Madam President, I rise once again to honor one of our \nNation's great Federal employees.\n  The Federal employee I am recognizing this week--and this is my 89th \nsince last May, and here they are on the chart--has made a name for \nhimself as an advocate for sensible regulation of the communications \nindustry.\n  At the Federal Communications Commission, Michael Copps has been a \ntireless fighter for the public interest and a steadfast campaigner for \nlocalism in broadcasting. In his position as one of the five \nCommissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to \noversee the regulation of our communications industry, Mike must work \nwith the other Commissioners to come to agreement on key issues \naffecting broadcasting, the Internet, and other media. Whether they \nagree with him or not, I know they have to respect and admire his \npassion and energy in advocating for what he believes to be the best \nway to serve the American people.\n  I did not choose to honor Mike only because he is one of the FCC's \nCommissioners; he has had a distinguished public service career for \nthree decades. His service as Commissioner is just his latest role in \nthe Federal Government. Mike is currently in his second term, having \nbeen appointed twice by President George W. Bush.\n  Before his appointment to the FCC, Mike served at the Department of \nCommerce as the Assistant Secretary for Trade Development and Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Basic Industries.\n\n  Prior to his service with the Commerce Department, Mike spent 12 \nyears here in the Senate as chief of staff to former Senator Fritz \nHollings of South Carolina. That is how I got to know Mike, when I was \nchief of staff for now-Vice President and then-Senator Joe Biden. I can \nsay from personal experience that, as a chief of staff, Mike was truly \nfirst class. He earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues \nacross the Senate on both sides of the aisle. Smart, exercising good \njudgment, and a very good listener, Mike embodied the skills and values \nthat make someone a great chief of staff.\n  Before coming to Washington in 1970, he spent time working in the \nprivate sector for a Fortune 500 company, and he also taught as a \nhistory professor for some years at Loyola University of the South, in \nNew Orleans. He holds a bachelor's degree from Wofford College in South \nCarolina and a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill.\n  In his current role, Mike has been an untiring advocate for the \npublic and has worked to push the FCC back toward its core mission: \nenforcing the regulations that maintain fair competition, protecting \nconsumers, and ensuring that the communications industry serves the \npublic interest. Particularly, he has been a crusader against control \nof the Internet by big corporations. His promotion of an open Internet \nis based on his belief that communications media should benefit all and \nfoster the growth and development of communities.\n  Last week, I spoke from this desk about the dangers of regulatory \ncapture. Over the past decade, many of our regulatory agencies have \nbeen caught up in a deregulatory mindset that viewed self-regulation as \nnot only adequate but preferable. Michael Copps has long been a voice \nof reason against regulatory capture.\n  He is just one example of the many outstanding men and women at the \nFederal Communications Commission. They are all truly great Federal \nemployees, and I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring their \nservice to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Madam President, a Senator has an enormous duty when it \ncomes to evaluating a Supreme Court nominee. The duty demands that \nSenators examine whether the person nominated to the highest Court in \nthe land will uphold and defend the principles contained in the \nConstitution, refrain from judicial activism, and respect the rule of \nlaw.\n  Some have characterized this duty as one of the most important and \nfar-reaching decisions that a Senator will make, and it is one of the \nmost important decisions in their entire time in the Senate.\n  As the nomination process for Ms. Kagan began, I went into it with an \nopen mind and a steadfast resolve to evaluate the nominee's \nqualifications without looking through a partisan lens. In fact, having \ngone through the confirmation process myself before being sworn in as \nSecretary of Agriculture, I know what an important process this is.\n  Senators have a strong duty to take it seriously. Considering Supreme \nCourt judgeships are lifetime appointments, these nominations require \neven closer scrutiny. Thus, Senators must carefully review any Supreme \nCourt nominee's record and their judicial philosophy.\n  After this careful review and closely monitoring the hearings before \nthe Judiciary Committee, I came to the conclusion that I could not \nsupport this nomination.\n  The Court is not a place to create laws, and I was not convinced that \nMs. Kagan understands this fundamental premise. Additionally, her long \ncareer as a political adviser and academic insufficiently prepares her \nfor a lifetime appointment to the country's highest Court.\n  For example, prior to her position as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan \nhad never taken a case to trial. I find that remarkable. Since her time \nas Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan has only argued six cases before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Beyond that lack of experience, there are several other areas that \nconcern me about this nomination. Ms. Kagan's view of the second \namendment is disturbing to me. As a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, she wrote that she was ``not sympathetic''--\n``not sympathetic''--to the legal assertion that the DC gun ban \nviolated citizens' constitutional right to bear arms.\n  Probably the most recent glimpse into Ms. Kagan's view of the second \namendment is her failure to file a brief on behalf of the petitioner in \nthe McDonald case regarding Chicago gun bans. The Supreme Court had \nalready been clear on the DC gun ban, and Chicago's law clearly \nimpacted a variety of Federal laws and programs.\n  Yet, as Solicitor General, she chose to sit quietly, tacitly casting \naside a very important constitutional protection. Her not filing \ndemonstrated the government's lack of interest or concern in protecting \nthis important constitutional right.\n  Ms. Kagan's lack of action is viewed by many as a bias against the \nsecond amendment, as if she were picking and choosing which \nconstitutional provisions she liked. Judges cannot selectively \ndisregard the Constitution when it is convenient or in line with their \npoint of view. So Ms. Kagan's record in this area is enormously \ntroubling for someone who wants to sit on the Supreme Court.\n  Another very serious concern is her actions as an adviser to \nPresident Clinton were instrumental in keeping partial-birth abortion \nlegal in the 1990s. During her time in the White House, the American \nCollege of Obstetricians\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\nand Gynecologists privately briefed Ms. Kagan on the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. Their opinion was clear and lacing equivocation.\n  According to a memo Ms. Kagan wrote, the medical group said:\n\n       In the vast majority of cases, selection of the partial \n     birth procedure is not necessary to avert serious adverse \n     consequences to a woman's health. There just aren't many \n     circumstances where use of the partial-birth abortion is the \n     least risky, let alone the necessary approach.\n\n  The group's public draft statement went on to say:\n\n       A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which the partial birth procedure would \n     be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of \n     the woman.\n\n  Upon hearing this news, Kagan wrote in a memo that the statement \nwould be ``a disaster.'' Then she edited the document and advised the \nmedical group to include a much different sentence claiming partial-\nbirth abortion ``may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a \nparticular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \nwoman.''\n  The original sentence and Ms. Kagan's sentence are vastly different, \nalmost complete opposites. Yet Ms. Kagan's language was copied verbatim \ninto the medical organization's final statement.\n  While Ms. Kagan has no medical credentials whatsoever, she bullied \nher personal views into the opinion of these medical professionals.\n  Unfortunately, this assumed expert medical opinion was relied upon \nheavily in subsequent court cases, including the one that struck down \nNebraska's partial-birth abortion ban--my State. U.S. District Court \nJudge Richard Kopf devoted more than 15 pages of his opinion to the \npolicy statement that Kagan wrote.\n  Judge Kopf believed the statement was entitled to judicial deference \nbecause, ``Before and during the task force meeting, neither ACOG nor \nthe task force members conversed with other individuals or \norganizations,'' he wrote in his opinion.\n  It is beyond belief and beyond unfortunate that no one was aware of \nMs. Kagan's extensive involvement in drafting the supposedly \nindependent policy statement; otherwise, this horrific procedure may \nhave been banned 10 years earlier.\n  This type of extreme political policy engineering should give us all \ngreat pause and solid reason to question whether Ms. Kagan could serve \nas a truly neutral umpire on the bench.\n  My concerns do not stop there. My concerns extend further to her role \nas dean of the Harvard Law School. Ms. Kagan was confronted with the \nSolomon amendment, a Federal law that requires schools receiving \nFederal funds to give equal access to military recruiters. It was very \nstraightforward. Yet she chose to ignore this law and denied military \naccess to Harvard's on-campus recruiting program.\n  Even the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Ms. Kagan in this \nmatter. This is especially troubling that Ms. Kagan would openly defy \nFederal law, especially in a time of war.\n  Her judgment and her reading of the law was fundamentally flawed, and \nevery one of her potential colleagues agreed she was wrong. That is not \na good sign for things to come.\n  For these reasons and others, I do not have confidence that Ms. Kagan \nwill be able to put aside her personal or political agenda before \nsitting on the bench.\n  As the National Right to Life Committee noted:\n\n       We anticipate that Ms. Kagan often will treat the U.S. \n     Constitution not as a body of basic law that truly constrains \n     both legislators and judges, but rather as a cookbook in \n     which may be found legal recipes that will allow the \n     imposition of the policies that Ms. Kagan deems to be \n     justified or advisable, or that are so regarded by whatever \n     groups she sees as the enlightened elites on a given subject.\n\n  A lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land is far too \nimportant a decision to have so many concerns. When the Senate votes on \nthe nomination of Ms. Kagan, I will vote no. Doing otherwise would \nignore the integrity of our Constitution and it would not be in the \nbest interest of this great country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncalls during today's morning business be charged equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, after careful consideration and \nassessment of the nominee's record and expressed views, I rise today to \nexpress my opposition to Solicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In the nomination process, a telling and inciteful statement by \nanother Senator is most applicable and pertinent. During the Senate's \ndebate on the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, then Senator \nBarack Obama stated:\n\n       . . . that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of \n     statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 \n     percent of the cases that come before the court, so that both \n     a Scalia or Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of \n     the time on those 95 percent of the cases--what matters on \n     the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly \n     difficult.\n       In those cases, adherence to precedent and rules will only \n     get you through the 25th mile of the marathon.\n       That last mile can only be determined on the basis of 1) \n     one's deepest values, 2) one's core concerns, 3) one's \n     broader perspectives on how the world works, and 4) the depth \n     and breadth of one's empathy.\n\n  I respectfully disagree with this rationale and find it troubling. \nOur judges must decide all cases in adherence to legal precedent and \nrules of statutory or constitutional construction.\n  The role of a judge is not to rule based on his or her own personal \njudgments or comply with one's empathy, how they think the world really \nworks, concerns and values--deep or shallow--all subject to personal \nviews, ideology and the winds of time and political change. No, the \nrole of a judge should adhere to the laws as they are written.\n  An appointment to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States is \na lifetime term. It was crafted by our Founders to protect and insulate \nthe highest Court of our land from personal concern, empathy, \nindividual values or how one thinks the world really works at some \npoint of time, not to mention the threat of any influence of politics.\n  Nominations to the highest bench should therefore not be considered \nlightly. It is one of the most important votes a Senator has the \nprivilege to cast.\n  And I would submit compared to the standard of legal precedent, \nstatutory rules, constitutional construction, again personal values, \nconcerns, how the world allegedly works and one's personal criteria of \nempathy represents a lesser standard--sort of a standard lite.\n  The qualifications of the nominee must be carefully considered. As \nU.S. Senators, we have an obligation to ensure that our courts are \nfilled with qualified, impartial judges.\n  In light of that I must ask--who is Elena Kagan?\n  In reviewing Ms. Kagan's qualifications, I find her lack of judicial \nexperience striking.\n  While others note that serving as a judge is not a requirement for a \nSupreme Court nomination, it has also been noted that every nominee in \nnearly 40 years to the Supreme Court has had extensive judicial \nexperience, whether from the bench or as a litigator in the courtroom.\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\n  Ms. Kagan's litigation experience is limited, with the majority of \nher arguments being made during her brief tenure as the U.S. Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  Given her obvious lack of experience in the court room, one must ask \nif this is the best position to receive on-the-job-training? Will the \n``craft'' of judging come innately to Ms. Kagan or is it a skill honed \nby years of practice and judicial experience?\n  Some have argued in defense of such a thin judicial resume that \nnominees can bring a ``real world''--- whatever that is--- perspective \nto the bench. Nonetheless, much of the nominee's experience lies in the \nhallowed, Ivy League, halls of academia, indeed a world of its own.\n  While I do not question the merits of a strong university background, \nI question how that makes one more in tune with the ``real world.''\n  Additionally, the nominee's resume includes her positions as special \ncounsel and policy advisor in the Clinton administration--a role in \nwhich she truly relished her job. During her tenure she advocated for \npolicies involving the second amendment.\n  In response to a Supreme Court decision which struck down the Brady \nAct's requirement of background checks before gun sales, documents from \nthe nominee's tenure suggested that the administration explore how to \nmaneuver around the Court's decision by executive action.\n  The advice here goes beyond legal counsel and indicates a clear \ninterest in achieving a policy goal by going around the Supreme Court's \ndecision, while forgoing the jurisdiction of Congress.\n  When determining how Ms. Kagan may approach a seat on the Court, her \nposition as a policy adviser is one of the few records available to \nreview.\n  Does this type of maneuvering indicate how Ms. Kagan would use her \nposition as a Supreme Court Justice to justify an agenda where a policy \ngoal is the intended outcome?\n  I must also say that as dean of Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan's \neffort to ban military recruiters from the main placement office on \ncampus is deeply troubling.\n  The justification for violating the Solomon Amendment--named after \nCongressman Gerald Solomon--was to protest the military's don't ask, \ndon't tell policy. This action was also consistent with her own \nexpressed views.\n  It must be noted, blocking access to military recruiters is counter \nto Federal law.\n  Only when threatened with the loss of Federal funding, did Harvard \ncomply. Ms. Kagan then used a stayed decision by an appellate court, \nwhich determined the Solomon Amendment was unconstitutional, to \nreinstitute the ban. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court overturned \nthe appellate court's decision by an 8-0 ruling.\n  According to Chief Justice John Roberts, ``A military recruiter's \nmere presence on campus does not violate a law school's right to \nassociate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers the \nrecruiter's message.''\n  I must say, I don't know of any recruiter who would stand up and \ndebate students in the circumstance of a policy judgment--more to the \npoint, in regard to a policy that is as controversial as don't ask, \ndon't tell. They are there to recruit individual students or to answer \nquestions they may have.\n  U.S. servicemembers deserve our unfettered support, as they face \nunimaginable danger on the front line in defense of our Nation. Their \nwillingness to sacrifice their time away from home and loved ones while \nserving in harsh and dangerous places under difficult circumstances \nshould be honored.\n  It seems to me we dishonor their sacrifices and service by hollow \njustifications of policy agendas. These efforts are a clear indication \nto me, as well as my fellow Kansans, that Ms. Kagan's agenda is at odds \nwith her role as a dean and a future Supreme Court Justice, and is \nclearly out of step with the average American no matter how deep her \nconcern, empathy, values or the real world she believed she could \nchange.\n  It is clear from her time as a policy adviser during the Clinton \nadministration--a job she truly relished--that she supports methods of \nenacting policy changes through administrative means and around the \njurisdiction of the legislative branch.\n  This type of disregard for the jurisdiction of the elected branch of \ngovernment is concerning.\n  Ms. Kagan's zeal and enthusiasm as a political advisor and an \nacademic does not qualify her for a lifetime appointment to our \nNation's highest Court.\n  Not only does she lack experience on the bench, but her record \nclearly demonstrates a propensity towards pursuing an activist agenda.\n  In her own words, Ms. Kagan confessed difficulty in ``taking off the \nadvocate's hat [to] put on the judge's hat.'' This admission is at best \nworrisome; at worst, a clear indication of her intent to legislate from \nthe bench.\n  We have a constitutional obligation to ensure that our judges are \nimpartial and faithful to the law. During Chief Justice John Roberts' \nconfirmation hearing, he noted that ``Judges and Justices are servants \nof the law, not the other way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires \ndon't make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and judge \nis critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a \nlimited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.'' They \nmay go to criticize the umpire, but they do not go to see him.\n  I am not convinced that Ms. Kagan will limit herself to merely \napplying the rules.\n  Given the limited judicial background and a lack of forthrightness in \nqueries as to her judicial philosophy during the nomination hearings, I \nam fearful that this nomination will serve as another tool in what we \nhave witnessed in further encroachment of government into the everyday \nlives of the American people.\n  Kansans have made clear to me that they do not want activist judges \non the Court and they do not want additional government intrusion into \ntheir daily lives and pocketbooks, especially coming from the bench.\n  Unfortunately, I think appointing Ms. Kagan to the Court will result \nin more of both. Therefore, I must oppose her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. The American people are worried about the direction of our \ncountry, and I absolutely share their concern. The public has witnessed \nWashington's growing disregard for the Constitution and its limits on \ngovernment power. Too many of those powers see no limits to their \nauthority, and that, to me, is frightening.\n  The size of government has exploded, spending is out of control, the \nnational debt is soaring, and Congress has passed thousands of pages of \nlegislation with little concern for the effects on the rights of \neveryday Americans and with no thought at all to the debt we saddle our \nchildren and our grandchildren with.\n  The Founding Fathers knew the dangers of expanding government power. \nThe Founders knew what Barry Goldwater knew when he said: ``A \ngovernment strong enough to give you what you want is strong enough to \ntake it away.''\n  They established the judiciary branch in order to protect against an \noverly aggressive government. They envisioned it as a neutral arbiter \nof disputes based on the written law and as a check on government power \ngrabs beyond the intended authority.\n  This is why the judiciary is so important and why the lifetime \nappointment of a Justice to the Supreme Court is one of the most \nserious actions any of us will consider. We must have judges who are \ncommitted to the job of holding us to the words of the Constitution and \nlaws that are written.\n  We, in Congress, have proven again and again that we will not limit \nourselves, and the executive branch continues to do the same. The \nAmerican people knew this, and that is why they are concerned about \nPresident Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nI am concerned that Ms. Kagan does not seem to recognize the limits the \nConstitution places on the Federal Government and does not understand \nor seem to understand the role of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Ms. Kagan, of course, does not have a judicial record for us to base \nour decisions on. I do not think that alone should disqualify her, but \nit does make it difficult to discern how she will perform as a judge. \nMs. Kagan has spent most of her career in political roles and\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nin the academic world. I do not think it is appropriate to cast my vote \nbased only on her politics, but I do think her record shows she has \nbeen unable to separate her politics from her legal advice, even in her \npurely legal role in clerking for the Supreme Court. This is incredibly \nproblematic.\n  I am concerned Ms. Kagan will only further the rapid expansion of the \nFederal Government, that her actions, particularly on issues such as \nmilitary recruiting, second amendment rights, and abortion, show that \nher first allegiance is to her own political views. Her record and her \ntestimony demonstrate that she is likely to limit the powers of the \nFederal Government only based on her personal political views and not \nbased on the enumerated powers of the Constitution.\n  Our Founding Fathers established a Federal Government of limited \npower. They enumerated those powers and intended the list to be \nexclusive. In the 10th amendment, they specifically state: Powers not \nexpressly granted to the Federal Government in the Constitution are \nreserved for the States. Everything not specifically named in the list \nof congressional powers was intended to be beyond Federal Government \nreach.\n  Unfortunately, legal progressives have sought to stretch that list \nfar beyond its breaking point. Often they have chosen as their tool the \ncommerce clause, which gives Congress the authority to regulate \ncommerce amongst the States. Over the years, Congress has relied on the \ncommerce clause to pass laws well beyond the scope of what our Founding \nFathers intended, laws regulating matters totally unrelated to \ninterstate commerce, such as how much wheat a farmer can grow on his \nown land for his own use or where a person might possess a firearm.\n  The Framers intended the limited nature of Congress's power as a \nmethod to protect the freedom of individual Americans to go about their \nlives without undue interference from government, but the limits the \nConstitution established matter only if our judges are willing to \nenforce them.\n  I am sad to say I do not believe Ms. Kagan will enforce those \nlimitations. During her hearings, Senator Coburn asked Ms. Kagan a very \nbasic question, but it is an important question that deserves a direct \nand straightforward answer. Senator Coburn asked this: ``If I wanted to \nsponsor a bill and it said, Americans, you have to eat three vegetables \nand three fruits every day, and I got it through Congress, and it is \nnow the law of the land, does that violate the commerce clause?''\n  While Ms. Kagan acknowledged this would be a dumb law, she repeatedly \nstated the Court should give great deference to the will of Congress. \nShe said: ``We can come up with sort of, you know, just ridiculous \nsounding laws and the principal protector against bad laws is the \npolitical branches themselves.''\n  I can certainly see why the American people are afraid, if the task \nof protecting against bad laws is left solely up to the political \nbranch. Ms. Kagan had extreme difficulty in recognizing any limit at \nall on Federal powers. She simply refused to acknowledge that the \nFederal Government cannot pass a law telling American citizens what to \neat.\n  Of course, I can see why the Obama administration supports her. The \nrecently passed health care legislation is an exercise of unprecedented \ngovernment power. The new health care law mandates--mandates--that \nAmericans purchase health insurance.\n  By forcing Americans to purchase government-regulated insurance and \nby threatening them with IRS tax sanctions, the Obama administration is \nforcing its way into American lives in a way this country has never \nwitnessed. Never before has the Federal Government forced Americans, \nunder threat, to purchase a particular good or service.\n  I strongly disagree and most Americans disagree with this expansive \nview of the Federal Government's powers. We need Justices on the \nSupreme Court who are ready and willing to stand and defend the \nConstitution. We need Justices who recognize that there are, in fact, \nlimits to the Federal Government's powers.\n  Not only must Supreme Court Justices recognize and enforce the \nlimitations of the Federal Government, but they cannot owe any \nallegiance to advancing the political agendas of the President who \nappointed them. I do not believe Ms. Kagan fully appreciates this \ncritical point. To the contrary, I believe that, if confirmed, she will \nbe tied more to her own political agenda than to the Constitution of \nthis great country.\n  Ms. Kagan's record is truly disconcerting to me. Throughout her \ncareer, her record reveals that she put politics above the law. Such a \nphilosophy has no place in the Supreme Court. I oppose Ms. Kagan not \nbecause of her political views, I oppose her because she has not \ndemonstrated an ability to leave those political views at the \ncourthouse door. As such, she fails to meet the minimum requirement for \nany judicial appointment: impartial fidelity to the written law.\n  On military recruiting, Ms. Kagan has fought zealously to keep \nrecruiters off our campuses during a time of war. As dean of Harvard \nLaw School, she sent e-mails to the entire Harvard Law School community \nsaying she abhors it, the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, and \ncalling it a ``profound wrong,'' a ``moral injustice of the first \norder.''\n  The Obama administration has defended her actions against military \nrecruiters saying these claims were overblown because she ultimately \ncontinued the practice of her predecessor in allowing the military to \nrecruit through the school's veterans organization, which was primarily \na social organization with fewer than 20 members.\n  Yet even this paltry action was only a way to continue to receive \nFederal funding for the school. A Federal law, known as the Solomon \nAmendment, denies Federal funding to any institution of higher \neducation that has a policy or practice that either prohibits or, in \neffect, prevents the military from gaining access to the campus or \naccess to students on campus for the purpose of military recruiting in \na manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to \ncampus and to students that is provided by any other employer.\n  Even then she explains that doing so caused great distress. Ms. Kagan \ndid everything she could to fight the Solomon Amendment, even signing \non to an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in the case of Rumsfeld v. \nFAIR, with about 40 other law professors opposing the amendment. The \nSupreme Court unanimously rejected their argument. Not one Justice \nfound it convincing--not Souter, not Breyer, not Ginsburg, not Stevens.\n  Ms. Kagan has demonstrated similarly poor judgment on the second \namendment. When she was clerking for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, she had the opportunity to consider Sandidge v. United \nStates, a DC firearms case remarkably similar to the 2008 DC v. Heller \ncase, in which the Court ultimately struck down the DC gun ban. In \nevaluating the case for Justice Marshall, she recommended that the \nCourt not even consider the case.\n  Ms. Kagan wrote that the petitioner's ``sole contention is that the \nDistrict of Columbia's firearms statutes violate his constitutional \nright to `keep and bear arms,' '' and then said, ``I'm not \nsympathetic.'' That was her remark to Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  Ms. Kagan also worked on several anti-second amendment initiatives in \nthe Clinton administration. She worked on the Clinton administration's \nresponse to the Supreme Court's 1997 decision striking down parts of \nthe Brady handbill law. The Court there said that Congress could not \ncommand State and local chief law enforcement officers to conduct \nFederal background checks on handgun purchasers. She considered such \nproposals as outlawing the sale of handguns where a chief law \nenforcement officer was unavailable or unwilling to conduct a \nbackground check, and also suggested that President Clinton issue an \nExecutive Order to do the same.\n  She coauthored two policy memos advocating for events and gun control \nproposals, including legislation requiring background checks for all \nsecondary market gun purchases, a ``gun tracing initiative,'' a new law \nholding adults liable for giving children easy access to guns, and a \ncall for a new gun design ``that can be shot only by authorized \nadults.''\n  She drafted an Executive Order restricting the importation of dozens \nof\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\nsemiautomatic rifles that had been considered ``sporting'' and \nimportable under the 1994 assault weapons ban. One of her colleagues in \nthe White House described the plan by saying, ``We are taking the law \nand bending it as far as we can to capture a whole new class of guns.''\n  She also worked on an effort to allow background check information \nfrom lawful sales to be retained by law enforcement, and a member of \nher staff wrote, ``the longer we are able to keep records--even days, \nweeks--the more useful [it] will be as an overall law enforcement tool.\n  This, of course, is exactly what the gunners don't want.'' \n``Gunners,'' a new word.\n  As Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan notably declined to submit a brief in \nsupport of the petitioner in the McDonald case--proably the biggest \nsecond amendment case in decades.\n  In working on the Volunteer Protection Act, Ms. Kagan expressed \nconcern to the Department of Justice that ``Bad guy orgs'' like the NRA \nand the KKK might be included in a ``cumulative list'' of nonprofits \nwhose volunteers would qualify for liability protection from lawsuits. \nTo lump the NRA in with such a despicable organization is an insult to \ngun owners across America.\n  On partial-birth abortion and on taxpayer-funded abortions, Ms. Kagan \nalso has a history of far-left advocacy on abortion issues, skewing \neven her legal judgments based upon personal politics.\n  When she was working for Justice Marshall, she urged him to vote to \ndeny review of a lower court decision holding that prison inmates had a \nconstitutional right to taxpayer-funded elective abortions, and even \nthough she admitted that parts of the decision were ``ludicrous'' and \nthat the facts showed no constitutional violations, she called it \n``well-intentioned.'' She insisted the Court should deny review, and \nlet this decision stand, because she was concerned that the Court might \n``create some very bad law on abortion.''\n  Memos and handwritten notes during her time in the Clinton White \nHouse demonstrate that she pushed even the Clinton administration \nfurther to the left on the issue. President Clinton at the time had \nexpressed a desire to ban all elective partial-birth abortions, to \nwhich, as she wrote in a handwritten note to the White House Counsel at \nthe time, ``This is a problem. . . .'' She was the lead person working \non a strategy to ensure that elective partial-birth abortions remained \navailable without real restrictions. In one memo, she lays out her plan \nto support a ``ban'' that includes a ``general health exception'' that \nwould make the ban largely meaningless.\n  Even when she heard that the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists was prepared to issue a statement stating that they \n``could identify no circumstances under which [the partial-birth] \nprocedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve \nthe health of the woman,'' she continued her fight.\n  In an internal White House memo, she notes that the medical statement \n``would be a disaster'' for the White House's case against the partial-\nbirth abortion ban. Documents show that she then drafted new language, \nhedging the original medical judgment, which the organization then \npublished as their own, verbatim.\n  She then authored a memo to President Clinton arguing that his \npreferred approach, without the health exception, was unconstitutional, \nand that ``the groups will go crazy.'' Of course, in 2003, Congress \npassed, and President Bush signed, a law prohibiting partial-birth \nabortion, without such a health exception. The Supreme Court upheld \nthat law.\n  Conclusion: I am afraid Ms. Kagan's record demonstrates that she \nsubstitutes her own political viewpoints for legal judgment. If \nconfirmed, I believe Ms. Kagan will add to Washington's growing \ndisregard for the Constitution of this country and its limits on \ngovernment power, instead of protecting against intrusion and \ngovernment actions, as the courts were designed to do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to speak in support of Solicitor Elena Kagan \nfor the Supreme Court in a minute, but just for a brief minute, I wish \nto speak about another very important issue, the legislation we are \nabout to vote on, the legislation that will help teachers and police \nofficers and firefighters and other workers retain their jobs.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe and \nSenator Susan Collins, for their courageous support of this measure. I \nwould like to take a moment to talk about the critically important \ncomponent of the legislation we will be voting on shortly.\n  That component is called the local share language that will send \ncritical aid directly to county governments in any State. The counties \nin my State are always worried. When we send the money to Albany, they \nnever see it or they see it much later and Albany takes a cut. But \nlegislation that I have been able to put into the bill says: If the \nlocal area pays for part of Medicaid, then they should be reimbursed \ndirectly.\n  Anyone who is familiar with New York knows we have some of the \nhighest property taxes in the Nation, way too high.\n  In fact, residents in West Chester County have the unfortunate \ndistinction of having paid the most in property taxes in the entire \ncountry. Nassau County residents follow quickly. On the list of the top \n20 counties with the highest property taxes, 5 are in New York. This \nprovision, which will send a total of $530 million directly to local \ncounty governments, will have a tangible and important benefit for New \nYorkers everywhere. Its No. 1 job is going to prevent counties from \nhaving to raise their already too high property taxes. County \nexecutives from one end of the State to the other--in Erie County, \nNassau County, and others--have told me if they can get this money, \nthis Medicaid relief--the Medicaid burden is so high--it will enable \nthem to not raise property taxes. That is why I fought so hard to \nensure this local share language was included in the first stimulus \npackage and now in this bill. We know money sent to Albany far too \noften stays in Albany. The bill will not only provide property tax \nrelief, it is an investment in our future. It will keep teachers in the \nclassroom and cops on the beat and firefighters in the firehouses. A \nrecession is no excuse to prevent the children from getting the best \neducation they can get, no excuse for letting criminals get away from \nthe dastardly crimes they commit.\n  Speaking of our children and their futures, I wish to mention one \nmore important thing. We are making these investments without adding a \ndime to the Federal deficit. In fact, this bill, in addition to the \nbenefits it contains, will reduce the deficit by over $1 billion. \nCongress should be focused like a laser on fighting unemployment and \ngetting the economy humming on all cylinders again. This bill is part \nof that ongoing effort. For the good of the country, I implore my \ncolleagues to support this sensible, important bill.\n\n\n                            Kagan Nomination\n\n  Madam President, later today, we will confirm an exceptionally well-\nqualified candidate to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, \nand average Americans will be a step closer to once again having their \nvoices heard in the highest Court in the land. This is because \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan brings both moderation and practical \nexperience to a Court sorely in need of both.\n  Why, then, are so many fighting over General Kagan, a nominee who is \nmainstream through and through? Why are so many fighting? Our judicial \nsystem is at the tipping point. Of the six most conservative Justices \nin living memory, four are on the Court right now. Two of those four \nwere confirmed within the last 5 years. It didn't happen by accident. \nMany conservatives decry what they call liberal judicial activism, but \nwhat they want is judicial activism of the right. Make no mistake about \nthat. There can be activists on the left and on the right. Both seek to \nimpose their views rather than follow the law.\n  The supposedly staunch opposition to judicial activism on the right \nhas shown its true colors in this debate over a truly moderate and \nmainstream candidate. They themselves want rightwing judicial activism \nto pull this country into the past.\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\n  I have always said the far right is using the only unelected branch \nof government to do what it cannot do through the two elected \nbranches--turn back history to a time when corporations and large \nspecial interests had more say in our courts than ordinary people. The \nright has created a kind of judicial activism that is as pernicious as \nthe activism on the left. But they do not see it that way. Activism is \ntheir very ideology.\n  When George Bush was President and conservative majorities in the \nHouse and Senate still couldn't pull America back 100 years, they said: \nWe need to do it by the Supreme Court. Hence, extremely conservative \nnominees were nominated and approved. As a result, our Court is on a \ncollision course with precedent, with the other branches of government \nand, frankly, with the American people. General Kagan is exactly the \nantidote we need to put the Court back on the level, to put the bubble \nback on the plumb. General Kagan is a 6 or 7 on a scale of conservative \nto liberal, with 1 being the most conservative and the most liberal \nbeing 10. The President's nominees were ones, with an occasional two. \nThey were way over to the far right. That is what independent, \nobjective, not Democratic, not Republican analyses show. Again, four of \nthe five most conservative Justices are on the Court right now.\n  The American people are reaping the bitter harvest from new laws that \nhave been made and old precedents that have been overturned. Put \nsimply, in decision after decision, this conservative, activist Court \nhas bent the law to suit an ideology. At the top of the list, of \ncourse, is the Citizens United case where an activist majority of the \nCourt overturned a century of well-understood law that regulated the \namount of money special interests could spend to elect their own \ncandidates to public office.\n  In the Ledbetter case, the Court upended decades of settled law and \nan agency interpretation to hold that a woman who received less pay \nthan a male colleague is only discriminated against by the first \npaycheck, not by the last. There are many other examples, over and \nover--on the Clean Water Act, punitive damages against the \nExxon Valdez, antitrust law where, again, favoring the special \ninterests and turning back the law, this conservative majority has \nbecome the most activist Court certainly in decades. These truly \nactivist decisions show little respect for Congress, for the executive \nbranch, and for the well-settled understandings the American people \ncommonly hold about our democracy. Yet somehow they label General Kagan \nas an activist, because she wants to follow precedent. That is not \nfair, and it is not true.\n\n  The record shows that General Kagan's record is replete with cases, \narticles, opinions, and discussion that shows and proves she is well \nwithin the judicial mainstream. First, in the course of her nomination \nhearing, she answered more than 700 questions. She answered them with a \ndegree of candor and specificity we simply did not see when either \nJustices Alito or Roberts were before us, nominees who, I submit, \nactually had conservative agendas to hide from the American people, \nunlike General Kagan who has nothing to hide. When she was asked her \nviews on interpreting the Constitution, she gave reasoned, detailed \nanswers, the most reasoned, detailed answers I can remember from a \nnominee. She gave candid and detailed answers about her views of \nspecific precedent governing the right to privacy, the commerce clause, \nfreedom of the press, the second amendment, civil rights, cameras in \nthe courtroom, even about her role as Solicitor General.\n  When Justice Alito was asked about his views of the takings clause, \nhe gave an opaque answer about the value of owning private property, \nnot even close to the specificity that General Kagan gave. But here we \nhave Members on this side of the aisle saying they won't vote for Kagan \nbecause she is not specific enough, when they were in full support of \nAlito and Roberts who gave far less specific answers. Why? We know why. \nAgain, the view on the right that they want their own brand of \nactivism, judicial activism of the right to pull the Court and the \ncountry away from the mainstream.\n  My colleagues' continuing insistence that General Kagan is hiding and \noutside the mainstream agenda says more about their agenda than hers. \nIt appears to me the only way to explain some of my colleagues' \nopposition to General Kagan is, they will vote for only ones and maybe \na few twos on the Supreme Court, people way over to the right side. And \nif one believes in judicial activism of the far right, that is exactly \nwhat one would do.\n  A second sort of evidence of General Kagan's moderation is her \nstunningly broad bipartisan support. Each of the Solicitors General to \nserve under Democratic and Republican Presidents for the last 25 years \nhas endorsed her. While at Harvard she got a standing ovation from, of \nall people, the Federalist Society, the training grounds for many of \nPresident Bush's conservative judicial nominees. She bridged the wide \nideological divide between conservative and liberal faculty members. \nShe brought together a faculty that had been fighting with one another. \nThey came together under her thoughtful, pragmatic, and moderate \ndecisions. As a result, to a Harvard faculty generally regarded as \nliberal, \nshe bought in many conservative apppointments.\n  Why then does General Kagan not have more bipartisan support within \nthis body? Why will she get fewer votes today than all but two Justices \nin the history of the Court, Justices Alito and Thomas? Again, one need \nlook no further than the sheer amount of law that has been undone by \nthe current Court in the last few years, law that protects ordinary \nAmericans against special interests and corporate interests.\n  These are the wages of a war that the far right has mounted in order \nto remake the law. But General Kagan will not be a soldier in their \nfight and, hence, despite her moderation, does not get their vote.\n  Having studied the Court's decision in Citizens United, I am \nincreasingly convinced that their war will not be won until we return \nto 1905, to what legal historians call the Lochner era of Supreme Court \njurisprudence. In 1905, squarely in the age of the robber barons, big \nrailroads and even bigger oil, a very conservative majority of Justices \nheld that the people of New York, my State, could not pass laws that \nlimited the legal workweek to 60 hours. This is because the Justices \nfound, somewhere in the due process clause of the 14th amendment, that \nbusiness had an inherent right to conduct itself without any government \nregulation, even if public safety was at stake. One hundred years later \nin Citizens United--same country, different setting, different rules--\nit does the same type of thing. Citizens United will go down as the \n21st century example of 20th century Lochner. Allowing corporate and \nspecial interests, now because they have so much money, to pour that \nmoney into our political system without even disclosure, without even \nknowing who they are or what they are saying or why they are saying it, \nthey are taking politics away, government away from the average person \nbecause of the influence of such large amounts of dollars.\n  Fortunately for Americans, General Kagan will be confirmed today, and \ngears of the time machine that is set to 1905 will be substantially \nslowed down. She will be confirmed with some bipartisan support, and I \npraise my colleagues on the other side who had the courage to break \nfrom the hard right. It takes courage to break from the extremes of \neither side. It is not easy. We all know that, no matter which party we \nare in. They have had the courage to do it. I salute them. She will be \nconfirmed because she is mainstream, because enough of my colleagues \nrecognize that her practical, real world experience will be a valuable \nasset to our judicial system and to our country.\n  And about practical experience, she has it in very real and tangible \nways. She is an accomplished lawyer, first female dean of the Harvard \nLaw School, a public servant who worked in all three branches of \ngovernment. Yet some on the other side call her inexperienced. It is \nhard to believe. In fact, General Kagan's experience does measure up to \nher colleagues and predecessors. Like Justice Thomas and the late \nJustice Rehnquist, General Kagan held high-level political jobs in the \nexecutive branch. Like William O. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter, she \nspent much of her career in academia. And like 38 other Supreme Court \nJustices\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\nbefore her, she does not have direct judicial experience, although like \nmany of them, she clerked for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Some of my colleagues have belittled General Kagan's experience as \nbetter suited to the backwaters of academia than a seat on the highest \nCourt. I think this is wishful thinking on their part, perhaps because \nthey know her real world experience will bring the Court back to the \ncenter.\n  And, in fact, it is clear that her experience at Harvard Law School \ndemonstrates, rather than undermines, her qualifications.\n  Unlike every other current Justice on the Supreme Court, General \nKagan ran a business. She understands much about how the real world \nfunctions that many of our current Justices simply do not.\n  She managed 500 employees and a budget of $160 million annually. \nPlus, this real world management experience was forged in an \nenvironment that was ideologically charged when she arrived.\n  But it was much less so when she left. Jack Goldsmith, whom Elena \nKagan hired and who had been head of President Bush's Office of Legal \nCounsel, wrote of her:\n\n       It might seem over the top to say that Kagan combines \n     principle, pragmatism, and good judgment better than anyone I \n     have ever met. But it is true.\n\n  General Kagan's skills as a consensus builder are sorely needed on a \nfractious Court that often struggles to find the moderate ground \nbetween its two wings. A recent study showed that last term, the Court \nissued ``conservative'' opinions 65 percent of the time--more than any \nterm in living memory.\n  The fact that the pull to the right is so demonstrable suggests also \nthat these decisions are often quite broad--as in the Citizens United \ncase, where the issues that were decided had not initially been \nbriefed. Someone as persuasive and perceptive as General Kagan could \nhelp to narrow these decisions, to put together 5 to 4 majorities that \nissue mainstream, modest opinions.\n  An important component of General Kagan's pragmatic experience is her \ngender. As difficult as managing an ideologically diverse law school \nfaculty is for anyone, General Kagan did it as the first woman. I have \nheard it said that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, but \nbackwards and in high heels.\n  The exact details obviously don't apply to General Kagan, but the \nsentiment does.\n  Serving as the first female dean of Harvard, and the first female \nSolicitor General, has surely broadened her views and deepened her \nunderstanding of how Americans work and relate to one another. Her role \nas a woman in each of these institutions enriches the practical \nexperience that she will bring to the Court.\n  This is the candidate whom many of my colleagues have branded as an \nout-of-the-mainstream liberal activist.\n  At the end of the day, it is fine to disagree with General Kagan's \nviews and ideology. But labeling such a mainstream candidate as a \nliberal ideologue sets a troubling precedent. It moves the center \nfurther and further to the right.\n  I am confident that General Kagan is the right candidate for the \nSupreme Court at the right time. I will proudly cast my vote for her.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6762-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, all \npostcloture time is considered expired, except there will be 20 minutes \nof debate equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, how long do I have to speak?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President. I think I can do it in that \ntime.\n  It seems we have time to do almost anything, but what we need to do \nis address the economy and jobs in this country. Just about every \neconomist, from all across the political spectrum, says one of the most \nimportant things we can do right now is not to raise taxes. Yet taxes \nare scheduled to go up in 5 months on almost every American, including \nthe businesses that create the jobs.\n  Of the two amendments I will offer here today, one amendment will \nstop the increase in income tax rates, and the second will stop the tax \nincreases on small businesses that file as individuals.\n  Clearly, it makes no sense in the middle of a recession to raise \ntaxes on individuals. An individual in South Carolina making $40,000 a \nyear will pay $400 more next year in taxes if we do not act. A married \ncouple with a combined income of $80,000 will see their taxes go up \nnearly $2,200. A married couple earning $160,000 combined could pay \n$5,500 in additional taxes.\n  The same thing will happen to small businesses that create the jobs. \nWe will be taking money out of their accounts and putting it in our \naccounts. At a time when they need to keep the money to grow our \neconomy and to hire workers, we do not need the money to continue to \nwaste it on what we have been doing.\n  Consider the stimulus bill. A couple of my colleagues this week came \nout with a report showing where a lot of this stimulus money went: $62 \nmillion for a Pennsylvania tunnel that Governor Rendell said was a \ntragic mistake; $193,000 for voter perception of the stimulus bill. I \ncould go on and on. This is not money we need to spend right now.\n  What we need to do is assure businesses and individuals that the tax \nrate this year will be the same next year so they can make good \ndecisions that will move our economy forward.\n\n\n                           Motions To Suspend\n\n  Madam President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate, I move to suspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing \nand considering the following motion to commit, with instructions, H.R. \n1586: I move to commit H.R. 1586 to the Committee on Finance with \ninstructions to report the same back to the Senate with changes to \ninclude a permanent extension of the 2010 individual income tax rates, \nand to include provisions which decrease spending as appropriate to \noffset such permanent extension.\n  And, Madam President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing Rules \nof the Senate, I move to suspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing \nand considering the following motion to commit, with instructions, H.R. \n1586: I move to commit H.R. 1586 to the Committee on Finance with \ninstructions to report the same back to the Senate with changes to \ninclude a permanent extension of current individual income tax rates on \nsmall businesses and provisions which decreases spending as appropriate \nto offset such permanent extension.\n  With that, Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motions are pending.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a stunt. It is a gimmick. It is \nnot serious, and it is very sad. We are in very difficult times. The \neconomy is in recession, going out of recession. We are\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nfacing the prospect of what to do about the so-called Bush tax cuts of \n2001, 2003. Those are massive tax cuts that were put in place in 2001 \nand 2003. They expire at the end of this year. It is a big question: \nWhat should the Congress do, what should the country do about those tax \ncuts?\n  At the same time, we are facing terrific, unfortunately high \ndeficits, very high deficits, almost as high as they were at the end of \nWorld War II--not quite but almost. The national debt now is \napproaching, as a percent of GDP, the levels that it was near the end \nof World War II--not quite. In fact, they were much higher at the end \nof World War II than they are today.\n  But the main point is, these are very serious questions. They require \ndeliberate thought. They require Senators to work together to find \nsolutions that help our country, help us decide: To what degree should \nthese tax cuts be extended? Which ones make sense? Which ones do not?\n  We have several goals here. Clearly, people do not like paying taxes. \nBut, clearly, Americans who are responsible know they must pay some \ntaxes in order for our country to function. There are two extremes \nhere. One is anarchy and the other States' outright total socialism. \nThere is some balance in the middle for a civil society to function.\n  These questions are very big: How are we, as a society, going to \nproperly function? To what degree should we begin and to what rate \nreduce the deficits and the debt? That is a very serious question. \nOther countries worldwide are facing these same questions, and we are \ninterrelated, the United States, with other countries. That is a very \nserious question.\n  In addition, how much should the Bush tax cuts be extended? At what \nrate, what amount, et cetera? Should all rates be extended? Should \nsome? Clearly, most Members of this body feel at least the so-called \nmiddle-income tax cuts should be extended permanently; that is, those \nwhose incomes are $200,000 or lower or families with $250,000--at \nleast. Then, there are other questions about what to do with the rest.\n  The motion offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina has this \neffect: He says all the tax cuts should be extended. First of all, we \ndo not know what that means. Is that just individual rates? If it is, \nthat is about $1.1 trillion it is going to cost over 10 years. Does he \nalso want to include the alternative minimum tax for 10 years or does \nhe also want to include dividend cap gains extended? I don't know. He \ndoesn't say. But I assume he does. That is going to be about a $3 \ntrillion cost--a $3 trillion cost--over 10 years. He wants that all \nreplaced with spending cuts. I ask you, is that serious? That is not \nserious. I ask, is that a stunt? Yes, that is a stunt. Is it a gimmick? \nYes, it is a gimmick. Is it serious? No, it is not serious.\n\n  These are serious times--very serious times--and we should not be \nengaged or even give comment to this kind of a stunt. I hate saying \nthat. I don't like saying that. But I have to be candid. I have to be \nhonest. If I am faulted for anything--and I am faulted for a lot--it is \nfor being honest and candid. This is a stunt. I urge my colleagues not \nto fall for this.\n  Now, the $3 trillion--I asked: Where are we going to cut $3 trillion? \nOur total receipts, Federal receipts for the year, are about $2 \ntrillion, a little over $2 trillion. That is pretty good. Well, OK, he \nwants to cut $3 trillion over 10. Now, where in the world? It can't be \ndone. It cannot be done. Impossible. He knows that, but still he stands \non the floor making this grand political statement. Does he say \nanything about small business? He doesn't say anything about small \nbusiness. What is small business? I have no idea. It is kind of veiled \na little bit under the cover of the top rates. He doesn't define it. We \ndon't know what it is. I mean, it is just sad.\n  We don't have much time left to deal with these tax cuts. We don't \nhave many legislative days left. We have to just do what Senators are \nsupposed to do, do what most people in our States want us to do--be \nreasonable, be thoughtful, take on the hard issues. And they will give \nus a lot of slack if they think we are basically doing the right thing, \nif we are doing our best--it may not be perfect but doing our best, and \nthat is what we should do. This amendment is not our best. It should be \nresoundingly defeated.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield my 4 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman yielding me \njust a few minutes. I wish to associate myself strongly with his \nremarks and urge our colleagues on this side to vote against the DeMint \namendment. The Senator from Montana is absolutely correct. It is a \nstunt, and it is a very sad stunt.\n  If the Senator from South Carolina is trying to wave the flag of \nsmall business to try to convince anybody to vote for his amendment, I \nwanted to put some things in the Record that might convince them \notherwise. This is a recent report that came out from the Tax Policy \nCenter, the Urban Institute, and the Brookings Institution--very well \nrespected. It is dated August 3, 2010.\n  I quote:\n\n       If the objective--\n\n  Which would be the extension of all the Bush tax cuts--\n\n     is to help small business, continuing the Bush tax cuts on \n     high-income taxpayers isn't the way to go [because] it would \n     miss 98 percent of small business owners . . .\n\n  It would miss 98 percent of small business owners.\n  So I beg my colleagues, if you want to have this debate over tax \ncuts, we can have it at a different time. Please don't wave small \nbusiness out here.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina will do--the effect of his \namendment, according to this very reputable report--would completely \nmiss 98 percent of small businesses in America. They are desperate for \nhelp. His amendment misses them by a mile. If we were in target \npractice today, he wouldn't pass. He wouldn't hit the target for a \nmile.\n  I have been on this floor for over 2 weeks with dozens of Members on \nthis side begging the Republican Party on that side to do something \nbefore we leave to help small business. There is $12 billion of tax \ncuts directly to them. The Senator from South Carolina voted no.\n  We have $30 billion that will turn into a $300 billion lending \nprogram directly to small businesses. Small businesses are the only \npeople who could get it and community banks are the only people who \ncould access it. Did the Senator from South Carolina vote yes or no? He \nvoted no.\n  This is a stunt, and it is a sad stunt. I tell my colleagues, there \nis a lot at stake. I know my 4 minutes is over, but I wanted to come \nand strongly urge my colleagues to follow the lead of the chairman and \nvote no on this sad stunt.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 55 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I think it is a sad day in the Senate \nwhen keeping current tax rates the same and stopping the largest tax \nincrease in history is called a stunt.\n  Over the last few weeks, the Democrats have voted to raise taxes on \ndividends and capital gains, affecting many senior citizens, and raised \nthe death tax to over half of what people leave to their families. Now, \ntoday, they want to raise the marginal income tax rates. If we left the \ntax rates the same, it would do more to help small businesses and jobs \nin America than any of the bailout or targeted programs my colleagues \nare talking about.\n  My Democratic colleagues have had 4 years to address the coming tax \nincrease and have done nothing. It is very important, but it is sad \nthat they will not address it. They will do every kind of government \nprogram that comes to mind, but they won't leave the money in the hands \nof the American people so we can grow our economy.\n  I encourage my colleagues but also the American people to look in on \nwhat is happening today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would just like to correct the \nstatement made by the Senator from South Carolina. He is saying this \nside has not\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\nwanted to extend tax cuts. That is totally inaccurate. This side does \nwant to extend tax cuts, and we will. Come September, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is going to see that this side of the aisle very \ndefinitely wants to extend those Bush tax cuts, including the 2001 \ncuts, the 2003 cuts. The only question is how much to do on AMT and how \nmuch to do on Federal estate tax. But we do want to extend them.\n  I see he is walking off the floor because I think he knows I am right \nand he doesn't want to have to hear it, but the fact is, we are going \nto extend. We will do our level best. The real question is whether we \nwill have 60 votes to get that passed. That remains to be seen. I hope \nthat happens. I don't see any Senators on that side of the aisle right \nnow, but I hope there are a few--at least one--so hopefully we will get \n60 votes in September. But we will make very strong recommendations to \nextend these tax cuts--maybe not all, entirely, but the vast bulk of \nthem--in an effort to help the American people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, may I have 1 minute to explain the \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we all know the economic engine in this \ncountry is small businesses. Most of our jobs come from small \nbusinesses. It makes no sense in the middle of a recession for us to \ntake more money from small businesses and bring it here.\n  This amendment simply keeps current tax rates the same for those who \nfile individually as part of their small businesses. It is a simple \nidea. I think we all agree on it. It is important that we do it before \nthe break and let small businesses know they can plan for next year. \nThey can hire people. They can help grow our economy. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask for 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not know anybody who can responsibly \nvote for this amendment because we do not know what it is. What is the \ndefinition of ``small business''? It could be anything. I think it is a \nthinly veiled attempt to address the top rates. We are only talking \nabout the top rates in effect.\n  The other amendment was totally irresponsible. It required a $3 \ntrillion cut in spending over 10 years; $3 trillion--not a ``b,'' a \n``t.'' This one is in the same vein.\n  Also, I think it is irresponsible because these are problems we must \naddress seriously when we come back, not take this lightly with message \namendments but seriously address when we come back in September what we \ndo with the tax cuts and what we do on the deficits.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, there can be no doubt of the need for \nthis bill, which includes an extension of enhanced Medicaid funding to \nStates and funding to help keep teachers in the classroom and out of \nthe unemployment line. Failure to enact this extension would place \nservices to those most in need at terrible risk, and it would place \nmany States, including my own, in an untenable budget situation.\n  Failure to enact the continued enhancement of Federal assistance for \nMedicaid and other health care programs would leave a hole more than \n$300 million wide in the budget of my State. Other States would face \nsimilar shortfalls. Plugging that hole in the current economic \nenvironment would almost certainly require service cuts or tax \nincreases above and beyond those suffered already by so many of our \nStates.\n  There is also little doubt of the need for the funding included in \nthis bill to preserve teaching jobs. In the current climate, we should \nbe looking for ways to preserve jobs. But that is especially true when \nloss of the jobs at stake would harm not only workers and their \nfamilies, but students depending on these teachers to help them prepare \nfor the future. Failing to approve this funding would damage our nation \nnow and in the future.\n  The excuses our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have \nused to prevent passage of important legislation in recent weeks do not \napply here. This measure is fully paid for. I regret that some of the \npay-fors are accomplished by borrowing from other important programs, \nand efforts are under way to correct that problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I come to the Floor today to discuss \nsomething very important to Illinois and so many others states FMAP.\n  As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we increased \nthe Federal matching rate for Medicaid, FMAP.\n  This is smart policy in a recession, because not only does it help \npeople in a time of need, it is also one of the most effective ways to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Temporarily increasing Medicaid costs allows States to sustain their \nprograms, rather than cutting them when families need them most.\n  It also generates business activity, jobs and wages in States that \nthey would not otherwise have seen.\n  But the temporary FMAP increase we passed is scheduled to end on \nDecember 31 right in the middle of most States' fiscal year.\n  For the 3rd consecutive year, States are facing vast revenue \nshortfalls. One estimate is that States will face deficits of over $350 \nbillion over the next 30 months.\n  As a result, at least 30 States are proposing cuts to their Medicaid \nprograms for fiscal year 2011--cuts that will harm people right when \nthey need help most.\n  These include cuts to eligibility, fewer benefits, more cost-sharing, \nand lower payments to the medical providers who see Medicaid patients.\n  The measure we are considering today would extend and phase out \nincreases in the Medicaid matching rate for 6 months, through June 30, \n2011.\n  It will provide $16.1 billion to States to ensure that they continue \nto receive an increased FMAP rate through the end of most States' \nfiscal years.\n  Illinois would receive about $550 million in Federal funding to help \nkeep the State's Medicaid program afloat.\n  The spending in this measure is fully offset. It will not add a dime \nto the Federal deficit.\n  My home State of Illinois is facing a budget shortfall of $13 billion \nin FY11.\n  This is at a time when the unemployment rate was 10.4 percent in \nJune, and the State's revenues from sales tax and individual and \ncorporate income taxes are down more than $3 billion since the fiscal \nyear 08 peak.\n  The State doesn't expect to return to fiscal year 08 revenue levels \nbased on the current tax rates until fiscal year 15.\n  Because of this deficit the State has already started making hard \nchoices.\n  Just last week, the Governor announced that to save $18 million, \n2,700 non-union State workers would be required to take 24 days off \nwithout pay.\n  That is just one measure to save money, and they will be forced to \nconsider additional painful cuts if we do not extend the increased FMAP \nrate through the end of the State's fiscal year.\n  Today, the Medicaid program in Illinois covers 2.6 million low- and \nmoderate-income people in the State, including children, pregnant women \nand people with developmental disabilities and mental illness.\n  Illinois saw its FMAP rate increase from 50 percent to 62 percent as \na result of the Economic Recovery spending.\n  The state of Illinois assumed a 6-month FMAP extension in its fiscal \nyear 2011 budget.\n  Without an extension, the State will be short an additional $750 \nmillion this year.\n  Illinois has reviewed its Medicaid program, and determined that \nwithout an extension of the increased Federal matching rate, it may be \nforced to consider eliminating services for: 168,000 children from \nfamilies with incomes just above the Federal Poverty Level; 18,000 \nadults from families with incomes greater than 133 percent of the \nFederal Poverty level; 200,000 adults covered by Illinois Cares RX--a \nstate program that helps low-income adults afford prescription drugs; \n63,000 children covered by Allkids--a comprehensive State program to \nprovide insurance to kids who would otherwise not have health \ninsurance.\n  Illinois was not alone in planning for a 6-month FMAP extension in \n2011.\n  In fact, 30 States assumed that an extension would be provided, and \nas of today, about half of those states do not yet have contingency \nplans for how to balance their budgets if an FMAP extension is not \npassed.\n  If Congress does not extend the funds, governors and legislatures \nwill have to revisit those budgets and consider new cuts, which will \nhurt the Nation's most vulnerable residents and will affect a variety \nof services.\n  These will be on top of cuts that have already been made over the \npast few years.\n  The National Association of State Budget Officers estimates that even \nas the need for State-funded services rose, states cut funding for \nservices by 4 percent for fiscal year 2009 and almost 5 percent for \n2010.\n  That's why 47 governors--Democrats and Republicans alike--have signed \na National Governor's Association letter urging Congress to extend the \nRecovery Act's additional Medicaid funding.\n  In these difficult economic times, we are trying to help Americans \nreturn to work AND take care of those who are between jobs.\n  These benefits include continued access to quality health care under \nthe Medicaid program.\n  Extending and phasing down the increased FMAP rate for another 6 \nmonths is a win-win for all of us. It will protect the most vulnerable \nduring this time of need and provide immediate relief to State and \nlocal economies.\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n                    medicaid pharmacy reimbursement\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask to engage in a brief colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senate majority leader and Senator Murray as it relates \nto the intent of a provision in this legislation regarding average \nmanufacturer price--or AMP.\n  Do I understand that the provision in section 202 of this bill is \nsolely intended to ensure that Medicaid rebates are collected from the \nmanufacturers of the particular drugs specified in the bill, that is \ninhalation, infusion, instilled, implanted, or injectable drugs not \ngenerally sold at retail pharmacies?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, the intention of this provision is to ensure that \nrebate dollars are collected for those particular drugs. Drug rebate \ndollars have long helped support state Medicaid programs and the \nprovision will ensure an accurate calculation of AMP for the purposes \nof these drug rebates.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for engaging in a colloquy with \nSenator Lincoln and me and would also like to clarify that this \nprovision is in no way intended to impact reimbursement to retail \npharmacies participating in the Medicaid Program. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The Secretary should direct drug \nmanufacturers to calculate AMPs for these drugs to allow States to \ncollect rebates. In order to maintain pharmacy reimbursement at \nappropriate levels for these drugs, the Secretary should use the \ndiscretion that is provided under the Patient Protection and \nAccountable Care Act to calculate a Federal upper limit, FUL, at an \namount that is at least 175 percent of the weighted average AMP for \nthose covered outpatient drugs.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. We would like to thank the leader for his clarification \nand shared goal of protecting access to critical drug therapies for \nvulnerable populations at retail pharmacies.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senators on the importance of protecting \nbeneficiaries' access to these drug therapies and the retail pharmacies \nthat faithfully serve them. I thank the Senators for their shared \ncommitment to this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, today I was proud to vote for final \npassage of the amendment offered by Senators Murray, Harkin, Schumer \nand Reid to the FAA authorization bill. This amendment brings long \noverdue good news to teachers and kids in Colorado and those worried \nabout losing access to the health care they need. I was elated to see \nthe Senate break through the usual gridlock and pass this important \nlegislation.\n  The package will save thousands of jobs and protect health services \nfor kids and vulnerable populations across Colorado and the country. \nDuring this savage economy that is hurting families all over our state \nand our country, as we work to get our ship righted, our kids and our \nschools should be at the top of our list of priorities.\n  If we are going to ensure that we leave more opportunity for our kids \nthan we ourselves have had then we must remain committed to education--\nto set the table for our kids' futures; to prepare them for the \ncompetitive world that awaits them; and to enrich their lives with a \nbetter education than the one that was offered to us.\n  I have tried to be a leader in the fight for the Medicaid Federal \nMedical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, funding and saving teachers' jobs. \nI was an original cosponsor of the Keep Our Educators Working Act of \n2010, introduced by Senator Tom Harkin. In February, I also led a group \nof 43 of my Senate colleagues in submitting a letter urging the \nmajority leader to provide States with an additional 6-month FMAP \nextension.\n  The Medicaid FMAP extension passed today by the Senate was crucial in \nthe effort to keep public servants at work across the country. Without \nit, States would be forced to layoff tens of thousands of more teachers \nand other public employees, cut education funding even further, and \nfurther reduce payments to health care providers. More than 900,000 \npublic and private sector jobs could be lost.\n  Colorado alone would lose more than $200 million if the FMAP \nextension fell victim to Washington politics. Cuts could include \neliminating state aid for full-day kindergarten for 35,000 children, \neliminating preschool aid for 21,000 children, and increasing \novercrowding in juvenile detention facilities, according the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities. The education jobs funding would prevent \nthe loss of between 2,000 and 3,000 teacher jobs in Colorado alone.\n  I am glad to see this package is paid for. However, I was very \nconcerned about the House package which paid for teacher jobs in part \nby cutting education reform programs. I joined 15 of my colleagues in \nsigning a letter requesting that we find other offsets to pay for this \nimportant measure. I am very pleased that we were able to avert the \ncuts to critical education programs and save teachers' jobs--all \nwithout raising the deficit.\n  Additionally, while I strongly support the measure, in no small part \nbecause it is completely paid for and does not add one dime to our \ndeficit, I would like to raise a strong concern with one of the pay-\nfors in this package. A rescission of $1.5 billion from the Department \nof Energy's, DOE, renewable energy loan guarantee program was used to \nhelp offset this amendment.\n  In Colorado this important program has helped foster tremendous \ngrowth in the clean energy economy. Just last month, President Obama \nannounced a conditional loan guarantee for a solar manufacturing \nfacility in my home state and there are dozens of job creating \nrenewable energy projects across the country waiting for approval from \nDOE.\n  This rescission places $15 to $20 billion of private investment in \nclean energy investment in jeopardy. While I am constantly reminded \nthat the Senate needs to make tough choices as we strive to be fiscally \nresponsible, I am compelled to raise my objection to this offset. It is \nmy sincere hope that, in the future, this Chamber, the House of \nRepresentatives and the administration will avoid tapping into what are \nalready scarce clean energy investments to pay for what are admittedly \nimportant recession-stopping items such as the ones we approved today.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, earlier today, I voted in \nfavor of two motions designed to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Let \nme be clear, I strongly support extending individual income tax rates. \nWhile I voted in favor of these motions to show\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\nmy support for extending the tax cuts, I do not agree with the tactics \nbeing used to advance this goal. The repeated attempts to suspend rule \nXXII in order to make a motion to commit a bill back to committee are \nbecoming part of an ongoing dilatory effort in the Senate. These \ntactics are not a serious attempt to come up with a legislative \nsolution but are designed only to score political points and slow the \nprogress of the underlying bill. The American taxpayers deserve more. I \nbelieve that instead of looking to score points both parties should \nwork together on a serious effort to extend these expiring tax \nprovisions, not waste time with procedural distractions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6767-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6767-S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

It is my understanding the bill is passed. I thank \nthe Senate for passage of this bill.\n  This is a bill which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nreported out by a unanimous 15-to-0 vote on July 19. This is the \nSenate's second time approving an intelligence authorization bill for \nfiscal year 2010. The committee reported S. 1494 unanimously in July \n2009, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent in September 2009. \nThe House passed its bill, its 2010 authorization bill, in February \n2010.\n  The House and Senate Intelligence Committees then worked for months, \ntogether with the administration, to agree on a bill that would make a \nsubstantial contribution to national security and that would be able to \npass both Chambers and become law with the President's approval. S. \n3611 is that agreement.\n  I thank the White House for their efforts to come to an agreement on \nthe legislation, as well as the efforts of the vice chairman, Senator \nBond, and his staff. This is his last bill and, as such, I thank him \nvery much for his cooperation in this matter, for the ability to work \nwith him over this period of time.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the leadership of the distinguished \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Reyes.\n  Broadly speaking, the bill advances the cause of effective oversight \nof the intelligence community and contributes significantly to the \nDirector of National Intelligence's ability to direct and lead the \nintelligence community as an integrated whole.\n  It is my understanding that the House will be back in session next \nweek. I would urge them to take up this important legislation at that \ntime.\n  Our committee filed a detailed report on S. 3611, which is available \nboth in print and on our Web site to all Members of the Senate, our \ncolleagues in the House, and the public as Senate Report 111-223.\n  The bill contains 106 sections divided into eight titles. Let me \ncommend the reading of the bill and our report to all who may be \ninterested in why it is essential that the Congress complete action on \nthis needed and overdue legislation. In these remarks, I will only \nmention a few highlights.\n  This is the committee's second report of an intelligence \nAuthorization for fiscal year 2010. We reported S. 1494 unanimously in \nJuly 2009 and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent in September \n2009. The House passed its fiscal year 2010 in February 2010.\n  The House and Senate Intelligence Committees then worked for months, \ntogether with the administration, to agree on a bill that would make a \nsubstantial contribution to national security and that would be able to \npass both Chambers and become law with the President's approval. S. \n3611 is that agreement.\n  Broadly speaking, the bill advances the cause of effective oversight \nof the intelligence community and contributes significantly to the \nDirector of National Intelligence's ability to direct and lead the \nintelligence community as an integrated whole.\n  To illustrate, with respect to oversight, the bill will complete an \neffort that the Senate began in 2004 to create a strong and independent \nstatutory inspector general for the intelligence community. A principal \nfocus of that community-wide IG will be on progress and problems with \nthe integration of the efforts of the 16 components of the intelligence \ncommunity. The bill also strengthens the CIA inspector general and \nprovides a statutory basis for IGs in the major intelligence elements \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n  This strengthened IG system within the intelligence community will \nprovide greater visibility for the leaders of the IC, including the \nDNI, into management, information sharing and information security, and \nother problems within the intelligence community. The reports of their \ninvestigations and audits will also be, as IG reports have been, an \ninvaluable aid for congressional oversight.\n  Other parts of the bill will also directly aid congressional \noversight. These include requirements that executive and legislative \nprocedures on full and timely notifications to the intelligence \ncommittees be in writing and that written records of notifications to \nthe intelligence committees of intelligence activities and covert \nactions also be in writing.\n  Importantly, the bill also requires that the head of each \nintelligence element certify annually on compliance with substantial \ncongressional notification requirements that already exist in title V \nof the National Security Act.\n  The bill takes important steps to improve both executive and \ncongressional oversight of intelligence community procurement and \nbudget matters. In the coming years, all parts of the government will \nneed to address the reality that appropriation levels will not rise as \nthey have in the past. This means that controlling cost overruns and \npromoting sound long term budget planning is an essential part of \nnational security. The bill takes important steps toward those \nobjectives.\n  The bill grants to the Director of National Intelligence important \nauthorities to manage the intelligence community. These include \nauthorities concerning personnel management, acquisition authority, and \ninformation sharing. There may be more to accomplish in all of these \nrespects and we have invited General Clapper, if he is confirmed as I \nhope and expect he will, not to be hesitant in asking for additional \nauthority if he identifies a need for it.\n  As is detailed in the committee's report, there are 10 provisions in \nthis legislation that enhance the DNI's authority and management \nflexibilities. Eight of those 10 provisions were requested by this \nadministration or the prior one.\n  There is more in this broad ranging legislation, from large to small \nitems. Indeed, the very length of the bill is testimony to the fact \nthat we have gone 5 years without an intelligence authorization. From \nfiscal years 1979 to 2005, the Congress had enacted an authorization \nfor every fiscal year. The\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nfiscal year 2010 bill is an opportunity, which we must not lose, to get \nback on track.\n  I will briefly note the reasons for the managers' amendment that the \ndistinguished vice chairman, Senator Bond, and I have propounded.\n  Three provisions of S. 3611 as reported by our committee on July 19, \nsections 106, 333(c.), and 334 of S. 3611, have been enacted into law \nby provisions of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, sections \n301, 308, and 3011 of Public Law 111-212, which the President signed \ninto law on July 29. Accordingly, the managers' amendment deletes those \nnow enacted provisions from S. 3611.\n  The managers' amendment also addresses requests from the Budget and \nJudiciary Committees. As requested by the Budget Committee, the \namendment adds a pay-go provision. I should note that the Congressional \nBudget Office table that will be printed in the Record indicates that \nthe bill makes no changes in the government's direct spending. As \nrequested by the Judiciary Committee, the amendment clarifies that \nreports provided to the Congress under several sections of the bill \nwill be provided to the Judiciary Committee.\n  This legislation reflects the negotiations with the House committee, \nthe intelligence community, and the White House. Provisions that our \ncommittee, and the Senate, passed last September had to be removed due \nto veto threats or objections from the House of Representatives. I look \nforward to addressing some of those issues in future legislation.\n  Beginning with our distinguished vice chairman, Senator Bond, and \nacknowledging also the leadership of the distinguished chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee, Mr. Reyes, I would like to thank all of \nmy colleagues for their work in producing a bill that will take \nimportant strides in improving the authority and oversight of the \nintelligence community through this 2010 bill, even as we recognize \nthat there is more to achieve in authorization legislation for fiscal \nyears 2011 and beyond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the chair of our committee. I \nthank her, her staff, for all of the good work that has gone into this \nbill, repeatedly, as she pointed out.\n  For too many years Congress has failed to pass an intelligence \nauthorization bill that could be signed into law. I am very pleased to \njoin with Senator Feinstein, the distinguished chair of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, in achieving passage of S. 3611, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n  Over the past several months, we worked closely with the House \nPermanent Select Committees on Intelligence and Administration to reach \na compromise text that could serve as a conference report for this \nbill. The bill now before this Senate and having passed the Senate \ncontains all of the elements of the compromise. It has been agreed to \nin advance by representatives of the administration. But, \nunfortunately, the House has thus far declined to move the process \nforward, bringing this bill formally to conference.\n  The chair and I agreed that we would be able to move this process \nforward by having the Senate pass the compromise text for the House to \nconsider when it returns next week.\n  The intelligence authorization bill before us is a good bill. It will \ngive the intelligence community the flexibility and authorities it \nneeds to function effectively and will ensure appropriate intelligence \noversight by this committee.\n  I have often said that in creating the Director of National \nIntelligence, we gave him an awful lot of responsibility without all \nthe authority he needed. Well, our bill attempts to address that \nproblem by giving the DNI clearer authority and greater flexibility in \noverseeing the intelligence community.\n  There are also a number of provisions in this bill that I believe are \nessential for promoting good government. Too often, we have seen \nprograms or acquisitions of major systems balloon in cost and decrease \nin performance. That is unacceptable. We are in difficult economic \ntimes and the taxpayers are spending substantial sums of money to \nensure that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep \nus safe. If we don't demand accountability for how these tools are \noperated or created, then we are failing the intelligence community, \nand, ultimately, we are failing the American people.\n  So, for the past several years, I have sponsored amendments that \nrequire the intelligence community to perform vulnerability assessments \nof major systems and to keep track of excessive cost growth of major \nsystems. This latter provision is modeled on the Nunn-McCurdy provision \nwhich has guided Defense Department acquisitions for years. I am happy \nto say that these provisions are part of this year's bill, too. I \nbelieve that these, and other good-government provisions, will \nencourage earlier identification and solving of problems relating to \nthe acquisition of major systems. Too often, such problems have not \nbeen identified until exorbitant sums of money have been spent--and, \nunfortunately, at that point, there is often reluctance to cancel the \nproject.\n  Similarly, the intelligence community must get a handle on its \npersonnel levels. In these tough economic times, it is more important \nthan ever to make sure that the intelligence community is appropriately \nresourced to ensure that its personnel can effectively perform their \nrespective national security missions.\n  However, I am concerned about the number of contractors used by the \nintelligence community to perform functions better left to government \nemployees. There are some jobs that demand the use of contractors, for \nexample, certain technical jobs or short-term functions, but too often, \nthe quick fix is just to hire contractors, not long-term support. And \nso, our bill includes a provision calling for annual personnel level \nassessments for the intelligence community. These assessments will \nensure that, before more people are brought in, there are adequate \nresources to support them and enough work to keep them busy.\n  These are just a few of the provisions in this bill that I believe \nare important for the success of our intelligence collection efforts \nand equally important for ensuring sound oversight by the intelligence \ncommittee.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership in shepherding this \nbill through the committee and the Senate. I appreciate her willingness \nto work through the countless issues raised throughout this process. I \nalso thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.\n  It is well-past time that Congress send an intelligence authorization \nbill to the President for his signature. Only by fulfilling our \nlegislative function will we get back on track with performing \neffective and much-needed intelligence oversight.\n  I, again, extend and expand my thanks to the distinguished chair for \nmaking sure the Senate Intelligence Committee can work in a bipartisan \nmanner, which we have done on this bill, and on lengthy oversight \nmatters that we have undertaken out of view of public scrutiny, \nobviously, but spending many days, many hours in meetings, looking over \nthe wide range of critical efforts that are needed by our intelligence \ncommunity to keep our country safe.\n  Why does passing an authorization bill matter at this late date in \nthe fiscal year? An annual intelligence authorization bill does more \nthan just authorize funding for intelligence activities, funding that \nin many cases has already been appropriated and spent. But it is vital \nthat the intelligence committees be able to provide direction for the \nexpenditure of funds for the intelligence community. But by providing \ncurrent and congressional guidance and statutory authority we can \nensure that the intelligence community has the maximum flexibility, the \ncapability it needs to function effectively, spend taxpayer funds \nwisely, and keep our Nation safe.\n  The Senate bill has the full support of the Senate. Senior \nadministration has said they will recommend the President sign this \ncompromise text into law. I urge, once again, the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives to bring up this bill and pass it when the House \nreturns to session next week so we can get back on track with \nperforming effective intelligence oversight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President. today the Senate passed a new version of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (S. 3611) with a \nmanager's amendment to address key concerns of the Judiciary Committee. \nI appreciate the commitment of Senator Feinstein, the chair of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, to work with me to strengthen \nthis important legislation. The bill the Senate has approved recognizes \nthe shared jurisdiction of the committee on the Judiciary and the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence in several legislative areas.\n  Last fall, when an earlier version of this bill--S. 1494--was \nconsidered by the Senate, I recognized that several provisions in the \nbill fell under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. Senator \nFeinstein and I engaged in serious negotiations concerning these \nprovisions. We negotiated agreements regarding exemptions to the \nFreedom of Information Act, FOIA, as well as numerous reporting \nrequirements, such as a significant, new requirement for the Federal \nBureau of Investigation--FBI--an agency clearly under the jurisdiction \nof the Judiciary Committee, and an important new cybersecurity \noversight provision.\n  Negotiations I undertook with Senator Feinstein last fall on the \nearlier version of the bill narrowed the operational files FOIA \nexemption for information provided by intelligence agencies to the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, and struck a \nFOIA (b)(3) exemption for terrorist identity information. Those \nagreements were preserved in the new version of the bill, S. 3611.\n  Senator Feinstein has told me she is also committed to ensuring that \nthe Judiciary Committee will receive reports required by the bill's \nsection 337, Cybersecurity Oversight. I appreciate Senator Feinstein's \nsupport for these improvements. The manager's amendment to the \nintelligence authorization bill agreed to today explicitly identifies \nthe Judiciary Committee as a recipient of relevant reporting \nprovisions.\n  The intelligence authorization bill includes several reporting \nrequirements that involve areas of long-standing interest and \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The new version of the bill, \nS. 3611, ensures that the Judiciary Committee is a recipient of those \nreports. Section 333 of the bill directs the Director of National \nIntelligence to provide a comprehensive report on all measures taken by \nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence and by elements of \nthe intelligence community to comply with the provisions of applicable \nlaw, international obligations, and executive orders relating to the \ndetention and interrogation activities of the intelligence community. \nThese include compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005; the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006; common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions; the Convention Against Torture; Executive Order 13492, \nrelating to lawful interrogations; and Executive Order 13493, relating \nto detention policy options.\n  The managers' amendment to the intelligence authorization bill \nmodifies section 333 to ensure that to the extent that the report \naddresses an element of the intelligence community within the \nDepartment of Justice, it shall be submitted, along with associated \nmaterial, to the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate. This \nreporting requirement is a cornerstone of the agreement I reached with \nSenator Feinstein last year. I am pleased to see it retained in the \nbill we passed today.\n  I fought for years to obtain information about the Bush \nadministration's detention and interrogation policies and practices, \nand the legal advice from that administration authorizing those \npolicies and practices. The last administration refused to give this \ninformation to Congress, instead issuing secret legal advice that \nmisconstrued our laws and international obligations with regard to the \ntreatment of people in our custody. Years later we found out that the \nadministration had sanctioned cruel interrogation techniques, including \ntorture. It is imperative that the Judiciary Committee be fully \ninformed of the extent to which the government is complying with our \nlaws and international treaties relating to detention and interrogation \nin order to be able to conduct proper oversight and ensure that our \ngovernment cannot shield policies that authorize practices in violation \nof our laws. The Judiciary Committee is an important partner in this \noversight.\n  Section 405 of the bill establishes a new Office of Inspector General \nof the intelligence community to conduct independent investigations, \ninspections, audits and reviews on programs and activities conducted \nunder the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. Under \nthis new authority, the inspector general is required to submit a \nsemiannual report to the Director of National Intelligence summarizing \nits activities. The amendment incorporated into S. 1494 last fall, and \ncarried over to S. 3611, modifies the reporting provision to require \nthe inspector general to submit reports that focus on government \nofficials to the committees of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives with jurisdiction over the department that official \nrepresents.\n  Section 405 of the bill creates an entirely new inspector general \nwith significant authority and responsibility in the intelligence \ncommunity. That authority will implicate agencies within the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, including the Department of \nJustice and components of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nbelieve this modification to the bill provides an important recognition \nof the Judiciary Committee's need to be involved in the investigations \nand activities of this new inspector general.\n  Another significant new provision is section 445 of the bill, Report \nand Assessment on Transformation of the Intelligence Capabilities of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, which creates a broad new \nreporting requirement for the FBI. The Judiciary Committee has always \nhad primary oversight over the FBI. As the FBI takes on more \nresponsibility in the areas of intelligence and national security, its \npolicies and practices in these areas must be subject to the oversight \nof Congress. The Intelligence Committees have particular expertise that \nmake them an important partner in this oversight. However, it is the \nJudiciary Committee that has the primary legislative and oversight \nresponsibilities over the FBI.\n  I am very pleased that the bill passed today contains several \nimportant improvements that I recommended to strengthen FOIA. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill, as amended, does not contain a \nbroad and unnecessary exemption to FOIA's disclosure requirements for \nterrorist identity information. That provision was included in an \nearlier version of the bill, but I worked to ensure it was struck it \nprior to passage of S. 1494 last fall. It is not included in S. 3611, \nthe successor to S. 1494.\n  No one would quibble with the notion that our government can--and \nshould--keep some information secret to protect our national security. \nBut, in the case of terrorist identity information, our government has \nsuccessfully withheld this sensitive information under the existing \nFOIA exemptions for classified and law enforcement information. In \naddition, the many instances of mistaken identities and other errors on \nterrorist watchlists and ``no-fly'' lists make it clear that FOIA can \nbe a valuable tool to help innocent Americans redress and correct \nmistakes on these lists.\n  Lastly, as a result of my negotiations with Senator Feinstein last \nfall, S. 3611 narrows the exemption to FOIA's search requirements for \noperational files information that the Nation's intelligence agencies \nshare with the ODNI. The bill makes it clear that operational files \nthat are already exempt from these search requirements retain this \nexemption under circumstances where the files are disseminated to the \nODNI. This carefully crafted compromise will help ensure both effective \ninformation sharing among our intelligence agencies and the free flow \nof information to the American public.\n  I believe that S. 3611 and the managers amendment passed today \nrecognize the value and significance of the shared jurisdiction in many \nareas of national security between the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees. The Judiciary Committee has long engaged in oversight and \nlegislative activity regarding cyber threats and cybersecurity. Senator \nFeinstein and I have worked together in the Judiciary Committee for \nmany years on these issues, and we both recognize the shared \njurisdiction and responsibilities of the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\nwith regard to oversight of cyber matters and cybersecurity.\n  I appreciate Senator Feinstein's cooperation in adopting these \nimprovements. In a letter sent to me yesterday, August 3, 2010, Senator \nFeinstein reiterated her commitment to work with the Judiciary \nCommittee in the area of cyber matters. I ask unanimous consent to have \nher August 3, 2010 letter printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record an exchange of letters between Senator \nFeinstein and myself dated September 15 and 16, 2009, that discussed \nSenate jurisdiction over the section in the bill that addresses \ncybersecurity oversight. In the earlier version of the bill, S. 1494, \nthe section was numbered 340. In the new version of the bill, S. 3611, \nthe cybersecurity oversight section is numbered 337.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. As Senator Feinstein has described it, Section 337 of the \nbill is intended to provide a preliminary framework for executive and \ncongressional oversight of cybersecurity programs, as defined in the \nsection, to ensure that these programs are consistent with legal \nauthorities, preserve reasonable expectations of privacy, and are \nsubject to independent audit and review. Section 337 of S. 3611 creates \nseveral reporting requirements with regard to the executive and \ncongressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These include \nPresidential notifications to Congress, reports to Congress and the \nPresident from the head of a department or agency with responsibility \nfor cybersecurity programs, in conjunction with the inspector general \nof that department or agency, and a joint report to Congress and the \nPresident from the inspector general of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the inspector general of the intelligence community on the \nstatus of the sharing of cyber threat information within 1 year. I look \nforward to continuing to work with Senator Feinstein in the Judiciary \nCommittee and in the Senate to ensure strong oversight and legislation \nwith regard to cyber matters.\n  I am pleased the Senate today will pass the amended Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The progress that Senator \nFeinstein and I have made to improve this bill demonstrates the success \nwe can have when we work together constructively.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As you know, our staffs have been in \n     discussions since the beginning of recess over various \n     provisions of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2010, ordered reported from the Committee on July \n     22, 2009. Among the provisions at issue is Section 340, \n     Cybersecurity Oversight.\n       Section 340 is intended to provide a preliminary framework \n     for executive and congressional oversight of cybersecurity \n     programs, as defined in the section, to ensure that these \n     programs are consistent with legal authorities, preserve \n     reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject to \n     independent audit and review.\n       Section 340 contains several reporting requirements. One \n     requires the President to provide certain notifications to \n     Congress. In addition, the head of a department or agency \n     with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in \n     conjunction with the inspector general of that department or \n     agency, is to submit to Congress and the President periodic \n     reports on the program. Finally, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of \n     the Intelligence Community are jointly to submit a report to \n     Congress and the President on the status of the sharing of \n     cyber threat information within one year.\n       Under the provision as reported, notifications and reports \n     under the section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.'' \n     Vice Chairman Bond and I have consulted with the Senate \n     parliamentarian to convey our recommendations for how \n     referrals of notifications and reports under the section \n     should be made.\n       As we have discussed before, cybersecurity is a matter of \n     interest to many of the committees of the Senate. Of note is \n     the longstanding interest in, and jurisdiction over, cyber \n     matters by the Judiciary Committee. This includes but is not \n     necessarily limited to the cybersecurity of the Justice \n     Department and other departments and agencies under the \n     Committee's jurisdiction, privacy interests of the American \n     people, and legal dimensions of the government's cyber \n     activities. Given the Judiciary Committee's role in these \n     matters and the expectation that reports under Section 340 \n     will touch on one or more of the Committee's areas of \n     jurisdiction, it is my strong belief that documents provided \n     to the Congress should be provided to the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       In addition, should the Intelligence Committee receive \n     reports under this section that are within the jurisdiction \n     of the Judiciary Committee but that are not provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee, I will ensure that access to those \n     reports is provided to Judiciary Committee members and staff \n     as appropriate.\n       Thank you for your cooperation over this issue, and other \n     provisions of the intelligence legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We exchanged letters last September \n     about section 340 of S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2010. As described in the report of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, the purpose of section 340 \n     is to establish a preliminary framework for executive and \n     legislative oversight to ensure that the federal government's \n     national cyber security mission is consistent with legal \n     authorities and preserves reasonable expectations of privacy.\n       On September 16, 2009, you placed in the Congressional \n     Record, at 155 Cong. Rec. S9451, my letter to you of \n     September 15. Because section 340 provides for various \n     reports or notifications to be submitted ``to the Congress,'' \n     I wrote to convey to you my recognition of the Judiciary \n     Committee's long-standing interest in, and jurisdiction over, \n     cyber matters, and my belief that documents provided to \n     Congress under section 340 should be provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee. I also stated my commitment that should \n     the Intelligence Committee receive reports under section 340 \n     that are within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee \n     but are not provided to it, then I will ensure your \n     committee's member and staff access to those documents as \n     appropriate.\n       The Intelligence Committee has now reported a second FY \n     2010 Intelligence Authorization, S. 3611, which is based on \n     the work of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and \n     the Administration to reconcile S. 1494 and H.R. 2701, the \n     House intelligence bill. Section 337 of S. 3611 is the direct \n     descendant of section 340 of S. 1494. The legislative history \n     of section 340 of S. 1494, including my letter to you of \n     September 15, 2009, is part of the legislative history of \n     section 337 of S. 3611.\n       The recognition I expressed of the role of the Judiciary \n     Committee in cyber matters, my belief in the right of the \n     Judiciary Committee to receive reports under section 337, and \n     my commitment to provide to your committee access to such \n     reports in the event they are provided to my committee but \n     not to yours, apply as much to section 337 of S. 3611 as they \n     applied to section 340 of S. 1494.\n       I look forward to working with your committee, and other \n     interested committees of the Senate, in establishing a strong \n     basis for cyber security oversight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Feinstein: Thank you for your letter today \n     regarding S. 1494, the Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2010. I was happy to work with you to reach \n     agreement on the amendment you are offering to the bill to \n     include the Judiciary Committee as a recipient of relevant \n     reporting provisions and to strike a proposed FOIA exemption \n     and modify another FOIA provision. I appreciate your support \n     for those improvements.\n       I had my first opportunity to review this legislation when \n     it was hotlined on August 5. As you noted, our staffs have \n     been in discussions over various provisions of S. 1494 that \n     involve the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and \n     issues on which it shares an interest with the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence.\n       Our understanding also includes the commitment in your \n     letter to me today to ensure that the Judiciary Committee \n     receives reports required by Section 340, Cybersecurity \n     Oversight. As you know as a member and former chair of the \n     Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland \n     Security, the Judiciary Committee has long engaged in \n     oversight and legislative activity regarding cyber threats \n     and cybersecurity. You and I have long worked together in the \n     Judiciary Committee on these issues and I appreciate your \n     recognition of the shared jurisdiction and responsibilities \n     of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees with regard to \n     oversight of cyber matters and cybersecurity. I appreciate \n     your commitment to ensure that the Judiciary Committee will \n     receive reports received under the Cybersecurity Oversight \n     provision.\n       As you have described it, Section 340 is intended to \n     provide a preliminary framework for executive and \n     congressional oversight of\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\n     cybersecurity programs, as defined in the section, to ensure \n     that these programs are consistent with legal authorities, \n     preserve reasonable expectations of privacy, and are subject \n     to independent audit and review. Section 340 creates several \n     reporting requirement with regard to the executive and \n     congressional oversight of cybersecurity programs. These \n     include Presidential notifications to Congress, reports to \n     Congress and the President from the head of a department or \n     agency with responsibility for cybersecurity programs, in \n     conjunction with the inspector general of that department or \n     agency, and a joint report to Congress and the President from \n     the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security \n     and the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on \n     the status of the sharing of cyber threat information within \n     one year.\n       According to the legislative language, reports under the \n     section are to be submitted ``to the Congress.'' As you noted \n     in your letter, the Judiciary Committee has a ``longstanding \n     interest in, and jurisdiction over'' cyber matters and cyber \n     security. This includes criminal activities, cybersecurity \n     matters handled by the Justice Department and other \n     departments and agencies under the Judiciary Committee's \n     jurisdiction, the privacy interests of the American people, \n     and constitutional and legal dimensions of the Government's \n     cyber activities, including all legal guidance. Thank you for \n     your willingness to work together on this issue, and the \n     other provisions of the intelligence legislation.\n       I look forward to continuing to work together with you in \n     the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate to ensure strong \n     oversight and legislation with regard to cyber matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we conclude our work prior to the \nAugust break, we are working very hard to try to address the Cobell \nsettlement and the Pigford settlement, these settlements are the result \nof lawsuits that were filed, negotiations that ensued, and eventually \nreaching agreement to settle these two cases.\n  I would like to talk briefly about the Cobell settlement. To start, I \nwant to show a photograph, a picture of a woman named Mary Fish. I \nwonder how anyone serving in this Chamber or how anyone in this country \nwould feel had they been Mary Fish. She was an Oklahoma Indian. She \nlived in a small, humble home, never had very much. But she had a piece \nof property, 40 acres, and she had six oil wells on her land--six oil \nwells on her land.\n  How she got ``her land'' dates back to 1887 when the Federal \nGovernment first divided up tribal lands and gave individual Indians \nseparate parcels of land and then said to the Indians: You know what. \nWe are going to give you separate parcels of land that will be yours. \nBut, we are going to manage them for you. We will hold them in trust \nand provide income from your land to you.\n  So poor Mary Fish, an Oklahoma Indian, had six oil wells on her land \nand lived a humble life and died a few years ago waiting, waiting for \njustice, justice that she never received. The Federal Government never \nexplained to Mary how much oil was being pumped from the wells on her \nland.\n  Even with all of the oil wells on her land, Mary made only a few \ndollars a year from six wells. At one point she got a check from the \nFederal Government for 6 cents. Another time she got a check from the \nFederal Government for $3. One time she got a check for $3,000. Another \ntime, although oil was still being produced, one of the statements that \nMary received showed a negative $5 in her account.\n  She died waiting for the government to account for the royalties on \nher land, and for this legislation that would settle this matter. She \ndied waiting for justice.\n  So what is the Cobell settlement, and what does it have to do with \nMary Fish and all the oil produced from her land. The Cobell settlement \nis an agreement reached by the Secretary of the Interior and the all of \nthe plaintiffs in the Cobell lawsuit--individual Indians like Mary. I \nam going to speak about the Cobell settlement, and a couple of \ncolleagues are going to talk about the Pigford settlement. We are here \ntoday talking about settling both of these issues.\n  The Cobell settlement established deadlines for the Congress to act. \nThe Court wants to see this matter resolved. The current deadline for \nCongress is August 6. We have already missed six deadlines established \nby the federal court. And if Congress does not act, the parties will \nreturn back to litigation, litigation that has gone on now for almost \n15 years in the federal courts.\n  As I indicated, this situation in the Cobell case resulted from a \ncentury of mismanagement of Indian trust accounts. I want to show a \nphotograph of the way trust records of the accounts for the individual \nIndians were kept on one Indian reservation--rat-infested warehouses \nwith boxes laying all over. They would not be able to find a piece of \npaper in this pile to save their souls. And this is how the government \nkept records for individual Indian trust accounts. The result is, so \nmany Indians were cheated. Yes, there have been circumstances in the \nlast century in which Indians were systematically cheated and looted. \nGrand theft occurred, a substantial amount of money was made off these \nlands. Someone else got it, the Indians did not. After all these years, \nit is long past the time for us to agree to settle these grievances.\n  The government has long known about the problem. In 1915, a \ngovernment report identified ``fraud, corruption and incompetence in \nthe management of these Indian trust accounts.'' That was in 1915. In \n1992, a House report compared the federal government's management of \nIndian trust accounts to ``a bank that doesn't know how much money it \nhas.''\n  Finally, in 1994, Congress passed a law requiring that the government \naccount for the money it was managing for American Indians, and then 2 \nyears later, where there was still nothing being done and no progress, \nElouise Cobell filed a case asking the government to follow the law.\n  Elouise Cobell is a member of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana. She is \nquite a remarkable woman. Like many American Indians, she grew up \nhearing stories of government checks and how the checks never made any \nsense. The checks arrived once in a while and were in amounts no one \nunderstood or could explain.\n  In 1996, she filed a lawsuit. Her lawsuit said: Give me an accounting \nof the money that you have collected from my lands, and do the same for \nevery other American Indian. That was in 1996.\n  We are now in the year 2010, and finally agreement has been reached \nby the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of \nJustice to settle these accounts. It was 10 years ago when the court \nruled against the Federal Government. The Federal Court said the \nFederal Government was wrong; they mismanaged these accounts, and \nviolated the trust. Yes, there has been corruption, incompetence, and \nmismanagement.\n  So 10 years ago, the Federal court ruled against the Federal \nGovernment, saying the Federal Government had lost, damaged, destroyed \ntrust records, and the Federal Government admitted it could not account \nfor these trust moneys. After all of this, the government had the nerve \nto spend taxpayers' money to appeal the court's decision. So it goes on \nand on and on. Millions have been spent in endless litigation with no \nsettlement in sight.\n  Finally, last December, and agreement was reached in settlement talks \nwith the Interior Department and the Indians that resulted a settlement \nand this legislation to approve the settlement.\n  I want to just mention a couple of other brief points. I know a \ncouple of colleagues wish to make some comments today.\n  The judge, when hearing of the settlement between the Federal \nGovernment and the Cobell plaintiffs, said the agreement was a win/win \nand that justice is on hold. That is what this is about. It is about \nproviding the funding to settle the Cobell case and provide some amount \nof justice.\n  Others will talk about settling the Pigford case.\n  I will very briefly say again a lot of American Indians have died \nwaiting for this moment. There are other stories I want to share.\n  This is Susie White Calf. She is a Blackfeet Indian from Montana. \nThis picture was taken in 2001, the same year the courts found the \nFederal Government had broken its responsibility to Indians. Six years \nlater, she passed away, in 2007. She will not get justice.\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\nBut perhaps we can provide justice for tens of thousands of other \nIndians by doing the right thing.\n  I have other things to say, but I know some of my colleagues wish to \nsay a few words. If I might, the Senator from Arkansas has to be away \nfrom the Chamber very briefly. She wanted to say a few words. Then I \nknow that Senator Kyl and some others wish to say some other words as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6800-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6800-S6803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PIGFORD II SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I want to say a special thanks to my \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan, not only for yielding, but also, most \nimportantly, for his incredible passion for justice. He has worked long \nand hard in this body and in the other, but certainly working hard for \njustice for those whose voices are often quieted. He does a tremendous \njob at it. I think we are all very grateful for that passion and for \nthat plea for justice.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to urge with great passion my Senate \ncolleagues to support another important piece of legislation; that is, \nto fund the racial discrimination settlement known as Pigford II \nbetween African-American farmers and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The time is long overdue to move beyond USDA's discriminatory past \nand begin to right the wrong of African-American producers and what \nthey have experienced. We have a keen opportunity today to be able to \nmove forward and to see, again, justice as has been described by \nSenator Dorgan in talking about moving forward and away from the past \nand the discrimination that occurred and putting an end to these \nsettlements that have already been settled. We have spent the time and \nthe energy and the resources to settle these arguments. Now we need to \nmake sure those who have been wronged will be right.\n  Between 1981 and 1996, African-American farmers seeking farm loans \nand credit were discriminated against, denying them access to \ngovernment programs and to capital. In some cases, these farmers were \ndiscouraged from even applying for loans. They were told they were \nineligible or that application forms were unavailable. In other \ninstances, loan applications were intentionally delayed to miss \ndeadlines, continuing to disadvantage those African-American farmers. \nAs a result of the discrimination, many of these farmers were unable to \nrun successful businesses and sustained severe damages to their credit \nhistories.\n  Despite these challenges, despite all of what they were presented \nwith and what they were dealing with, some of these farmers are still \nfarming today, embodying the essence of resilience and the industrious \ncharacteristic of all American farmers. We should be proud they are \nstill farming today, and we should honor that by making sure we move \nthis settlement forward and make sure these awards are granted to those \nwho have been wronged.\n  Another fallout faced by African-American farmers is their shaken \nfaith in the USDA and, by extension, the U.S. Government. Who can blame \nthem--to have been wronged and to be found they were in the right and \nyet still not to be made whole? Many farmers have spent more than 20 \nyears seeking recognition of the discrimination they experienced. While \nno settlement can completely compensate them for the anxiety, the \nanguish, and, of course, the humiliation they experienced, finally \nfunding this settlement is a critical first step in restoring the \nUSDA's credibility among minority farmers.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand how critically important this is \nto the embodiment of who we are as a people and a government to move \nthis forward. While it is understood that a legal settlement agreement \nis rarely perfect, funding this agreement will provide much needed \nreconciliation for African-American farmers. It is an opportunity to \nrestore their faith in their government, by renouncing a past riddled \nwith discrimination and rightfully honoring the settlement.\n  Time is of the essence, as many Pigford claimants have passed away \nwaiting for closure on this matter, just as Senator Dorgan mentioned \nNative Americans who have passed away waiting for justice. We simply \ncannot afford to delay this process any further. We have seen multiple \nopportunities and efforts to try to move forward. I hope today is an \nopportunity none of us will deny to move the issue forward.\n  In my State of Arkansas, I have heard the stories of hard-working \nfarm families who, despite years of neglect and discrimination from \ntheir own government, continue pushing ahead. I have heard from farmers \nsuch as Mr. Charlie Knott, a hard-working Arkansan who sought farm \nloans in the 1980s but was misled and mistreated in that process. Mr. \nKnott was refused timely access to sufficient capital because of \ndiscrimination, limiting production and ultimately crippling his \nbusiness.\n  When Mr. Knott fell ill, his children tried to take over the farm but \nwere also met with resistance and neglect from their government, \nleading to destroyed credit ratings, a loss of 230 acres, as well as \nthe family tractor and other farm equipment. After farming on the same \nland for over 100 years, the Knott family was forced to quit.\n  Adding insult to injury, the Knott children were once again denied \naccess to the Pigford claim because of missed filing deadlines. The \nKnott children are determined to return to farming, to restore the \nfamily business and their dignity, and to uphold the legacy of their \nfather, who fought for years not only to serve his family and community \nbut to contribute to the strong legacy of American farming.\n  Farmers such as Mr. Knott deserve justice and gratitude from a nation \nthat wouldn't be what it is today absent their sacrifices and \ncontributions. Farmers such as Mr. Knott have suffered gross \ninjustices. It is incumbent on the Members of Congress to demonstrate \nthe leadership to correct this injustice and to pass this legislation. \nIf not today, when? When will we do this? This action is long overdue. \nThe time has come to take this step, to live up to our founding \nprinciples, to begin the healing process that is so needed, and to \nrestore faith in our government. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure today as we move forward and put it behind us, as we begin to \nheal and rebuild faith in our government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nwhat she has said. It really is unfortunate that we cannot get this \nPigford legislation passed.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from \nNorth Carolina, has been working on this very hard as well. In fact, \nshe and I have cosponsored a piece of legislation to give justice in \nthis area as well.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to finally take care of this situation \nof bringing justice to Black farmers who have been waiting for decades \nto settle their discrimination claims against the Department of \nAgriculture. Earlier this year, Secretary Vilsack was able to reach a \nsettlement agreement with the Pigford II claimants who were denied a \ndetermination on the merits of their claims against the USDA for no \nreason other than they had filed late.\n  The government has an obligation to fund the settlement, which is \nsubject to court approval, and Congress must act to provide relief for \nthese claimants and do it quickly. The Black farmers have been asking \nfor stand-alone consideration of this bill. That is what I was hoping \nto get done today.\n  I have nothing against what my colleagues are doing on the Cobell \nsettlement as well.\n  I think it is fair to say that such appropriation for the Pigford \nsettlement ought to be offset.\n  There is an advocate for the Black farmers--John Boyd. I have been \nworking with him for a long period. He was working hard on this a long \ntime before I was. We should be getting this resolved for the benefit \nof the farmers but also for the advocates, those people who have been \nworking so hard finding ways to get it done. We thought now was the \nopportunity to get it done.\n  The farm bill we passed last year does one thing right: it focuses a \nconsiderable amount of resources on new and beginning farmers and \nranchers. Many of the Pigford claimants were in that same boat 20 years \nago. We have an opportunity to rectify that misjustice. We know USDA \nhas admitted the discrimination occurred. Now\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nwe are obligated to do our best getting relief to those who deserve it. \nIt is time to make these claimants right and move forward into a new \nera of civil rights in the Department of Agriculture.\n  I look forward to the time we can get this done. I plead with my \ncolleagues, as the Senator from Arkansas pleaded, to get this done \nright now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I add my voice in support of coming to \nclosure on this important issue. I thank Senator Dorgan and Senator \nLincoln for their extraordinary leadership for the Pigford and Cobell \nclaimants. We are very close to settling a grave injustice that has \ngone on in two communities, one the Native-American community and the \nother the African-American community. I surely hope we can find a way \nforward in the next few hours, before we leave, to get this done; if \nnot, that it would be one of the first orders of business when we \nreturn.\n  Explanations have been made beautifully on both sides. I represent \n1,000 African-American farmers. I am going to fight for them and \nadvocate for them and continue to bring their cases before this body \nuntil we get justice.\n  People in Louisiana generally, of many different races, understand \nsystematic injustice. Talking about oil moneys not coming the way they \nshould, there are many people in Louisiana right now shaking their \nheads in great sympathy with the stories the Senator from North Dakota \nshared with us about Native Americans.\n  I support the Pigford settlement. I support the Cobell settlement. I \nhope we can find the $5 billion, approximately, so that it does not \naffect the deficit, paid for in a responsible way to end this \ndiscrimination and to provide some hope and support to these families.\n  I was proud to send Clarence Hawkins' name to run the USDA in \nLouisiana, the first African-American administrator to do so, former \nmayor of Bastrop. The President appointed him at my suggestion. We are \nmaking some headway in Louisiana to rectify past injustices.\n  Again, I thank Senators Dorgan and Lincoln for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, Senator Barrasso and I, as chairman and \nvice chairmen of the Indian Affairs Committee, have been working on \nthis issue for a long while. Senator Kyl, Senator Baucus--we have had \ndiscussions. Senator Kyl had to leave the floor, but I believe he will \nreturn. He very much wants to find a way to resolve these issues, as do \nI and others.\n  This is not complicated. This is a case where the Federal Government \nsaid to American Indians in the late 1800s: We are going to break up \nthese tribal lands and give you personal ownership of these lands. And \nthen we will manage the lands for you and take care of it for you in \ntrust, and the income that comes off those lands will be yours. We will \nmanage your trust accounts.\n  The fact is, they took control of the lands and created trust \naccounts. And the Indians got bilked, looted. Grand theft occurred.\n  Let me show one more photograph. This fellow is still alive. His name \nis James Kennerly. He is a Blackfeet Indian, standing in front of his \nrather humble home. He is hoping that Congress will resolve this by \napproving the settlement. His father was a World War I veteran, \nwounded, disabled in combat. The family lives on land that has \nconsiderable oil and gas leases. Thousands of barrels a week were \npumped off that land. Years later, the oil wells still continue to \npump, but all the lease documents have disappeared. This family lives \nin a humble home despite having had oil interests on their property.\n  Another person waiting for justice, Johnson Martinez, a Navajo Indian \nin his seventies, lives in a rundown trailer house near Bloomfield, NM. \nHe has no running water and no electricity. At night, he builds a fire \nto keep himself and his dogs warm. He lives yards away from where the \ngas pipelines cross his family's land. He lives off the right-of-way \nfees for the gas pipeline. One month, he got a check for $80. Sometimes \nhe gets a check for a few cents. A court-appointed investigator found \nthat non-Indians were receiving 20 times more than Navajo Indians such \nas Johnson Martinez were receiving in the same circumstances.\n  And then there is Esther and Sam Valdez--Navajo Indians--they live \n100 feet from natural gas wells. They have been producing natural gas \nfor a long while. Yet this family has trouble putting food on the \ntable. They receive checks for $6 and $8. Sometimes the checks come, \nsometimes they don't. The Federal Government can never explain to them \nwhat happens to the money. This is grand theft.\n  For more than a century, American Indians were cheated. Yes, there is \nsome incompetence here. That is the comfortable word. But there is also \nlooting and theft involved in having these folks cheated.\n  The lawsuit was filed 15 years ago. Ten years ago, the Federal court \nsaid the Federal Government is completely without merit and violated \nits trust. The court found in favor of the plaintiffs, saying that they \nhave been bilked. That was 10 years ago. But, the case continued in \nFederal court with more and more money spent on lawyers.\n  Finally, at long last, Interior Secretary Salazar and Attorney \nGeneral Holder, and the plaintiffs in this case negotiated an \nagreement, and the Federal judge in the case said: This looks like \njustice to me. This settlement was sent to the Congress for approval \nand to provide the funding for this agreement.\n  I came to the floor to offer a unanimous consent request to see if at \nlong last we might put the Cobell litigation behind us and do the fair \nthing. I understand a unanimous consent request would be objected to at \nthis moment because of what is called the ``pay-for.'' So we have a \ndisagreement about that. But I also understand from discussions we have \nheld that there is the possibility and the potential that this \nafternoon we might find a way to reach agreement on the ``pay-for'' \nportion of this and have the Senate finally approve the Cobell \nsettlement, and also the Pigford settlement so that we can move beyond \non this.\n  In the situation that led to the Cobell case, there are people who \nshould hang their head in shame, many of them now departed, who have \nbilked the Indians out of so much money over so many years.\n  I would finally say this about the Cobell matter and the American \nIndians involved. This is a chart that shows the 10 poorest counties in \nAmerica, the 10 counties with the most significant poverty in our \ncountry. Madam President, 8 of the 10 counties have Indian reservations \nin them--8 of them. We know that. We know what is going on.\n  Then I talk about these people, American Indians, who live in humble \nhomes with no money, with six oil wells on their land. Somebody is \ngetting the money, but the Indians are not. Who is cheating them? Who \ncheated them a decade ago, five decades ago, ten decades ago? Will we \never settle our account here? Will this country ever deal responsibly \nwith what I call a shame?\n  Well, my colleague, Senator Barrasso, and I have worked on this a \nlong while. He has had some concern about certain aspects of the \nsettlement, but I do not think there is a disagreement between us at \nall about the need to move forward to resolve this issue. My hope is we \ncan do that very soon.\n  As I said, I was intending to seek a unanimous consent request, but I \nthink I will stop short of that at this moment because there is the \npotential, perhaps later this afternoon, for us to reach agreement on \nthe ``pay-for'' and a couple of other elements and get a unanimous \nconsent request agreed to, which would be a very significant \nachievement in this body today.\n  I know Senator Barrasso from Wyoming wishes to seek recognition. Let \nme yield the floor so that might happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work done by my \ncolleague from North Dakota and his commitment as chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee to try to come to a solution in the Cobell \nsettlement.\n  He is absolutely right. We still need to work on some policy issues, \nas well\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nas some issues in terms of how this will be paid for. He and I both \nagree we need to settle the Cobell lawsuit. There has been much \nrhetoric. We both agree we need to settle the Cobell lawsuit.\n  At the President's insistence, and the House and the Senate \nmajorities, they have repeatedly tried to get this bill enacted outside \nthe regular process. This settlement has been inserted into various \nbills over the past several months that have absolutely nothing to do \nwith American Indian issues. You ask yourself why. Well, perhaps folks \nwanted to avoid some scrutiny--scrutiny by Congress, by the press, and, \nmost of all, by those who have been most affected, the stakeholders.\n  Two weeks ago, I came to the floor and offered an amendment to \nlegislation that addressed some of the more egregious problems with the \nsettlement. I am talking policy as well as pay-for issues. The majority \nleader dismissed my amendment, and he called it the ``beat up the \nlawyers'' amendment. Well, he called it that because one of the \nprovisions in the amendment establishes a $50 million cap on \npresettlement attorneys' fees--$50 million. The settlement says it \nshould be between $50 million and $100 million. My amendment said, \nlet's keep it at that lower figure. Only in Washington, DC, would \nanyone ever call a $50 million cap on attorneys' fees--$50 million of \nattorneys' fees--as beating up the lawyers.\n  Well, because attorneys' fees were capped at $50 million, the \nmajority leader objected to both the Cobell and the Pigford \nsettlements.\n  There was and still is a good reason for that cap. Every Member of \nthis body should read a couple of op-eds on this Cobell settlement. One \nwas in the August 1 edition of The Hill, the other in today's August \n5th edition. The August 1 article: ``Cobell settlement worth doing \nright, together.'' The one from today: ``Unconscionable Cobell.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both these articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Hill's Congress Blog, Aug. 2, 2010]\n\n             Cobell Settlement Worth Doing Right, Together\n\n                          (By Kimberly Craven)\n\n       Today, the Senate will be asked to approve by unanimous \n     consent settlement of the proposed Cobell lawsuit (Cobell v. \n     Salazar). Senators are not being advised that the proposed \n     settlement is constitutionally dubious and greatly expands \n     the original litigation. It authorizes a mandatory class of \n     plaintiff with no regard to the due-process rights of \n     individuals to opt. It creates a new class to settle land and \n     natural resource mismanagement claims which were never part \n     of the original litigation and not been part of the 14-year-\n     long Cobell lawsuit which, we have been told, sought only an \n     accounting of individual Indian money (IIM) accounts.\n       If Congress approves it, the settlement will consist of two \n     classes: those of the historical accounting class and the new \n     ``un-litigated'' class--the trust mismanagement class. The \n     first class will receive $1,0oo and any traditional safe-\n     guard of opting-out will be denied this class. The new second \n     class will receive $500 and a formula based on the top 10 \n     sums that have filtered through a person's IIM account.\n       Creation of the new class has been disturbing to many \n     tribes and American Indians. The government will be \n     authorized to pay more than $3.4 billion without even filing \n     an Answer to the new Complaint of land mismanagement claims. \n     What it means is that if you're a Native person whose land \n     has been flooded or damaged, timber destroyed, mineral \n     royalties underpaid, soil poisoned, grass lands over-grazed \n     by your lessee or if you've just been the victim of trespass, \n     your claims will be settled for $500 and a formula amount \n     that bears no resemblance to actual damages or loss.\n       Many American Indians think this entire settlement, \n     although cloaked in righteous language, has been cobbled \n     together for the primary purpose of permitting the \n     Administration to fulfill a campaign promise. This settlement \n     will permit the attorneys to claim as much as $100 million in \n     attorney fees with a side agreement they are not even \n     required to document the time spent on the case for the first \n     fourteen years. Personally, I find it disturbing that one of \n     the plaintiff attorneys served on the Obama campaign, \n     transition team, and posted pictures of himself on Facebook \n     partying at the White House holiday party around the time the \n     settlement was reached, and now is rumored to be up for 10th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals nomination. The lead plaintiff has \n     been very upfront that some Indians will get hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars and is on record as saying, ``Some \n     people will be very, very rich.'' I think we know who some of \n     those people might be. The litigation was filed in a Court of \n     Equity where only an accounting (an equitable action) could \n     be ordered and money damages could not be awarded. The seven \n     attorneys will share in $100 million and the lead plaintiff \n     will also be entitled to up to $15 million in \n     ``reimbursements'' for ``repayable grants,'' surely an \n     oxymoron even in Washington-speak, plus an undisclosed amount \n     in ``incentive fees for the four lead plaintiffs.''\n       As I wrote this opinion piece, I researched elements of an \n     unfair class action lawsuit and found this information at \n     www.classactionlitigation.com/faq. Elements include ``any \n     settlement where the release being demanded as a condition of \n     the settlement is extremely overbroad and encompasses claims \n     that were neither pursued in the class complaint nor subject \n     to true adversarial litigation prior to the settlement and \n     virtual nonexistence of discovery by the class counsel who \n     proposes a settlement.'' This surely meets those thresholds \n     with no discovery, judicial record, or due process for the \n     proposed second class.\n       Both the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians and the \n     Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Association are on record as \n     wanting changes to the settlement. Sen. John Barrasso (R-\n     Wyo.) has recommended many of these changes to address the \n     fairness, restoration, due process, and other infirmities in \n     the settlement proposed today and many Indian people \n     appreciate his efforts in his leadership role as Vice \n     Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Having \n     worked for a Republican Senator, Sen. Daniel J. Evans (R-\n     Wash.), who also served in this capacity, I know firsthand \n     that Indian issues are not partisan in nature. If this is \n     worth doing to the tune of $3.4 billion, then it's worth \n     doing right together.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the The Hill's Congress Blog, Aug. 5, 2010]\n\n                         Unconscionable Cobell\n\n                        (By Richard A. Monette)\n\n       A few facts about the Cobell settlement to be voted on in \n     Senate today:\n       Number of published court opinions in the case: 80-plus;\n       Amount awarded to plaintiffs by courts at present: $0;\n       Amount to attorneys under settlement: $100 Million (through \n     Dec. 7, 2009);\n       Amount to each account holder under settlement: $1,000.00;\n       Number of accounts with less than $15: 107,806;\n       Total amount of money in accounts with less than $15 (small \n     accounts): $15,210.51;\n       Average balance in 107,806 small accounts: $7.09;\n       Total to be paid under settlement to small accounts: \n     $107,806,000.\n       The Senate is asked today to give approval, sight-unseen \n     and by unanimous consent, to a $3.4 billion ``settlement'' of \n     a 14-year-old lawsuit brought by five individuals on behalf \n     of all American Indians who have money or land held in trust \n     by the United States. $2 billion of this amount will be \n     earmarked to pre-fund an existing Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     program for 10 years. The amount awarded by the courts to \n     date after more than 10 trials is exactly zero dollars and \n     zero cents. If approved by the Congress, and subsequently by \n     the courts, the remainder of this money will be parceled out \n     by formula in the form of reparations without regard to any \n     individual's actual losses or damages.\n       The only individuals who will be permitted to present \n     actual clams are the attorneys and the five named individual \n     plaintiffs. The five named plaintiffs are authorized up to \n     $15 million as ``reimbursements'' for ``repayable grants,'' \n     plus an undisclosed amount as ``incentive fee awards.'' The \n     lawyers will be authorized to claim up to $100 million off \n     the top, plus their ``normal hourly rates'' for as long as it \n     takes to settle up with some 300,000 individuals, more than \n     83,000 of whose whereabouts are unknown. Much smaller mass \n     settlement awards have taken more than 10 years to close out.\n       More than 100,000 of these individuals have account \n     balances of less than $15. Each of them will receive a check \n     for $1,000, or an amount more than 6,600 percent of their \n     current balance. Those individuals with more than $1 million \n     in their accounts will receive $1,000 also, or less than one-\n     tenth of 1 percent of their current balances. There is \n     neither rhyme nor reason to this scheme.\n       The $2 billion, pre-funded BIA program completely usurps \n     the authority of the Appropriations Committees for 10 years. \n     This settlement also confers jurisdiction on a federal \n     district court that does not presently have it; rewrites the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for this case to authorize \n     the court to exercise the conferred jurisdiction; and \n     presents the court not with a case or controversy as required \n     by Article III of the Constitution, but with a pre-packaged \n     financial program simply to administer. The sponsor of this \n     measure in the Senate stated that no other committee (i.e., \n     Judiciary) needs to review this measure before it is \n     presented for a vote.\n       Proponents claim this settlement will ``turn the page'' on \n     a dark chapter. Some who are familiar with the litigating \n     history beyond this case of the lead counsel and lead \n     plaintiff think this settlement is more likely only to fuel a \n     war chest for subsequent, similarly entrepreneurial and \n     extortionate litigation. No senator should think this \n     settlement approximates ``justice'' that has somehow escaped \n     the attention of the federal\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\n     judges who have actually presided over the 14-year history of \n     this case.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. So there are issues of policy dealing with \ntransparency, dealing with the production of records by the attorneys \nwho are involved in this. When you read one of these editorials, the \none in today's Hill, ``Unconscionable Cobell,'' written by a law \nprofessor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:\n\n       Number of published court opinions in the case: 80-plus\n       Amount awarded to plaintiffs by courts at present: $0\n       Amount to attorneys under settlement: $100 Million. . . .\n       Amount to each account holder under [this] settlement:\n\n  We are talking now about those who have been affected by this--\n\n     $1,000.00\n\n  What an incredible disparity.\n  Well, if we were all to take the time to look through these two \neditorials, the changes to the settlement I have been proposing would \nnot only seem reasonable, they would be absolutely necessary. They \npoint out several real problems with the settlement, including the way \nthe attorneys' fees are handled. I am continuing to work with my \ncolleagues on dealing with that. These are the blunt facts.\n  So I agree with my colleague from North Dakota, the problems with the \nCobell settlement are by no means insurmountable. They can and they \nmust be resolved. In fact, I do not think it would be difficult to \nresolve the differences we have regarding the Cobell settlement. We can \nsit down, and we plan to do that, to discuss the issues directly. I \nthink we can get beyond this impasse, and that is what I am committed \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, I intend to withhold the \nunanimous consent request because it would clearly be objected to. \nThere are some people who disagree with the method by which this \nsettlement would be paid for.\n  But I also wish to mention that I have some hope that later today, \nfinally at long last, we may be able to come to the floor of the Senate \nwith an agreement that would be able to withstand the unanimous consent \nrequest. If we do that before we break, we would have resolved a very \nlongstanding issue, not just 15 years of litigation, or a century of \nmismanagement, but also since last December, when this agreement was \nreached and the Congress was given time to approve it, but then that \ndeadline had to be extended six times. At long last, perhaps we will be \nable to decide we can do this together.\n  I very much appreciate the work Senator Barrasso is doing and Senator \nKyl and Senator Baucus and others. My hope is that later this afternoon \nI will be able to come to the floor with such a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Pigford II \nsettlement pending full action by the U.S. Senate.\n  We all know that farming is a difficult occupation. The hours are \nlong, the weather is unpredictable, and the challenge of competing in a \nglobal marketplace is intense. Tens of thousands of Black farmers have \nhad to face all those normal challenges. Tragically, they have also had \nto deal with a challenge that was unique to them based solely on race. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, was discriminating against \nthem.\n  More than 12 years ago, Black farmers across America brought a class \naction suit against the USDA for racial discrimination. The history of \nthat discrimination is a sad one, and it is well documented. Farmers, \nlike all businesses, need access to loans. They need to borrow money \nfor expensive equipment and they need funding to help them when \ndroughts strike or when markets collapse. The Congress has recognized \nthis need for decades, and we have established special loan programs in \nthe USDA to support these special needs. But when it came to lending, \ntens of thousands of Black farmers were the victims of systemic \ndiscrimination. During the 1980s and 1990s, the average processing time \nfor a loan application by White farmers was 30 days; the average time \nfor a loan application by Black farmers was 387 days. Black farmers had \nto wait 12 times as long to receive a loan. This discrimination earned \nthe USDA the regrettable nickname ``the Last Plantation.''\n  Black farmers finally sought justice through a class action lawsuit \nin 1997. More than 20,000 farmers initiated claims citing racial \ndiscrimination in the USDA farm loan programs. Two years after the \naction was initiated, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia entered a consent decree approving a class action settlement \nto compensate these farmers for years of racial discrimination by the \nUSDA. Each farmer who could prove discrimination was entitled to \ndamages. Out of the initial 20,000 farmers, 15,000 were meritorious in \nthe claims they brought.\n  As the legal process continued, additional farmers began to join the \nclass action and filed their own claims. Approximately 80,000 farmers \neventually brought claims. Unfortunately, many of these farmers did not \nknow about the class action suit, and by the time they learned of its \nexistence, the filing deadline had passed.\n  In 2008, Congress recognizing the injustice of stopping 80 percent or \nmore of the farmers who potentially suffered discrimination by our \ngovernment--decided to take action and created a new cause of action \nfor farmers previously denied access to justice. In the 2008 farm bill, \nwith bipartisan support, Congress included $100 million for payments \nand debt relief as a downpayment to satisfy the claims filed by \ndeserving claimants denied participation in the original settlement \nbecause of timeliness issues.\n  After years of litigation and negotiation between the Department of \nJustice, which represented the USDA, and lawyers for the farmers, a \nsettlement was finally reached in February 2010. The Pigford II \nsettlement agreement will provide $1.25 billion, which is contingent on \nappropriation by Congress, to African-American farmers who can show \nthey suffered racial discrimination in USDA farm loan programs. Once \nthe money is appropriated farmers can pursue their individual claims \nthrough the same nonjudicial process used in the first case.\n  To address this funding need, President Obama included $1.15 billion \nin additional funding for his fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 \nbudgets. Both Chambers of Congress have worked to pass appropriations \nto fulfill the settlement agreement since February. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed funding language for the Pigford case twice; \nonce as part of the war supplemental and the other on a tax extenders \nbill. But the Senate has not been able to do the same. Despite the \nmajority leader's efforts in finding ways to pay for the legislation \nand move the legislation for full Senate consideration, we have been \nunable to proceed to a rollcall vote. This bill has come before the \nSenate a half dozen times. There are no known objections to the \nsettlement, yet we have failed to pass the funding therefore denying \nthe process for funding to these farmers who were discriminated against \nby our own government.\n  We must move to appropriate these funds. The settlement that was \nreached is only valid until August 18, 2010. Failure to appropriate the \nmoney by then could cause the agreement to be voided. William Gladstone \nonce said that ``justice delayed is justice denied.'' Let us not be in \nthe business of delaying and denying justice for African-American \nfarmers. Let us be in the business of allowing the justice system to \nwork and provide them with adequate redress. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think my friends and colleagues on the \nother side have blocked out some time. If they would not mind, I would \nbe very grateful if I could take 5 or 6 minutes to make some comments \nabout the Kagan nomination. I see heads nodding affirmatively, so I \nappreciate it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6803-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6803-S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME \n                  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to executive session \nto\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nconsider the following nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Elena Kagan, of \nMassachusetts, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my very \nstrong support for the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to \nserve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I would like \nto thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions for their work \nduring the Judiciary Committee's recent hearings, as well as Majority \nLeader Reid for moving Solicitor General Kagan's nomination through the \nSenate confirmation process as he has.\n  There are very few powers exercised by this body that are more \nimportant than its constitutionally mandated duty to give advice and \nconsent on the President's judicial nominations. The very essence of \nour Nation's government rests on the supremacy of the rule of law, and \nthe Constitution is the highest embodiment of that principle. The men \nand women whom we confirm to this Court are more than just judges. As \nthe chief interpreters of that seminal document, the Constitution, they \nare guardians of the supremacy of the rule of law, upon which the \nintegrity of our entire system of justice has been built.\n  It is, therefore, no surprise that nominees to our Nation's highest \nCourt are subjected to such an intense level of scrutiny during the \nSenate's confirmation process. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not \nlay out a precise roadmap for how to do this. Therefore, each Senator \nmust decide for him or herself what criteria to use when evaluating the \nmerits of an individual Supreme Court nominee.\n  For my part, I have used the same, simple three-part test for Supreme \nCourt nominees since 1981, when I voted to confirm Sandra Day O'Connor \nas the Court's first female Justice. Indeed, this is the 13th Supreme \nCourt nomination I have considered during my 30-year tenure in the \nSenate--from Justice O'Connor to Elena Kagan today.\n  First, does the nominee have the technical competence and legal \nexperience to do the job of a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court?\n  Second, does the nominee have the proper character and temperament to \nserve on the High Court?\n  Third, does the nominee's record demonstrate respect for and \nadherence to the principles underlying our legal system--that of equal \njustice under the law?\n  For anyone who has read about her life or watched her performance \nduring the confirmation hearings held by the Judiciary Committee \nearlier this summer, I believe it is abundantly clear that Elena Kagan \npasses all three of these tests with flying colors.\n  On the question of Solicitor General Kagan's competency and \nexperience, I think there is little doubt that we are dealing with a \nsuperbly qualified nominee.\n  Since her graduation from Harvard Law School in 1986, Elena Kagan has \nenjoyed an illustrious legal and academic career.\n  After her graduation, Solicitor General Kagan had the honor of \nclerking for two extremely distinguished and highly influential Federal \njudges: U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit \njudge Abner Mikva, with whom I served in the House of Representatives, \nand has been a great friend of mine for many years; and Thurgood \nMarshall, the Nation's first African-American Supreme Court Justice.\n  Subsequently, after nearly a decade of legal work in the private \nsector, as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and as \nan Associate Counsel in the White House under the administration of \nPresident Clinton, Ms. Kagan returned to her prestigious alma mater, \nserving first as a professor of law and then as dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  In an auspicious return to public service, Elena Kagan became the \nFederal Government's chief lawyer before the Supreme Court last year \nwhen she was confirmed by this body as our Nation's 45th Solicitor \nGeneral--a position often referred to, I might add, as the Court's \n``10th Justice'' because of the extensive legal knowledge and close \nworking relationship with the Federal bench it requires.\n  I realize some of my colleagues have questioned Solicitor General \nKagan's nomination because of her lack of judicial experience--that \nbecause Solicitor General Kagan has never been a judge in either a \nState or Federal court she cannot be an effective Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  I would, however, gently remind my colleagues that there is \nabsolutely no constitutional requirement that a Supreme Court nominee \nhave served previously as a judge. In fact, there is no requirement to \nbe a lawyer to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Since \nour country's founding, well over one-third of the 111 individuals who \nhave served on our Nation's highest Court never put on a judge's robe \nbefore their confirmation.\n  Indeed, William Rehnquist, who served as Chief Justice from 1986 \nuntil his death in 2005, had no prior work experience as a judge when \nhe was first appointed to the Court by President Nixon in 1971.\n  Nor did Justice Robert Jackson, a very close and dear personal friend \nof my father who served with him at the Nuremberg Trials in 1945 and \n1946. Robert Jackson served as U.S. Attorney General under Franklin \nRoosevelt before being appointed to the Supreme Court in 1941.\n  I would, therefore, submit to my colleagues that there are other \nimportant measures of the quality of a Supreme Court nominee besides \nthe depth of his or her experience on the bench. Solicitor General \nKagan's impressive list of career accomplishments and extensive base of \nlegal knowledge will, I believe, hopefully put those unfounded doubts \nover her experience to rest.\n  Moving on to the two remaining parts of my test, Elena Kagan once \nagain proves she would make an excellent addition to our Nation's \nhighest Court.\n  As to her character, her graceful performance before the Judiciary \nCommittee and extensive list of enthusiastic recommendations from \nDemocrats, Republicans, and others across the entire spectrum reveal \nher to be a person of the utmost integrity, professionalism, and sound \njudgment. They also reveal, I think, a key aspect of her legal \nphilosophy--a deep and abiding respect for the rule of law and our \nNation's cherished principle of equality under the law.\n  As I said previously, Supreme Court Justices are not just judges, \nthey are stalwarts of our Nation's democratic values, guardians of the \nidea that the rule of law should always transcend the rule of men. Each \nof the Federal judicial nominees confirmed in this body has the ability \nto shape every facet of the law and, in a larger sense, American \nsociety in general. As a result, it is absolutely critical, in my view, \nthat we have members of the Supreme Court whose first obligation, above \nall else, is to safeguard those guiding constitutional principles that \nform the foundation of our democratic system of government and to fight \nfor the principle of equal justice under law.\n  I firmly believe that, when confirmed, Solicitor General Kagan will \nhew closely to those critically important values and work to ensure \nthey are protected.\n  Once again, I wish to thank Chairman Leahy, our colleague Senator \nSessions, the ranking minority member, and the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who I think gave her a very fair, competent, and thorough \nhearing during the nomination process. I also wish to commend Majority \nLeader Reid for his hard work during this process. I urge my colleagues \nto join those of us who believe this is a quality nominee who will \nserve our country well as an Associate Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side for giving me \na few minutes to express my views on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to participate \nin a colloquy with a number of my Senate colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we wish to enter into a discussion this\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\nafternoon about a very critical issue in this confirmation process, and \nthat is the second amendment and the right to keep and bear arms as \nprovided for in our Constitution; the threat that now exists to that \nright that is plainly stated in the Constitution, and why we think it \nis worthy of serious consideration.\n  I will say that most Americans are totally unaware, perhaps, that the \nsecond amendment and the power of the second amendment hangs by a mere \nthread. Two five-to-four decisions recently have affirmed the second \namendment, but had that vote been different--one Justice voting a \ndifferent way--the second amendment would not apply to the District of \nColumbia. It would not be considered a right that would apply even to a \nFederal Government entity such as the District of Columbia as a result \nof the Heller case.\n  A more recent case in Chicago, McDonald v. the City of Chicago, dealt \nwith whether the second amendment actually applies to the States and \ndoes it only apply to the Federal Government. That was a big deal. If \nit does not apply to the States, then any State in any city--and many \ncities are perfectly willing to do this--would have the power to ban \nfirearms entirely, even though the Constitution plainly says you have \nthe right to keep and bear arms. This was the effect of that decision.\n  I see my colleague Senator Wicker from Mississippi here. I wish to \nask him if he would share with us: Does he believe Ms. Kagan's record \nwould provide us any insight into her views on the second amendment? \nBecause she would be one of the votes that would be critical as we go \nforward in the future as to whether that amendment still has power and \nforce.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the ranking member for that question. I would \nanswer: Yes, indeed, her record, taken together with her committee \ntestimony, tells us a lot about Ms. Kagan's insight and feelings about \nthe second amendment.\n  Let me agree with my colleague from Connecticut, however, and say I \ndon't believe it is necessary for someone to have judicial experience \nto be an effective member of the Supreme Court. Clearly that is not \ncalled for in the Constitution. However, in a situation such as this, \nwhere the nominee has never written a judicial opinion of her own, \nwhere she has hardly any experience at all in the courtroom, I do think \nit is appropriate--and actually necessary--for us to examine her life \nexperience and see what insights we can gain on her views on the second \namendment.\n  I would also say this: The debate is drawing to a close. The issue is \nprobably not in doubt, but I think we owe it to the Record, we owe it \nto our constituents, we owe it to the American people to outline our \nconcerns with regard to the second amendment to the Constitution, to \nthe second article in the Bill of Rights. So I ask my colleagues to \nindulge me by going through some of the life experiences this nominee \nhas.\n  Ms. Kagan began her law career clerking for a very antigun judge, \nAbner Mikva, who later brought Ms. Kagan to the White House to serve as \nhis deputy. Judge Mikva once likened the National Rifle Association to \n``a street crime lobby.''\n  Next, Ms. Kagan's own hostility to the second amendment rights became \nevident during her time as a law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall \nwhere as a clerk she wrote that she was ``not sympathetic'' to the \nargument that the DC handgun ban violated an individual's second \namendment rights. This is disappointing and troubling. In this memo she \ndidn't cite text, precedent, or analyze the law or look to the \nConstitution. Ms. Kagan inserted her personal beliefs and said: I am \nnot sympathetic to this individual right argument.\n  The case that comment involved was Lee Sandidge. A business owner was \narrested and convicted in the District of Columbia for possessing \nammunition and an unregistered pistol without a license. The law \nprovided up to 10 years in jail for this offense. Mr. Sandidge's second \namendment claim--the one that Ms. Kagan was not sympathetic toward--\nchallenged the very same DC total gun ban that was struck down later by \nthe Supreme Court in the Heller decision. Ms. Kagan's lack of sympathy \nfor Sandidge's claim demonstrates she failed to recognize that we have \nan individual right as citizens to bear arms. I am very pleased that \nthe Supreme Court has now recognized this on two occasions, in Heller \nas well as this year, in 2010, in McDonald.\n  Then Ms. Kagan embarked on what can only be described as a quest \nagainst gun ownership and second amendment rights during her years in \nthe Clinton White House. She worked extensively on gun issues during \nPresident Clinton's administration which was well known for such gun \ncontrol efforts. The record leaves no doubt that Ms. Kagan was a key \nplayer in shaping Clinton White House restrictive gun policies. During \nthose years, she coauthored policy memos that advocated increased \nrestrictions on lawful gun owners, including legislation requiring \nbackground checks for all secondary market gun purchases, a gun tracing \ninitiative, and a call for a new gun design ``that can be shot only by \nauthorized adults.'' According to the records of the Clinton \nPresidential Library, Ms. Kagan also drafted an Executive Order \nrestricting the importation of certain semiautomatic rifles that were \nnot covered by statute. In other words, she authored an Executive Order \nthat went beyond the statute in her quest against gun ownership.\n  At the time of the import ban, a senior staffer who worked in the \nClinton domestic policy shop that was run by Ms. Kagan, described the \nadministration's plan as follows: ``We are taking the law and bending \nit as far as it can to capture a whole new class of guns.'' This was \nthe office our nominee ran during that administration.\n  In addition, Ms. Kagan appears to have been in charge of the Domestic \nPolicy Council's effort to respond to the Supreme Court's 1997 ruling \nin Printz v. the United States. The Printz case struck down parts of \nthe 1994 Brady handgun law on tenth amendment grounds. According to the \nClinton Library, even after the Supreme Court had ruled, the Clinton \nadministration, with Ms. Kagan involved, worked to preserve \nunconstitutional provisions considered in many legislative and \nexecutive branch responses to the Court's decision.\n  I would reiterate what my friend from Alabama has said. The right of \nevery American--the individual right we have to keep and bear arms \nunder the second amendment to the Constitution--hangs by a single vote, \nand I am concerned that personal sympathies and a strong record of \nopposition to the second amendment would influence the way this person \nwould act as a judge.\n  But there is one other thing, and I wish to ask my friend from Nevada \nabout this. During her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Ms. \nKagan stated she had never had an occasion to look at the history on \nwhich Heller is based, and, therefore, she could not say whether she \nbelieved there is a preexisting individual, fundamental right to keep \nand bear arms.\n  Here is a talented and intelligent and articulate and brilliant law \nstudent and law professor and staffer who worked extensively on the \nissue of second amendment rights for years, and she taught \nconstitutional law at one of the most prestigious institutions in this \ncountry, yet she stated in her testimony that she had never had \noccasion to look at the history on which this was based and, therefore, \nshe could not say whether there was a fundamental right to keep and \nbear arms. I think her credibility was quite damaged by that statement.\n  I ask my friend Senator Ensign whether he was surprised when Ms. \nKagan made that statement based on her extensive experience and \ninteraction involving this issue?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. As a matter of fact, I was surprised. I think she did a \nreal disservice to her prior employers, Justice Marshall, President \nClinton, by not studying the history of the second amendment before she \nprovided them with legal advice. I also think she did a disservice to \nher students, one that a professor of constitutional law should \nunderstand.\n  Ms. Kagan confirmed the importance of studying founding documents \nwhen interpreting second amendment rights when she said during her \nSolicitor General hearing:\n\n       The individual rights view and the collective rights view \n     present cogent and sometimes powerful arguments. And I have \n     come\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n     away thinking that immersion in the primary sources, which I \n     have never attempted, would be necessary to choose between \n     them with any degree of confidence.\n\n  That is what she said. She confirmed this when I met with her as \nwell. Yet the choice between the individual and collective rights view \nwas crucial to her work for Justice Marshall in the Sandidge case and \nwas certainly important to her work during the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator from Nevada yield for a question on \nthat?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I heard my colleague say--and I would be interested in \nhaving him confirm--didn't Ms. Kagan teach constitutional law and would \nit not have been appropriate at that time for her to have looked at the \nFounding Fathers' intent on the second amendment?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. As a matter of fact, she did teach constitutional law. I \nsuspect that in the course of her career, she came to understand where \nthe Founders included these words in the second amendment in the Bill \nof Rights:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  I don't think there was a lack of time or certainly a lack of ability \nto find this source material, but I suspect it may be more of her \nunwillingness to accept and ultimately admit that the Constitution and \nthe second amendment run contrary to her political beliefs. I find this \nextremely troubling.\n  I also think it shows this nominee's tendency to rely on her own \npersonal beliefs and to read these into her decisions instead of the \nintent of the Framers of the Constitution.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it is \ntroubling--very troubling, and maybe even telling--that the President \nwould ask us to confirm an individual who admittedly has not reviewed \nthe justification for the second amendment in the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I think my friend from South Dakota makes an excellent \nobservation. This admission of her failure to study the history \nsurrounding the second amendment is also in stark contrast to her \nemphasis on the importance of students studying international law at \nHarvard Law School.\n  When Solicitor General Kagan became dean of the Harvard Law School, \nshe spearheaded a sweeping overhaul of the academic curriculum to \nrequire law students to take an international and comparative law \ncourse during their first year.\n  When asked, ``What specific subjects or legal trends would you like \n[Harvard] to reflect?'' she responded:\n\n       First and foremost, international law. . . . we should be \n     making clear to our students the great importance of \n     knowledge about other legal systems throughout the world. For \n     21st century law schools, the future lies in international \n     and comparative law, and this is what law schools today ought \n     to be focusing on.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       Our goal, then, has been to . . . better equip graduates to \n     be proactive and creative problem solvers . . . to work with \n     a global perspective, whether the particular problem involves \n     a local contract dispute, or an international treaty.\n\n  Thanks to Dean Kagan, international law is a required course at \nHarvard Law School for first-year law students. However, constitutional \nlaw--U.S. constitutional law--is not only not a first-year \nrequirement--in fact, somebody graduating from Harvard Law School can \ngraduate without ever taking U.S. constitutional law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, this is a troubling thing. \nJustice Scalia has been a fierce critic of this, pointing out: What \ncountry do you pick? Do judges get to pick their own?\n  It seems to me, from what the Senator said, it is clear that the \nPresident's nominee to our highest Court in the United States has felt \nthat the world of international law is more important than studying our \nown Constitution.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is the way it appears to me. This is another example \nof where her personal beliefs come in to affect the way she is going to \nbe as a judicial activist.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. I think we must study what our Constitution \nsays, what the people who wrote it meant, and what rights the people \nretained for themselves when they created it and gave certain limited \nrights to the Federal Government. I do believe the history of the \nsecond amendment is important. What is the history surrounding the \nfounding of our country and the drafting of the second amendment?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am glad the Senator from Alabama asked that critical \nquestion. I think it is so important for Americans, people in this \nbody, but especially our Supreme Court Justices, to understand.\n  We have to remember that the founding generation had just finished \nfighting the Revolution against a tyrannical government. They knew the \ntrue value of having an armed citizen population.\n  Thomas Paine wrote in ``Thoughts on Defensive War'' in 1775:\n\n       Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, \n     and preserve order in the world, as well as property. . . . \n     Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of \n     the use of them.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson once said in a 1787 letter to William Smith:\n\n       And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers \n     are not warned from time to time that this people preserve \n     the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. . . .\n\n  Patrick Henry said:\n\n       Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing \n     degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own \n     defense? Where is the difference between having our arms \n     under our own possession and under our own direction, and \n     having them under the management of Congress? If our defense \n     be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can \n     they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, \n     as in our own hands?\n\n  In fact, if you only take a cursory look at the 20th century, every \nsingle government that has perpetrated genocide has first disarmed its \ncitizens. It is my understanding that every known dictator who has come \nto power has followed this course.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, did our Founding Fathers actually know this? What \nwas their intent with regard to preserving the right to keep and bear \narms when this language went into the Constitution?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I know that our Founders certainly looked at writings of \nprominent philosophers when debating the importance of the right to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  William Blackstone, whom the Supreme Court has called the \n``preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,'' \ncited the right to keep and bear arms as ``one of the fundamental \nrights of Englishmen,'' calling it ``the natural right of resistance \nand self-preservation--the right of having and using arms for self-\npreservation and defense.''\n  Judge St. George Tucker, who wrote the first commentary on the \nConstitution in 1803, describes the second amendment as ``the true \npalladium of liberty.''\n  He continued:\n\n       The right to self-defence is the first law of nature: in \n     most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine \n     the right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever \n     standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to \n     keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext \n     whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, \n     is on the brink of destruction.\n\n  Judge Tucker also said:\n\n       If, for example, a law passed by congress, prohibiting the \n     free exercise of religion . . . or abridging the freedom of \n     speech, or of the press; or the right of the people to \n     assemble peaceably, or to keep and bear arms; it would, in \n     any of these cases be the province of the judiciary to \n     pronounce whether any such act were constitutional. . . . The \n     judiciary, therefore, is the department of the government to \n     whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \n     constitution especially, confided, interposing its shield \n     between him and the sword of usurped authority, the darts \n     of oppression, and the safety of faction and violence.\n\n  I would like to ask my colleague from Mississippi, what did Ms. Kagan \nsay about this natural right of self-defense?\n  Mr. WICKER. I simply look to her own testimony. I think it is \ntroubling--particularly for a law professor and somebody who dealt with \nthe issue for decades--when asked at her hearing whether she personally \nbelieves there was a right to self-defense that existed before the \nConstitution, she said she ``didn't have a view of what are natural \nindependent of the Constitution.''\n  Maybe Solicitor General Kagan was tired by that time. Maybe she had \nbeen told by her handlers--the people at the Department of Justice--\nthat it is best\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\nto simply not answer that. But I say to my colleagues, we are endowed \nby our Creator with certain inalienable rights. We don't get them from \nthe Constitution. Those rights are there. Certain rights are \nenumerated, including the second amendment rights, in the Constitution. \nFor a Justice of the Supreme Court not to understand that causes me \nproblems, and it causes me to think that she just doesn't have a very \nwell-founded view of the second amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Well, I think her statement was shocking. It also proves \nshe doesn't believe the second amendment codifies the preexisting \nnatural right to self-defense.\n  Her statement is in stark contrast with the belief of our Founders, \nwho fervently believed that the right to keep and bear arms was a \nnatural right. Our Founders discussed natural rights in one of the \nfounding documents, the Declaration of Independence:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  Yet Ms. Kagan doesn't ``have a view of what are natural rights \nindependent of the Constitution.'' The failure to recognize the natural \nright to self-defense as articulated by our Founders and expressed in \nthe Bill of Rights, I believe, is deeply disturbing.\n  The Constitution doesn't create these inalienable rights, as the \nSenator from Mississippi said. It recognizes and protects these rights \nthat are considered bestowed upon us by our Creator.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senator is correct. The phrase ``a right of the \npeople'' is used two other times in the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights--in the first amendment's assembly and petition clause, the \nfourth amendment's search and seizure clause, and a very similar phrase \nis used in the ninth amendment, where the Founders stated that ``the \nenumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be \nconstrued to deny or disparage others retained by the people.''\n  In all three instances, the Framers were referring to individual \nrights and not to collective rights. Nowhere in the Constitution does a \n``right'' attributed to ``the people'' refer to anything but an \nindividual right. It is the same with the second amendment.\n  This has been affirmed in the Heller case. Judge Sotomayor, when \ntestifying before us, said she thought that was settled law. The \ndecision this year, in which she dissented, makes me wonder about that, \nand it gives me grave concern, with a 5-to-4 Court, about what might \nhappen to precedent and what I believe now is settled law.\n  Let me ask the ranking member, during Ms. Kagan's hearing, she was \nquestioned about her statement that she believes precedent trumps \noriginal intent. What does this mean with regard to the second \namendment rights, based on the pre-Heller precedent?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is a troubling statement. I think, clearly, it \nallows her to justify voting--if confirmed to the Supreme Court--to \neviscerate the second amendment. There are some earlier cases before \nthe 14th amendment was even passed, or before the first 10 amendments, \nthe Bill of Rights, were applied to the States in any systematic way \nthat you could rely on as precedent, which could indeed trump, in her \nwords, the original intent of the Constitution.\n  What did the people ratify? They ratified the Constitution that, in \nfact, just before the Founders signed it, they said ``we do ordain and \nestablish this Constitution for the United States''--not some other \njudicial opinion 100 years later.\n  I think it raises troubling questions about where she stands on that. \nIn the light of Heller and McDonald, which were razor-thin 5-to-4 \ndecisions, made within the last 2\\1/2\\ years, we have to acknowledge \nthat the Supreme Court is not, with clarity, committed to the plain \napplication of the second amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might ask the Senator from Alabama this--because he \nis the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. I know he has dealt \nwith numerous nominees to the Supreme Court in the past, as well as \nprobably hundreds of other judicial nominees. Does the Senator recall \nhow often those nominees had a record on second amendment rights?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, most nominees have not had a record on it, but it \nis interesting, and perhaps noteworthy, that President Obama, who \nhimself has not been a strong supporter of the second amendment rights, \nand many of his supporters and Cabinet members are openly hostile to \nit, the two nominees for the Supreme Court he has submitted, Justice \nSotomayor and Kagan, have had records that indicate a hostility to it. \nEven though Judge Sotomayor, in her testimony, indicated she considered \nthis settled law--the Heller decision--her decision less than a year \nlater in the Chicago McDonald case, on a similar but somewhat different \nissue, was not consistent with the belief that the Supreme Court had \nsettled the question in Heller. So this was a troubling thing. I think \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, has argued very \nvociferously to restrict gun rights.\n  This is the top law enforcement officer in the country. I do believe \nthis is a matter of some concern, in fact, that we may be moving into a \nperiod in which the government, the big city in Washington, the elites \nwho control this, who come out of an environment where they are not \ncomfortable with guns, are oblivious and insensitive to the right that \nI believe was critical to our Founders in ratifying the Constitution. \nThey wanted to know that they had a right to keep and bear arms, and it \nwas important to them that the right was in the Constitution.\n  I ask Senator Thune, have any of the outside groups that are \nconcerned about these issues spoken out about this nomination?\n  Mr. THUNE. They have. I simply say to my colleague from Alabama, in \nhis remarks he noted the pattern we are starting to see that exists \nwith regard to--the Senator from Alabama mentioned the Attorney General \nof this administration and their nominees to the Supreme Court. What \nthat has done is galvanized those at the grassroots level who are very \nconcerned about what they see happening and how it might threaten and \nput in danger the second amendment right that many of them have enjoyed \nand believe is something that ought to be protected in the future--it \nought to be protected by the Supreme Court, it ought to be protected by \nthe Congress, it ought to be protected by the President of the United \nStates.\n  We see some of these grassroots people who are concerned about this \nissue give voice to their concerns through organizations such as the \nNRA, for example, and Gun Owners of America. I wish to point out, if I \nmay, that both of these organizations have written letters in \nopposition to Ms. Kagan's nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Rifle Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                        Fairfax, VA, July 1, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: We are \n     writing to announce the National Rifle Association's position \n     on the confirmation of Solicitor General Elena Kagan as \n     Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       Other than declaring war, neither house of Congress has a \n     more solemn responsibility than the Senate's role in \n     confirming justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. As the Senate \n     considers the nomination of Solicitor General Kagan, \n     Americans have been watching to see whether this nominee--if \n     confirmed--would respect the Second Amendment or side with \n     those who have declared war on the rights of America's 80 \n     million gun owners.\n       During confirmation hearings, judicial nominees make \n     carefully crafted statements regarding issues with which they \n     do not personally agree. They often speak in terms of \n     ``settled law'' or ``I understand the right''. When those \n     statements are contradicted by an entire body of work over a \n     nominee's career, however, it would be foolhardy to simply \n     take them at face value. In Ms. Kagan's own words, ``you can \n     look to my whole life as to what kind of justice I would \n     be.'' We agree.\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\n       As she has no judicial record on which we can rely, we have \n     only her political record to review. And throughout her \n     political career, she has repeatedly demonstrated a clear \n     hostility to the fundamental, individual right to keep and \n     bear arms guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.\n       As a clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, Ms. Kagan said \n     she was ``not sympathetic'' to a challenge to Washington, \n     D.C.'s ban on handguns and draconian registration \n     requirements. As domestic policy advisor in the Clinton White \n     House, a colleague described her as ``immersed'' in President \n     Clinton's gun control policy efforts. For example, she was \n     involved in an effort to ban more than 50 types of commonly-\n     owned semi-automatic firearms--an effort that was described \n     as: ``taking the law and bending it as far as we can to \n     capture a whole new class of guns.'' And as U.S. Solicitor \n     General, she chose not to file a brief last year in the \n     landmark case McDonald v. Chicago, thus taking the position \n     that incorporating the Second Amendment and applying it to \n     the States was of no interest to the Obama Administration or \n     the federal government. These are not the positions of a \n     person who supports the Second Amendment.\n       During her confirmation hearings last year, Justice Sonia \n     Sotomayor repeatedly stated that the Supreme Court's historic \n     Heller decision was ``settled law''. Even further, in \n     response to a question from Chairman Leahy, she said ``I \n     understand the individual right fully that the Supreme Court \n     recognized in Heller.'' Yet last Monday in McDonald, she \n     joined a dissenting opinion which stated: ``I can find \n     nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, or \n     underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it as \n     `fundamental' insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and \n     bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes''.\n       We would also note that both Heller and McDonald were 5-4 \n     decisions. The fact that four justices would effectively \n     write the Second Amendment out of the Constitution is \n     completely unacceptable. Ms. Kagan has repeatedly declined to \n     say whether she agrees with the dissenting views of justices \n     Stevens, Breyer, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, which leaves \n     unanswered the very serious questions of whether she would \n     vote to overturn Heller and McDonald or narrow their holdings \n     to a practical nullity.\n       This nation was founded on a set of fundamental freedoms. \n     Our Constitution does not give us those freedoms--it \n     guarantees and protects them. The right to defend ourselves \n     and our loved ones is one of those. The fundamental, \n     individual right to keep and bear arms is another. These \n     truths are what define us as Americans.\n       Any individual who does not believe that the Second \n     Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does not \n     respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve \n     on any court, much less receive a lifetime appointment to the \n     highest court in the land. Justice Sotomayor's blatant \n     reversal on this critical issue requires that we look beyond \n     statements made during confirmation hearings and examine a \n     nominee's entire body of work. Unfortunately, Ms. Kagan's \n     record on the Second Amendment gives us no confidence that if \n     confirmed to the Court, she will faithfully defend the \n     fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms of law-\n     abiding Americans.\n       For these reasons, the National Rifle Association has no \n     choice but to oppose the confirmation of Solicitor General \n     Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the importance \n     of this issue, this vote will be considered in NRA's future \n     candidate evaluations.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns. Should you \n     have any questions or wish to discuss further, please do not \n     hesitate to call on us personally.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne LaPierre,\n       Executive Vice President, NRA.\n     Chris Cox,\n       Executive Director, NRA-ILA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Gun Owners of America,\n\n                                  Springfield, VA, August 5, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: You will soon vote on the confirmation of \n     Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       During her confirmation hearings, Kagan ducked and dodged \n     questions about the Second Amendment and refused to declare \n     whether she believes the Second Amendment protects an \n     individual right.\n       Kagan insisted that the Supreme Court decisions in Heller \n     and McDonald should be treated as precedent and ``settled \n     law,'' but this in no way precludes her from ruling that \n     almost any gun law--including gun owner registration, \n     purchasing limits, waiting periods, private sale background \n     checks, and more--is consistent with the Constitution.\n       Recall the confirmation hearings of Sonia Sotomayor, the \n     newest Supreme Court Justice. Sotomayor assured the Senate, \n     and the American people, that she accepted the Court's ruling \n     in Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual \n     right.\n       Yet, in the McDonald case, Sotomayor joined the dissent in \n     writing that ``I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's \n     text, history, or underlying rationale that could warrant \n     characterizing it as `fundamental' insofar as it seeks to \n     protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-\n     defense purposes.''\n       Ms. Kagan has made the same promises to the Senate, but the \n     available evidence portrays her as a forceful advocate of \n     restrictive gun laws and as a person driven by political \n     considerations rather than the rule of law.\n       While Ms. Kagan does not have a record of judicial \n     opinions, her views on the Second Amendment are no mystery. \n     Some considerations that have come to light since her \n     nomination include:\n       While serving in the Clinton administration, Ms. Kagan \n     drafted an executive order to ban certain semi-automatic \n     firearms;\n       Ms. Kagan suggested that the President could issue another \n     executive order--bypassing Congress--to ban gun purchases \n     without prior approval from the federal government;\n       As a law clerk, Elena Kagan advised against the Supreme \n     Court considering Sandidge v. United States in a case that \n     questioned the constitutionality of the D.C. gun ban, writing \n     that she was ``not sympathetic'' to the gun owner's Second \n     Amendment claims; and,\n       Kagan was part of the Clinton team that pushed the firearms \n     industry to include gun locks with all gun purchases and was \n     in the Clinton administration when the President pushed \n     legislation that would close down gun shows.\n       Elena Kagan poses such a threat to the Second Amendment \n     that it would be better for the Supreme Court to begin its \n     2010-2011 session with only eight Justices, than for this \n     radical nominee to be confirmed.\n       On behalf of over 300,000 members of Gun Owners of America, \n     I urge you to ``NO'' on this nominee's confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Velleco,\n                                      Director of Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I continue by saying that after reviewing \nMs. Kagan's record of testimony at the confirmation hearing, Gun Owners \nof America concluded:\n\n       . . . the available evidence portrays her as a forceful \n     advocate of restrictive gun laws and as a person driven by \n     political considerations rather than the rule of law.\n\n  The NRA went on to write:\n\n        . . . Ms. Kagan's record on the Second Amendment gives us \n     no confidence that if confirmed to the Court, she will \n     faithfully defend the fundamental, individual right to keep \n     and bear arms of law-abiding Americans.\n       For these reasons, the National Rifle Association has no \n     choice but to oppose the confirmation of Solicitor General \n     Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the importance \n     of this issue, this vote will be considered in the NRA's \n     future candidate evaluations.\n\n  Yes, the answer to the question of the Senator from Alabama is both \nthe NRA and Gun Owners of America have opposed not only this nomination \nbut also Justice Sotomayor's nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe NRA's letter in opposition to the Sotomayor nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Rifle Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, July 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader McConnell: We are writing to \n     express the National Rifle Association's opposition to the \n     confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as Associate Justice of \n     the United States Supreme Court.\n       From the outset, the National Rifle Association respected \n     the confirmation process and hoped for mainstream answers to \n     bedrock questions. Unfortunately, Judge Sotomayor's judicial \n     record and testimony during the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     hearings clearly demonstrate a hostile view of the Second \n     Amendment and the fundamental right of self-defense \n     guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.\n       We are particularly dismayed about the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit's recent decision in the case \n     of Maloney v. Cuomo, in which Judge Sotomayor refused to \n     follow Supreme Court precedent by conducting a proper \n     incorporation analysis of the Second Amendment, concluding \n     instead that the right to keep and bear arms does not protect \n     all law-abiding Americans living in every corner of this \n     nation.\n       In addition, Judge Sotomayor was a member of the panel in \n     the case of United States v. Sanchez-Villar, where (in a \n     summary opinion) the Second Circuit dismissed a Second \n     Amendment challenge to New York State's pistol licensing law. \n     That panel, in a terse footnote, cited a previous Second \n     Circuit case to claim, ``the right to possess a gun is \n     clearly not a fundamental right.''\n       It is only by ignoring history that any judge can say that \n     the Second Amendment is not a fundamental right and does not \n     apply to the States. The one part of the Bill of Rights that \n     Congress clearly intended to apply to all Americans in \n     passing the Fourteenth Amendment was the Second Amendment. \n     History and congressional debate are clear on this point.\n       We believe any individual who does not agree that the \n     Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does \n     not\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\n     respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve \n     on any court, much less the highest court in the land. Given \n     the importance of this issue, the vote on Judge Sotomayor's \n     confirmation will be considered in NRA's future candidate \n     evaluations.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns. Should you \n     have any questions or wish to discuss further, please do not \n     hesitate to call on us personally.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne LaPierre,\n       Executive Vice President, NRA.\n     Chris Cox,\n       Executive Director, NRA-ILA.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the NRA wrote in that case:\n\n       . . . Judge Sotomayor's judicial record and testimony \n     during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings clearly \n     demonstrate a hostile view of the Second Amendment and the \n     fundamental right of self-defense guaranteed under the U.S. \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from South Dakota, why is \nit so significant that both of these groups have opposed her \nnomination?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from Nevada, it comes down to their \nhorrible record on gun rights. It made it impossible for these two \norganizations to conclude that they would be impartial constitutional \njudges on this issue even though they tried to convince Senators \notherwise during their confirmation hearings.\n  These groups had their concerns about Justice Sotomayor validated on \nJune 30, 2010, when she ruled again that the second amendment is not a \nfundamental right. Justice Sotomayor assured Senators during her \nhearing that she believed the second amendment guaranteed an individual \nright to keep and bear arms. But then in her first ruling on the second \namendment as a Supreme Court Justice, she joined the minority opinion \nin McDonald v. Chicago and failed to protect this individual right, as \nconfirmed by the majority of the Court, for citizens living in the 50 \nStates.\n  Specifically, at Justice Sotomayor's hearing, she said that she \n``understood the individual right fully that the Supreme Court \nrecognized in Heller'' and ``knew how important the right to bear arms \nis to many Americans,'' and that she did not consider the right \n``unfundamental.''\n  This is in stark contrast to the opinion she signed onto in McDonald \nthat I said--this is a quote from the McDonald opinion:\n\n       I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, \n     or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it \n     as fundamental, insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping \n     and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes.\n\n  I know that many in this body, especially those who supported her \nconfirmation, were surprised by what is seemingly a 180-degree turn.\n  While I had hoped we could trust her word, I was concerned that her \nrecord did not fit her statements at the hearing. I had concerns that \nher true feelings were much more hostile toward the second amendment \nright than what she was letting on.\n  Specifically, I had concerns with two different cases she decided as \na circuit court judge, including one after the Supreme Court already \nrecognized the second amendment was an individual right, where she held \nin that case that the second amendment was ``clearly not a fundamental \nright'' and did not apply to the States.\n  There were some Senators at the time who were not as concerned by \nthis record as I was and some of the others of us in the Chamber were \nand went so far as to say--this is a quote from one of our colleagues:\n\n       I do not see how any fair observer could regard her \n     testimony as hostile to the second amendment personal right \n     to bear arms, a right she has embraced and recognized.\n\n  That is something said by one of our colleagues in the Senate during \nthe Sotomayor confirmation.\n  While what Justice Sotomayor said during the hearing certainly gave \nthe impression that she believed in the individual right to keep and \nbear arms, her prehearing record demonstrated her true beliefs.\n  I am here today to urge those Members who proclaim to strongly \nsupport the second amendment not to be fooled a second time. Ms. Kagan \nwas asked about the second amendment on a number of occasions at her \nhearing, and each time her response was merely a mimic of Justice \nSotomayor's statements on the second amendment at her hearing.\n  Ms. Kagan would go no further than to acknowledge that the important \nSupreme Court decisions in Heller and McDonald are ``precedent'' and \n``settled law entitled to all the weight the precedent usually gets.''\n  I believe there is no question that Ms. Kagan will follow in the \nfootsteps of Justice Sotomayor and revert to the beliefs demonstrated \nby her anti-second amendment record rather than her posturing during \nher confirmation hearing.\n  That is the reason the NRA and other groups that treasure the \nfundamental right to keep and bear arms, such as Gun Owners of America, \noppose her nomination, just as they did Justice Sotomayor's.\n  The only question that remains for us in the Senate is whether pro-\nsecond amendment Senators who voted for Justice Sotomayor have learned \ntheir lesson and will vote against the Kagan nomination.\n  I say to my colleagues from Nevada and Alabama, as the old saying \ngoes: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. For the \nsake of gun owners across the country, I hope they will not be fooled \nagain.\n  I say to my colleagues from Nevada and Alabama, with all the \nunanswered questions that remain after the Heller and McDonald cases, \nare there not lots of reasons why those grassroots people across this \ncountry--those gun owners, those people who care profoundly about the \nright to keep and bear arms--ought to be concerned? For example, what \nis a sensitive place? Who needs to register? There are going to be \nregistration laws that are put in place. How is the issue of \nmicrostamping and the mandates and requirements that might be \nassociated with that going to impact this fundamental second amendment \nright?\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask the ranking member about the \nMcDonald case, and maybe he can go into some details about the McDonald \ncase and the significance of that when it comes to future decisions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The McDonald case was a hugely important case. It dealt \nfor the first time in recent memory with the question of whether the \nsecond amendment, which had been held in Heller to apply to the Federal \nGovernment, whether it passed through the 14th amendment to apply to \nall the States--and cities are creatures of States, so whether it \napplied to cities.\n  This is a big deal because it is not generally so much the Federal \nGovernment that is willing to deny gun rights, but certain States and \ncertain cities seem very aggressively willing to deny people's second \namendment rights.\n  The question for the Court was: Is it a fundamental right in the Bill \nof Rights, a stated fundamental right, and if it is fundamental, it \npasses through the 14th amendment and all States must comply with it, \njust as States must comply with the right to free speech and other \nrights in the Constitution.\n  By a razor thin 5-to-4 majority, the Supreme Court in McDonald held \nthat it is a fundamental right and does apply to the States, and no \nState, therefore, and no city can deny an individual right of an \nAmerican citizen to keep and bear arms. This is a big, important case.\n  Justice Sotomayor--who suggested otherwise in her testimony--as \nSenator Thune said, her record suggested she would rule that way, rule \nwith the four that it did not apply to the States. It is a big deal.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In the McDonald case, as I understand, there were several \nrestrictions put on citizens when it came to their second amendment \nright: paying a $100 processing fee and a $15 fee for each gun \nregistered; undergo and pass a firearms safety test which consists of 4 \nhours of training and 1 hour target range practice, which, by the way, \ncosts about $100 for each one of those activities; undergo and pass a \nvision test, if you do not have an Illinois driver's license; provide \nfingerprints; be at least 21 years of age or 18 years with parents' \npermission; wait 45-120 days for processing; own only one operational \nfirearm; and reregister every 3 years.\n  I ask the ranking member, why are these restrictions necessary?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The question becomes: Does it impact a fundamental\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\nright? At some point it does. We decided you cannot put a poll tax on \npeople to say you have to pay money for your right to vote. People do \nnot have to pay for the right to speak out about advocate beliefs \nbecause you have a right to free speech.\n  I do think these restrictions, as they increase, can reach a point of \ndenial of people's individual right to keep and bear arms. We want to \nbe sure that a judge not only recognizes it is a constitutional \nindividual right but that the judge recognizes that some of these \nrestrictions we accept and are legitimate go too far.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will add, concluding my remarks, that this issue is of \ncritical importance. Without the second amendment, the rest of the Bill \nof Rights can go away. That is what our Founders recognized. Our \ncolleagues, before they vote on Solicitor General Kagan, need to \nunderstand that. That is why this colloquy is so important today. We \nhave brought out some very important points.\n  It was an honor to be with my colleagues to discuss Solicitor General \nKagan's views on the second amendment and how that potentially could \nimpact her decisions in the future.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I close by saying as well, I think in all \ncases, you have to judge people not by what they say but by what they \ndo. Clearly, the record would suggest, as it did with Justice \nSotomayor, a certain hostility toward the second amendment right. \nObviously, statements at the Judiciary Committee hearings suggesting an \nopenness to this or acknowledging settled law or precedents or all \nthose sorts of things were meaningless in regard to the Chicago case \nwith regard to Justice Sotomayor.\n  If we look at the long history of Ms. Kagan with regard to this \nissue, I think we can conclude where she is going to end up.\n  It is a critical issue because these are 5-to-4 decisions. These are \nvery narrow decisions that strike at the very heart of a fundamental \nconstitutional right that people in this country deserve to have their \nleaders, both elected leaders and people on the Court, protect. I am \nvery concerned about where that is headed with this nominee.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleagues for this nice and valuable \ndiscussion. I will say that one of the unjustifiable actions of the \njudicial activist philosophy that is too much afoot in America today is \ntheir willingness to completely be oblivious to plain constitutional \nrights, things that are flatly stated, and then to create rights that \ndo not exist.\n  For example, the Constitution gives the right to free press, but we \nhad Solicitor General Kagan arguing before the Supreme Court in defense \nof this campaign finance bill that a corporation could be prohibited \nfrom producing a pamphlet before an election that might be critical of \na politician. I mean, that is what the first amendment was about. It \nwasn't about pornography or flag burning, for heaven's sake. It was \nabout political speech, plainly in the Constitution. Yet we had four \nmembers of the Supreme Court--a vote in an opinion recently--who said \nthe government could ban the pamphlets. Actually, another lawyer for \nthe government argued you could ban books.\n\n  The Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 majority did, in fact, say that you \ncould take a man's private drugstore--the government could--and give it \nto another man who had a competing drugstore; in other words, taking \nprivate property for private use. The Constitution says you can't take \nprivate property except for public use under condemnation. A plain \nviolation, 5-to-4 approved.\n  By two 5-to-4 decisions--the narrowest of margins--we had the plain \nconstitutional right that Americans have to keep and bear arms hang by \none vote. We have another example of a judge in California yesterday \ndeclaring that the Constitution somewhere says a State must declare \nthat a union between same-sex couples has to be defined in the same way \nand recognized in the same way as a marriage, even after California had \na referendum in which millions of Californians voted differently. A \nsingle judge, with no clear constitutional authority at all--in fact, \nno real constitutional authority--declared that invalid and wiped it \nout.\n  So I would suggest that people who are using this court to promote \ntheir agendas need to be careful. Don't think you can play with the \nfirst amendment. Don't think you can play with the second amendment. \nDon't think you can play with the constitutional right to have your \nproperty not taken by the government except for public use. If you can \nstart wiping those rights out, what right next will the Court come and \ntake? What right next will the central government come and take from \nyou?\n  So if you love this Constitution and respect it and believe it is a \ngreat bulwark for freedom, prosperity, and liberty, I suggest there is \nonly one way to handle it, Mr. President: enforce it as written whether \nyou like it or not.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to address the nomination of \nSolicitor General Kagan to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Earlier \nthis week, I discussed my opposition to the nomination, but at that \ntime I didn't go into any depth about my concerns with regard to her \nparticipation in the military recruiting policy that banned the U.S. \nmilitary from the Office of Career Services at Harvard Law School.\n  While this incident has been discussed a lot, I think it is very \nimportant to establish for the record exactly what happened. I believe \na due respect for the men and women of our military and the gravity of \nthis debate demand a full review of the facts behind what Elena Kagan \ndid as dean of the Harvard Law School to exclude and stigmatize the \nU.S. military.\n  Harvard Law School adopted an antidiscrimination policy in 1979. This \npolicy states that any employer that wished to use the Office of Career \nServices at the law school had to sign a statement affirming that it \ndoes not discriminate on various bases, including sexual orientation. \nThe military--not just because of its policy but because of the policy \nof the Congress and the law that we passed--could not sign this \nstatement because of the don't ask, don't tell policy adopted during \nthe Clinton administration.\n  In 1993, when a Democratic Congress and the Clinton administration \nchanged the military's outright ban on gays in the military to adopt \nthis don't ask, don't tell policy, Harvard took the position that the \nmilitary was still not in compliance with its antidiscrimination \npolicy. As a result of Harvard's policy, from 1979 through 2002, the \nU.S. military was barred from recruiting individuals at the Harvard Law \nSchool's Office of Career Services, where everyone else who was \nrecruiting on campus was allowed to conduct interviews and recruit \npotential candidates.\n  While this ban on the services of the Office of Career Services was \nin effect, the Harvard Law School Veterans Association essentially took \nthe place of the Office of Career Services and established an off-\ncampus interview forum for law students interested in serving their \ncountry in the U.S. military. So because they were banned from the \nOffice of Career Services, the military had to look for an alternative \nvenue or forum provided by the Harvard Law School Veterans Association \nin order to conduct those interviews.\n  But then something very important happened. In 1995, Congress enacted \nanother law, popularly known as the Solomon Amendment. The Solomon \nAmendment said you cannot receive Federal funds--if you are an \neducational institution--if you, in effect, prohibit military \nrecruiting on your campus. In other words, they could have continued \ntheir policy of discrimination against the military, but they would \nhave been denied Federal funds under the plain wording of the Solomon \nAmendment passed in 1995.\n  The Secretary of Defense, under the Solomon Amendment, has to make a \nfinding that the school is not offering access to military recruiters \nthat is ``equal in quality and scope to the access that the school \nprovides other employers.'' That was the 1995 law. In 2002, the \nSecretary of Defense of the United States found that Harvard's \nexclusion of military recruiters from the Office of Career Services was \nnot ``equal access.''\n  In response to this Federal law and the finding by the Secretary of \nDefense, Ms. Kagan's predecessor, Robert\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nClark, essentially capitulated and gave the military access to the \nOffice of Career Services in 2002. So Dean Robert Clark, Dean Kagan's \npredecessor, rather than be denied Federal funds to Harvard by \nviolating the Solomon Amendment and denying access to military \nrecruiters to the Office of Career Services, decided in 2002 to change \nHarvard's policy. Thus, when Ms. Kagan became dean of the law school in \nthe spring of 2003, the military had full access to the Office of \nCareer Services to recruit interested candidates for military service.\n  For a while, Dean Kagan maintained the military's access to the \nOffice of Career Services in compliance with the Solomon Amendment. But \nit is clear that Dean Kagan did not like that because she voiced her \npolitical opposition to the don't ask, don't tell policy--in other \nwords, the law enacted by Congress and to which the Department of \nDefense was accountable for enforcing--in an e-mail she sent to all of \nHarvard's law students saying that she ``abhorred'' the ``don't ask, \ndon't tell policy'' and she considered it ``a moral injustice of the \nfirst order.''\n  In January 2004, Dean Kagan joined 53 other members of the Harvard \nlaw faculty in filing a friend of the court brief supporting a \nchallenge to the Solomon Amendment in the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals. So even though she maintained access for a while, inherited \nthat policy under her predecessor, in 2004, when a lawsuit was filed to \nchallenge the Solomon Amendment, Dean Kagan and other Harvard Law \nSchool faculty joined in a friend of the court brief to try to strike \ndown the Solomon Amendment.\n  In November of 2004, a split panel on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals actually held that the Solomon Amendment was reasonably likely \nto be unconstitutional and sent the case back to the district court \nwith instructions to issue an injunction halting the Solomon \nAmendment's enforcement.\n  Now, this is very important because the Third Circuit is one of our \ncircuit courts of appeal in the United States, but it is not the U.S. \nSupreme Court. By that I mean when it makes a decision, its decision \nonly applies to the territory or that part of the United States that is \nwithin the Third Circuit. That is important because Harvard is not in \nthe Third Circuit. Harvard is in the First Circuit. So in effect, the \nThird Circuit panel's decision had no legal effect on Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  Nevertheless, the very next day, after the Third Circuit issued its \ndecision, Dean Kagan changed the Harvard Law School policy to once \nagain bar the military from using the services of the Office of Career \nServices. In other words, she was not compelled to do so by law but \nexercising her discretion as dean, she chose to reinstate this policy \nof barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services.\n  Then, in January of 2005, the Third Circuit issued an order staying \nits enforcement pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. After \nthis, of course, the Third Circuit ruling did not even have any effect \neven in the Third Circuit, much less in the jurisdiction in the circuit \nwith jurisdiction over Harvard. But even after the order was stayed, \nMs. Kagan continued the policy of barring military recruiters from the \nOffice of Career Services.\n  While her policy barring military recruiters from the Office of \nCareer Services was in effect, Dean Kagan approached the Harvard Law \nSchool Veterans Association and asked them to serve as an alternate \nchannel for military recruiting at Harvard Law School. In 2005, the law \nschool veterans declined, writing:\n\n       Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any \n     office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources \n     to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively \n     for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting \n     events.\n\n  In short, the law school veterans told Dean Kagan that the separate \naccess she wanted them to offer the military would not be equal because \nthey didn't have the ability to match the resources of the Office of \nCareer Services.\n  In May 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States then said they \nwere going to hear an appeal of the Third Circuit's decision, and they \ngranted the writ of certiorari to the Defense Department's appeal of \nthat case to review their finding on the Solomon Amendment. Over the \nsummer of 2005, the Defense Department notified Dean Kagan that it \nwould rescind Harvard's funding--in other words, it would deny Federal \nfunding to Harvard pursuant to the Solomon Amendment--if she continued \nto deny the military access to the Office of Career Services.\n  Faced with this ultimatum, on September 20, 2005, Dean Kagan finally \nended her 10-month unlawful denial of access and announced that pending \nthe Supreme Court's decision she would lift the ban and give the \nmilitary access to the Office of Career Services. But in the meantime, \nshe filed another friend of the court brief, this time in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, arguing the Solomon Amendment should not \napply to her actions barring the military from the Harvard Law School's \nOffice of Career Services.\n  Ultimately, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Dean Kagan's \nposition and unanimously upheld the Solomon Amendment.\n  To recap: Dean Kagan's ban on military recruiters lasted for 10 \nmonths--from November of 2004 through September of 2005. During that \nentire span of time, the Department of Defense position was always--was \nalways--that the ban violated the congressionally passed Solomon \nAmendment. Never in that span of time did the Supreme Court, the First \nCircuit, or any other court with jurisdiction over Harvard adopt Dean \nKagan's view regarding the scope or enforceability of the Solomon \nAmendment. In that span of time, only a split panel of the Third \nCircuit held that the Solomon Amendment was unenforceable, and for all \nbut 2 months of that time, the Third Circuit's order was stayed.\n\n  Despite all of this, Dean Kagan persisted in barring military \nrecruiters from the Office of Career Services and insisted that the \nmilitary could obtain separate but equal access to Harvard Law School \nthrough alternate routes. Dean Kagan held that the Supreme Court's \nposition ran afoul of the Solomon Amendment, the findings of the \nSecretary of Defense, and ultimately the legal judgment of the entire \nSupreme Court. I believe these are the undisputed facts of the case.\n  So why do Ms. Kagan's actions matter? I would argue that they matter \nfor two reasons. First is the message her actions sent about her lack \nof respect for the U.S. military at Harvard Law School during her \ndeanship. Ms. Kagan claims she holds the military in the highest \nrespect, but I have to ask you, this notion that you are going to \nprovide separate but equal access to interviewing services is not one \nthat shows respect. It is one that provides an unnecessary and really \nreprehensible stigma on the U.S. military, which had no control over a \npolicy passed by Congress under the Solomon Amendment.\n  Of course, she did this at a time when hundreds of thousands of young \nmen and women deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were wearing the uniform \nof their country to protect their fellow citizens and the rule of law. \nDean Kagan's actions in taking every step legally possible to relegate \nthe military to what she herself believed was separate but equal status \nplaced an unmistakable stigma on the military during a time of war.\n  I believe her decision to stigmatize the military is reason enough to \noppose her nomination to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, but \nher actions as dean are troubling for another reason as well. I believe \nher actions as dean indicate strong evidence that, as a Justice, \nsomeone sitting in judgment on the U.S. Supreme Court, she would tend \nto advance her political preferences rather than take a traditional \napproach of a judge in following the law.\n  Many of our colleagues have pointed out correctly that Ms. Kagan has \nnever been a judge. While that is not a requirement to serve on the \nSupreme Court, this lack of judicial experience makes it difficult to \ntell whether Ms. Kagan would adopt a judicial activist philosophy if \nshe takes a seat on the Court. Because she has never held the job of a \njudge--we don't have any record to judge her by--we must look to the \njobs she has held and the actions she has taken to see how she is \nlikely to perform her job as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In the 10 months during which she banned the U.S. military from the \nHarvard Law School campus, I believe Dean Kagan showed a willingness to\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nbend the law and facts to advance her own political goals of protesting \nthe don't ask, don't tell policy and, as I said, stigmatizing the \nmilitary in the process. Despite the lack of any binding authority, she \nadopted an interpretation of the Solomon Amendment so tenuous that it \ncould not garner the vote of a single Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and she did so for the express purpose of advancing her \nobjections to a policy she said she abhorred.\n  Bending the law and the facts to reach a preferred result is exactly \nwhat judicial activists do, and there is a pattern in Ms. Kagan's legal \ncareer of bending the law and facts to advance her preferred policy \nresults. So while Ms. Kagan has never been a judge, she has established \na disturbing pattern of doing what judicial activists do. Ms. Kagan's \nactions in her previous jobs showed she is very likely not to embrace \nthe role of a judge who decides cases based on the Constitution as \nwritten and the law as passed by Congress that she is responsible for \nenforcing if they are, in fact, constitutional but, rather, she gives \nevery indication of someone who believes it is within her role and \nprerogative as a Justice to basically make the law rather than to \nenforce the law as written. No Member of this Chamber should be \nsurprised if, for the rest of her life as a Supreme Court Justice, Ms. \nKagan does not merely follow the law as written but, rather, bends the \nlaw to advance her progressive political agenda.\n  Our Constitution is too precious and the Supreme Court is too \npowerful for us to accept without question a President's nominee to the \nSupreme Court. The Framers of the Constitution recognized the \nimportance of this appointment and the power given to a Supreme Court \nJustice, who serves for life without any political accountability to \nthe electorate. That is why they gave us the responsibility to give our \nadvice and consent.\n  The nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is really \na two-step process. First, the President makes his nomination. The \nPresident can nominate anyone the President wants who meets the \nqualifications of the Constitution. But then it is our responsibility \nto exercise our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent.\n  I believe Ms. Kagan has failed to embrace the traditional view of \njudging that I believe all judges must adhere to at the risk of, \nrather, them becoming a lawmaker, which is incompatible with the role \nof a Justice. I believe a judge who assumes a role of being a \npolicymaker or a lawmaker is, in essence, a lawbreaker.\n  Indeed, Ms. Kagan's career up to this point shows a willingness to \nbend the law and the facts to advance her own beliefs, and I fear this \ntrend will continue in an activist tenure on the Supreme Court. For \nthese reasons, I oppose her nomination and will vote no.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nPresident's nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Senate has no more important responsibility than to advise and \nconsent on nominations to our Nation's highest Court. It will be an \nhonor on behalf of the people of my State to cast my vote to confirm \nElena Kagan.\n  Ms. Kagan is a distinguished lawyer with a remarkable legal \nbackground. She brings very diverse experiences to the Court that I \nbelieve will add to the important perspective of the high Court as it \nreviews cases of critical importance to the American people.\n  Throughout her career she has been a legal trailblazer and a role \nmodel. She will be the fourth woman to serve on the high Court, and for \nthe first time in history, three women will be serving on the bench \nwhen oral arguments are heard this fall. Her nomination marks an \nhistoric milestone of progress for women in the legal profession and in \nserving as leaders for our Nation.\n  A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan began her career as a law \nclerk to former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who like her, \nserved as Solicitor General prior to being promoted to the high Court. \nJustice Marshall made history as the first African-American Solicitor \nGeneral at the time and Ms. Kagan has followed suit as the first female \nSolicitor General.\n  Following her clerkship, Ms. Kagan worked in the private sector where \nshe handled first amendment, commercial and criminal litigation. She \nthen served in the highest ranks of academia as a law professor. This \nultimately led to her becoming dean at the Harvard Law School, one of \nour nation's most prestigious institutions. Her ascension to dean \nmarked the first time in Harvard Law School's 186-year history that a \nwoman held this position. As dean, Ms. Kagan bridged ideological \ndivides among faculty, recruiting professors from across the \nideological spectrum, managing the largest and most prestigious law \nschool in our nation and improving the quality of life for students.\n  Prior to becoming dean, Ms. Kagan served in high legal and policy \npositions in the Clinton administration, where she learned the \noperations of the executive and legislative branches of our government, \nwhich will help the Court better understand how policy judgments are \nmade and the effect that the decisions of our government and courts \nhave on the lives of everyday Americans.\n  Most recently, Ms. Kagan has dutifully served our Nation as the U.S. \nSolicitor General. The Solicitor General is often referred to as the \n10th Justice because of the frequency that he or she appears before the \nCourt on behalf of the United States. This experience exposed Ms. Kagan \nto nearly every case that has come before the current Court and she has \nhad to weigh all of the same legal considerations as the current \nJustices prior to deciding the position of the U.S. Government. Few \npositions provide better preparation for the high Court.\n  While she has not previously served as a judge, though she was \npreviously nominated to be one, I see her varied background as an \nasset. We need different life experiences on the Supreme Court. If \nconfirmed, Ms. Kagan will be the first nonjudge since former Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist was nominated by former President Richard \nNixon.\n  Her mix of professional experience will help ensure that we do not \nhave a Court out of touch with the American people. Ms. Kagan has \ntaught the law in the classroom, practiced in the public and private \nsector, worked in the judiciary as a clerk and crafted the policies of \nthe executive branch. Everywhere she has worked, Ms. Kagan has \nexcelled. Her experience is the kind of experience we should aspire for \nall of our justices to have before serving on the high Court.\n  The Supreme Court is too important to not hold our justices to high \nstandards of intellect and achievement--a standard Ms. Kagan meets. It \nis our best and brightest who should serve in these important \npositions. We need Justices who respect precedent, hew closely to the \ntext of the law and do not pursue an agenda from the bench.\n  We do not need activist judges whether they come from the right or \nleft. The American people do not want an ideologically driven Supreme \nCourt that is pursuing a political agenda. We want a Court that \nrespects precedent and helps resolve the legal questions of our time as \nthey affect our daily lives.\n  I would like to close by thanking outgoing Justice John Paul Stevens \nfor his service to our country. Justice Stevens presided on the Court \nduring a period of great change and accomplishment for our nation. He \nis a member of the Greatest Generation and is a true patriot for his \nservice during World War II. Justice Stevens has been an intellectual \nheavyweight on the bench and provided a voice of reason even while we \nhave seen the Court drift so heavily in favor of the most powerful \ninterests. He has left large shoes to fill and will be missed.\n  President Obama has nominated someone who can fill these shoes. \nBecause of the breadth and diversity of her experience, Elena Kagan has \na profound understanding of the law and effect the Supreme Court has on \nthe lives of all Americans. She is an intellectual heavyweight in her \nown right and will help the Court bridge the divides of recent years.\n  I am proud to commit my vote in favor of this nominee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to support the confirmation of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan as the next Associate Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  Solicitor General Kagan is eminently qualified to serve on our \nNation's highest Court. As a student, she excelled at\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\nPrinceton, Oxford and Harvard Law School. She has stellar legal \ncredentials that have been recognized by liberal and conservative \nlawyers alike. And, throughout her career, including as a professor of \nlaw, as a key advisor to President Clinton, as dean of Harvard Law \nSchool, and as Solicitor General, she has demonstrated a great mind and \nintellect.\n  Moreover, Solicitor General Kagan will bring important diversity to \nthe Court. First, when the Senate confirms her, she will be only the \nfourth woman to serve on the Court; and for the first time in history, \nthree women will serve on the Supreme Court together.\n  Second, Solicitor General Kagan's experiences as someone who has \nworked in the legislative and executive branches will provide a vital \nperspective that is currently lacking among the Justices. In fact, for \nthe first time in history, the current Court is comprised entirely of \nJustices who were promoted directly from the lower Federal courts. \nWhile judicial experience is important, it is also important to \nrecognize that some of our most consequential Justices--Louis Brandeis, \nFelix Frankfurter, Earl Warren, Robert Jackson and William Rehnquist, \nto name just a few--did not have prior judicial experience. I am glad \nthe President recognized how crucial it is to have on the bench \nJustices with varied life experiences.\n  Mind you, I am hopeful that next time the President will look to one \nof the many qualified lawyers who did not graduate from Harvard or \nYale, or one who resides east of the Appalachian Mountains. But \nnominating someone from outside the Federal courts is a refreshing \nchange.\n  As I evaluate Solicitor General Kagan's qualifications, an additional \nfactor is important for me: she clerked and learned from two judges for \nwhom I have enormous respect--Judge Abner Mikva and Justice Thurgood \nMarshall. These two jurists exhibited a deep and abiding passion for \njustice, and each strived throughout his career to ensure that ``equal \njustice under law'' is more than an ideal chiseled on a marble facade, \nbut a concrete reality for all our citizens.\n  In her opening statement before the Judiciary Committee, Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan noted:\n\n       My first real exposure to the Court came almost a quarter \n     century ago when I began my clerkship with Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall. Justice Marshall revered the Court--and for a \n     simple reason. In his life, in his great struggle for racial \n     justice, the Supreme Court stood as the part of government \n     that was most open to every American--and that most often \n     fulfilled our Constitution's promise of treating all persons \n     with equal respect, equal care, and equal attention.\n\n  In a 1993 law review article, she expressed a fondness for Justice \nThurgood Marshall's vision of constitutional interpretation, which she \ndescribed as ``demand[ing] that the courts show a special solicitude \nfor the despised and disadvantaged.'' She described this vision as ``a \nthing of glory.'' I am hopeful that Solicitor General Kagan will follow \nin the best traditions of Judge Mikva and Justice Marshall and continue \nto strive to make our Nation's laws more just.\n  Considering her outstanding intellect and credentials, there simply \nis no doubt Solicitor General Kagan should be confirmed.\n  However, for me, there is another, equally important, consideration. \nI also believe that Solicitor General Kagan will be an important and \nneeded voice on the Court to ensure that appropriate respect and \ndeference is given to Congress, and proper effect is given to our most \nimportant statutes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nCivil Rights Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, so all \nAmericans receive the fullest protections of the law.\n  Too often debate regarding the Supreme Court seems to focus on a \nhandful of divisive cultural issues. Indeed, many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have come to the floor to focus on gays in \nthe military, abortion and guns. To be sure, these issues are \nimportant. But, what typically get overlooked in a debate like this are \nthe many technical, statutory cases--often involving esoteric legal \nprinciples--that nonetheless have a tremendous impact on the everyday \nlives of ordinary Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the sad truth is that, in case after case, often in \nnarrow 5-4 decisions, today's Court has too often slammed shut the \ncourthouse door in the face of these ordinary Americans. The Court has \nused arcane legal doctrines and strained readings of Federal statutes \nto prevent citizens from vindicating their civil rights and consumer \nprotections. The result is that many people who suffer grievous wrongs \nare not able to bring meritorious lawsuits, and to hold corporations \nand the government accountable.\n  In case after case, the Court has undermined vital protections and \nsided with the powerful against the powerless--for instance, in cases \nsuch as Ledbetter v. Goodyear, Gross v. FBL Financial, and Riegel v. \nMedtronic. In doing so, the Court has repeatedly ignored the clear \nintent of Congress in passing important laws.\n  In the ``Sutton trilogy'' the Court repeatedly misread the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and narrowed the scope of individuals deemed \neligible for protection under that landmark statute. The result of \nthese decisions was to eliminate protection for countless thousands of \nAmericans with disabilities. These flawed, harmful decisions were \nreversed in the last Congress when we unanimously enacted the ADA \nAmendments Act.\n  Similarly, in June, 2009, the Supreme Court decided Gross v. FBL \nFinancial, Inc. In a case involving an Iowan, Jack Gross, the Court \nmade it harder for those with legitimate age discrimination claims to \nprevail under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In doing so, it \nreversed a well established, 20-year-old standard, consistent with that \nunder title VII of the Civil Rights Act, that a plaintiff need only \nshow that membership in a protected class was a ``motivating factor'' \nin an employer's action. Instead, the Court held that a plaintiff \nalleging age discrimination must prove that an employment action would \nnot have been taken against him or her ``but for'' age. In other words, \nthe plaintiff must now prove that age discrimination was not a cause or \na motivating factor, but that it was the determinative cause of an \nadverse employment action. Proving ``but for'' cause is extremely \ndifficult and will greatly limit potentially meritorious suits \ninvolving discrimination Congress sought to prevent.\n  In doing so, the Court did not even address the question on which it \ngranted certiorari. As Justice Stevens noted in dissent, ``I disagree \nnot only with the Court's interpretation of the statute, but also with \nits decision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking. The Court is \nunconcerned that the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed \nby the parties or uninterested amici curie. Its failure to consider the \nviews of the United States, which represents the agency charged with \nadministering the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act], is especially \nirresponsible.''\n  In University of Alabama v. Garrett, a case whose oral arguments I \npersonally attended, the Court limited the rights of people with \ndisabilities. In doing so, it ignored numerous congressional hearings \nand a task force which collected evidence through 63 public forums \naround the country attended by more than 7,000 persons. In United \nStates v. Morrison and Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court \ncompletely ignored extensive congressional fact-finding and struck down \nparts of the Violence Against Women's Act and the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, respectively.\n  The contrast with Solicitor General Kagan is stark. She repeatedly \nmade clear her approach to judging: respect for congressional intent \nand for long standing precedent. She consistently made clear that a \njudge's personal views should play no role in interpreting a statute \nand ``the only question is Congress's intent.'' Unlike some current \nmembers of the Court, moreover, she made clear that where the text of a \nstatute is ambiguous she will look to legislative history--``a judge \nshould look to other sources, should look to the structure of the \nstatute, should look to the history of the statute in order to \ndetermine Congress's will.'' After her confirmation hearing and based \non my personal meeting with her, I am convinced she will give full \neffect to our most important statutes.\n  Finally, as I listen to the debate surrounding Solicitor General \nKagan's confirmation, I find it remarkable that conservatives continue \nto accuse every\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\nDemocratic appointed nominee of being ``activist.'' It is a tired \nbumper sticker slogan that not only has no meaning but is divorced from \nreality.\n  In fact, what is clear from this debate is that it is the \nconservatives who want to use the courts to achieve a desired political \nresult and to thwart the democratic will of the people, as expressed \nthrough their elected representatives.\n  For example, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSessions, noted his concern that Solicitor General Kagan ``will bring \nto the bench a progressive activist judicial philosophy which holds \nthat unelected judges are empowered to set national policy from the \nbench.''\n  I find it ironic that this charge is bandied about by the same people \nmost eager to have the courts strike down as unconstitutional the \nrecently enacted health care reform bill. To strike down this law would \nrequire an unelected judge to ignore the clear language of the \nConstitution, reverse precedents that go back to John Marshall, \ndisregard extensive fact-finding by Congress, and overturn a decision \nof a majority of both Houses of Congress and the President of the \nUnited States. That would be the height of judicial activism, the \nheight of ``making national policy from the bench.''\n  The reality, is that, the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have \ninvalidated more laws than any previous Courts.\n  It is conservatives who not only want the Court to make national \nhealth care policy, but also to limit the ability of Congress to keep \nthe corrupting influence of corporate spending out of our democracy, as \nthe Court did in Citizens United.\n  It is conservatives who second guess decisions by Congress, including \na unanimous Senate, to ensure the rights of all Americans to vote, as \nthe Roberts Court suggested in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility \nDistrict No. One v. Holder.\n  It is conservatives who want the judiciary to second guess decisions \nmade by local sheriffs in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.\n  It is conservatives who want the judiciary to second guess local \nzoning decisions, environmental and land use regulations.\n  It is conservatives who want the courts to invalidate efforts by \nCongress and local governments to eliminate racial discrimination.\n  Given the current Court's repeated disregard for Congress and for our \nefforts to expansively protect American citizens, I believe it is \nimperative that the next justice be someone who respects precedent, \nstrives to apply congressional intent and purpose, and understands the \nimportance of this nation's landmark civil rights protections. Based on \nher record and after meeting her, I am confident Solicitor General \nKagan will be that type of jurist.\n  Solicitor General Kagan clearly has the intellect, experience and \njudgment to be an outstanding Justice. I am proud to support her \nnomination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the \nnomination of Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  First, I commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and his \nstaff for their efforts to make this confirmation process so thorough \nand transparent. The committee had the opportunity to review nearly \n200,000 pages of internal memos and emails from Ms. Kagan's service as \na law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall and as a White House aide \nduring the Clinton administration--making the examination of her record \none of the most thorough and searching in history. I appreciate that \nPresident Obama and President Clinton did not raise claims of executive \nprivilege to try to stop the release of documents, which was a \nrefreshing change and a practice that I hope future Presidents will \nfollow in years to come.\n  All but a tiny fraction of these documents were made available \nonline, granting extraordinary access to the public. I said after last \nyear's hearings for Justice Sotomayor that Chairman Leahy had set a new \nstandard for transparency and public access to Supreme Court nomination \nhearings, and in these proceedings he did it again. I commend him and \nhis staff for their tremendous work over the past few months.\n  There is no question that Elena Kagan is eminently qualified for a \nposition on the Supreme Court. She has an impressive education, she has \nworked at the highest levels of government, and she has served as dean \nof a top law school. During the hearings, she demonstrated a keen mind, \nthoughtful analysis, and a wide-ranging command of the law. She has \ndeveloped a reputation as someone who can reach out to those with whom \nshe may not agree and work together, and that skill should prove very \nvaluable on the Court. I believe that because she has not previously \nbeen a judge, she will bring a different and important perspective to a \nCourt that is otherwise entirely populated by former appellate judges.\n  I appreciated Solicitor General Kagan's efforts to improve the \nconfirmation process by being forthcoming in her answers. Fifteen years \nago she quite fairly criticized the process in an article, arguing that \nthe American people deserved more substantive discussions of the law. \nWhile I can't say that she quite lived up to the high standard that she \nset for nominees in 1995, I do believe that she tried to answer our \nquestions as openly and comprehensively as she could, given what the \nconfirmation process has become.\n  I came away from the confirmation process convinced that Elena Kagan \nunderstands the appropriate relationship between the courts and \nCongress. As she explained at the Judiciary Committee hearing, her work \nwith Congress during her time at the White House taught her a healthy \nrespect for the political branches and how difficult it can be for \nCongress to pass legislation. I hope that she will keep this in mind \nbefore she votes to overturn a bill that Congress may have spent years \ndrafting and debating.\n  But while this deference is important, Solicitor General Kagan also \ndemonstrated that she recognizes the critically important role of our \njudicial system in serving as a check on the other branches of \ngovernment--in ``policing constitutional boundaries,'' as she put it. \nShe spoke eloquently about the early experiences of Justice Marshall \nand his efforts to eradicate Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. She \nexplained that what was so incredible about his struggle for equality \nwas that ``the courts [took] seriously claims that were not taken \nseriously anyplace else. . . . In other words, it was the courts' role \nto make sure that even when people have no place else to go that they \ncan come to the courts and the courts will hear their claims fairly.'' \nShe said this was a miraculous thing about courts, and I agree with \nher. With regard to executive power, she emphasized that ``no person, \nhowever grand, however powerful, is above the law.'' She also talked \nabout ``the importance of adhering to the law, no matter the \ntemptations, no matter the pressures that one might be subject to in \nthe course of one's career.'' These insights indicate that she will \ntake seriously the Court's role in safeguarding individual rights and \nprotecting the rule of law.\n  In addition to informing the committee about the nominee, the \nhearings also taught us more about the Supreme Court. We have heard a \nlot in recent years about ``judicial activism.'' But I think the \nhearings helped underscore that activism is in the eye of the beholder. \nAs Justice Souter explained in a recent speech, the truth is that the \nSupreme Court has to decide hard cases--cases in which a judge cannot \nsimply read the words of the Constitution and objectively evaluate the \nfacts. That is, a judge cannot simply act as an umpire. Judges often \nhave to choose between positive values in the Constitution that are in \ntension with each other, he noted.\n  Justice Souter reminded us that facts may look very different in \ndifferent historical contexts. The quintessential example of this is \nthe Court's historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education to \noverturn Plessy v. Ferguson--a case that by current standards would \nsurely qualify as judicial activism but that is one of the most revered \nin our nation's history. What this shows us is that judging is not a \n``robotic enterprise,'' as Solicitor General Kagan told the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. Judging is hard and it does, in fact, \nrequire judgment. But, Justice Souter explained, ``we can still address \nthe constitutional\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nuncertainties the way [the Framers] must have envisioned, by relying on \nreason, by respecting all the words the Framers wrote, by facing facts, \nand by seeking to understand their meaning for living people.'' I \nbelieve Elena Kagan will fulfill that vision admirably.\n  So I will vote to confirm Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. I look forward to her confirmation as only the \nfourth woman in history to serve on our Nation's highest Court, and I \nexpect she will serve with distinction--and with good humor, which she \ndemonstrated throughout this arduous process--for many years to come.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Elena Kagan to serve as the next Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Having carefully examined her record, monitored her confirmation \nhearings, and personally met with her, Solicitor General Kagan is \nclearly qualified to serve on the Court. Given her tremendous \neducational accomplishments at Princeton, Oxford, and Harvard, as well \nas her success as a constitutional and administrative law scholar at \nChicago and Harvard, there is little question that she is \nintellectually qualified for the job.\n  General Kagan has had an impressive career, having clerked for \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, worked as the first female \ndean of Harvard Law School, and served as the first female Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. During that time, she has impressed all \nwith whom she has worked with both her character and her talent.\n  Some of my colleagues are concerned that previous Federal judicial \nexperience is not among her list of accomplishments. Historically, \nhowever, large numbers of our Supreme Court nominees have not had prior \njudicial experience. The last Supreme Court nominee appointed without \nany such experience served was former Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  Indeed, the outgoing Court represents the first time in history when \nall nine Justices had Federal judicial experience. That is what \nprompted Justice Antonin Scalia to say that he was ``happy to see that \nthis latest nominee is not a federal judge.'' I share that view, and \nwelcome the unique academic perspective that General Kagan will bring \nto the Court.\n  Others with concerns about General Kagan have pointed to her \ntreatment of military recruiters as the dean of Harvard Law School or \nmemos she wrote when she was an advisor in the Clinton administration. \nIn addition to the explanations provided to me by General Kagan during \nour meeting, I am reassured about these controversies by the fact that \nshe has received strong support from legal minds across the political \nspectrum.\n  General Kagan has earned high praise from conservatives like Jack \nGoldsmith and Miguel Estrada, as well as from every former Solicitor \nGeneral since 1985, including Ted Olson and Ken Starr. These are not \npeople who make such endorsements lightly. They would not speak well of \nsomeone who is outside the mainstream.\n  When considering my vote on nominees to the Supreme Court, my key \ntest is whether or not the President's nominee is qualified to serve on \nthe Court, not whether I agree with everything he or she have ever \ndone. As Senators, we must examine the record, accomplishments, \nintellect, and character of each judicial nominee put before us, and \ndetermine whether each individual is worthy to serve on the bench. This \nis the standard I used when I voted to confirm Chief Justice John \nRoberts, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. And that is \nthe standard I am using in voting to confirm Elena Kagan.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nSolicitor General Kagan's experience. Over the past few months, there \nhas been a lot of talk from our friends across the aisle about whether \nMs. Kagan is qualified to be our country's 112th Supreme Court Justice.\n  They say she has never been a judge. How conveniently they forget \nthat some of the most well-respected Justices in the history of the \nSupreme Court also brought life experiences outside the ``judicial \nmonastery,'' which President Obama so ably encouraged us to look \nbeyond. Former Chief Justice William Rehnquist is one example. Former \nJustice Lewis Powell, Jr., is another.\n  They also conveniently forget that just a few decades ago, most \nJustices had little or no judicial experience. In fact, it is General \nKagan's diversity of life experiences that, in my opinion, make her \nexceptionally qualified for the High Court. President Obama said one of \nthe primary reasons he nominated General Kagan was because of her \n``understanding of law--not as an intellectual exercise or words on a \npage--but as it affects the lives of ordinary people.'' I couldn't \nagree more.\n  The inscription that greets visitors to the Supreme Court building \njust across the street reads: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' That \ninscription is at the heart of the experience General Kagan would bring \nas the newest member of the High Court.\n  That experience includes a reputation as one of the Nation's foremost \nlegal minds; as a legal advisor to two Presidents; as the first woman \nto serve as Dean of Harvard Law School; and as the Nation's first \nfemale solicitor general.\n  It also includes more personal experiences, many of which mirror the \nlives of the American people she has committed her own life to serve.\n  She is the child of immigrants. She is the daughter and sister of \npublic schoolteachers, and she has been a teacher herself. She is an \nadvocate for her students. And she is a proponent of discussion and \ndebate that educates, respects and improves upon the lives of all it \nimpacts.\n  It is because of all of these experiences--as President Obama said on \nthe day he introduced her--that General Kagan will make the Nation's \nhighest Court ``more inclusive, more representative, more reflective of \nus as a people than ever before.''\n  I am confident that Solicitor General Kagan has the experience that \nwill make her a stellar Justice, and I look forward to casting my vote \nin favor of her confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come here today to discuss one of the \nmost important duties we exercise as Senators the confirmation of a \nUnited States Supreme Court Justice.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have a responsibility under the Constitution to \ndetermine if nominees to the Supreme Court are qualified for the job. \nIn making this determination, I consider a nominee's knowledge of the \nConstitution and the law as well as their ability to be deliberate and \nto hear every case that comes before them impartially and without \npersonal bias.\n  I believe Ms. Kagan passes that test and that she is qualified to \nserve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have made this decision after carefully reviewing the Judiciary \nCommittee record on her nomination and visiting with Ms. Kagan \npersonally on two occasions to discuss her nomination. I was impressed \nwith her knowledge, humility, and candidness, and I believe she was as \nforthcoming in our conversations as any individual whose Supreme Court \nnomination I have considered.\n  As Solicitor General for the United States, Elena Kagan served as the \nFederal Government's lawyer in chief, representing all Americans, \nincluding Arkansans, before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  A passion for public service and the law has been the driving force \nbehind her career. Elena Kagan is the first woman to serve as Solicitor \nGeneral, and the first woman to serve as the Dean of Harvard Law \nSchool. She previously worked in the Clinton White House as Deputy \nAssistant to the President for Domestic Policy and as Associate Counsel \nto the President. She spent several years in private practice after \nserving as a law clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia, and for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I believe the fact that Elena Kagan has not worked as a judge will \nbenefit the Court. She will bring a fresh voice and unique perspective \nto the discussion on cases that come before the Court. There is already \na persuasive precedent for a nominee with no judicial experience to \nserve on the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, 41 Supreme Court justices, \nincluding Chief Justice William Rehnquist, had no experience\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nserving on a lower federal or state court. And many former justices who \nalso did not previously work in the judicial branch have similar \nbackgrounds to that of Solicitor General Kagan.\n  Since Ms. Kagan was nominated for this position in May, I have heard \nfrom many Arkansans both for and against her confirmation. In terms of \nthe concerns that have been raised by those who oppose her \nconfirmation, I have examined her record regarding those issues and \nhave spoken to the nominee on two occasions to discuss those matters \nfurther. After careful thought and consideration in fulfilling my \nresponsibility to judge her fitnesss for this position, I have found \nnothing that I believe disqualifies her from being confirmed.\n  There is no doubt Elena Kagan holds the Constitution and the Court's \nprecedents in high regard. During her nomination hearings, Elena Kagan \nresponded to numerous questions about a variety of issues. In response \nto one question regarding recent Supreme Court rulings involving the \nSecond Amendment, she stated, ``there is no question that the Second \nAmendment guarantees Americans the individual right to possess and \ncarry weapons in case of confrontation.'' Further, General Kagan \nexplicitly said that the recent Heller and McDonald decisions that \nsecure a fundamental and individual right to own a firearm for self \nprotection is ``settled law.'' Ms. Kagan has personally assured me she \nhas no desire or intention of working to overturn either decision.\n  It is true Ms. Kagan has not promised how she would decide future \nSecond Amendment cases that may come before the Court. Neither Justice \nRoberts nor Justice Alito made any pledges or promises in that regard \neither during their confirmation hearings. To do so would betray one of \nthe basic foundations of our system of government which is a fair \nminded and independent judiciary. Further, after reviewing the \nJudiciary Committee hearing record for Ms. Kagan, Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito, in my view Ms. Kagan was as, if not more, forthcoming \nregarding her views on the Second Amendment than the two most recent \nnominees made by a Republican President.\n  One final comment General Kagan made to me during our last \nconversation about the Second Amendment was her desire to join Justice \nScalia on one of his hunting trips to get better acquainted with her \ncolleagues on the Court if she is confirmed. Sounds like a good idea to \nme.\n  Elena Kagan has also shared with me her deep respect and honor for \nthe military and the men and women in uniform who risk their lives to \ndefend our freedoms. Her father was a veteran, and she has taken with \nher the reverence for the military he instilled in her. In 2007, Elena \nKagan was invited to speak at West Point military academy, where she \nspoke to cadets about fidelity to the Constitution and the rule of law. \nGeneral Kagan said she accepted this invitation, something she rarely \ndoes, as an opportunity to thank the senior cadets for their \ncontributions and service to our country.\n  Both in our personal conversations and in her testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Ms. Kagan has explained her actions as Dean \nof Harvard Law School regarding military recruiting.\n  The bottom line for me is that Elena Kagan never denied military \nrecruiters access to students on campus and that she holds the men and \nwomen in uniform who fight to defend the freedoms we cherish as \nAmericans in high regard. Evidence of this is supported by military \nveterans themselves associated with the law school who have spoken \nfavorably of Ms. Kagan's treatment of students in the military and the \nmilitary in general. A group of Harvard Law School Iraq War Veterans \npublished a letter stating that Kagan, ``has created an environment \nthat is highly supportive of students who have served in the \nmilitary.''\n  It is also worth noting that Solicitor General Kagan is supported by \na long and distinguished list of law associations, organizations, \nmembers of Republican and Democratic administrations, unions, advocates \nand professionals. The list of supporters even includes every former \nSolicitor General since 1985, including Ted Olsen and Ken Starr.\n  As I have said with previous Supreme Court nominees selected by two \ndifferent Presidents, I won't agree with every decision that he or she \nmakes. However, the standard for evaluating Supreme Court nominees \nshould be whether he or she is qualified for the job and is prepared to \nplace the law and the integrity of our Constitution ahead of any \npersonal or political beliefs he or she may have. I believe Ms. Kagan \nmeets that standard which is why I will support her confirmation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to serve as Associate Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court. A lifetime appointment to the highest \nCourt in the land is a serious matter, and confirming each Justice is \none of the most solemn duties of any Senator.\n  When I sat down with her, I was struck by Ms. Kagan's obvious \nintelligence and candor. It was also obvious that her wealth of \nprofessional experience has given her a real reverence for our \ncountry's rule of law. As the confirmation process went on, I paid \nclose attention to the answers Ms. Kagan gave to my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee in her hearing. What comes across loud and clear \nwhen one listens to Ms. Kagan is that she has a strong belief in the \nConstitution and an understanding of its purpose to serve and protect \nthe American people.\n  Throughout the arduous process of being a Supreme Court nominee, Ms. \nKagan has impressed me at every turn with her intellect, integrity, and \nindependence. These are fundamental traits our Nation needs in every \nmember of the highest Court in the land.\n  But being a Supreme Court Justice requires more than surviving the \nconfirmation process. If confirmed, Ms. Kagan would be ruling on the \nmost important and urgent matters facing our Nation. Her voice would \ncarry with it the rich and varied background of professional experience \nthat would sound a note of true intellectual independence.\n  Although some have found fault with the fact that she has never \nserved as a judge, I have never believed that lack of prior judicial \nexperience should stop someone from serving with distinction on the \nCourt. After all, some of our greatest jurists had no experience as a \njudge--Justices John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and \nWilliam Rehnquist among them. In place of that singular legal \nexperience, Ms. Kagan brings expertise that she has earned in all three \nbranches of government, as well as the private sector as an attorney in \nprivate practice and as the dean of Harvard Law School.\n  In talking with Ms. Kagan, I came away confident that she well \nunderstands the proper role of a judge and will not attempt to \nlegislate from the bench. I discussed with Ms. Kagan her views and \napproach to some of the important issues the Court will address in \nupcoming years, such as national security, the limits of executive \npower, and the protection of civil liberties.\n  I also spoke with Ms. Kagan about an issue of particular concern to \nOregonians one which they have endorsed twice at the ballot box--the \nright to control end-of-life decisions. Oregon voters twice approved \ndeath with dignity ballot measures. I have long believed that their \ndecision should be respected by the courts, and I am pleased the \nSupreme Court has agreed with that view. While not taking a position on \nspecific questions that could come before the Court, Ms. Kagan \nreassured me that she sees this as Oregonians do. She believes end-of-\nlife decisions are protected by constitutional privacy rights, and she \nbelieves the Federal Government should not contravene State laws that \nprotect individual rights on this issue.\n  Finally, I was also comfortable with the way Ms. Kagan explained her \nviews on a frequently litigated constitutional issue, the limits of \ncongressional power to act under the commerce clause. Ms. Kagan's \nanswers assured me she has a very thorough and nuanced understanding of \ncommerce clause jurisprudence and that she will rule on commerce \nauthority cases with both deference and wisdom.\n  I am convinced, based on everything I have heard, that Ms. Kagan \npossesses the intellect, integrity, and independence to serve as an \nextraordinary Justice on the Supreme Court. With the retirement of \nJustice Stevens, Ms. Kagan certainly has large shoes to fill.\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\nBut I have no doubt she is more than up to the task, and our country's \nlaws will be safely guarded in her hands. That is why Elena Kagan has \nmy support, and I will vote to confirm her as an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan as Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. By any objective standard, Elena Kagan offers a well-rounded \ncombination of academic legal expertise and real world application of \nlaw and public policy. The President has nominated Ms. Kagan to a job \nshe may hold for three decades or more, and in which she will have the \nopportunity to touch the lives of Americans in countless ways. So just \nbeing an intelligent and hard-working public servant is not enough for \nthis vital position. That is why I have taken my time and my \nresponsibility seriously, to thoroughly review her record before \ndeciding to support her.\n  Decisions by the Supreme Court have immediate impacts on the lives of \neveryday Americans when the rulings are handed down. These decisions \nmay continue to play a role in the lives of Americans for generations. \nConsidering my vote on a Supreme Court nominee, a task I will perform \nsoon for the second time in my brief Senate career, is a duty I take \nvery seriously.\n  I approach this decision from the perspective of a government chief \nexecutive. It is the constitutional role of the President to nominate \nSupreme Court justices. In the case of a nominee to the Federal courts, \nespecially to the Supreme Court, this choice is not about a President's \nability to carry out a stated agenda. Rather, justices on the highest \ncourt in the land are there to protect and interpret the Constitution, \nso the highest standards must be applied.\n  In my meeting with Solicitor General Kagan, I found her to be \nintelligent and engaging, and open to hearing my thoughts on what is \nimportant to Alaskans. I listened as Ms. Kagan described the way she \napproached legal issues, and heard from her an approach to the law and \nthe Constitution that indicated she will not be an activist judge. I \nagree with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Lindsay Graham, \nwho said the job of a senator is not to second guess the President's \njudgment in selecting Supreme Court nominees, but to determine if the \ncandidate is qualified, of good character and understands the \ndifference between being a judge and a politician. Ms. Kagan is such a \nperson.\n  For me as an Alaskan, there were some issues I needed to make front \nand center in our discussion, especially the rights we enjoy and which \nthe Supreme Court has recently spoken to under the second amendment of \nthe Constitution.\n  Alaskans take their second amendment rights very seriously. In a \nState where the daily life for many includes subsistence hunting, \npersonal protection and basic survival, our right to keep and bear arms \nis not an academic question. It is a fundamental part of our lives. The \nState of Alaska has gone so far as to pass laws requiring firearms be \nkept in survival gear carried in private airplanes. Unlike much of the \n``Lower 48,'' the wilderness in Alaska is reachable within minutes from \neven our largest cities. Even in the greater Anchorage area encounters \nwith wildlife are commonplace and serious injuries occur regularly. \nThat is why firearm ownership and use in Alaska transcends the debates \nin Washington over what the second amendment means.\n  Much of the opposition to Ms. Kagan's nomination has focused on what \nsome charged was her alleged lack of support for second amendment \nrights. Some oppose Ms. Kagan's nomination because she worked for \nJustice Thurgood Marshall and President Bill Clinton. When she was \nasked by Judiciary Chairman Leahy if, after the Supreme Court's \ndecisions in Heller and McDonald that the second amendment secures an \nindividual's fundamental right to own a firearm and use it for self-\ndefense, Ms. Kagan's response could not have been more clear: ``There \nis no doubt, Senator Leahy. That is binding precedent and entitled to \nall respect to binding precedent in any case. That is settled law.'' \nInstead of second-guessing or making assumptions about her views, I am \ntaking Ms. Kagen at her word.\n  Even before the Court's decision in McDonald applied the reasoning of \nHeller beyond the District of Columbia, Ms. Kagan was clear about the \nfundamental nature of the rights protected by the Second Amendment. \nDuring her confirmation hearing to be Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan \nresponded to a question about the meaning of Heller from Senator \nGrassley: ``There is no question, after Heller, that the second \namendment guarantees Americans the individual right to possess and \ncarry weapons in case of confrontation.''' In subsequent questioning, \nMs. Kagan responded regarding Heller that she would give that decision \nand its reasoning ``the full measure of respect that is due to all \nconstitutional decisions of the Court.''\n  What Elena Kagan said about the second amendment, especially in light \nof the Heller and McDonald decisions that I supported, cannot be \nconsidered anti-gun, or anti-second smendment.\n  In our meeting, I also asked Ms. Kagan about unique status of Alaska \nNative people and issues. I pointed out that Alaska is home to nearly \nhalf the 562 federal recognized tribes in the United States and that \nAlaska Natives comprise nearly 20 percent of our State's population. \nMs. Kagan admitted to being no expert in ``Indian law,'' but expressed \na willingness to learn about the challenges and opportunities facing \nAlaska Native people. She also expressed support for encouraging the \ncourts to adopt procedures making it easier for people whose first \nlanguage may not be English to understand court proceedings.\n  Another significant issue for Alaskans is the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the Exxon Valdez case. Thousands of Alaskans were damaged \nby that oil spill, yet Exxon took every possible advantage in the U.S. \ncourt system to delay payment of damages as long as they could. As a \nresult, an estimated 20 percent of those damaged by the spill died \nbefore they could collect any compensation. Ms. Kagan agreed with the \ntragedy of that case and expressed frustration with it dragging on so \nlong.\n  Mr. President, because of what I have learned in looking at the \ncareer and record of Ms. Kagan, and reviewing her statements and \ntestimony on matters that are important to the people of Alaska I am \nprivileged to serve, I am pleased to confirm Elena Kagan as an \nAssociate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to be the next Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. After a careful and considered \nreview of her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her \noverall record, and my personal meeting with her in May, I have \nconcluded that General Kagan should be confirmed as the next Associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court.\n  General Kagan would succeed Justice John Paul Stevens who has served \nour country as a decorated war veteran, a distinguished Federal \nappellate judge, and a Supreme Court Justice for nearly 35 years. I \nappreciate his service to our Nation, and believe that all of us in \npublic service can learn from his dignified manner and sound advice to \n``understand before disagreeing.''\n  As with the previous nominees to the Court that I have had the \nresponsibility to review, I have not arrived at my decision lightly. It \nhas been said that, of all the entities in government, the Supreme \nCourt is the most closely identified with the Constitution--and that no \nother branch or agency has as great an opportunity to speak directly to \nthe rational and moral side of the American character; to bring the \npower and moral authority of government to bear directly upon the \ncitizenry.\n  The Supreme Court passes final legal judgment on the most profound \nsocial issues of our time. The Court is uniquely designed to accept \nonly those cases that present a substantial and compelling question of \nFederal law; cases for which the Court's ultimate resolution will not \nbe applied merely to a single, isolated dispute--but, rather, will \nguide legislatures, executives, and all other courts in their broader \ndevelopment and interpretation of law and policy. Ours is a government \nof liberty and order, of State and Federal authority, and of checks and \nbalances, and the remarkable challenge of calibrating these fundamental \nbalance\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\npoints is entrusted ultimately to the nine Justices.\n  To help meet this extraordinary challenge, any nominee for the Court \nmust, as I stated for previous nominees under both Republican and \nDemocrat administrations, have a powerful intellect, a principled \nunderstanding of the Court's role, and a sound commitment to judicial \nmethod. A nominee must have the capacity to engender respect among the \nother Justices in order to facilitate the consensus of a majority. And \nto warrant Senate confirmation, the nominee must have a keen \nunderstanding of, and a disciplined respect for, the great body of law \nthat precedes her.\n  It is with these high standards that we should also evaluate the \nrecord of General Kagan to serve as the Court's 112th Justice. General \nKagan is a distinguished graduate from Princeton, Harvard, and Oxford \nUniversities where she earned several distinct honors. She served as a \nlaw clerk to two judges, United States Court of Appeals Judge Abner \nMikva and United States Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. \nGeneral Kagan then worked in private practice as an associate at a \nleading D.C. law firm and a law professor at two of the Nation's most \nregarded law schools.\n  General Kagan has also served as a special counsel for the Senate \nJudiciary Committee; a lawyer in the Office of the Counsel to a \nPresident; a policy advisor to a President; and dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool. Most importantly, she has served as the 45th Solicitor General \nof the United States where she has participated in six oral arguments \nand overseen briefs and certiorari petitions in approximately 100 \ncases.\n  For her work as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan has won the support of \nevery one of the 10 Solicitors General who have served since 1985, \nincluding 5 Republican appointees. She has also earned the support of \nover 50 deputy and assistant solicitors general who have served over \nthe last 42 years.\n  As these highly skilled professionals have noted, the ``job of \nSolicitor General provides an opportunity to grapple with almost the \nfull gamut of issues that come before the Supreme Court and requires an \nunderstanding of the Court's approach to numerous issues from the \ncriteria for certiorari review to the Justices' approach to oral \nargument. The constant interaction with the Supreme Court that comes \nwith being the most-frequent litigator before the Court also ensures an \nappreciation for the rhythms and traditions of the Court and its \nworkload.''\n  Prior to her 15 months as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan had relatively \nlittle experience as an active practitioner. The American Bar \nAssociation's principle expectation for a Federal appellate nominee is \n``at least'' 12 years experience actually practicing law, and even now \nshe continues to fall short of that. This is due in part to the fact \nthat she does not appear to have performed any amicus curiae or pro \nbono work while serving as a law professor.\n  Such practical experience often helps the Justices remain connected \nto the effect of their decisions on the lives of everyday people. All \nSupreme Court Justices, regardless of judicial philosophy, weigh the \nConstitution's text, history, context and precedents when deciding the \nlandmark cases. Active practice of law experience helps with that \nprocess because, as prior Justices and distinguished scholars alike \nhave observed, the Justices' decisions in landmark cases are inevitably \n``channeled and constrained by who [they] are and what they have lived \nthrough.''\n  General Kagan has not given us the clearest insight into those \nexperiences that she has ``lived through'' that will ``channel and \nconstrain'' her sense of constitutional boundaries. At the same time, I \nfind that her experience in working at the highest levels of all three \nbranches of government will provide her with valuable insights as she \napproaches her work on the Court. I also accept her comments from our \npersonal meeting that she did indeed have a ``formative experience'' as \na young lawyer in learning that ``behind legal questions are real \npeople with real lives.''\n  As regards General Kagan's lack of prior judicial service, I do not \nfind that to be disqualifying. Nearly 40 Justices have served on the \nCourt without prior judicial experience, including in more recent times \nLouis Brandeis, Hugo Black, Robert Jackson, Earl Warren, Lewis Powell, \nand William Rehnquist. Especially on the current Court where all of the \nexisting members come from the Federal appellate courts, General Kagan \nshould bring a new and different perspective.\n  This brings us to the additional factors we must consider when \nproviding our consent on a President's nominee for Associate Justice--\njudicial temperament, methodology, integrity and philosophy. By their \nvery nature, these attributes are often challenging to measure, but \nthey can be assessed through a careful analysis of a nominee's complete \nrecord.\n  With regard to the first consideration, judicial temperament, we all \nagree that it is absolutely essential that a judge be fair, open-minded \nand respectful. Our citizens simply must have confidence that a judge \nwho weighs their legal claims does so with an even temperament. A judge \nmust be truly committed to providing a full and fair day in court, \nwhile projecting a sincere equanimity and respect for the law. When \nthese attributes are not clearly present in our judges, the public \njustifiably begins to lose faith in the integrity of our courts.\n  By all accounts, whether from conservative former Solicitors General \nKen Starr and Ted Olson, and Assistant Solicitor General Miguel \nEstrada, General Kagan has a clear reputation for a sound judicial \ntemperament. She projected poise throughout this process, during her \nhearing and in our personal meeting. Likewise, she has testified and \nspoken about the necessity of courts to provide a ``level playing \nfield,'' of maintaining a fidelity to the law, and of the \nessential requirement not to prejudge any case, stating during her \nhearing that judging is about ``what the law says, whether it's the \nConstitution or whether it's a statute . . . the question is always \nwhat the law says . . . it's what the text of the Constitution says . . \n. what the law says, not a judge's personal views.''\n\n  Turning to the considerations of judicial methodology and integrity, \nGeneral Kagan does not have a judicial service record to review. We \ncan, however, examine her scholarship. Here, she has six scholarly \narticles, two scholarly book reviews and a variety of other \ncommentaries. I have some concern that this collection is, by \nacademia's standards, not especially prodigious, and that General Kagan \ndid not continue her scholarship during her six years as Harvard's \ndean.\n  Her eight scholarly publications do, however, tackle the difficult \nsubjects of Presidential power, the delegation doctrine, and hate \nspeech. In particular, her Presidential Administration and Chevron's \nNon-delegation Doctrine article from 2001, as well as The Changing \nFaces of First Amendment Neutrality article from 1992, demonstrate both \nclose attention to complicated legal detail and careful legal \nanalysis--skills essential for the difficult work of the Court.\n  We can also review her approach to judicial methodology from her \nanswer to my request to identify three of the Court's constitutional \nopinions--majority, concurring or dissenting--that in her view \nexemplify sound judicial methodology. First, General Kagan chose \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes' 1905 dissenting opinion in Lochner v. \nNew York. In that case, the Court invalidated a State law prohibiting \nan employer from requiring a baker to work more than 60 hours per week. \nThe Court reasoned that the statute ``necessarily interferes with the \nright of contract between the employer and employees,'' a right that is \n``part of the liberty of the individual'' protected by the 14th \namendment.\n  General Kagan cited this opinion as a ``concise and persuasive \nformulation of the proper role of the judiciary in relation to the \npolitical branches of government,'' highlighting these passages:\n\n       I strongly believe that my agreement or disagreement [with \n     the law] has nothing to do with the right of a majority to \n     embody their opinions in law. . . . The Constitution is . . . \n     made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the \n     accident of our finding certain opinions natural and \n     familiar, or novel, and even shocking, ought not to conclude \n     our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying \n     them conflict with the Constitution of the United States. \n     [Justices should not use their office] to prevent the natural \n     outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a \n     rational\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\n     and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute \n     proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have \n     been understood by the traditions of our people and our law.\n\n  Next, General Kagan selected a 1927 concurring opinion in Whitney v. \nCalifornia where the Court unanimously upheld a conviction for conduct \nthreatening to overthrow our government by unlawful means. Calling the \nconcurrence an ``inspiring example of a commitment to protecting \nconstitutional rights'' and a ``stirring reminder of the value of \nfreedom of speech in our society, including its importance to \ndemocratic self-governance,'' General Kagan cited her admiration for \nthis paragraph:\n\n       Those who won our independence believed that the final end \n     of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties, \n     and that in its government the deliberative forces should \n     prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an \n     end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of \n     happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They \n     believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as \n     you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread \n     of political truth; that without free speech and assembly \n     discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion \n     affords ordinarily adequate protection against the \n     dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace \n     to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a \n     political duty; and that this should be a fundamental \n     principle of the American government. They recognized the \n     risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they \n     knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of \n     punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to \n     discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds \n     repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces \n     stable government; that the path of safety lies in the \n     opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and \n     proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil \n     counsels is good ones.\n\n  Finally, General Kagan identified a 1952 concurring opinion in \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. There, the Court held that \nPresident Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he ordered \nthe Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the Nation's \nsteel mills in the face of a labor strike during the Korean war. \nRespecting a concurring opinion as the ``definitive framework for \nevaluating the constitutionality of presidential action,'' General \nKagan observed that:\n\n       Two aspects of the opinion are notable. First, Justice \n     [Robert] Jackson's opinion is a classic formulation of the \n     propositions that executive authority is not unlimited even \n     in wartime and that the President is not above the law. That \n     is all the more remarkable given that its author had served \n     in the Executive Branch for much of his career, including as \n     Solicitor General and Attorney General. Second, Justice \n     Jackson refused to oversimplify constitutional analysis. . . \n     . [H]is analysis depended in large measure on an assessment \n     of relevant historical practices and political processes. \n     That analysis was resolutely legal in its nature; it was not \n     based on the Justice's political preferences or personal \n     views. But the analysis took into account the full \n     complexities of constitutional interpretation in its relation \n     to modern governance. That is what has given Justice \n     Jackson's concurrence its staying power and has made it the \n     Court's principal precedent on executive power.\n\n  These three replies by General Kagan are informative. Together they \nargue for a limited judicial role, and demonstrate her command of the \nphilosophical underpinnings of core constitutional doctrine and her \ninsight into the necessity of aligning those theories with the \nfunctional ``complexities of modern governance.'' They also convey an \nawareness of, and therefore perhaps a capacity for, judicial \nstatesmanship. As Justice Felix Frankfurter once noted, ``breadth of \nvision'' and ``capacity to transcend one's own experience'' are often \nthe defining qualities that matter most in guiding a Justice's work on \nlandmark cases.\n  As regards her views on substantive subjects of law, conservative \nattorneys such as Charles Fried, Michael McConnell and Paul Clement \nhave agreed that General Kagan is in the mainstream. For example, she \nhas affirmed forcefully that stare decisis is a critical command for \nthe Court. As she wrote to the committee, that command requires a \ncareful inquiry into whether the precedent has ``been found unworkable, \nwhether subsequent legal developments have left the rule an \nanachronism, or whether premises of fact are so far different from \nthose initially assumed as to render the rule irrelevant or \nunjustifiable.'' Moreover, she testified that:\n\n       The entire idea of precedent is that you can think a \n     decision is wrong. You can have decided it differently if you \n     had been on the court when that decision was made. And \n     nonetheless you are bound by that decision. That's--if the \n     doctrine of precedent enabled you to overturn every decision \n     that you thought was wrong, it wouldn't be much of a \n     doctrine. . . . I think when the court looks as though it's \n     flipping around and changing sides just because the justices \n     have changed, that's bad for the credibility of the \n     institution and it's bad for the system of law.\n\n  General Kagan has also stated that the Constitution protects a right \nof privacy and that Roe v. Wade is not only ``settled law'' but has \nbeen ``doubly settled'' by Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Likewise, she \nhas stated that foreign law should not have precedential weight in \n``any but a very, very narrow set of circumstances,'' such as limited \ncases involving ``ambassadors'' or the ``law of war.'' And finally, she \nhas testified, as noted above, that Youngstown Sheet & Tube remains the \n``determinative'' governing standard in assessing Presidential wartime \npowers.\n  With respect to the second amendment, in my view, as a long-time, \nardent supporter of second amendment rights, I have carefully examined \nGeneral Kagan's work as the President's attorney a decade ago on a \nvariety of legislation affecting gun ownership rights. This is a fair \nquestion and, here, General Kagan testified as follows:\n\n       The work that I did in the Clinton White House was all work \n     . . . before Heller was decided, and so we really . . . did \n     not consider . . . regulations through the Heller prism . . . \n     because Heller didn't exist at that time. . . . What \n     President Clinton was trying to do back in the 1990s and what \n     I as his policy aide was trying to help him do, was to \n     propose a set of regulations that had very strong support in \n     the law enforcement community, that had actually bipartisan \n     support here in Congress to keep guns out of the hands of \n     criminals, to keep guns out of the hands of insane people. It \n     was very much an anti-crime set of proposals that I worked on \n     back then in the '90s.\n\n  A former White House colleague corroborated General Kagan's \ntestimony: ``In all these cases, [President] Clinton had already \nsettled views on these questions. Our job was to make sure the \ngovernment's policy reflected what he wanted. He'd already made up his \nmind on most of these contentious issues.''\n  As several members of the committee during General Kagan's hearing \nnoted, this same point--that a lawyer's job is to represent the \nclient's views, and not the lawyer's own views--was also made by \nJustices Roberts and Alito when they were asked during their \nconfirmation hearings about advice they gave while serving as executive \nbranch attorneys. Both nominees testified that their executive branch \nlegal counsel reflected ways to advance their elected client's, not \ntheir own personal, legal interests and policy preferences.\n  With respect to the fact that, more recently, General Kagan did not \nfile a brief for the United States in McDonald v. City of Chicago--\nMcDonald did present an important question regarding the interplay of \nthe second and 14th amendments, and I joined an amicus brief in support \nof Mr. McDonald's claim to incorporate the second amendment through the \n14th amendment, so that the protections of the second amendment would \napply not just against Federal acts, but against the acts of State and \nlocal governments as well. Here, several observations are warranted.\n  First, McDonald presented only the question of whether the second \namendment applied to State and local governments, and not what the \nscope of the protections of the amendment is. As a result, McDonald, \nunlike Heller, presented no implications for the constitutionality of \nFederal gun laws. Accordingly, the United States was not a party in the \ncase.\n  Second, the issue of incorporation is by its very nature one of \nprimarily State and local, and not Federal, concern. This explains the \namicus brief signed by 38 States in this case. This also explains why \nthe Solicitor General's Office has a tradition of not weighing in on \nincorporation cases. General Kagan wrote to the committee in response \nto a supplemental question that:\n\n       It has long been the practice of the Office of the \n     Solicitor General not to file an amicus brief in cases \n     concerning the application of a constitutional provision to \n     the states (so-called incorporation cases). Although \n     incorporation cases raise important issues of constitutional \n     interpretation, and may matter\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\n     greatly to individual citizens, those issues do not implicate \n     the responsibilities and obligations of the federal \n     government under the Constitution. Incorporation cases \n     therefore do not fall within the category of cases in which \n     the Office of the Solicitor General files amicus briefs: \n     those where the federal government itself has a clear and \n     specific interest in the resolution of the case.\n\n  This response is consistent with the reported statement of former \nSolicitor General Erwin Griswold, who was uniquely appointed by a \nDemocratic President, President Johnson, and retained by his Republican \nsuccessor, President Nixon. In 1970, General Griswold reportedly wrote \nthat incorporation cases are rarely of direct interest to the Federal \ngovernment because ``fundamental considerations of federalism militate \nagainst executive intrusion'' into issues of State and local law.\n  Further, although former Solicitor General Paul Clement did appear in \nHeller for the United States, under the Bush administration, Heller was \nnot an incorporation case. Moreover, the broader question presented by \nHeller, unlike McDonald, did implicate the basic scheme of Federal \nfirearms regulations.\n  Yet even then, General Clement argued in Heller for a somewhat \nnarrower ruling regarding personal rights. He also argued for a \nsomewhat higher level of judicial scrutiny of challenges to regulation \nof such rights in order to ensure that the longstanding existing \nFederal laws--like possession of machine guns, possession by convicted \nfelons, or possession on Federal property--that his office is required \nto defend were protected. A majority of the Court ultimately respected \nand accepted General Clement's concern in both Heller and McDonald. As \nSenator Cornyn noted at the hearing, Justice Alito wrote for the \nmajority in McDonald that:\n\n       We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast \n     doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \n     `prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the \n     mentally ill, . . . laws forbidding the carrying of firearms \n     in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, \n     or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the \n     commercial sale of arms.' We repeat those assurances here; . \n     . . incorporation does not imperil every law regulating \n     firearms.\n\n  Perhaps most importantly, General Kagan testified repeatedly that \nboth McDonald and Heller are settled law. As regards McDonald, General \nKagan said, ``I do think that . . . decision [McDonald] [is] settled \nlaw; entitled to all of the weight that any precedent of the Supreme \nCourt has; [and] . . . can only be overturned if there is strong \nevidence the ruling [among all of the other stare decisis factors] is \nunworkable.''\n  On Heller, she said: ``I think that Heller is settled law and Heller \nhas decided that the Second Amendment confers such an individual right \nto keep and bear arms. I have absolutely no reason to think that the \ncourt's analysis was incorrect in any way. I accept the court's \nanalysis and will apply it going forward.'' She also said that Heller's \nfinding that a personal right of possession is ``deeply rooted in this \nNation's history and traditions'' is a ``central part of the \nrationale'' of Heller and, again, is ``settled law.''\n  Moreover, she testified that she has ``never believed that the \npresident had the power to prohibit [the sale of firearms] without \nlegislative authorization. . . . In fact, that's one [issue] that \nHeller and McDonald don't effect, that the president didn't have that \npower before and doesn't have that power after.'' She also testified \nthat ``the Second Amendment question, as defined by Heller, was so \npeculiar to our own constitutional history and heritage that . . . \nforeign law didn't have any relevance.''\n  Turning to another important issue, I also share the concern for how \nGeneral Kagan approached the issue of military recruiting at Harvard \nLaw School. Under the Solomon amendment, universities like Harvard that \nreceive Federal funding are required to permit military recruiters on \ncampus. Opposing the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, General \nKagan was one of several deans to relegate military recruiters to a \nless preferred position by withholding Office of Career Services' \nsponsorship.\n  General Kagan also participated in a lawsuit challenging the Solomon \namendment as unconstitutional. Had she prevailed in that suit, colleges \nand universities across the country could have denied the military on-\ncampus access to students across the country. Fortunately, the Supreme \nCourt summarily and unanimously rejected this challenge in 2006 in \nRumsfeld v. F.A.I.R.\n  General Kagan continues to defend her decision as a difficult \nmediation of competitive on-campus interests. But the prevailing \nrecognition here is that the Nation was fully engaged in two wars \ndesigned to advance national security, and so I continue to be troubled \nthat General Kagan chose to relegate the military rather than her \ninstitution's financial or policy interests.\n  Reviewing the final consideration of judicial philosophy, General \nKagan has spoken directly to the important but appropriately limited \nrole that the Court plays in our constitutional scheme of government. \nShe recognizes that the Court is the ``least accountable'' of our \ngovernmental institutions and that the Court is not ``self-starting.'' \nCiting Alexander Bickel and his 1961 seminal article, General Kagan \nstated in our personal meeting that the ``passive virtue'' of the Court \nrests in what it does not do, and that the Court should work hard ``not \ndo more than is called for'' and ``not go too far.'' Likewise, she said \nin her questionnaire that ``I think it is a great deal better for the \nelected branches to take the lead in creating a more just society than \nfor courts to do so.''\n\n  We recently witnessed what happens when the Court does not adhere to \nsuch decision-making restraints. We are all familiar with Citizens \nUnited v. F.E.C. where the Court overruled a mere 7-year-old precedent \nto strike down the electioneering communications provision of the \nBipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.\n  There, the majority effectively converted on its own motion an as-\napplied challenge into a facial challenge through its order for re-\nargument. According no deference to our 100,000-page factfinding record \nthat took Congress over 10 years to assemble, and further dismissing \nthe commands of stare decisis, the majority then rejected the \nrelatively recent 1990 precedent of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \nCommerce and the very recent 2003 precedent of McConnell v. F.E.C. \nInstead, the majority inflated the precedential value of the majority's \nvery recent--only decided in 2006--and readily distinguishable F.E.C. \nv. Wisconsin Right to Life and eschewed arguments to decide the case on \nnarrower statutory grounds. Consequently, and in striking contrast to \nclaims of ``judicial modesty,'' the majority then struck down the \nelectioneering communications provision of BCRA on the broadest of \ngrounds.\n  Even granting that General Kagan was an advocate in the case, I was \npleased to hear her say in our personal meeting that the Citizens' \nmajority ``did not respond in the right way. Congress had gone through \nan enormous record and the Court had ruled only a few years earlier. \nFrom where I sat, the Court was wrong.''\n  I also agree with Justice Stevens' dissent in Citizens that the \nactivist ``path'' taken by the Citizens'' majority will ``do damage'' \nto the Court itself. Citizens is not, of course, the only recent case \nin which Justices and scholars from across the political spectrum have \nviewed the Court's majority as overreaching. Indeed, opinions in \nMontejo v. Louisiana, Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, and related commentaries have all expressed the same concern.\n  Finally, I note that, if confirmed, General Kagan will become the \nfourth female Justice ever to serve on the Supreme Court. She will \nfollow Sandra Day O'Conner and join Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and \nSonia Sotomayor. General Kagan has already become the first woman to \nserve as Solicitor General of the United States, and the fact remains \nthat it does make a difference who women and girls see at the pinnacles \nof government and industry. As Justice Ginsburg observed at the time of \nJustice Sotomayor's nomination, ``women belong in all places where \ndecisions are being made.''\n  Ultimately, when the Framers accorded us the special role of \nconfirming judicial nominees that we are exercising here today, having \ndelegated the power of nomination to the Office of the President, and \nhaving recognized that elections to that office may affect the overall \ncomposition of the Court, the Framers expressly intended that\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\nwe review judicial nominees not by their affiliations, but by their \nqualifications. This is why Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 76 \nthat the Senate should deprive a duly elected President of his or her \nnominee only for ``special and strong reasons.''\n  In reviewing the record of General Kagan's scholarship, the to, \nevidence of her reputation, and her responses to the committee and \nother Members throughout this process, I find in that General Kagan has \na very capable intellect and a deep respect for the rule of law. She \nhas a command of the important but limited role of the courts, and a \ndemonstrated commitment to stability in the law. It is therefore my \nconclusion that Solicitor General Elena Kagan is qualified to serve as \nthe next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I express my \nstrong support for the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to \nbe the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. A \ntrailblazer in many ways, Solicitor Kagan was the first female to serve \nas Solicitor General of the United States and the first female Dean of \nHarvard Law School, one of the most prestigious legal educational \ninstitutions in our Nation. Her nomination as Solicitor General \ngarnered the bipartisan support of every Solicitor General who served \nfrom 1985 to 2009, including Charles Fried, Ken Starr, Drew Days, \nWalter Dellinger, Seth Waxman, Ted Olson, Paul Clement, and Greg Garre, \na testament to her ability to build bridges across partisan lines and \nher fidelity to law above politics.\n  Solicitor Kagan brings a wealth of historic legal experience to the \nposition of Associate Justice, including serving as law clerk to \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to serve on the \nSupreme Court, working as an associate at the law firm of Williams & \nConnolly, teaching as a law professor at the University of Chicago and \nHarvard University, and acting as policy counsel to President Clinton \nand special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In these \ncapacities she handled legal and policy issues ranging from public \nhealth, to education, to war crimes, to campaign finance and welfare.\n  Solicitor Kagan's experience with different branches of government \nequips her with a unique perspective on the law and the challenges the \nCourt will face in the coming years. Her confirmation honors the legacy \nof Justice John Paul Stevens, the outgoing Justice, who was well known \nfor his service of dignity and intellect, without regard for partisan \ndivides.\n  If we confirm her--and I am confident we will--Solicitor Kagan will \nbe only the fourth woman in history to serve on the Supreme Court, and \nwill be the third woman to sit on the current Court, the highest number \nof female justices to serve at one time.\n  Solicitor Kagan's confirmation will be an inspiration for generations \nof female lawyers and legal scholars to come, and will make an \nindelible impression on this country's legal landscape. Today, women \ncomprise only 19.2 percent of federal district court judgeships, and 20 \npercent of federal appellate judgeships, highlighting the need for \nincreased gender representation on our Nation's highest courts. \nSolicitor Kagan's confirmation is only a step towards reducing this \ngender disparity in our Nation's judiciary.\n  I followed closely Solicitor Kagan's hearings, and I am impressed by \nSolicitor Kagan's commitment to respect the rule of law. The hearings \nfor Solicitor Kagan, who testified for more than 17 hours and answered \nover 540 questions, were thorough and fair. In her opening statement, \nSolicitor Kagan observed that, ``the Supreme Court's role in our \nsociety is to act as a safeguard to the rule of law by maintaining a \ncommitment to impartiality, principle, and restraint; and the role of a \nSupreme Court justice is to approach each case with even-handedness and \nfair-mindedness, to ensure that everyone who comes before the Court \nreceives a fair shake.''\n  Solicitor Kagan also expressed her admiration for Justice Thurgood \nMarshal; under whom she clerked, for his view of the Supreme Court as a \nmeans of access to justice for those left without redress after unfair \ntreatment. Her expressed judicial philosophy of impartiality and \nfairness, to individuals of all classes, income levels, and interests, \nis a critical component to the High Court in a climate where we see \nincreasing judicial activeness and partiality to special interests.\n  Solicitor Kagan's experiences as a scholar and policy advisor \nunquestionably qualify her for a position on the Supreme Court. I find \nit disingenuous that several of my conservative colleagues have \nattacked Solicitor Kagan's lack of judicial experience. The last two of \nthe previous four chief justices of the Supreme Court, William \nRehnquist and Earl Warren, had no judicial experience when first \nnominated to the Court. Nor did, Felix Frankfurter, Louis Brandeis, and \nJohn Marshall, known as the ``Great Chief Justice.'' Over one-third of \nthe past 111 Supreme Court justices had no judicial experience when \nthey were first nominated. Rather than being a product of the judicial \nmonastery, Solicitor Kagan brings a real world perspective on the role \nof a justice, with a view to the practical contexts and implications of \nthe Court's decisions. Solicitor Kagan's two decades of experience \nworking in every branch of government exceptionally qualify her as an \nAssociate Justice, and as one of the top legal thinkers in the country.\n  My conservative colleagues have also criticized Solicitor Kagan's \nenforcement of Harvard Law School's anti-discrimination policy. \nSolicitor Kagan did not assert her own personal agenda and oppose \nmilitary recruitment on campus, as several of my colleagues have \nalleged. Instead, as Dean, Kagan was charged with enforcing an anti-\ndiscrimination policy in effect at Harvard since 1979 that prevented \norganizations discriminating against selected individuals from \nrecruiting through the school's office of career services. Kagan's \nenforcement of this policy was consistent with her predecessors, Dean \nRobert Clark and Harvard President Larry Summers. However, Kagan \nensured that military recruiters still had access to students. Kagan \nnoted, ``[M]ilitary recruiters had access to Harvard students every \nsingle day I was dean . . . I'm confident that the military had access \nto our students and our students had access to the military throughout \nmy entire deanship.'' Solicitor Kagan's work to ensure student access \ndemonstrates her support of our military and her encouragement of the \nbrightest students' involvement in our Armed Services.\n  Solicitor's Kagan's widespread support is a testament to her impact \non not only her colleagues and peers, but also upon a large number of \nthose in the legal profession. The American Bar Association, after \nconducting an investigation over several weeks that included peer \nreviews, concluded that Solicitor Kagan merited its highest rating of \nunanimously ``well qualified.'' To merit the Committee's rating of \n``well qualified,'' a Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member \nof the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and exceptional \nbreadth of experience, and meet the very highest standards of \nintegrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.\n  In addition, Solicitor Kagan has received support from Democrats and \nRepublicans and a range of civil rights, non-profit, and advocacy \norganizations, including the National Women's Law Center, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, Earthjustice, the American Bar \nAssociation, the Alliance for Justice, the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nthe National Association of Women Judges, the Hispanic Bar Association, \nthe Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCR). Solicitor Kagan is also \nendorsed by her colleagues in academia, and a group of over sixty-nine \nlaw school deans across the country expressed their written support for \nher nomination to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a June 15, 2010 \nletter. Her supporters also include her former students, including one, \na former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, who called Solicitor \nKagan, ``a person of utmost integrity, extraordinary legal talent and \nrelentless generosity.''\n  Solicitor Kagan's intellectual aptitude and commitment to justice was \ndemonstrated early in her life. She was born in New York City, NY, the \ndaughter of a school teacher and a public\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\nhousing lawyer. She graduated from Princeton University, received a \nMasters in Philosophy from Worcestor College of Oxford University, and \nreceived her law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. She \nthen clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, was an associate with \nWilliams & Connolly, and then counsel to President Clinton, as \nAssociate Counsel, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic \nPolicy, and Deputy Director for the Domestic Policy Counsel. She led \nthe Clinton administration's inter-agency effort to analyze all legal \nand regulatory aspects of the Attorney General's tobacco settlement and \nthen participated actively in the development and congressional \nconsideration of tobacco legislation. She also handled legislative \nissues involving constitutional issues, including separation of powers, \ngovernmental privileges, freedom of expression, and church-state \nrelations.\n  As Dean of Harvard Law School, she joined other deans in opposing an \namendment to strip the courts of the power to review detention \npractices, treatment and adjudications of guilt and punishment for \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This reflects a fair view, with an \neye to checks and balances on different branches of government.\n  In her first case as Solicitor General, Solicitor Kagan argued before \nthe Supreme Court on behalf of the government in the Citizens United v. \nFEC case. As Solicitor Kagan notes, however, her role as Solicitor \nGeneral was to argue on behalf of the country, not to advance her \npersonal beliefs.\n  In my meeting with her, Solicitor Kagan confirmed her commitment to \nprotecting the right to privacy enshrined in our Constitution. I \nbelieve she will preserve that right.\n  Solicitor Kagan is uniquely qualified to serve as Associate Justice \nbecause she not only possesses an impressive intellectual capacity and \ncommitment to fairness, but also because she is committed equal \njustice. As she remarked in her opening statement, ``Equal Justice \nunder the Law. It means that everyone who comes before the Court--\nregardless of wealth or power or station--receives the same process and \nthe same protections . . .''\n  Solicitor Kagan demonstrates a readiness to serve on our Nation's \nHighest Court and I am confident that she will make a fine justice who \nwill not only uphold the Constitution and legal precedent of the \ncountry, but continue to preserve one of the most treasured tenets of \nour legal system, equal access to justice for all Americans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week I spoke on the Senate \nfloor, calling for the confirmation of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to \nthe position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I added my \nvoice to a chorus of bipartisan praise for her qualifications and \nabilities to be a Supreme Court Justice, joining supporters such as \nMiguel Estrada, Assistant Solicitor General in the George H.W. Bush \nadministration; former Solicitors General Kenneth Starr and Drew S. \nDays and a number of my Republican colleagues, including Senator \nLindsey Graham and Senator Judd Gregg. These voices across the \npolitical spectrum recognize Elena Kagan's years of practical, \npragmatic experience, and value, in the words of Professor Michael \nMcConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law \nSchool, her ``fidelity to legal principle even when it means crossing \nher political and ideological allies.''\n  Despite her abilities and her tremendous legal career, Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan continues to be the subject of baseless attacks. For \ninstance, the National Rifle Association, NRA, has taken out full page \nadvertisements in multiple newspapers and has aired national television \ncommercials claiming Elena Kagan is unfit for the Supreme Court because \nof her supposed opposition to the second amendment rights of Americans. \nThe NRA's charges are unfounded and are refuted by the nominee's own \nwords during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  For example, in regard to the Supreme Court's 2008 Heller decision, \nwhich ruled that the second amendment protects an individual's right to \npossess a firearm for private self-defense purposes in a Federal \nenclave, and the Supreme Court's recent McDonald decision, which \napplied the Heller holding to the States, the NRA has said that \nSolicitor General Kagan has left unanswered ``very serious questions of \nwhether she would vote to overturn Heller and McDonald.'' Perhaps the \nNRA lobbyists were not watching her confirmation hearing when she \nreplied to a question from Senator Tom Coburn saying, ``I very much \nappreciate how deeply important the right to bear arms is to millions \nand millions of Americans. And I accept Heller which made clear that \nthe second amendment conferred that right upon individuals, and not \nsimply collectively.'' In addition, in response to a related question \nfrom Senator Charles Grassley, Solicitor General Kagan said ``those \ndecisions are settled law . . . I will follow stare decisis with \nrespect to Heller and McDonald as I would with any case.''\n  It seems pretty clear, contrary to the NRA's claims, that Solicitor \nKagan has answered questions concerning her position on the second \namendment rights of Americans, and she will defend those rights.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that there now be 1 hour remaining \nfor debate with respect to the Kagan nomination for the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, with 15-minute blocks controlled as follows: Senator Sessions, \nChairman Leahy, Leader McConnell, and Senator Reid of Nevada; that upon \nthe use of the allotted hour, the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid on the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session. Further, I ask that when Members cast a vote on \nthe nomination, they do so from their seats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair withhold please, Mr. President.\n  You have heard my request. What is the ruling of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 3:30 today we will vote on the nomination \nof Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in the midst of President Johnson's \n``Great Society,'' Ronald Reagan explained that our Nation had arrived \nat a crossroads, at a time for choosing.\n  The choice, Reagan explained, was ``whether we believe in our \ncapacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American \nRevolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-\ndistant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan it \nfor ourselves.''\n  Forty years later, our Nation once again finds itself at a \ncrossroads. Government is getting larger and larger. Spending is out of \ncontrol, and a little intellectual elite, in a far distant capital, is \ntrying harder than ever to plan the lives of the American people. Even \nbasic choices about how we care for our own health are now made by \ncareer bureaucrats whose names Americans will never hear and whose \nfaces they will never see.\n  Our Nation has a choice to make. We either restore or relinquish our \ngreat heritage of limited constitutional government. Part of that \nchoice will be made here today. Part of that choice will be made as we \nconsider the nomination of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. In recent \nyears, the progressive wing of the Supreme Court has offered opinions \nthat would have denied Americans their right to keep and bear arms, and \nseverely diminish the right to free speech during election time.\n  These same progressive Justices succeeded only a short time ago in \nruling that a citizen's property could be seized by the State for \nprivate commercial development. These Justices are ignoring the text of \nour Constitution, the plain rights guaranteed by our Constitution, in \norder to advance what\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\nthey think are better ideas, their vision, their political agendas, \nfrankly.\n  This progressive, activist judicial philosophy strikes at the heart \nof our democracy and is a direct threat to our liberty. Judges are \nlifetime appointed. They are not accountable to the people. President \nObama himself has said that judges must shed their neutral \nconstitutional role and impose upon the nation ``their broader vision \nof what America should be.'' That is how he said he would pick judges, \nand this is certainly the kind of judge President Obama believes he has \nfound in Ms. Kagan, someone who shares his progressive, elitist vision \nand is willing to advance it from the bench.\n  Indeed, throughout Ms. Kagan's career, she has been more deeply \ninvolved in politics than law, and has frequently put her politics \nabove law. She has never been a judge, never argued even a case before \na jury. She has practiced law for 3 years. She has less real legal \nexperience than any nominee in the last half century.\n  The experience Ms. Kagan does have, however, is mostly that of a \npolitical lawyer and a policy advocate, and whenever her political \nviews have clashed with her legal obligations, her vision of what \nAmerica should be and not her duty have too often won the day.\n  As a Supreme Court clerk she pursued a progressive agenda without \nregard to the Constitution's text or history. She even wrote she was \nnot sympathetic to an American's constitutional right to keep and bear \narms. As a top aide to President Clinton she was closely involved in \nefforts to restrict private gun ownership, including a plan to block \nfirearm importation into our country that one Clinton official admitted \nwas ``taking the law and bending it as far as we can.''\n  She also worked aggressively to ensure the wide availability of \npartial-birth abortion. Instead of providing President Clinton with \nsound legal advice based on the best medical evidence, she pushed the \nPresident away from his moderate position, and away from his \nwillingness to reach a compromise on this issue. She even helped revise \na medical statement to imply a medical need for the gruesome partial-\nbirth abortion procedure that did not exist, when the expert panel had \nindeed said it was never an appropriate procedure.\n  Next, as dean of Harvard Law, Ms. Kagan would once again sacrifice \nlegal principle for political gain for advancement of an agenda she \nbelieved in. Ms. Kagan inherited a policy of equal and unfettered \naccess for military recruiters on campus. That was the policy. But she \nreversed this policy, kicking the military out of the campus \nrecruitment office as our troops at that very time were risking their \nlives overseas. She did this in clear, knowing violation of Federal \nlaw, the Solomon amendment. The Solomon amendment, passed by this \nCongress four times, requires unrestricted, equal access on campuses \nfor military recruiters. Ms. Kagan knew what the law said, and as she \nherself admitted, knew that it was in force every single day she was \ndean. But she put her own views, her political ideas, her ideologies \nabove the law and above the best interests of our soldiers, stripping \nthe military of their official access availability on campus.\n  Ms. Kagan justified this conduct by saying she was objecting to don't \nask, don't tell. That statute, however, was passed by Congress and \nimplemented by President Clinton, her former boss. But instead of \ncomplaining to the politicians who made the rule, to those of us in \nCongress who were involved in passing it and maintaining it, working \nwithin the democratic system, Ms. Kagan took it upon herself to defy \nthe law and to demean the people who were merely following the law, our \nnoble men and women who serve our country.\n  Perhaps some of those on that campus recruiting had just come off the \nbattlefield, having served their country, placing their lives at risk. \nFor that there can be no justification.\n  After Harvard, Ms. Kagan assumed the post of Solicitor General of the \nUnited States. In that job it is her sworn duty to defend all Federal \nlaws, including those she may personally oppose. These are the laws of \nCongress which the Solicitor General must defend. As every good lawyer \nknows, her job is to represent her clients, and the client of the \nSolicitor General is the United States of America.\n  Did she fulfill that duty? Did she faithfully represent her client? \nNo, she did not. When the liberal Ninth Circuit issued a deeply flawed \nruling against don't ask, don't tell, the law Ms. Kagan had so strongly \nopposed at Harvard, she did not appeal the ruling, despite great \nchances of success on appeal to the Supreme Court. Instead, she did \nexactly what the ACLU, the group who was leading the fight in \nrepresenting the individual in that lawsuit, who opposed the statute \nand wanted it stricken, she did what they desired and let the ruling \nstand, and missed the opportunity to get a clear appeal. This was a \ntest of Ms. Kagan's legal character, and she failed that test. I \nstudied the case closely. I want to be fair to her about that.\n  The only explanation for her not appealing to the Supreme Court was \nthat she did not want them to uphold the statute to win a victory for \nthe United States. In short, she did not fulfill her duty. Her duty. Is \nthat a word that is out of fashion today? And she did not live up to \nher explicit, sworn promise made to this Senate, to vigorously defend \nthat very statute, when she was confirmed to be Solicitor General.\n  Given this record, it is not surprising that Ms. Kagan's judicial \nheroes are activists who reject and repudiate sometimes even the very \nidea of objectivity. But it is objectivity, the search for what is \nright and true, that makes our system of justice so extraordinary and \nso unique. The whole goal of our trials is to find the truth. These \nconcerns were addressed during the hearing. Ms. Kagan was given every \nopportunity to respond. But she opted, I thought, for political spin at \nthe expense of rigorous honesty and accuracy. In so doing, she only \nfurther demonstrated she lacked the qualities necessary to sit on the \nCourt. Other Senators have the same impression of that testimony.\n  Some have said that Senators are opposing this nomination for \npartisan reasons, that her qualifications are not in question. But what \nqualification is more essential for the Supreme Court than impartial \nfidelity to the law? This is not an ideological litmus test but a core \nbipartisan standard to which any nominee of any party ought to be held.\n  Senators can and will disagree on the question of how much deference \na President is due in his nomination. But surely that deference cannot \nextend so far as to include a nominee who is unable to serve under the \nConstitution as they take an oath to do.\n  The American people will not easily forgive the Senate if we confirm \nMs. Kagan to the Supreme Court. They will not forgive the Senate if we \nfurther expose our Constitution to revision and rewrite by judicial \nfiat, to advance what President Obama says is a broader vision of what \nAmerica should be. That is the Congressional role, not the judicial \nrole, to figure out what the vision and the policy of this country \nshould be.\n  Now more than ever we need this Court to be an impartial defender of \nour constitutional liberty. As Vice President Biden's own chief of \nstaff and close friend of Ms. Kagan emphatically said, ``Ms. Kagan is \nclearly a legal progressive.'' If confirmed, I fear she will continue \nputting her politics above the law, as she has so often done before. So \nI invited those who supported this nomination to refute the record and \nthe analysis I have stated over the several past weeks, but I do not \nthink one error has been raised and identified by Ms. Kagan's \nsupporters in what I have said.\n  So we are left with the same concern, that Ms. Kagan would ally \nherself not with the constitutional liberties of all Americans but with \nthe big government agenda of the President who nominated her. In fact, \nat the hearing, Ms. Kagan was unable to identify any limits on the \ngovernment's power to control America's economic decisions. What Ms. \nKagan perhaps fails to realize is that the people should control their \ngovernment, not the other way around.\n  That is why no Supreme Court Justice should simply rubberstamp any \npolitical agenda of a President or Congress, nor should any Senator. \nOur liberties are far more precious than any partisan allegiance.\n  After the Constitution was drafted, Benjamin Franklin was asked what \nkind of government had been created. Franklin replied: A republic, if \nyou can keep it. Again, the choice is ours. Either we embrace our \ngreat, magnificent\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nconstitutional heritage that I love so much or we let it slip away to \njudges who believe they can allow their own personal core beliefs and \nphilosophies to help them decide how a case should go. Either we move \nforward more secure in our freedom or we fall back to the old bankrupt \nidea of big government--an idea that has failed at every place, every \ntime it has been tried.\n  Let's take a step today in the right direction. Let's listen to the \nAmerican people and strengthen our commitment to constitutional values. \nIt is that commitment that impels me to vote against this nomination \nand why I urge my colleagues in both parties to do the same.\n  I see the chairman of the committee, Senator Leahy. He and I don't \nagree on this nomination, but he is a proven professional chairman. He \nhas gone through a host of these nominations. He is tough, but he is \nfair. He let us have our say. I thank the chairman for the privilege of \nworking with him on this important constitutional effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nkind words. We both set out with the goal of making sure the United \nStates had a chance to hear this nomination, to hear the debate on it, \nand to have Senators speak. We both decided before the debate that \nwould happen, and it has. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  We are about to conclude debate on the nomination of Elena Kagan to \nbe Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This is the time when \nthe 100 of us stand in the footsteps of 300 million Americans and make \nthe decision whether she will be confirmed to a lifetime appointment. I \npredict right now she will be confirmed and I look forward to her \nbipartisan confirmation.\n  She has been nominated to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens, someone \nwho served with integrity for so many years, a man I consider a friend. \nHer qualifications, intelligence, temperament, and judgment will make \nher a worthy successor to Justice John Paul Stevens.\n  When she is appointed by the President after we confirm her, three \nwomen will serve together on the Supreme Court of the United States for \nthe first time in our Nation's history, three women on the nine-member \nSupreme Court. As I said 5\\1/2\\ weeks ago, when the Judiciary Committee \nbegan Solicitor General Kagan's confirmation hearing, we are a better \ncountry for the fact that the path of excellence Elena Kagan has taken \nin her career is one now open for both men and women. I look forward to \nthe day when I see many more women on that Court.\n  Solicitor General Kagan's legal qualifications are unassailable. She \nearned her place at the top of the legal profession. No one gave it to \nher; she earned it. As a student, she excelled at Princeton, Oxford and \nHarvard Law School. She was a law clerk to a giant in American justice \nand American law, Justice Thurgood Marshall. She worked for then-\nChairman Biden on the Judiciary Committee. These experiences, combined \nwith her work as an advisor to President Clinton, give her background \nin all three branches of our government. She also taught law at two of \nthe Nation's most respected law schools. In the decade since the \nRepublican Senate majority pocket-filibustered her nomination to the DC \nCircuit--remember, when people say she does not have judicial \nexperience, of course, Republicans did block her from going on the \ncourt--Elena Kagan became the first woman dean of Harvard Law School \nand then the first woman Solicitor General of the United States, often \nreferred to as the 10th Justice.\n  The 100 of us who serve in the U.S. Senate stand in the shoes of more \nthan 300 million Americans as we discharge this constitutional duty to \nconsider nominations to our Nation's Federal courts. We will conclude \nour consideration of this nomination after 12 weeks. If we can do that \nfor a Supreme Court nomination, we ought to be able to consider the \nother judicial nominations that have been stalled for months after \nbeing favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is the 15th time since I have been in the Senate that I have \nbeen able to consider a Supreme Court nomination. I have applied the \nsame standards to this nomination as I have to the ones that preceded \nit. I looked to see whether Solicitor General Kagan would fairly apply \nthe law and use common sense. That is the same standard I used on the \nfirst Supreme Court Justice I voted on, a man from Chicago, Justice \nJohn Paul Stevens, nominated by a Republican President. I proudly voted \nfor him. For Solicitor General Kagan, I looked to see whether, as a \nJustice, she would appreciate the proper role of the courts in our \ndemocracy. Would she be the kind of independent Justice who would keep \nfaith with each of the words inscribed in Vermont marble over the front \ndoors to the Supreme Court: ``Equal justice under law.'' My answer to \nthese questions, based on her record and testimony, is a resounding \nyes.\n  Solicitor General Kagan demonstrated an impressive knowledge of the \nlaw and fidelity to it. She spoke of judicial restraint and respect for \nour democratic institutions, her commitment to the Constitution and the \nrule of law. She made clear that she will base her approach to deciding \ncases on the law and the Constitution, not politics or an ideological \nagenda. So today I will cast my vote for Elena Kagan's confirmation.\n\n  I observed at the outset of this confirmation process that there was \nno one President Obama could nominate who would not be opposed by some. \nSome Senators announced their opposition to Solicitor General Kagan's \nnomination even before a hearing took place. The opening statement of \nothers at the Judiciary Committee hearings struck me more like \nprosecutors' closing arguments. Senators who last year disregarded \nJustice Sotomayor's years of judicial service to focus on a few phrases \ntaken out of context from her speeches reversed their course this year \nto proclaim that an extensive judicial record is imperative. Standards \nshift almost every time. They then faulted Solicitor General Kagan for \nnot having been a judge, while ignoring the fact that it was Senate \nRepublicans who pocket-filibustered her judicial nomination more than \n10 years ago.\n  Senators can make their own judgments, and they have. I ask of them \nonly two things: Fairly consider Solicitor General Kagan's testimony \nand adhere to the standards of fairness and objectivity that you are \ndemanding of her as a Justice. History will judge whether Senators have \nfairly considered the nomination of Solicitor General Kagan. I commend \nthose Senators who have shown the independence to join the bipartisan \nconfirmation of this nomination.\n  I also defend the right of every Senator to vote as he or she \nchooses. I understand that some statements made in opposition to this \nnomination were seen as insulting to the nominee and to others. I \ndisagree with the many inferences, conclusions and judgments expressed \nin opposition, but I do not think Senators intended their remarks to be \ndisparaging.\n  Five years ago, I followed the Democratic leader's statement in \nopposition to the nomination of John Roberts with my statement in favor \nof that nomination. That was my judgment based on the record and his \ntestimony, including his pronouncements on judicial restraint, \ndeference to Congress, and respect for precedent. At the time, Senators \non the Democratic side of the aisle--a number of them--disagreed with \nme, including one Senator who disagreed with me but, nevertheless, came \nto the floor to defend my position. That Senator was the then-junior \nSenator from Illinois. Of course, he now serves as President of the \nUnited States. As I told President Obama the other day, his defense of \nme meant a lot then, and 5 years later, it still does.\n  In the course of our consideration of this nomination, I have spoken \nseveral times about the key role real world judging and judicial \nindependence have played in furthering the Constitution's purpose of \nforming a more perfect union. It is essential that judicial nominees \nunderstand that, as judges, they are not members of any administration. \nI believe Solicitor General Kagan has that understanding. Courts are \nnot subsidiaries of any political party or interest group, and our \njudges should not be partisans. That is why the Supreme Court's \nintervention in the 2000 Presidential election in Bush v. Gore was so \njarring and why the recent decision by five conservative activist \nJustices in Citizens United to\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nthrow out 100 years of legal developments in order to invite massive \ncorporate spending on elections for the first time in 100 years was \nsuch a jolt to the system.\n  It is also essential that judges and Justices understand how the law \naffects Americans each and every day. I expect Elena Kagan learned \nearly on in her legal career, when she clerked for Justice Marshall, \nthat Justices ought to understand how their decisions affect real \nAmericans. In the hard cases that come before the Supreme Court, in the \nreal world, we want and need Justices who have the good sense to \nappreciate the real world ramifications of their decisions. The \nAmerican people live in the real world of great challenges. The Supreme \nCourt needs to function in that real world.\n  It took a Supreme Court that, in 1954, understood the real world to \nconclude in Brown v. Board of Education that the seemingly fair \nsounding doctrine of separate but equal was in reality a straitjacket \nof inequality and inconsistent with the constitutional guarantee of \nequality. It took a Supreme Court 75 years ago that understood the real \nworld and the Great Depression to reject conservative judicial activism \nto accept the constitutional authority of Congress to outlaw child \nlabor, to guarantee a minimum wage, and to establish a social safety \nnet for all Americans. Through Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, \nCongress ensured that growing old no longer means growing poor and that \nbeing older or poor no longer means being without medical care. That \nprogress continues today with our efforts to pass laws to ensure \nprotection from natural and manmade disasters, to encourage clean air \nand water, to provide health care for all Americans, to ensure safe \nfood and drugs, to protect equal rights, to enforce safe workplaces and \nprovide a safety net for seniors.\n  Vermont did not vote to join the Union until the year the Bill of \nRights was ratified. Those of us from the Green Mountain State are \nprotective of our fundamental liberties. Vermonters understand the \nimportance the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the \nsubsequent constitutional amendments have had in expanding individual \nliberties over the last 220 years. I believe Solicitor General Kagan \nshares this understanding. As she said in her opening statement at the \nhearing:\n\n       What the rule of law does is nothing less than to secure \n     for each of us what our Constitution calls ``the blessings of \n     liberty''--those rights and freedoms, that promise of \n     equality, that have defined this nation since its founding.\n\n  All of us are better for our historic progress to greater freedom, \nequality, and security.\n  Every February, the Senate hears President George Washington's \nFarewell Address. It is usually read by the Senate's most junior \nMember. In that pronouncement by our first President, George Washington \nwarns against the danger of factions, partisanship, and what he called \n``the spirit of party,'' noting:\n\n       [T]he common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party \n     are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise \n     people to discourage and restrain it.\n       It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and \n     enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community \n     with ill-founded jealousies and public alarms; kindles the \n     animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally \n     riot and insurrection.\n\n  That was George Washington, a long time ago. But today our Nation \nfaces many challenges. It is a time when we should be pulling together \nand working together. Instead, we have seen too much obstruction, \nnegativity, and devotion to the failure of the other party instead of \nthe success of the country.\n  The nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan is a matter on which \nI expect the President had hoped we would come together. Her nomination \nreally is one worthy of broad bipartisan support.\n  With Elena Kagan's confirmation, the Supreme Court will better \nreflect the diversity that has made our country so great. We will write \nanother chapter in the history of our Nation's highest Court. And we \nwill take another step forward in fulfilling the hopes and dreams of \nthe trailblazers who set the path for Elena Kagan to follow.\n  I will proudly vote for her confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nto my staff who worked tirelessly during these past few months on this \nnomination. They spent many long hours combing through and distilling \ninformation in hundreds of thousands of documents provided by Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan, the Clinton Library and the Pentagon. On a short \ntimeline, my staff worked around the clock to prepare for the hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, which occurred merely 49 days after \nPresident Obama announced Solicitor General Kagan's nomination to the \nSupreme Court. Because of their hard work and dedication, our members \nwere well-prepared and well-informed, which allowed us to conduct a \nfair and thorough hearing.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank my staff and Senator Leahy's \nstaff, the Judiciary Committee staff, for their fine work during this \nnomination process. It has gone on for a number of weeks, and it has \nbeen very stressful, with a lot of late nights, and people really have \nworked hard. I believe that has provided us with good and accurate \ninformation.\n  I particularly would like to express my appreciation to my staff \ndirector, Brian Benczkowski, on whom I have relied repeatedly through \nthis process, for his good judgment and wise counsel, his integrity and \nexperience as we have dealt with this difficult challenge. I would also \nnote my chief counsel for nominations, Danielle Cutrona, who has also \nworked exceedingly hard, as well as my deputy staff director, Matt \nMiner.\n  I would like to acknowledge and thank the other hard-working and \ntalented lawyers on my permanent staff who worked on this nomination, \nincluding William Smith, Ted Lehman, Bill Hall, Mark Patton, John \nEllis, and Kimberly Kilpatrick.\n  I would also like to extend my appreciation to the talented lawyers \nwho joined my staff as Special Counsels specifically to work on this \nnomination, including Ralph Johnson, Jason Tompkins, and Susanna \nDokupil. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the efforts of our \nLaw Clerks, two of whom dedicated their time while studying for the bar \nexam, including Amanda Lavis, Ed Liva, and Taylor-Lee Wickersham.\n  I would also like to acknowledge our dedicated support staff: Lauren \nPastarnack, Sarah Thompson, Andrew Bennion, Allison Busbee, Kate \nLaborde, and Ivy Williams.\n  Finally, I cannot overstate the important work done by our press \nteam. My Communications Director Stephen Boyd, Press Secretaries Sarah \nHaley and Stephen Miller, and Press Assistant Andrew Logan have worked \ntirelessly throughout this process.\n  All of these individuals shouldered the brunt of this enormous task, \nworking late hours and through weekends and holidays. They deserve our \nrecognition for their hard work, professionalism, and dedication to \npublic service.\n  I would also like to thank the other talented lawyers on my staff \nwho, among others I have just mentioned, handled the regular \nlegislative business that came before the Judiciary Committee during \nthis process: Joe Matal, Bradley Hayes, and Sam Ramer.\n  And let me express my gratitude to the Republican Leader and his \nstaff, specifically John Abegg, Josh Holmes, and Webber Steinhoff; \nalong with Republican Policy Committee Counsel Gregg Nunziata who \nprovided invaluable assistance to my staff.\n  I'd also like to express my thanks to Chairman Leahy for his work on \nthis nomination. We didn't always agree on everything, but he was \nrespectful of Republicans' rights during this process and he conducted \na fair and thorough hearing. He would not have been able to do that \nwithout the help of his staff, including his Staff Director and Chief \nCounsel Bruce Cohen and his Chief Nominations Counsel Jeremy Paris.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the Judiciary Committee's Chief Clerk,\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\nRoslyne Turner and her assistant, Erin O'Neill.\n  Every one of these talented staff members contributed to this \nprocess, and their dedication and hard work helped us conduct a fair \nand thorough hearing. I extend my heartfelt thanks to each of them. We \ncould not have fulfilled our Constitutional duty of Advice and Consent \nwithout them.\n  Mr. President, there are in the hearing nine letters in opposition to \nthe nomination of Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt from Gonzalo Vergara, Lt. Col., USAF (Ret); the Judicial Action \nGroup; National Right to Life Committee; Military Families United; the \nLiberty Counsel; The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention; the American Association of Christian \nSchools; the Center for Military Readiness; and the National Rifle \nAssociation of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four letters \nfrom the National Right to Work Committee; the American Conservative \nUnion; C. Everett Koop, former U.S. Surgeon General, and the Ethics & \nReligious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                               Work Committee,\n\n                                    Springfield, VA, July 1, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the over 2.6 million members of \n     the National Right to Work Committee, I strongly urge you to \n     vote against confirmation of Elena Kagan for a lifetime seat \n     on the United States Supreme Court. Her record as an high-\n     level White House advisor to President William Jefferson \n     Clinton demonstrates that her views about the First-Amendment \n     and statutory rights of American workers are far outside the \n     judicial mainstream.\n       In 1976, in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, a case in \n     which National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation \n     attorneys represented the plaintiff, public school teachers, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether nonunion public \n     employees can constitutionally be compelled as a condition of \n     employment to subsidize their union monopoly bargaining \n     agent's political activities. The Court, unanimously, held \n     ``that a State cannot constitutionally compel public \n     employees to contribute to union political activities which \n     they oppose.''\n       The First-Amendment right of workers not to be forced to \n     subsidize union politics, first recognized in Abood, has been \n     reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in several subsequent cases \n     brought to the Court for workers by National Right to Work \n     Legal Defense Foundation attorneys, cases such as Ellis v. \n     Railway Clerks (1984), Teachers Local 1 v. Hudson (1986), \n     Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Ass'n (1991), and Davenport v. \n     Washington Education Ass'n (2007).\n       The Court's Abood ruling relied on the principle underlying \n     the Supreme Court's 1976 decision about the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act in Buckley v. Valeo, that ``contributing to an \n     organization for the purpose of spreading a political message \n     is protected by the First Amendment.'' The Court has \n     reiterated that principle repeatedly, and relied upon it \n     again as recently as this year in Citizens United v. Federal \n     Election Commission.\n       However, in 1996, when she was Associate Counsel to \n     President Clinton, Ms. Kagan rejected this long, unbroken \n     line of Supreme Court precedent that protects the First-\n     Amendment right of public employees--and of Americans \n     generally--not to be compelled by government to subsidize \n     political activities of private, voluntary associations.\n       In an e-mail message on October 31, 1996, to Paul J. \n     Weinstein, Jr., Chief of Staff of the White House Domestic \n     Policy Council, Ms. Kagan said (emphasis added):\n       It is unfortunately true that almost any meaningful \n     campaign finance reform proposal raises constitutional \n     issues. This is a result of the Supreme Court's view--which I \n     believe to be mistaken in many cases--that money is speech \n     and that attempts to limit the influence of money on our \n     political system therefore raise First Amendment problems . . \n     . I also think the Court should reexamine its premise that \n     the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment \n     entails a right to throw money at the political system.\n       In her Senate Judiciary Committee testimony on June 29, \n     2010, Ms. Kagan claimed in answer to a question from Senator \n     Orrin Hatch that these were merely the Clinton \n     Administration's, not her personal, views.\n       However, later, on October 31, 1996, Ms. Kagan was one of \n     several White House staff members whose memorandum \n     recommending how the White House should respond to questions \n     about President Clinton's ``Campaign Finance Reform \n     Announcement'' was transmitted to White House Chief of Staff \n     Leon Panetta. That memo from Ms. Kagan and others \n     incorporated Ms. Kagan's argument that the First Amendment \n     does not protect the right to spend money for political \n     activities. In short, in 1996 Ms. Kagan both suggested and \n     endorsed that crabbed view of the. First Amendment.\n       Thus, Ms. Kagan's testimony this week before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee clearly is disingenuous. It is reasonable \n     to conclude from her record that, if confirmed, Ms. Kagan \n     would be willing to overrule Abood's well-established \n     protection of the constitutional right of workers not to \n     be forced to subsidize union politics.\n       This conclusion is supported by other documents the Clinton \n     Presidential Library recently produced for the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in preparation for its hearings on Ms. \n     Kagan's Supreme Court nomination.\n       On November 14, 1996, Ms. Kagan sent a memorandum on White \n     House stationery to then White House Counsel Jack Quinn and \n     then Deputy White House Counsel Kathleen Wallman about a \n     draft ``memo to the President on campaign finance.'' In her \n     memo, Ms. Kagan said:\n       The memo does not address what seems to me the key issue in \n     developing a strategy on campaign finance legislation: how to \n     deal with Republican efforts to restrict labor union \n     spending. I think the Republicans will insist on including in \n     any campaign finance legislation a provision making it \n     difficult for unions to use money from compulsory union dues \n     in political campaigns. . . . We should start thinking now \n     how we're going to deal with this Republican poison pill.\n       In 1988, of course, in Communications Workers v. Beck, yet \n     another case in which National Right to Work Legal Defense \n     Foundation attorneys represented the plaintiff workers, the \n     Supreme Court had already held that the National Labor \n     Relations Act--like the First Amendment--prohibits unions \n     from using compulsory union dues of objecting workers in \n     political campaigns. Thus, any provision that would make ``it \n     more difficult for unions to use money from compulsory union \n     dues in political campaigns'' would simply protect a \n     constitutional and statutory right of workers recognized by \n     the Court in the Abood line of cases and in Beck.\n       Ms. Kagan nonetheless subsequently recommended that \n     President Clinton oppose any legislation protecting the right \n     of workers not to be forced to subsidize union politics, \n     despite the First Amendment's guarantee of that basic worker \n     freedom of speech and association.\n       On February 12, 1997, Kathleen Wallman, then Deputy \n     Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, circulated an \n     11:30 a.m. draft memorandum for the President on possible \n     policy announcements of labor issues that the Vice President \n     could make at a meeting of the AFL-CIO's Executive Committee \n     later that month. The draft indicates that Ms. Kagan, by then \n     Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, was \n     writing two sections of the memo that were not included in \n     the draft. One of those sections that Ms. Kagan ``agreed to \n     draft'' concerned the Administration's ``[p]osition on Beck \n     legislation aimed at limiting the use of union dues in \n     political activity.''\n       Later that same day, Ms. Kagan e-mailed Ms. Wallman her \n     recommendation about ``legislation aimed at limiting the use \n     of union dues in political activity'' (italics added): John \n     Hilley [Director of Legislative Affairs], Bruce Reed \n     [Director of the Domestic Policy Council], and I all \n     recommend that you state strong opposition to Beck \n     legislation, no matter what it is attached to.''\n       In sum, as a high-level White House official Ms. Kagan both \n     disagreed with the well-established legal principle that \n     underlies the long line of Supreme Court decisions \n     recognizing the constitutional right of workers not to be \n     compelled to subsidize union political activities as a \n     condition of employment and opposed any legislation designed \n     to protect that fundamental right of free speech and free \n     association. This puts her far outside the judicial \n     mainstream and demonstrates a disdain for the rights of \n     independent-minded American workers.\n       Consequently, on behalf of the National Right to Work \n     Committee's over 2.6 million members, I strongly urge you to \n     vote NO on confirmation of Ms. Kagan's nomination to the \n     Supreme Court.\n           Respectfully,\n\n     Mark A. Mix.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Conservative Union, \n     I strongly urge you to vote ``NO'' on the confirmation of \n     Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Elena Kagan's entire career is more suited to that of a \n     political activist than a legal scholar, as she has been \n     described by President Obama and as she described herself in \n     her testimony. Kagan began public life as a political \n     operative for the U.S. Senate campaign of Elizabeth Holtzman \n     of New York in 1980. The documents produced for the Judiciary \n     Committee show that, as a member of the Clinton \n     Administration's Justice Department, Kagan's primary role was \n     to develop political strategy in dealing with the Congress on \n     legal issues. A good example of this is when the issue of \n     partial birth abortion came before the Senate during the \n     Clinton administration. At this time Kagan proceeded to \n     negotiate changes to a statement by the American Council of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) that said there were \n     no serious medical reasons for conducting a partial birth \n     abortion. Kagan's involvement made it more difficult for the \n     Senate to pass a ban on partial birth abortion. This example \n     clearly displays that Kagan is more of a political operative \n     than a legal scholar.\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n       Another serious impediment to Kagan's nomination is her \n     deep involvement as the Obama Administration's Solicitor \n     General on issues that will continue to come before the \n     Supreme Court. This may mean that Kagan will or should have \n     to recuse herself from key decisions of the court. As \n     outlined in a letter from Republican members of the Committee \n     on July 13 to Kagan, there is even a question as to whether \n     recusal will be an issue when the constitutionality of the \n     recently passed health care bill comes before the court.\n       Kagan has also shown herself willing to ignore the law for \n     political purposes. As Dean of the Harvard Law School, Kagan \n     banned military recruiters on campus in violation of the \n     Solomon Act to satisfy campus activists. Her actions were \n     voided by a unanimous 8-0 decision of the very court on which \n     she has been nominated to serve.\n       Although through the mid-twentieth century, court \n     appointments of politicians were sometimes made to satisfy \n     political deals, such as the appointment of Earl Warren in \n     the 1950s, in recent years judicial experience and legal \n     background have been at the forefront of nominations. The \n     nomination of Elena Kagan is more akin to President Lyndon \n     Johnson's nomination of political crony Abe Fortas as Chief \n     Justice, which had to be withdrawn.\n       It was President Obama, as a U.S. Senator, who changed the \n     criteria for judges from minimum qualifications to judicial \n     philosophy and more subjective criteria. The nomination of \n     Elena Kagan is a blatant attempt to place on the court a \n     political operative who will work as an advocate of \n     Administration policies rather than look at rulings from an \n     objective view of constitutionality. Please vote ``NO'' in \n     the confirmation of Elena Kagan.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Larry Hart,\n\n                                 Director of Government Relations,\n     The American Conservative Union.\n                                  ____\n\n       An Open Letter to the American People: For many years, \n     before, during and after my service as surgeon general of the \n     United States, I've been known for presenting my unvarnished \n     opinion on medical matters, regardless of the views of \n     political parties or outside influences. The time has come \n     for me to do so again.\n       I was deeply disturbed to learn that Elena Kagan, the \n     nominee for Supreme Court scheduled for a Senate committee \n     vote next week, manipulated the medical policy statement on \n     partial-birth abortion of a major medical organization, the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in \n     January 1997.\n       The problem for me, as a physician, is that she was willing \n     to replace a medical statement with a political statement \n     that was not supported by any existing medical data. During \n     the partial-birth abortion debate in the 1990s, medical \n     evidence was of paramount importance.\n       Ms. Kagan's amendment to the ACOG Policy Statement--that \n     partial-birth abortion ``may be the best or most appropriate \n     procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or \n     preserve the health of a woman''--had no basis in published \n     medical studies or data. No published medical data supported \n     her amendment in 1997, and none supports it today.\n       Indeed, there was, and is, no reliable medical data that \n     partial-birth abortion is safe or safer than alternative \n     medical procedures.\n       There are other medical options.\n       In my many decades of service as a medical doctor, I have \n     never known of a case where partial-birth abortion was \n     necessary in place of a more humane and ethical alternative. \n     Not only have I never seen such a case, but I have never \n     known of any physician who had to do a partial-birth \n     abortion--nor have I ever met a physician who knew of anyone \n     who had to perform one out of medical necessity. In fact, \n     partial-birth abortion has risks of its own, and could injure \n     a woman.\n       Medical science should not have been twisted in 1997 for \n     political or legislative gains.\n       Ms. Kagan's political language, a direct result of the \n     amendment she made to ACOG's Policy Statement, made its way \n     into American jurisprudence and misled federal courts for the \n     next decade.\n       She misrepresented not only the science but also \n     misrepresented her role in front of your elected \n     representatives in the United States Senate.\n       This is unethical, and it is disgraceful, especially for \n     one who would be tasked with being a measured and fair-minded \n     judge.\n       Americans United for Life Action has released a thorough \n     and comprehensive report on this matter, a report that \n     provides substantive evidence of Ms. Kagan's actions in this \n     matter. I ask that Senators and the American people give this \n     report their most serious consideration. I urge the Senate to \n     reject the politization of medical science and vote no on the \n     Kagan nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     C. Everett Koop, M.D., Sc.D.,\n       Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, \n     1981-89.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \n           Baptist Convention,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On June \n     25, we sent you a letter expressing serious concerns about \n     Elena Kagan's nomination as the next associate justice to the \n     U.S. Supreme Court. As we stated, we have been alarmed about \n     Kagan's lack of respect for the First Amendment's right to \n     free speech, her admiration for extreme judicial activists, \n     and her role in advancing pro-abortion policies. We also \n     expressed our distress about Kagan's attempts, while dean of \n     Harvard Law School, to bar military recruiters from campus \n     because of her own personal views in opposition to the \n     military's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. Unfortunately, \n     these concerns remain.\n       During the Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings, \n     Kagan failed to satisfactorily clarify her actions and \n     opinions. Many of her answers were confusing and unclear. She \n     refused to respond to several key questions in an open and \n     honest manner. She also avoided many issues altogether. Since \n     Kagan has had no judicial experience and possesses limited \n     experience as a practicing attorney, we were interested in \n     learning about her judicial philosophy. However, we learned \n     little about her beliefs and judicial views during the \n     confirmation hearings. Rather than providing answers to our \n     concerns, Kagan's responses have only raised more serious \n     questions.\n       After careful consideration, we believe Elena Kagan is not \n     a suitable nominee for the Supreme Court. She has evaded too \n     many questions and her record is too obscure to confirm her \n     to this lifetime appointment. Consequently, we urge you to \n     vote against Kagan's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard D. Land.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the chairman \nand ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy and \nSenator Sessions, on conducting a dignified and respectful hearing on \nthe Kagan nomination.\n  Let me just add that, in my view, the way Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee have conducted themselves in the minority over the \npast few years underscores that the kind of hyperbole and hysteria that \nhas too often accompanied the Supreme Court nominations of Republican \nPresidents is hardly an essential part of the process. The committee \nhearings gave Senators and the American people a valuable opportunity \nto focus our attention on a woman whom President Obama would like to \nsee deciding cases on some of the most important and consequential \nissues we face as a country. Ms. Kagan will be ruling on some of the \nmost important legal questions that arise during President Obama's \nadministration and long after he leaves office. It was vitally \nimportant that we have an opportunity to question her on her views \nabout the law. What we learned from the hearing and what we were unable \nto learn from it form an important part of the record on her \nnomination.\n  But this, of course, is just a part of Ms. Kagan's record. Senators \nhave spent weeks examining Ms. Kagan's experience and background in \nlight of the awesome responsibility that comes with a lifetime \nappointment on our Nation's highest Court. As I have said previously, \nmy own judgment is that Ms. Kagan is not suited to assume a lifetime \nposition on our Nation's highest Court. Now I would like to explain why \nin more detail.\n  As we know, Ms. Kagan does not have the judicial or private practice \nexperience most modern-day Supreme Court Justices have had--far from \nit. This is relevant not because one has to have prior judicial \nexperience in order to be a good Supreme Court Justice--that is not my \nview now, and it never has been--but the absence of judicial experience \nmakes it all the more important that we look more closely at the kind \nof experience Ms. Kagan has, in fact, had. A review of Ms. Kagan's \nexperience reveals a woman who has spent much or her adult life not \nsteeped in the practice of law but in the art of politics.\n  When we look at her resume, we find a woman who has worked fervently \nto advance the goals of the Democratic Party and liberal causes, \nusually at the expense of those with whom she disagrees politically or \nideologically. In college, she spent one summer working 14 hours a day \nfor a liberal Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York. \nWhen her candidate lost, Ms.\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nKagan wrote that it was her hope that one day a ``more leftist left \nwill once again come to the fore.''\n  In fairness, few of us would want everything we said or wrote as \ncollege students put up on a billboard. But the trajectory of Ms. \nKagan's career and the records from her time as a political advisor in \nthe Clinton White House suggest someone, as one news story put it, who, \nlong after college and even at the highest peaks of political \ninfluence, was ``driven and opinionated, with a flair for political \ntactics. . . .''\n  What else do we find in Ms. Kagan's resume?\n  Well, 8 years after that first Senate race, she volunteered for the \nDukakis Presidential campaign, working as an opposition researcher to \ndefend the then-Governor of Massachusetts from attacks and to look for \nways to attack the Republican opposition. I note her job as an \nopposition researcher because it is part of a pattern of partisan \npolitical activity and because Democrats themselves have strongly \nquestioned the impartiality of Republicans who have held this type of \njob.\n  As a Supreme Court law clerk, Ms. Kagan often inserted her own \npersonal views into her legal advice. In one case, for example, she was \ndismissive of a man's second amendment claim because it was something \nthat, in her words, she did not find to be ``sympathetic.''\n  Later, as an aide to President Clinton, she did not serve as an \nattorney but as a policy advocate, seeking legal advice rather than \ngiving it. It was in this role that she helped lead a task force on \nchanging the Nation's campaign finance laws and gleefully noted when \none specific proposal would disadvantage Republicans. She also went out \nof her way to deter lawyers at the Justice Department from officially \nnoting their serious constitutional concerns with a campaign finance \nproposal because it might complicate the pursuit of the Clinton \nadministration's political goals.\n  It was also at the Clinton White House that she suggested turning a \nroutine literacy event at a Maryland school into a chance to score \npolitical points against--you guessed it--Republicans. And it was there \nthat she went to extraordinary lengths to prevent the enactment of a \nban on partial-birth abortion, a procedure the vast majority of \nAmericans strongly oppose.\n  From the Clinton administration, she went on to academia. She had \nstrongly held views and acted upon them there as well. As dean of \nHarvard Law School, she refused to give our military, at all times, the \nfull and good access to which they are entitled under Federal law. \nIndeed, she was so driven by her own personal views on this issue that \nshe took a position in a case before the Supreme Court that was so \nlegally dubious that not a single Justice agreed with it.\n  From Harvard, President Obama--her friend and former colleague at the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School--selected her to be his Solicitor \nGeneral. I, and the vast majority of my Republican colleagues, voted \nagainst her nomination to that position, given her lack of litigation \nexperience. Indeed, Ms. Kagan made her first oral argument in any \ncourt, for any purpose, just last year in the Citizens United case. \nHaving been in the courtroom myself that day, I heard her argue to an \nastonished Supreme Court that the power of the Federal Government is so \nvast it can ban political speech with which it disagrees, such as \npolitical pamphlets, despite the clear commands of the first amendment \nto the contrary.\n  So when we look at Elena Kagan's background, what we find again and \nagain is someone who has worked tirelessly to advance a political \nagenda or ideology, often at the expense of the law.\n  Let's look for a moment at her relationship to the current \nadministration.\n  We know the President and Ms. Kagan are former colleagues and \nfriends. We know that the President views her as an important and loyal \nmember of his team and that he was particularly pleased with her \nhandling of the Citizens United case. And we know the President is \nconfident that Ms. Kagan shares his view that judges should be judged \nespecially on their ability to empathize with some over others--in \nother words, that she embraces the so-called empathy standard whereby \njudges act on, to quote the President, ``their broader vision of what \nAmerica should be,'' which may or may not be what the law says is \nrequired. All of which brings us to the question of whether Ms. Kagan \nis suited to sit on the Supreme Court.\n  We do not have a judicial or private practice record to go to, but \nfrom the record we do have--that of a passionate policy advocate, a \nzealous political operative, and a loyal member of the Obama \nadministration--the President picked precisely--precisely--the kind of \njudge he said he would. But is this the end of the inquiry? The \nPresident won the election. Ms. Kagan is bright. She has a good humor. \nDoes the Constitution suggest that we therefore must assent to her \nnomination? Is that what the Founders envisioned?\n  Well, the Federalist Papers say two things that are particularly \nrelevant here.\n  First, let's look at Federalist 76, which gives examples of specific \ndisqualifiers for confirmation. The common theme for these \ndisqualifiers is someone who is nominated not because of their \nobjective qualifications but because of a personal connection to the \nExecutive--be it friendship, family relationship, or a belief that they \nwill exhibit a bias. It says the Senate's power to disapprove a nominee \n``would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the \nPresident, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit \ncharacters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal \nattachment, or from a view to popularity.'' That is Federalist 76.\n  Now let's look at Federalist 78, which talks about the role of the \ncourts in our democracy and the proper philosophy for a judge. Here, \nHamilton writes that courts may not ``substitute their own pleasure to \nthe constitutional intentions of the legislature.'' He adds that their \njob must be to ``declare the sense of the law'' and that if, instead, \nthey should exercise their ``WILL''--which he puts in all capital \nletters--``the consequence would be . . . the substitution of their \npleasure to that of the legislative body.'' In other words, Hamilton \nwas cautioning against judges so motivated by their own passions and \nsympathies that they would use their judicial power to implement, as \nPresident Obama puts it, ``their broader vision of'' what ought to be.\n  So while Hamilton, in Federalist 76, listed some of the reasons for \ndisqualifying a nominee, this was clearly not an exhaustive list. \nSurely he did not lay out the critical qualification for a judge in \nFederalist 78 and then leave the Senate powerless to enforce it. Both \npapers must be read together, not in isolation, which brings us back to \nMs. Kagan.\n  If you believe the role of a judge is to be an impartial arbiter, Ms. \nKagan's background as a policy advocate and political lawyer--and \noftentimes a very partisan one--cannot be ignored. Indeed, Members of \nboth parties should appreciate the importance of confirming judges who \nare more interested in what the law says than in how the law can be \nused to advantage any one side.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee once put it:\n\n       No one should vote for somebody that's going to be a \n     political apparatchik for either the Democratic Party or the \n     Republican Party.\n\n  If you believe the role of a judge is to be an impartial arbiter, Ms. \nKagan's relationship to the President can't be ignored either. I think \nour friend, the senior Senator from Ohio, put his finger on what \nFederalist 76 was talking about in this regard. As he put it earlier \nthis week:\n\n       I would argue that General Kagan has been nominated based \n     on her friendships and her personal attachments with \n     President Obama and others at the White House, not based on \n     objective qualities that would indicate she is qualified to \n     be a Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  As for the empathy standard, well, empathy may be a very good quality \nin general, but in a court of law it is only good if you are lucky \nenough to be the guy the judge empathizes with. It is only good enough \nif you happen to share the judge's ``broader vision of what America \nought to be,'' which is the exact opposite of what the author of \nFederalist 78 had in mind.\n  Let's say you are a pro-life group challenging a restriction on late-\nterm abortion and you are appearing before a Justice Kagan. In light of \nthe lengths\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nshe went to in order to arrive at her preferred result on the subject \nof partial-birth abortion, do you think you are going to get a fair \nshake?\n  Let's say you think the government is infringing upon your second \namendment rights. Given that she dismissively said she is not \nsympathetic to this sort of challenge, do you think she is going to \napply the law or her own broader vision of how America should be?\n  Let's say you are a conservative nonprofit group that wants to \npublish a pamphlet or show a movie before an election. In other words, \nlet's say you are a group such as Citizens United. Given her record of \npartisan advocacy, how do you think you are going to fare before her in \nthat case?\n  Ms. Kagan has never made a secret of her professional aspirations. \nShe has cultivated all the right friendships along the way, including \nthe President of the United States. This is all well and good but, in \nmy view, it strains credulity to think that Ms. Kagan's strong \npolitical views will be more constrained by the Constitution once she \nreaches her goal than they have been up until now.\n  Some of Ms. Kagan's supporters would like us to focus on her \npersonality. They say she has a knack for making friends and getting \nalong well with different kinds of people. Once again, these are all \nfine qualities. No one has any doubt that Ms. Kagan is bright and \npersonable and easy to get along with. But the Supreme Court is not a \nsocial club. If getting along in polite society were enough reason to \nput someone on the Supreme Court, then we wouldn't need a confirmation \nprocess at all.\n  The goal was not to determine whether we think someone is smart and \neasy going; it is whether someone can be expected to be a neutral and \nindependent arbiter of the law rather than a rubberstamp for this \nadministration or for any other.\n  Whether it is small claims court or the Supreme Court, Americans \nexpect politics to end at the courtroom door. Nothing in Elena Kagan's \nrecord suggests that her politics will stop there.\n  Ms. Kagan's background as a political operative, her lengthy resume \nof zealous advocacy for political and ideological causes, often at the \nexpense of the law and those whose views differ from her own, her \nattachment to the President and his political and ideological goals, \nincluding his belief in the extraconstitutional notion that judges \nshould favor some over others, make her precisely the kind of nominee, \nin my view, the Founders were concerned about and that Senators should \nhave reason to oppose.\n  For these reasons, I will vote against the nominee, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I recommend that \nSenators proceed to the Senate floor to cast their votes. We ask that \nSenators be seated when they cast their votes.\n  Decades before America's founding--when its direction was only \nroughly charted and its doctrines still in draft form--a lawyer from \nMassachusetts wrote that ours must be a nation of laws and not of men. \nThat man, John Adams, knew that the rules and rights of a free land \nmust withstand personal whims and political winds. It is a belief so \nbasic Adams would later enshrine it in his State's constitution.\n  Today we will send to our highest Court another brilliant lawyer from \nMassachusetts, Elena Kagan, someone whose respect for the rule of law \nis matched only by her appreciation for those laws that concern the \ndaily lives of the people they govern. The roots of General Kagan's \nrespect for the rule of law are in her respect for our separation of \npowers. It is a reverence she developed during her service in all three \nbranches of government, defending the first and second amendments, \nstrengthening our national security, and protecting children's safety.\n  Wherever Elena Kagan has gone throughout her considerable career, she \nhas succeeded. At Princeton and Oxford, at the law schools at Harvard \nand the University of Chicago and back to Harvard once again, in the \nprivate sector and in the highest levels of government, she has brought \ntogether people of every ideological stripe.\n  In recent weeks, we have again seen how effectively she impresses and \nunites those she meets. Look at the incredibly diverse array of people \nand organizations speaking in unison in favor of her nomination, \nincluding every Solicitor General, no matter the party, over the last \nquarter century. Now she is poised to join a Court whose power she \nrespects as well as its limits. She understands that the laws are made \nonly on this side of the street and only interpreted on the other side \nof the street.\n  Our Supreme Court promises equal justice for all who come before its \nbench. We must also fulfill the promise of greater equality among those \nwho sit behind the bench.\n  Although the Founders did not want ours to be a government of men, \nfor a long time men were the only ones running it. The most qualified \nwomen were turned away--turned away--one after another. Justice \nO'Connor graduated third in her law school class at Stanford, one of \nthe premier law schools in this country, while others her age were just \nfinishing college. The only job offer she got after graduating third in \nher class was a job as a legal secretary.\n  Justice Ginsburg graduated first in her law school class at Columbia, \nanother premier law school, but not a single law firm would hire her \neither. She was denied a clerkship not by one but two Supreme Court \nJustices because, as they readily admitted, she was a woman.\n  It took nearly 200 years before the Court welcomed Sandra Day \nO'Connor as its first woman and more than a decade longer before Ruth \nBader Ginsburg would join her as its second. A year ago today, Ginsburg \nwas the only woman Justice, but when it opens this fall, three women--a \nfull third of the bench--will preside together for the first time. That \nis progress. It is not yet completely equitable in a nation where women \nrepresent more than one-half the population, but it certainly is \nprogress.\n  That Sotomayor and Kagan can join the Court in such relatively rapid \nsuccession is a tribute to the path their predecessors cleared.\n\n  Justice Ginsburg said last year that ``women belong in all places \nwhere decisions are being made.'' The Supreme Court is certainly one of \nthose places. Elena Kagan is certainly one of those women.\n  As the Senate votes for this nominee on her merits, we are also \nvoting for the most inclusive Court in its long history. It will be \neven more inclusive when we confirm more Justices who don't come from \nIvy League schools.\n  In the oath General Kagan will soon take--the same oath sworn by 111 \nJustices before her--she will pledge to ``do equal right to the poor \nand to the rich.'' That is a commitment her predecessor, Justice John \nPaul Stevens, always fulfilled. We are grateful for Stevens' long \nrecord of service as a decorated war veteran, a successful lawyer, and \nan impartial judge and Justice who summoned common sense in his \nopinions. He was always passionate but always a gentleman.\n  Stevens once wrote: ``Corporations are not part of `We, the People' \nby whom and for whom our Constitution was established.'' General Kagan \nbelieves that too. It is the principle she defended in her first case \nas the first female Solicitor General; that is, our country's chief \nlawyer, when she fought to stop foreign and domestic corporations from \ndrowning out American voters' voices. She knew it would not be an easy \ncase, but she stood for fairness, transparency, and citizens' rights \nbecause that is what a nation of laws demands.\n  General Kagan learned from another trailblazing Justice and her \npersonal hero, Thurgood Marshall, that behind the law lived real \npeople. She knows the Court's rulings can affect working families as \nintimately as they do wealthy interests.\n  The American people deserve a Justice who understands that one \nlitigant's case is no more justified simply because he has more money \nthan his opponent. Elena Kagan will be that Justice.\n  We need a voice on the Supreme Court who remembers and reveres the \nrights of individuals, not because people are always right and \ncorporations are always wrong but because the argument of even the \npoorest citizen should be heard just as loudly, with the same patience \nand deliberation and impartiality as that of the richest firm.\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n  Elena Kagan has demonstrated, time and time again, that she \nunderstands that.\n  In fact, listening is one of her strong suits. Justice Stevens often \nsaid that openly debated differences benefit democracy and he promoted \nwhat he called ``understanding before disagreeing.'' The lawyer and \nteacher the President has chosen to succeed Justice Stevens believes \nthe same.\n  When General Kagan spoke last year to graduates of Harvard Law \nSchool, where she was beloved by the students and faculty alike, she \nreminded them: ``You only learn something when your ears are open, not \nwhen your mouth is open.'' That shows wisdom. It takes a smart person \nto recognize that we make progress and make the right decisions when we \napproach each person and each problem with an open mind. It takes a \nsmarter one to say as much.\n  So I hope each Senator will approach this vote the way General Kagan \nwill approach each question that comes before the Court: with deference \nto the facts, the evidence, and our shared national interests.\n  General Kagan is a public servant who has remained far above the \npolitical fray and will be the only Justice who comes from outside the \njudicial monastery. She is a student and teacher of the law who looks \nup from her books out into the real world. She knows that while we are \na nation of laws and not of men, the former has a genuine and personal \nimpact on the lives of the latter.\n  Because of her intellect and integrity; her reason, restraint, and \nrespect for the rule of law; her unimpeachable character and unwavering \nfidelity to our Constitution, I am proud to cast my vote for Elena \nKagan's confirmation to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We are going to wait until the hour of 3:30 arrives before we start \nto vote.

Mr. President, the Senate has concluded our consideration \nof the nomination of Elena Kagan and confirmed her as an Associate \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court. For the second time in 2 years, we \nhave considered a nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme \nCourt, one of our most consequential responsibilities. I am proud that \nprocess we followed in considering this nomination in the Judiciary \nCommittee and in the Senate has garnered praise from many Senators for \nits fairness and thoroughness.\n  We could not have given this nomination the attention it deserved \nwithout the help of dedicated staff. For months, the staff of the \nJudiciary Committee has worked long hours dutifully to obtain and \nreview extensive amounts of documents and information and help Senators \nin our review. I wish to thank the following members of the majority \nstaff in particular, Jeremy Paris, Erica Chabot, Kristine Lucius, \nShanna Singh Hughey, Maggie Whitney, Hasan Ali, John Amaya, Sarah \nHackett, Sarah Hasazi, Michael Gerhardt, Elise Burditt, Noah \nBookbinder, Anya McMurray, Liz Aloi, Tara Magner, Kelsey Kobelt, Juan \nValdivieso, Matt Virkstis, Curtis LeGeyt, Roslyne Turner, Erin O'Neill, \nJulia Gagne, Brian Hockin, Joseph Thomas, Elizabeth Saxe, Katharine \nMcFarland, Miles Clark, Christine Paquin, David \nZayas, Lydia Griggsby, Adrienne Wojciechowski, Dan Taylor, Patrick \nSheahan, Matt Smith, Scott Wilson, Kiera Flynn, Rachel Pelham, Bree \nBang-Jensen, Chuck Papirmeister, and Bruce Cohen. I also thank my staff \nfor their hard work on this nomination, in particular, Edward Pagano, \nDavid Carle, Laura Trainor, and Kevin McDonald. I would also like to \nthank Stacy Rich from Senator Murray's staff who helped manage the \nfloor.\n  I commend and thank the hard-working staffs of the other Democratic \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee for their tremendous contributions \nto this effort.\n  I also commend and thank Senator Sessions, the committee's ranking \nRepublican, and his staff, in particular, Brian Benczkowski, Danielle \nCutrona, Ted Lehman, and Lauren Pastarnack, for their hard work and \nprofessionalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6830-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is obvious we are not going to be able \nto get to the Defense authorization bill this week. However, it is \nimportant we get to it as soon as possible after we return. In order to \nfacilitate that, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 414, S. 3454, national defense authorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I do so with some \nreluctance, I remind my colleagues that last year we took up the \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill without warning. The \ndistinguished chairman of the committee introduced a hate crimes bill \nwhich had no business on the Defense authorization bill, filled up the \ntree, and then, of course, we spent a great amount of time on hate \ncrimes.\n  I have only been a member of this committee since 1987. I have never \nseen what the chairman of the committee did last year by bringing forth \na totally irrelevant and very controversial issue and putting it on the \nDefense authorization bill. We spent weeks on that when we should have \nbeen spending time on defending this Nation. It was a betrayal of the \nmen and women who are serving this country.\n  I am not going to allow us to move forward, and I will be discussing \nwith my leaders and the 41 Members of this side of the aisle as to \nwhether we are going to move forward with a bill that contains the \ndon't ask, don't tell policy repeal before--before--a meaningful survey \nof the impact on battle effectiveness and morale of the men and women \nwho are serving this Nation in uniform.\n  It is, again, the chairman of the committee and the majority leader \nand the other side moving forward with a social agenda on legislation \nthat was intended to ensure this Nation's security.\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n  Along with it, abortion now is going to be performed in military \nhospitals for the first time in a long time. There is going to be a \ntransparency. The distinguished chairman and his staff, without \ninforming me or anybody else, put in $1 billion worth of porkbarrel \nprojects instead of the $1 billion the administration asked for us to \naid Iraq as we are finally leaving.\n  It is a terrible piece of legislation, ramrodded through. My greatest \nconcern, of course, is about repeal of don't ask, don't tell without \nany survey being done to find out the battle effectiveness and morale, \nwhich we were assured would take place before the repeal of don't ask, \ndon't tell. It is purely a political promise on the part of the \nPresident of the United States and the Members on the other side of the \naisle, and it is disgraceful to have it on this legislation without a \nsurvey being done about our battle effectiveness and the morale of the \nmen and women in the military from whom I am hearing all the time.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, each of the items which the Senator from \nArizona mentioned were voted on in committee. These are decisions that \nwere made by the committee, and if we can get this bill to the floor, \nthe decision will not be left up to the Armed Services Committee; it \nwill be left up to the Senate. If anyone wishes to strike a provision \nthat is in this bill--and the provisions which the Senator from Arizona \ntalked about are all relevant provisions. It was a Senate Armed \nServices Committee bill which put into place don't ask, don't tell. The \nprovision we have in there now which changes that policy makes it \nconditional upon that survey being completed and a certification from \nthe military leaders that there is no negative impact on morale. So we \nhave taken into consideration that survey.\n  The main point is that the place to debate these policies is on the \nfloor of the Senate. The Senate will determine, if we can get this bill \nto the floor, whether we make that conditional change in the don't ask, \ndon't tell policy or whether we do a number of other things, some of \nwhich I objected to in committee.\n  Some of the amendments of the Senator from Arizona that were adopted \nin committee I objected to and voted against. I am not going to deny \nthe Senate the opportunity to take up a bill which is essential for the \nmen and women in the military because I disagree with some provisions \nin that bill. I will then move to strike those provisions if I disagree \nthat much, if we can get the bill to the floor. That is what the Senate \ndebate is supposed to be about.\n  I am sorry there is an objection to this bill coming up. Obviously, \nwe are going to try to get this bill up in September so we can debate \nthe issues which the Senator from Arizona points to. They are \nlegitimate issues for debate. We should debate them, but the only way \nwe can debate them is if we get the bill to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will respond again. Last year, the \nSenator from Michigan did not allow exactly what he is espousing now. \nHe brought up hate crimes and filled the tree so that even if the \nSenator from Arizona wanted to have an amendment on it, I could not do \nit. The hate crimes bill had nothing to do with national defense. It \nhad everything to do with the social agenda of the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  What we have done is, we have eroded the confidence of Members on \nthis side of the aisle as to what the agenda is going to be.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Michigan can tell me what hate crimes had to \ndo with the defense of this Nation. It had everything to do with his \nsocial agenda. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be happy to tell the Senator from \nArizona what hate crimes has to do with the defense of this country. \nMen and women who defend this country defend this country for a lot of \nreasons. One of them is we try to act against hate in this country. \nThat is one of the values we stand for; that we try to defeat hate. \nThat was debated last year. It was voted on last year. The vote maybe \ndid not come out the way the Senator from Arizona wanted.\n  If we want to debate last year, that is OK. Let's bring the bill to \nthe floor so we can debate it. But the objection now makes it much more \ndifficult to bring a bill to the floor so we can debate the very issues \nthe Senator from Arizona wants to debate.\n  We should debate the don't ask, don't tell decision we made in the \ncommittee. It was debated there; it should be debated on the Senate \nfloor. By the way, it is a conditional change in the don't ask, don't \ntell policy. The policy was put in place by the Pentagon and by the \nArmed Services Committee and by the Senate. It is perfectly appropriate \nthat it be considered as part of this bill because it was our committee \nwhich put that policy in effect to begin with.\n  The debate is appropriate. But how do we have that debate unless we \ncan get it to the floor of the Senate? How can we debate the amendments \nof the Senator from Arizona? There were two or three that he offered in \ncommittee that I objected to. How do we get to those debates unless we \ncan get the bill to the floor?\n  I cannot get a guarantee from everybody that I will prevail in my \neffort to strike the amendments of the Senator from Arizona. I cannot \nget that guarantee in advance, nor should the Senator from Arizona seek \na guarantee in advance as to what will be in the final bill or will not \nbe in the final bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I can guarantee that we would not fill up \nthe tree the way the Senator from Michigan did last year and would \nprobably do again this year in violation of what I believe is what the \nSenate should be all about--amending on different legislative proposals \nthat are before the Senate instead of filling up the tree and not \nallowing amending of the bill, despite what the chairman says had \nsomething to do with national defense.\n  Hate crimes? Really? Then that means that everything in the social \nagenda of the Senator from Michigan has to do with the men and women \nwho are serving in the military. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it was the Senate which made a decision \nlast year on hate crimes. It was not the Senator from Michigan, \nalthough I very much favored what the Senate of the United States \ndid. But it was the Senate of the United States which acted in a way \nwhich the Senator from Arizona does not agree to--I don't know how many \namendments we adopted last year, but it was a large number of \namendments which were adopted. A large number of amendments were \ndefeated. I don't know if that tree was filled up, as the Senator puts \nit, last year or not, or when it was filled up. But we had a huge \nnumber of amendments that were considered on this bill.\n\n  It is the intention, I hope and believe, of the leader, and it is \nsurely my intention this year, that we have an amendment process which \nis traditional for the Defense authorization bill; that it be a very \nopen process for amendments on this bill. That is my intention. It is \nthe intention of the majority leader as well. I want to assure my \nfriend from Arizona that will be the case again this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I won't repeat myself over and over. The \nfact is, last year, the Senator from Michigan brought up hate crimes, \nfilled up the tree, and we spent almost all of the first 2 weeks \ndebating hate crimes, which had nothing to do with the purpose and \nmission of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is the first time I \nhave ever seen such a thing happen. I am not going to let it happen \nagain if I have anything to say about it.\n  As I have said to the Senator from Michigan, I will talk to our \nleadership and our caucus and all the Members over on this side of the \naisle, and when we get back a decision will be made as to whether we \nwill object to the motion to proceed. In the meantime, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator from Arizona suggesting we did not have a \nvote on hate crimes last year?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Arizona is saying that the Senator from \nMichigan filled up the tree; did he not? Was the tree filled up? You \nare the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is not my recollection, but that is not my question. My \nquestion is whether we had a vote on hate crimes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My response is did you prevent the tree from being \nfilled?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We did not prevent a vote on hate crimes last year. That \nis my answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for the past 2 weeks, I have come to \nthe floor of the Senate to speak about the critical importance of \npassing child nutrition legislation before we adjourn for the August \nrecess, and I want to say a very special thanks to all of my colleagues \nfor their hard work on this initiative, their willingness to rise above \npartisan politics, regional differences, or anything else, to seize \nthis opportunity. I am so pleased today to say we have seized this \nopportunity to make a historic investment in our children.\n  I started out my discussion here on the floor last week by saying all \nwe would need to get this bill done was a mere 8 hours--a simple 8 \nhours to pass a bill that would improve the lives of millions of \nchildren across this country. With the assistance of my colleagues, we \nwere able to accomplish this goal in much less time than that, and I \nwant to thank my colleagues again for sending such a strong bipartisan \nmessage of support for child nutrition.\n  Before I go any further, I wish first to thank my good friend and the \nranking member of our Agriculture Committee, Senator Chambliss, for his \ntremendous assistance in crafting this legislation and bringing us to \nthis vote today. He is a wonderful partner in the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and he has been a true partner in \nthis effort. I greatly appreciate all his work on this bill. We could \nnot have gotten to this point, nor could we have passed this, without \nhim. So I am grateful to him. I also add my thanks to his staff--Martha \nScott Poindexter and Kate Coler. And, of course, all my thanks go out \nto my staff on the Agriculture Committee--Robert Holifield, Brian \nBaenig, Dan Christenson, Hillary Caron, Courtney Rowe, and Julie Anna \nPotts. They are the absolute best.\n  I also need to thank the administration--the President and First \nLady, as well as Secretary Vilsack--for their incredible leadership on \nchildhood nutrition. Their hands-on involvement, particularly in the \nlast few days, has ensured that we will be able to accomplish this \ngoal. I know this is an issue they all care very deeply and \npassionately about, and that is reflected in the many shared priorities \nbetween the Congress and the administration that are included in this \nbill.\n  I must say the presence of the First Lady, her compassion, her \ndiligence, her tenacity in wanting to see something happen on behalf of \nthe children of this country that was productive, was progressive, and \nthat moved us forward past the benchmarks we had been at since 1973 \nhave been amazing, and I am certainly grateful to her for all she has \ndone.\n  With the passage of this bill, I am pleased we are bringing some \nfresh bipartisan air into the Senate. It goes to show that when you are \nwilling to roll up your sleeves, work across the aisle in a collective \nand bipartisan manner, you truly do see results. That is what the \nAmerican people elected us to do. That is what they expect and that is \nwhat this bill represents.\n  Most importantly, this bill is about our children, and about doing \nwhat is right for them and for their families. It is about connecting \nmore children with the child nutrition programs which their families \ndepend upon to make ends meet. It is about making sure they get the \nnutritious meals they deserve so they can succeed in the classroom and \nlearn better. It is about making sure our schools and classrooms, our \nchildcare settings are all places that promote good health and \nwellness, because we know that children who are healthier learn better \nand they also\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\ngrow up to be healthier adults, contributing more and more to our \ncommunities and our industries and businesses and families.\n  They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and that is \ncertainly true with this bill, which makes huge leaps forward in the \nfight against childhood obesity and chronic disease. We know that \nbetter nutrition and more physical activity are at the heart of \ntackling the obesity epidemic in this country, and this bill promotes \nboth. It provides the largest increase in the child nutrition programs \nsince their inception--nearly 10 times the amount we provided in the \nlast authorization. It includes the first real increase in the \nreimbursement rate for the National School Lunch Program in almost 40 \nyears. Madam President, 40 years. It is amazing to me--I believe I may \nhave been 10 years old at the time--to see that finally, after 40 \nyears, we are making the kind of investment in our reimbursement for \nschool nutrition programs that we should. In exchange for that extra \ncash, children will receive healthier school meals. That is the deal, \nand it is a good deal. It is a good deal for us as a Congress and those \nwho are stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, and it is good for our \nchildren too.\n  It also includes an historic agreement between schools, parents, \npublic health and nutrition advocates, and the leaders in the food and \nbeverage industry to establish national school nutrition standards \nthroughout the school campus, not just in the lunchroom. This provision \ncomplements the commonsense steps we have already taken in my home \nState of Arkansas to ensure that our school environments are as healthy \nas possible for our children. With passage of this bill, we will be \nbringing some of that Arkansas wisdom to the rest of our country, and I \nam very proud of the hard work that has gone into our schools in \nArkansas as well as our fight against childhood obesity. We are so \nincredibly proud of the steps we have taken and the successes we have \nalready seen.\n  The bill also takes tremendous steps forward in the fight against \nchildhood hunger in Arkansas and all across our country. It reduces the \nredtape that serves as a barrier to accessing child nutrition programs \nand will connect over 100,000 additional children per year with free \nschool meals. In this day and age--and particularly in this economy--\nthat is so critical for working families. It improves the way we feed \nhungry children during the out-of-school time. Because of this bill, an \nadditional 29 million meals per year will be served through afterschool \nprograms so children don't have to go to bed hungry, they don't have to \nleave school hungry, they don't have to go home hungry.\n  I know there are many who wish to have seen us do more. I too would \nhave liked to have gone further and made even bigger investments. But \nin this budget environment, with record deficits, we have been able to \nproduce a bill that is fully paid for and will not add one dime to the \ndeficit. It is the fiscally responsible and right thing to do by our \nchildren. At a time when families are scrimping and saving to make \ntheir own budgets work, we simply must pass this bill so their children \ncan live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. And we will. We \nhave.\n  Today, in this Chamber, we have taken a major step forward. We have \nmade a strong commitment to our children and to improving the health of \nthe next generation of Americans. With the passage of this bill we are \nushering in a new era that will feed the minds and the bodies and the \nsouls of millions of children across this country. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues to see this legislation signed \ninto law as well as making sure we are implementing this as quickly as \nwe can, as we know that schoolchildren will be starting back to school \nhere in the next couple of weeks. We must work hard to see this \nlegislation signed into law so we can make an investment in our \nchildren--our greatest blessings, our greatest resource--that will last \nthem a lifetime.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \npassed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. I am supportive of \nthe final product before us to reauthorize these important child \nnutrition programs.\n  The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry had \nthree goals in mind as we drafted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of \n2010: expand access to existing programs to better reach children in \nneed, improve the nutritional quality of meals, and simplify program \nrules to improve operations. I am extremely pleased that all three of \nthese goals are met with this legislation.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 makes a significant \ninvestment of over $3 billion to improve the nutritional quality of \nschool meals. The performance-based increase to the reimbursement rate \nshould entice more schools to meet higher standards faster than an \nacross-the-board increase.\n  This legislation also gives USDA the authority to regulate all foods \nsold on school campuses, far beyond the existing authority to regulate \nonly meals served through the National School Lunch Program. I have \nbeen impressed with industry efforts to work with schools to create \nconsistent voluntary guidelines to reduce caloric intake of food and \nbeverages sold on school campuses. I urge the Secretary of Agriculture \nto look closely at the success of existing voluntary agreements and use \nthem as a model for future regulations.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 also provides greater \naccess to nutrition programs for low-income children across the \ncountry. By expanding afterschool meals, promoting direct \ncertification, and expanding community eligibility for universal meal \nservice, this legislation will ensure that more children who need \nnutrition assistance will be able to participate in the programs.\n  I would like to thank all the members of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee for their efforts and support of this legislation, as well as \nthank chairman Lincoln for her leadership throughout the process.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed legislation \nthat will make a historic investment in our children by approving the \nfirst increase in real terms of the reimbursement rate for school \nlunches in 40 years.\n  Now 10,000 children a year will have new access to free school meals. \nThroughout the country, there are people working hard to make sure \nthese kids have a least one healthy meal each day. In my State, one of \nthe people who makes that happen is Betty Brain of the Blazers Boys and \nGirls Club in Portland. She is known as Chef Betty and every day she \ncooks meals for more than 200 underserved kids, dishing up healthy \nfoods with fresh ingredients to keep them healthy and strong.\n  Chef Betty is not just a cook. She is an inspiration to the kids who \ncome to the Boys and Girls Club every day. These kids are family to \nher, and she makes it her personal responsibility to make sure they get \nnot only a good meal but also a kind word and a helping hand.\n  I can guarantee that there is a Chef Betty in every Boys and Girls \nClub in America--someone who understands how important it is to help a \nchild in whatever way she can.\n  For all the Chef Bettys in America, we need to reauthorize these \nprograms so they can keep those kids from being forced into eating not \njust any food but good food made by good people.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate just passed \nthe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. This legislation makes historic \ninvestments in the health and nutrition of our Nation's children. In \naddition to increasing funding for a number of programs, without adding \na penny to the deficit, it requires a long overdue update of the \nnutrition standards for the food in our schools. I commend the \nchairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lincoln, and its \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, and their staffs for their hard work \non this important legislation. I also thank our leadership for working \nto ensure this bill passed.\n  I am particularly glad the bill includes provisions based on \nlegislation, the Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act, \nSenator Kohl and I introduced last year to improve school breakfast \nprograms. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act will help schools invest in \ntheir breakfast programs. Many of my colleagues know that school \nbreakfast programs face hurdles that reduce participation. This bill \nwill help schools start new breakfast programs, as well as expand or \nimprove existing programs.\n  As I mentioned, this legislation also includes a provision to update \nschool nutrition standards based on legislation introduced for the past \nseveral Congresses by Senator Harkin that I\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nhave cosponsored. I am pleased that these standards will be updated and \nexpanded to foods sold outside of the cafeteria.\n  I have long advocated programs and policies that ensure schools have \naccess to fresh, local food. I worked with other Senators to ensure the \n2008 farm bill removed barriers to local procurement and preference for \nour country's schools. Along those lines, I am glad that the Healthy, \nHunger-Free Kids Act provides funding for farm-to-school programs which \nhelp connect farmers to schools and provide children with a new \nperspective on nutrition and food. Many Americans are now generations \nremoved from the farm, and these programs can provide valuable \nknowledge of where food comes from and how it is grown. They can also \nprovide farmers with a new marketing opportunity and allow them to \ncollaborate directly with local schools.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act also reauthorizes a number of \nimportant programs outside of schools, including the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC, \nthe Child and Adult Care Food Program, afterschool feeding programs and \nSummer Meals. These programs are all critical to ensuring that our \nchildren do not go hungry outside of the school environment as well.\n  I am also glad that the bill includes provisions to streamline our \nnutrition programs, such as direct certification, categorical \neligibility, and community eligibility. It also includes funding for \npilot programs to improve methods of providing healthy food to our \nchildren, which will allow local schools to try programs that work for \nthem and will likely generate creative new ideas to national problems.\n  I commend Senators Lincoln and Chambliss for ensuring the full cost \nof this legislation is offset. Though I might have preferred different \noffsets, I am pleased that we are able to improve our child nutrition \nprograms without passing the cost onto the very children these programs \nwill help.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate has taken a lengthy stride \ntoward improving the health of America's children and addressing two of \nthe greatest threats to their wellbeing and security: hunger and \nobesity. By passing the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act to \nreauthorize Federal child nutrition programs, we will be making a \nhistoric investment in our children's future and in the Nation's \nfuture. With others in this body, I have pressed for action on this \nbill before the Senate completed its business this week. I am pleased \nthat the Senate and our leaders made this bill the priority that our \nchildren deserve it to be.\n  I have heard from countless Vermont parents, teachers, school \nadministrators, food service workers, community leaders, farmers and \nothers about the importance of making sure every child in America has \naccess to nutritious meals at school. They all want what's best for our \nchildren, and they all know how crucial it is that we have passed this \nlegislation today.\n  In March of this year, more than 4 months ago, the Senate \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee unanimously approved \nthis bipartisan bill, upon which our Chairman and Ranking Member have \nworked so hard. Today's action has come just in time, as the September \n30 deadline to reauthorize these programs is quickly approaching. \nWithout action today, I have been concerned that we would have been \nforced into another long-term extension of these vital programs, \nsidelining the tremendous improvements that the Agriculture Committee \nhas been working on for months.\n  I am grateful for Chairman Lincoln and Ranking Member Chambliss for \nall that they have done to ensure that we could pass this bipartisan \nbill. Our First Lady also deserves credit for the impetus that has \nhelped propel our efforts forward. She has vigorously and ably taken up \nthe cause of solving the problem of childhood obesity within a \ngeneration, so that kids born today can reach adulthood at healthy \nweights. The groundbreaking legislation that the Senate has passed \ntoday will bring fundamental changes to our schools and will improve \nthe food options available to our children.\n  When the first national school lunch program was created in 1946, \nchildren in this country were plagued with malnutrition from not having \nenough of the proper nutrients for health, growth and development. At \nthe time it was considered a matter of national security to safeguard \nthe health and well being of our nation's children. That was a far \ndifferent era in the health of our Nation, but the importance of these \nprograms and the children they help has not diminished. Unfortunately, \nthe health statistics for children in this country today are troubling; \nin fact one in five children in this country is considered obese.\n  Thankfully this bill will help to put those children on the road to \nhealthier, more productive and longer lives. The Healthy, Hunger-Free \nKids Act establishes for the first time, ever, national school \nnutrition standards to ensure our children have healthier options \navailable throughout the entire school day. With this legislation, \nparents across the country will know that the snacks and foods offered \nto their children at school, even the vending machine and a la carte \nlunch line options, are based on national standards established by USDA \nto ensure healthier diets.\n  I believe that our school cafeterias should be treated as an \nextension of the classroom and as an opportunity for students to learn \nabout nutrition, well-balanced meals, and where their food comes from. \nI thank the Chairman for including funding for the Farm to School \nprogram, which is a proven, common-sense, community-driven approach to \nimprove the health and wellbeing of children while supporting our local \nfarmers and economy. My goal in authoring the Farm to School program \nwas the powerful logic of this ``two-fer'' an opportunity to get money \ninto the hands of American farmers for their locally grown products, \nwhile supporting local economies and teaching kids about nutritious \nfoods and where they come from. Vermont is leading the country in this \neffort, and I hope other States will be able to learn from our \nexperiences as they incorporate more local and healthy foods into their \ncafeterias.\n  It is a sad reality that hunger is a regular part of life for far too \nmany children in America today, and for many children, the meals they \nget at school are sometimes the only things they will eat all day. In \nVermont one in ten people live in food insecurity, and many of these \nare our most vulnerable, our children. In addition to increasing \nreimbursement rates and streamlining the nutrition programs to make \nthem easier for families to utilize, this legislation also improves \nsummer and afterschool meal programs.\n  I again thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for doing a remarkable job with this legislation. \nTheir hard work and dedication, and that of their staff, have resulted \nin bill that makes a historic investment in the future of this country.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I am thrilled that today the Senate has \npassed what must be a top Senate priority every day: the health and \nwell being of our children.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act reauthorizes child nutrition \nprograms before they expire on September 30. This bipartisan, \ncompletely paid-for legislation will make the most historic investment \nin child nutrition programs since their inception. And I am proud to \nsupport this bill.\n  At a time when childhood obesity rates are skyrocketing and child \npoverty is increasing, this bill couldn't be more important. For kids \nto be successful in the classroom they must be well nourished--kids who \neat right, learn better.\n  More than 390,000 Colorado kids and millions more nationwide--rely on \nschool meals, and this bill will make sure that those meals--and other \nfoods kids have access to while at school--are nutritious and healthy. \nAnd that is just one example of the important investments this bill \nmakes.\n  Coloradans know the value of healthy living--perhaps that is one \nreason why my State is the fittest State in the Union--but we too are \nstruggling with rapidly increasing obesity rates, particularly among \nchildren.\n  Colorado is tackling the concurrent problems of child hunger and \nchildhood obesity head-on with a State-led effort of ending childhood \nhunger by 2015 and a roadmap to do it. Simultaneously\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nColorado has school districts and communities that are leading the \nNation in piloting innovative models that put healthy eating and active \nliving at the top of their priority list.\n  I am thrilled that the bill we passed today builds on and supports \nthe work that my State is already doing, while challenging Colorado and \nother States to go even further, to eliminate childhood hunger, to \ntackle childhood obesity, to emphasize wellness, and to build a healthy \nfoundation for all kids.\n  Chairman Lincoln, Ranking Member Chambliss, thank you for your \nleadership and diligent work on this historic bill. Passage of the \nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is an example of the Senate doing exactly \nwhat it should--delivering for our kids.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6835-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I rise to speak this afternoon on the \nfloor of the Senate about an issue that is very critically important to \nthe people of this country, and that is our relationship with Latin \nAmerica.\n  This weekend, the new President of Colombia will be sworn in--Juan \nManuel Santos--and he follows a great leader in Colombia, President \nUribe, who, in my mind, is the Abraham Lincoln of that country. He kept \nthat country unified at a very difficult time, while it was wracked \nwith what was then a civil war. Eight years ago, President Uribe \nbrought the country back together. He was able to fight the FARC, keep \nthe country from falling into a narcoterrorist state, and has brought \nstability to Colombia. They are perhaps our best friend in Latin \nAmerica.\n  Colombia is a vibrant, beautiful country, full of good people, with a \ndemocracy that now works. This last election is a tribute to President \nUribe. On behalf of my State of Florida and the Senate, I rise to \ncongratulate President Uribe and the great work he did on behalf of \nColombia, as well as to welcome in President Santos.\n  Our relationship with Colombia is very important. They are a key \ntrading partner to the United States and a key trading partner to my \nhome State of Florida. When you are walking around and perhaps seeing \nsome fresh flowers--there are some here in this Congress--but wherever \nyou are in this country, there is a very good chance those flowers came \nfrom Colombia. Seventy percent of the flowers we have in this country \nthat are purchased by local florists come from Colombia, and they come \nthrough Miami on their way to your local florists.\n  We have a great trading relationship. That is why, in 2006, we \nentered into a free trade agreement with Colombia. Unfortunately, we \nhave not ratified that agreement. Along with the free trade agreements \nfor Panama and South Korea, they have languished without approval. The \nPresident spoke about this in his State of the Union Address--the \nimportance of passing these free trade agreements--yet we still don't \nhave those agreements before us here in the Congress. For one reason or \nanother, they have yet to be ratified.\n  There is a lot of talk in this Chamber about the creation of jobs, \nand that that should be our focus. Well, passing these free trade \nagreements would get Americans back to work. Right now those countries \nbasically have free trade with us but we don't have free trade with \nthem. Ninety percent of all Colombian products sold in the United \nStates enter our country duty free. Yet American goods face tariffs of \nup to 35 percent when entering Colombia.\n  According to the Latin America Trade Coalition, in 2008, more than \n6,000 small- and medium-sized American businesses exported to Colombia. \nIf we were to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, more than 80 \npercent of U.S. consumer and manufacturing products and most U.S. farm \ngoods would immediately enter Colombia duty free.\n  Implementing this treaty could increase our gross domestic product by \n$2.5 billion. I say to my friends in the majority, if they want to \ncreate jobs in this country--and that certainly should be what we are \nfocused most on in this most troubling economy--let's pass these free-\ntrade agreements. Let's do it when we get back from the break; let's do \nit in September. We should have already done it.\n  When I met with President Uribe in January of this year and talked to \nhim about a variety of issues, he looked at me painfully and said: Why \nis our friend, the United States of America, not ratifying this \nagreement?\n  Our greatest friend in the region, a bright spot of democracy, a \nPresident who has fought the narcoterrorists, stabilized this country \nas a bulwark against Venezuela and all the threats that posed to our \nregion, and we can't ratify this agreement? It is a shame. It is \nsomething we need to do. We need to do it as well as ratify the \nagreement with Panama, as well as the one with South Korea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6835-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6835-S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING REAR ADMIRAL LEROY COLLINS, JR.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I rise today to give special \nrecognition to the life and work of a great Floridian who was \ntragically killed in Florida unexpectedly just a few weeks ago. RADM \nLeRoy Collins, Jr., is the son of our former Governor, Governor LeRoy \nCollins. He was an admiral in the Navy. He was the head of the Veterans \nAffairs Division in the State of Florida where I had the opportunity to \npersonally work with him when I served the Governor. A native of \nTallahassee, FL, he received his commission from the Naval Academy in \nJune 1956 and began a long career in the Navy.\n  His first tour was aboard the amphibious transport USS Calvert, \nfollowed by the Submarine Officer's Basic Course in Groton, CT, and he \nlater served abroad the U.S. submarine Chivo.\n  Through hard work, dedication and sacrifice, LeRoy earned the rank of \nrear admiral.\n  Admiral Collins served as an analyst for naval Intelligence in \nWashington, DC, and as a ballistic missile weapons officer aboard the \nnuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine USS James Madison. After a \nbrief tour working missile test operations at the Naval Ordnance \nTraining Unit, in Cape Canaveral, he transferred to the Navy Reserve in \n1966.\n  While a naval reservist, Admiral Collins served as commanding officer \nof the coastal minesweeper USS Thrush and later as commander of various \nNavy Reserve submarine units. During his time, he was the Navy's \nliaison to the Florida National Guard and also commanding officer of \nthe Navy liaison unit at U.S. Readiness Command, headquartered at \nMacDill Air Force Base, FL.\n  The admiral served as Commander, Naval Reserve Readiness Command, \nRegion 8 and later as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Reserve) for \nLogistics, Pentagon, until his retirement from the Navy Reserve as a \ntwo-star rear admiral in October, 1990.\n  Admiral Collins also had a career in business. He spent time with the \nFlorida Power & Light Company and IBM. He was the founding president of \nFinancial Transaction Systems, Inc., and president of Telecredit \nService Center, Inc. In addition, he served as president of Dynamic \nRealty of Tampa, Inc., was chairman of Gateway Holdings, Inc., and \nserved as president of the Armed Forces Financial Network.\n  He was a great Floridian. The Collins family is perhaps Florida's \nfirst family. Governor Collins is perhaps our greatest Governor. \nAdmiral Collins upheld the tradition of his family that traces it roots \nall the way back to the founding of Florida. The property upon which \nour Governor's Mansion sits was given by the Collins family. Their \nhome, The Grove, sits right next door.\n  Admiral Collins was in many ways everything you would expect of a \ngreat Floridian. He was genteel, he was kind, he was smart. Public \nservice mattered to him.\n  On behalf of the people of Florida, on behalf of the Senate, I extend \nour condolences to his wife Jane and their family on the passing of a \ntruly great Floridian. He and they are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6836-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6836-S6837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           PIGFORD SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I rise to associate myself with the \nremarks of the chair of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lincoln, as \nwell as Senators Grassley and Landrieu, concerning the importance of \nproviding funding to pay the still pending claims of the Black farmers \nwho were discriminated against by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nThis case has North Carolina roots. Timothy Pigford, a Black farmer, \nwas the focal point for this class action lawsuit. He grew up in \nColumbus County and had a farm in Bladen County, NC. He was first \ndenied a Federal loan to buy a farm in 1976.\n  Mr. Pigford and others filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nPigford v. Glickman, alleging that the USDA maintained a pattern and \npractice of discrimination against Black farmers.\n  In 1999, the government settled the Pigford v. Glickman case, finding \nthat thousands of African-American farmers were in fact discriminated \nagainst when applying for benefits that would help their farms.\n  Under the terms of the settlement, eligible farmers initially were \nrequired to submit completed claims packages by October 12, 1999. This \ndeadline was subsequently extended by the court to September 15, 2000. \nApproximately 61,000 petitions were filed after the original October \n1999 deadline but before the September 2000 late filing deadline. Of \nthese 61,000 petitions, only around 2,500 were permitted to proceed to \na determination on the merits. Over 25,000 additional petitions were \nfiled after the September 2000 late filing deadline and before the May \n2008 enactment of the 2008 farm bill.\n  It is quite clear that inadequate notice was provided to those who \nhad viable claims of discrimination against the USDA. Because of this \ninadequate notice, many farmers were denied participation in the \nPigford claims resolution process as late filers.\n  The 2008 farm bill provided $100 million to pay the outstanding \nclaims of the so-called late filers. However, the amount of money that \nwas set aside in the farm bill for the settlement is totally inadequate \nto satisfy the damages that more than 4,000 African-American farmers in \nNorth Carolina, and a total of 75,000 nationwide, could be eligible to \nreceive.\n  Last February, Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack reached a \nsettlement agreement with the farmers who filed claims after the \ndeadline set by the court who were originally denied a determination of \ntheir Pigford claims. This settlement agreement provides, once and for \nall, sufficient awards for farmers who were the victims of \ndiscrimination at the hands of their own government, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  The Federal Government has failed to live up to its obligations to \nour Black farmers, including more than 4,000 in my State of North \nCarolina.\n  Today the Senate has the opportunity to live up to its obligations \nand right this wrong. I believe it is imperative that we address this \ninequity for Black farmers across the country, including those in North \nCarolina, and I hope we are able to reach an agreement to resolve this \nissue today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, even though he has left the floor, I \nwould like to thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for \npermitting me to proceed. I want to comment on what the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina spoke on because that is my topic as well. \nWe hope to be able to bring up this issue on the Senate floor and get \nsome justice for the Black farmers.\n  I come to the floor today to speak about justice and the Department \nof Agriculture. Let me go back a few years.\n  Though civil rights legislation in the 1960s was supposed to have \noutlawed racial discrimination, at least on the Federal level, a 1982 \nreport issued by the Civil Rights Commission stated that the USDA was \n``a catalyst in the decline of the black farmer.''\n  That year, African-American farmers received only 1 percent of all \nfarm ownership loans, only 2.5 percent of all farm-operating loans, and \nonly 1 percent of all soil and water conservation loans. That year, \ntoo, the Reagan administration closed the USDA's Civil Rights Office--\nthe very arm that investigated discrimination complaints.\n  Adding insult to injury, when African-American and other minority \nfarmers filed complaints, the USDA did little to address them. In 1983, \nPresident Reagan pushed through budget cuts that eliminated the USDA \nOffice of Civil Rights--and officials admitted they ``simply threw \ndiscrimination complaints in the trash without ever responding to or \ninvestigating them'' until 1996, when President Clinton ordered the \noffice re-opened.\n  Even when there were legal findings of discrimination at USDA, they \noften went unpaid--and those that did get paid, the money often came \ntoo late, since the farm had already been foreclosed.\n  In 1984 and 1985, the USDA lent $1.3 billion to farmers nationwide to \nbuy land. Of the almost 16,000 farmers who received those funds, only \n209 were Black. By 1992, in North Carolina, the number of Black farms \nhad fallen to 2,498, a 64 percent drop since 1978.\n  In Illinois, there are many similar stories. As a child growing up on \nthe family farm in west central Illinois, Lloyd Johnson remembers \ncropland extending for miles around, all of it owned by African-\nAmericans like himself. ``For a stretch of four miles, it was black-\nowned land,'' the 66-year-old farmer recalls. ``Now there's mighty \nfew.''\n  Today, Johnson's farm in Alton, IL, is one of just 59 run by African \nAmericans across the State, down from 123 in 1997, according to revised \nfigures from a 2002 census. As farming has become a big business, it \nhas become one of the least diverse businesses around.\n  It was not always. In 1920, Illinois had 892 Black farmers, and \nAfrican Americans owned 14 percent of the Nation's farmland. Now they \nhold less than 1 percent. The same pressure to consolidate that has \nreduced the ranks of farmers for the past century is making any \nturnaround unlikely, demographers say. The number of Black farmers in \nIllinois, currently less than one in 1,000, appears destined to \neventually hit zero. Probably there will be none very shortly.\n  In 1990, The Minority Farmers Rights Act, created to address the \ninjustices noted at USDA, and passed in this body by former Senator \nWyche Fowler of Georgia, who sat on the Agriculture Committee, \nauthorized $10 million a year in technical assistance to minority \nfarmers.\n  The new program was only able to garner $2 to $3 million a year under \nPresident Reagan, and was in danger of being de-funded altogether. As \nworking capital and technical assistance was systematically denied to \nBlack farmers across America, most rural African-American farmers did \nnot have access to essential legal assistance and fell prey to land \nspeculators and unscrupulous lawyers.\n  In 1994, the Land Loss Prevention Project filed a Freedom of \nInformation Act lawsuit on behalf of Black farmers, turning key \ninformation over to Congress to investigate discriminatory practices by \nthe USDA. Again, USDA released a report analyzing data from 1990 to \n1995, and found that ``minorities received less than their fair share \nof USDA money for crop payments, disaster payments, and loans.''\n  In 1997, a USDA Civil Rights Team found the agency's system for \nhandling civil rights complaints was still in shambles: the agency \ndisorganized, the process for handling complaints about program \nbenefits ``a failure,'' and the process for handling employment \ndiscrimination claims was ``untimely and unresponsive.''\n  A follow-up report by the GAO in 1999 found that 44 percent of \nprogram discrimination cases, and 64 percent of employment \ndiscrimination cases, had been backlogged for over a year.\n  It was against this backdrop in 1997, that a group of Black farmers \nled by Tim Pigford of North Carolina filed a class action lawsuit \nagainst the USDA. In all, 22,000 farmers were granted access to the \nlawsuit, and in 1999, the government admitted wrongdoing and agreed to \na $2.3 billion settlement--the largest civil rights settlement in \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\n  However, African-American farmers had misgivings with the process of \nthe Pigford settlement. Many farmers who joined the lawsuit were also \ndenied payment. By one estimate, 9 out of 10 farmers who sought \nrestitution under Pigford were denied. The Bush Department of Justice \nspent 56,000 office hours and 12 million contesting farmers' claims; \nand many farmers feel their cases were dismissed on technicalities.\n\n  I would like to remember what Congresswoman Eva Clayton, an African-\nAmerican Democrat from North Carolina, said at a March 1999 Black \nfarmers rally at the Federal Courthouse in Washington, DC: ``There is \nreason to despair . . . There are several reasons why the number of \nblack farmers is declining so rapidly. But the one that has been \ndocumented time and time again, is the discriminatory environment \npresent in the Department of Agriculture . . . the very agency \nestablished to accommodate the special needs of farmers . . . Once land \nis lost, it is very difficult to recover . . . We stand here today in \ndespair over this history. Yet, we also stand here today in hope that \njustice will prevail, and that the record will be set right for those \nfarmers who have been wronged . . . ''\n  Shortly after coming into office, President Obama's Secretary of \nAgriculture, Tom Vilsack, signaled a change in direction at USDA. The \nSecretary has declared ``A New Civil Rights Era at USDA,'' and stepped-\nup handling of civil rights claims in the agency.\n  This year, Secretary Vilsack responded to concerns over handling of \nthe original Pigford case, agreeing to a historic second payment in \nApril, known as Pigford II, that would expand the settlement to farmers \nwho were excluded from the first case.\n  We are here today to help put an end to this long-standing injustice. \nPigford II is before us and will help make right this history of \ndiscrimination by one of our own government agencies.\n  I want to thank Leader Reid for his unceasing efforts in bringing the \nPigford II and Cobell settlements before us, and I thank others who \ncame before me and those of us here today, on both sides of the aisle, \nwho have advanced the force of justice on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider carefully this important question \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6837-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6837-S6838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nweek after week since the health care bill was signed into law, with a \ndoctor's second opinion of the health care law. I do this as someone \nwho has practiced medicine, taking care of the families in Wyoming as \nan orthopedic surgeon for 25 years; as someone who has been the medical \ndirector of the Wyoming Health Fairs, to give people low-cost blood \nscreenings so they can have early detection of medical problems to help \nthem find problems early. And early treatment following early detection \nis something that always works to keep down the cost of their medical \ncare.\n  I wish to talk about the fact that we have seen again this week a new \ndevelopment, and the development this week is that the American people \nhave spoken. They have done it in the Show Me State of Missouri. The \nShow Me State has shown Washington that they have rejected the \nPresident's takeover of the health care system in this country.\n  Like so many Americans, voters in Missouri are sick and tired of \nWashington forcing things upon them, telling them what they need to do, \nand now telling them what they need to buy--specifically in terms of \nthe Federal mandate that people have health insurance, that they must \ngo out and buy that or face penalties, taxes, fines related to the fact \nthat they make a choice to not buy health insurance.\n  I think the voters are also tired of being ignored by Washington. \nThat is why 71 percent of the voters in Missouri on Tuesday--71 \npercent, over 7 out of 10--who went to the polls rejected the demand by \nWashington that they be forced to buy a product, to buy health \ninsurance. It is part of the law. It is a mandate. They have to have \nhealth insurance, have to buy it.\n  So how did the White House respond to this rejection of what has now \nbeen forced down the throats of the American voters? Well, Robert \nGibbs, the White House Press Secretary, was questioned on this during \nthe White House press conference, and he was asked what it means that \nvoters in Missouri would vote against this Federal mandate, and Gibbs \nsaid ``nothing.'' It means nothing. Well, to the voters of Missouri \nwhom I have talked to, this is an insult. It does mean something. They \nexpressed their opinion, and the White House said: Your opinion means \nnothing to us.\n  So instead of trying to address the concerns and fix the new law, \nright now the White House seems to be more focused on a slick public \nrelations program. They have a whole campaign going.\n  It is interesting because the people of Missouri are not the only \nones who are opposed to this law. Later this year, voters in a couple \nof other States will be voting as well on the impact and the mandate.\n  A new Rasmussen poll out just this past week says that 57 percent of \nAmericans--I am talking about likely voters; that is how they polled \nthis, likely voters--said this recently passed health care law, in \ntheir opinion, is bad for our country. So 57 percent of Americans feel \nthe law that was forced down the throats of the American people, with \nthe American people screaming: Do not pass this law--even today, 57 \npercent of Americans, as they learn more and more about what is in the \nlaw, believe it is bad for the country. That is actually the highest \nlevel of pessimism about this law since the law was passed in March.\n  Support for the law continues to erode. So what happens? Well, the \nWhite House comes out with a public relations campaign, and once again \nthey are setting their sights on America's seniors. They did it with a \nvery expensive glossy mailer that went out to the seniors on Medicare. \nIt looked to me like a propaganda piece--very misleading. Once again, \nthey are focused on the seniors. Why? Well, because the seniors are \nthose who are most opposed to the new health care law, the one that \ntakes $500 billion away from Medicare, not to save Medicare, the health \ncare program for our seniors, but to start a whole new government \nprogram for someone else.\n  So this week, what happened? At the end of last week, the new \ndirector of Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Berwick--and we have talked \nabout him on the Senate floor. He is the one who had a recess \nappointment, the one who is in love with the British health care \nsystem, the new director who had the recess appointment who has never \ncome to the Senate to share his answers with the American people. The \nAmerican people have been denied the right to hear from him. He did not \nhave time to share his views with the American people, but he did have \ntime to introduce a slick new ad campaign to try to sell the new law to \nMedicare patients.\n  The health care law is out there now being promoted in a television \nad for which the American taxpayer is going to have to pay the bill. \nThe American taxpayers are going to pay the bill, and the ad stars Andy \nGriffith. During this ad--and we know Andy Griffith from Andy of \nMayberry, the television show, and in later years, Matlock. He is used \nas the spokesman now to our seniors, telling seniors a number of \nthings, making a number of promises. Let's go through them.\n\n  One is, he says seniors will have their ``guaranteed benefits.'' \nWell, only in Mayberry does a $500 billion cut equal better care for \nAmerican seniors. Even the administration's own actuaries and own \nspecialists in Medicare took a look at this, and they don't even agree \nwith the commercials. They say the cuts are unlikely to be sustainable \nover time. They say that one in six hospitals and doctors offices \nrelated to Medicare providers are going to become unprofitable within \n10 years, and many may be forced to close. They say the new law is \ngoing to jeopardize patient access to medical care.\n  Well, then Mr. Griffith says: ``Well, more good things are coming.'' \nWell, what kinds of things for our seniors on Medicare? When you take a \nlook at how the cuts are out there--there are cuts for home health, \nwhich is a lifeline for seniors who try to stay out of\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\na nursing home. There are cuts to nursing homes for Medicare. There are \ncuts in physical therapy. There are cuts to hospice, where many people \nspend the last days of their lives. There are cuts across the board. I \ndo not know how that can be related to ``more good things are coming.''\n  The President's Medicare experts tell us that benefits aren't going \nto remain the same because things would happen with Medicare Advantage. \nOne out of four people on Medicare is signed up for Medicare Advantage, \nand the reason they do it is because there are advantages of being on \nMedicare Advantage in terms of preventive care, in terms of coordinated \ncare. There are good reasons people sign up for that. Yet there are \ngoing to be cuts there.\n  In the commercial, they also say the law will lower prescription \ncosts, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that is not true, \nthat the cost of prescriptions will continue to go up.\n  There are people who look at ads, political ads, different kinds of \nads. There is an organization called factcheck.org, and what they did \nis they said this commercial uses--their words are ``weasel words,'' \nthey say, to avoid telling the truth. Well, that is the fundamental \nproblem. As much as most Americans love to hear from Andy Griffith, we \nwould prefer to hear the truth from President Obama. Instead of \nspending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer \nmoney--taxpayer money--on a misleading ad, the President should put \nthis money toward the $500 billion that has been cut from our seniors \non Medicare.\n  The White House continues to believe the American people do not \nunderstand what is in the health care law, and they say that is the \nreason it is unpopular. They say that if more people understood the \nlaw, well, then it would be more popular. But week after week, \nsomething else comes out, another broken promise that makes people \nrealize this is not good for them. It is not good for them as patients; \nit is not good for the providers, the nurses and doctors who take care \nof the patients; and it is not good for the payers, the people who are \npaying for their health care, the taxpayers of America. Across the \nboard, people realize, as they learn more and more about what is in \nthis law, that it is not good for them.\n  When I go to senior centers and visit with seniors, I say: How many \nof you believe it is going cost you more for our health care? Every \nhand goes up.\n  Then I say: How many of you believe the quality of your care is going \nto go down? Every hand goes up.\n  You see the same thing if you go to a Kiwanis Club or a Lions Club or \na Rotary Club, civic organizations, whomever you visit. Do you think \nthe cost of your care is going to go up? Every hand goes up. Do you \nthink the quality of your care is going to go down? The hands go up \nagain. That is not what the American people want--paying more and \ngetting less.\n  Well, I think the American people are really getting a good \nunderstanding of what is in this bill, and the people of Missouri have \nclearly reflected that Tuesday in the voting booth.\n  Earlier this week, I joined Senator Coburn, the other physician in \nthe Senate--there are only two physicians who serve in this body--and \nother Members of the Senate in sending a letter to Secretary Sebelius, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. What we requested is that \nthe Department stop running this ad, reimburse the U.S. Treasury for \nany taxpayer money spent on the ad, and explain which one of the \naccounts in Health and Human Services paid for this advertisement.\n  Take a look at this. We as a nation are $13 trillion in debt, and the \nWhite House's ongoing propaganda campaign should not be funded by \nAmerican taxpayers. And that is why, week after week, every week since \nthis bill became law, I have come to the floor to give my second \nopinion about the health care law and to say that it should be repealed \nand replaced--replaced with something that is patient centered, not \ngovernment centered, not insurance company centered, but patient \ncentered. Allow people to buy insurance across State lines. That will \nhelp bring down the cost and will help more people to be insured. Give \npeople who buy their own health insurance the opportunity to have the \nsame tax breaks the big companies get. Give people who buy their own \nhealth insurance, and others, opportunities through nutrition and diet \nand exercise and taking responsibility for their own health care. Let \nthem reap the benefits of that. Then, of course, we need to deal with \nlawsuit abuse and the expense of all of the unnecessary tests, the \ndefensive medicine doctors all across the country will tell you they \nend up practicing.\n  Those are the things we need to do--and opportunities for small \nbusinesses to join together to bring down the cost of their care. With \nthe individual mandate that is out there and the business mandate, we \nare seeing more businesses saying: You know, I am not going to want to \nprovide health insurance under this new law. I will just pay the \npenalty and go on. That is going to make it harder for people.\n  Here we are with a huge national debt, high unemployment, and a \nhealth care law that, in my opinion, would best serve the country if it \nwas repealed and replaced. That is why I come to the floor again today, \nthe last day the Senate is in session, as Senators are heading out \naround the country to visit with those in their communities. I am \nhoping the American people continue to speak out and tell their elected \nrepresentatives it is time to repeal and replace this health care law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6838-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6838-S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent for \na proposal on the border. First, I will speak for a minute and then ask \nconsent. I know my colleague from Arizona will then speak and offer \nsome amendments to it.\n  Today, I join my cosponsors--Senators Reid, Inouye, Murray, \nFeinstein, Bingaman, McCaskill, Casey, Udall of Colorado, Begich, and \nBurris--to try to make our borders as secure as possible. We are asking \nunanimous consent to pass a smart and tough $600 million emergency \nborder security appropriations package that will provide immediate \nrelief to the border.\n  Here is what our border security package will do: It will provide \nover $250 million to hire 1,500 new agents to permanently patrol our \nsouthern border and ports of entry.\n  It will also create a strike force that will be deployed in different \nareas of the southwest border, depending on where the need is greatest \nat any particular moment.\n  It will provide funds to deploy unmanned drones to fly along our \nsouthern border and provide our patrol officers on the ground with real \ntime information on unlawful border crossings. I believe there are \nseven working now. They have been very successful, and they should be \nexpanded quickly and immediately.\n  It will provide funds to improve communications capabilities between \nFederal border enforcement and State and local officers along the \nborder.\n  It will provide funds to construct forward operating bases for the \nBorder Patrol to use that are actually located on the border instead of \nbeing hundreds of miles away.\n  It will provide funds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \nconduct investigations of drug runners, money launderers, and human \ntraffickers along our border.\n  It will provide over $200 million to increase the number of ATF, DEA, \nand FBI agents on our border because the focus on drug dealing and \ncrime on our border is very important and has to be coordinated with \nimmigration enforcement and bolster the number of prosecutors and court \nresources along our border so wrongdoers can be immediately brought to \njustice.\n  The best part of this border package is it is fully paid for and will \nnot increase the deficit by a single penny. The emergency border funds \nwill be paid for by assessing fees on foreign\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\ncompanies known as chop shops that outsource good, high-paying American \ntechnology jobs to lower wage, temporary immigrant workers from other \ncountries. These are companies such as Infosys. But it will not affect \nthe high-tech companies such as Intel or Microsoft that play by the \nrules and recruit workers in America.\n  This border package will, therefore, accomplish two important goals. \nIt will make our border far more secure extremely quickly, and it will \nlevel the playing field for American companies and American workers to \ncompete against these foreign companies known in the industry as using \n``outsourcing visas.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 5875, which is at the desk; that \nthe Schumer substitute amendment, which is the text of S. 3721, a bill \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for border security for \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent to engage in a short colloquy with my colleague from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, my understanding, I say to my colleague \nfrom New York, is this provides for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes; 1,000 Border Patrol and 500 ICE and DEA.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One-hundred ICE, $39 million for Customs and Border \nProtection, 250 new Customs and Border Patrol agents you mentioned, \ncommunications equipment, money to deploy forward operating bases. I \nwish to go over it again with my colleague.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So far, exactly right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. A Federal law enforcement training center, additional \nfunding for the Department of Justice.\n  Anyway, the reason I mention this is because I think these are \nsignificant. It comes to a total of about $600 million; is that \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. I think this is significant \nlegislation. I ask the Senator if he would amend his request to include \nthe adoption of three amendments. Those amendments are Nos. 4590, 4591, \nand 4592. They are: $200 million for Operation Streamline, which is a \nprogram that charges those individuals who have crossed the border \nillegally with a petty crime or misdemeanor with jail time. This has \nproved to be a great deterrent for repeat crossers; $68 million \nadditional for the Customs inspectors and the other third would be $20 \nmillion for the Law Enforcement Support Center which helps the Federal \nGovernment, States, and localities identify those individuals who are \nhere illegally and also determines their status regarding eligibility.\n  If I may mention to my colleague, I am not complaining about these \nprovisions. I would like to point out that Operation Streamline on the \nborder has been a very effective tool as disincentives to repeat \ncrossers. I hope that either in this legislation the Senator from New \nYork would consider it and, of course, we need more Customs inspectors.\n  The Law Enforcement Support Center is to identify individuals because \nright now they are overtaxed, as we know, with the number of illegals, \nhow to identify them and to determine their status.\n  These three amendments I would obviously pay for out of the stimulus \npackage.\n  My question to my colleague from New York, I understand he is paying \nfor them--maybe he can elaborate--for these provisions by increasing \nfees or taxes on companies that issue or need H-1B visas and those \ncompanies that have less than 50 percent of their employees as American \ncitizens; is that correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is basically correct, yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator describe that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The bottom line is this. I like the H-1B program, and I \nthink it does a lot of good for a lot of American companies. In fact, \nin the immigration proposal I made, along with Senator Reid and Senator \nMenendez, as well as the outline with Senator Graham, we expand H-1B in \na variety of ways.\n  There is a part of H-1B that is abused, and it is by companies that \nare not American companies or even companies that are making something. \nRather, they are companies that take foreign folks, bring them here, \nand then they stay here for a few years, learn their expertise, and go \nback. We think we should increase the fees when they do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. Again, I ask if the Senator from \nNew York would amend his request to include the adoption of those three \nKyl-McCain amendments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I appreciate the spirit in which \nthe Senator from Arizona has talked about the proposal. Let me try to \nbe in the same spirit. I always said I believe in comprehensive \nimmigration reform. I know my colleague from Arizona has focused on \nthis issue for at least as long as I have. I was involved in the \noriginal legislation back in the late eighties with a great deal of \ncare, a great deal of concern, and a great deal of focus.\n  I hope, even though I cannot accept these amendments, that maybe we \ncould come together on something that we could bring back in September \nbecause I do believe we have to secure the border. Even in the \ncomprehensive proposal that we made, we said we have to secure the \nborder and do other things as well. It is my belief that securing the \nborder alone will not solve our immigration problems; that until we \nhave comprehensive reform, particularly in making sure employers do not \nhire illegal immigrants--which they now do, even though they do not \nknow they are illegal immigrants because documents are so easily \nforged, that we have to do comprehensive. But we should do the border. \nTo say we have to do comprehensive does not gainsay that we have to \nwork on the border and work on it quickly and soon.\n  My problems with the amendments are as follows: First and foremost, \ntaking funds from the stimulus is something I could not support. The \nreason is very simple. In my view--and it may be different than my \ncolleague's--the stimulus creates jobs. I do not want to tell my \nconstituents in Buffalo that they may be laid off or not have the \nopportunity for a job to work on a road, to be employed as a sheriff or \nfirefighter or teacher because there are less stimulus dollars. I do \nnot believe in robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  I prefer our source, which is from these companies which are not, as \nI say--they are companies whose whole purpose is to bring people in on \nH-1B and the vast majority of them from other countries who go back to \nthe other countries. That is a better funding source.\n  On the third amendment, I do believe we have that one, the $21 \nmillion for the center. I believe that is in our bill, the Law \nEnforcement Support Center. I believe that is in our proposal.\n  As for the second amendment, which is probably the one where we have \na substantive disagreement, Operation Streamline is, first, expensive. \nIf you are going to immediately incarcerate everyone who is apprehended \nat the border, you pay for their medicine, you pay for their health \ncare, you pay for their food. It is over $100 a day. DHS has been using \na different program. When they find someone crossing the border \nillegally, they bring them to the Mexican interior. Secretary \nNapolitano has shown some good documentation that works, and it is a \nlot cheaper.\n  Until proven otherwise, I think we ought to continue that program and \nmaybe expand that program based on the agreement we have that there \nshould be more people on the border so there are more apprehensions.\n  What we learned in a different area--asylum--is that building \ndetention centers for all those who are caught creates problems.\n  In New York, we have a large number of asylees--and I support asylum \nin many justified cases--and it has proven to be very expensive. It has \nproven to be cumbersome, and oftentimes you don't have the supply of \nspace to keep up with the demand.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n  So I would respectfully oppose the three amendments and urge that the \noriginal proposal be supported.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think my colleague may have been referring, when we are \ntalking about the law enforcement support center provision that says \nU.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement salaries and expenses, maybe that \nis the area that he is referring to that falls under----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe so, yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The stimulus money. I would remind my colleague that just \nthis morning he voted to use $1.5 billion in stimulus funds for the DOE \nLoan Guarantee Program. But that is a subject of a different \ndiscussion.\n  Let me just say again about Operation Streamline that I would invite \nmy colleague from New York to come and see one of these facilities and \ntalk to our people down at the border. One of the problems, as you \nknow, is we have had this catch and release, or even catch and take to \nanother part of the United States and put them across the border. So we \nseem to have these repeat crossers. The experience that we have had, \nand the people down there will tell you about, is keeping these people \nincarcerated for a period of time--and it isn't just everybody who \ncomes across, it is somebody who has committed a petty crime, a \nmisdemeanor, et cetera--we have found those individuals do not return \nor are much less likely to do so.\n  So I say to the Senator from New York, there is no fence money in \nhere, and we would have liked to have seen that. We need to complete \nand reinforce the fence. We want 3,000 officers down on the border, but \nthe bill has 1,200, which is certainly a major step forward. And there \nis 1,000 Border Patrol. We think we need as many as 3,000, as I \nmentioned.\n  But I think this $600 million is important. I think it is going to a \nlot of the right purposes. We will fight some more on these three \nadditional amendments I am talking about. While I appreciate the \naddition of UAVs, we need more surveillance capability on the border \nand, obviously, in my view, we need to finish the fences. But this is a \nstep forward, so I would ask unanimous consent on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kyl to be added as cosponsors. This will move forward our 10-\npoint plan we have put forward to get our border secured.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator, and I am glad we were able to--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Goodwin). Is there objection to the \nrequest made by the Senator from New York?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I think we are a little \nout of sync.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to the Senator for a few thoughts.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator from New York wishes, he can proceed to \nthe UC, which I will support, and then I would like to have a few \nmoments to make some comments. That would be fine.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have been told they need to do some conferring in our \ncloakroom, so the Senator may speak and I will hold off for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Schumer's \nlegislation, and I also would support it. It is clearly a step in the \nright direction, and it is one of the things we need to do.\n  I guess as we leave this Congress to go home and get ready to \ncampaign, many of my colleagues may be able to say they did something \nthat was helpful in eliminating illegal immigration--something other \nthan suing the State of Arizona, where the Department of Justice is \ntrying to block Arizona from participating effectively in reducing the \namount of illegal immigration.\n  On June 11, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, \nacting on behalf of approximately 7,000 ICE officers and employees--\nImmigration and Custom Enforcement--cast a unanimous vote of ``no \nconfidence'' in Mr. John Morton, the Director, saying that he is more \ninterested in politics than in in enforcing our immigration laws. So I \nam concerned about that.\n  Also, Senator McCain was correct to say that we voted for 700 miles \nof double-layer fencing, and even appropriated money for its \nconstruction. Only 400 miles have been completed and of that, only \nabout 40 miles are double layer. I am not aware that any other \nconstruction is ongoing. Why aren't we completing that? It multiplies \ndramatically the capability of an agent to be effective on a long \nborder if there are barriers there. So I am not happy about our not \ncompleting that. It is very much a failure. This Congress committed to \nthe American people more than one time to build that fence and we still \nhave not done it.\n  This is typical of why the American people are not happy with us; why \nour approval rating is getting close to single digits. You can't get \nmuch lower than it is. After much debate, we agreed to build a 700-mile \nfence, yet we end up getting 400 and saying that is great.\n  Then we have this administration, immediately after taking office \ncausing a big stir by investigating its own ICE agents. ICE agents \nraided a business in Washington State which was employing a whole bunch \nof illegal workers and do you know what Ms. Napolitano, the Secretary \nof Homeland Security says? She says: We are going to get to the bottom \nof it.\n  Did she mean we are going to get to the bottom of the people who were \nillegally working and the company who was illegally hiring them? No. \nShe wanted to get to the bottom of what it was this agent was doing \ntrying to enforce the law.\n  She sent a signal throughout the entire Federal law enforcement \ncommunity. What was that signal? Don't raid businesses. That is exactly \nwhat that did.\n  Operation Streamline does work. It absolutely works. CNN had a guy \non; he was caught within hours, Senator McCain. They took him down to \nthe border and walked him to the middle of the bridge and let him go \nback, and he just came back the next day. So this Operation Streamline \nis really a dramatic improvement where it is in effect.\n  The 287(g) program ought to be expanded, which calls on and provides \na mechanism for great partnership with local people. Instead, Secretary \nNapolitano narrowed the program and when the State of Arizona tries to \nhelp DHS, the Obama Administration say: No, that is not a good idea. We \nare going to sue you.\n  So, in my view, this bill is a good step. I salute my colleague from \nNew York. I think we have some potential to work in the right \ndirection. But there is a lot more to be done, and what is lacking is a \nfirm commitment from this administration and this Congress to end the \nmassive illegality at our border. It is within our grasp to do so. A \nlot of people think it is not possible--it is possible. We have done it \non certain sectors of the border. We could complete that, and then we \ncould begin to focus on what to do about the people who have been here \nfor many years and how to handle that. But until we focus on ending the \nillegality, we can't get anywhere.\n  So I will be thankful for what we have. Senator McCain would like to \nadd 3,000 more agents, but 1,200 is a step in the right direction. But \na number of other things, if done effectively, with the will to reduce \nthe illegality, will work. It is not impossible.\n  The thing about Operation Streamline, and the reason it saves money \ninstead of costing money, is that when it is utilized, the number of \npeople entering illegally goes down because they know they are not just \ngoing to be taken back to the border the next day and released to then \nreenter. They actually get a misdemeanor conviction and maybe some sort \nof probation, and then they are released and are much, much, much less \nlikely to come back because it would be a more serious offense the \nsecond time.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are waiting to see if there are other \nMembers on our side who would like to come and speak, so I would like \nto either yield time to the Senator from Rhode Island, who has been \nwaiting on another subject, and then come back to this, or suggest the \nabsence of a\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nquorum, whichever would be OK with my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I temporarily yield the floor to my colleague from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I intend to speak for a few minutes on \nclimate change and the need for a new energy strategy for this country.\n  I will just note that if any of my colleagues intend to seek the \nfloor to conclude the business Senator Schumer and Senator McCain were \nengaged in, they can just signal me and I will yield the floor to allow \nthem to finish that business.\n  Mr. President, we are now at the end of this work period, and we will \nshortly be going back to our home States for our home work during the \nAugust recess from Washington. We are doing so without having done \nanything about our dependence on fossil fuels, the carbon pollution \nthat we subsidize going into our atmosphere, the undisputed science of \nwhat is happening in our atmosphere as a result of that, and the \nconsequences that are beginning to pile up on our planet as a result of \nour negligence in addressing this pressing issue.\n  It is easy when you are in Washington to think that this is the \ncenter of the universe and that the little fights and quarrels that \nhappen here and the politics of this town are what is most important. \nIn this Chamber, which is very often a hotbed of those politics, I \nthink that problem is particularly severe. There are political \nsituations where, if we don't get it resolved, then it just keeps going \nalong and there is no real harm done. But nature doesn't give a darn \nabout our politics. Nature doesn't give a hoot about our campaign \ncontributions. Nature doesn't care about what motivates delay. Nature \ndoesn't care whether you are lying or telling the truth. Nature just \ngoes on about her business, driven by chemistry, biology, physics--the \nbasic elemental forces of nature.\n  We are getting ourselves into a situation where by ignoring those \nforces we are beginning to imperil ourselves and future generations.\n  It is astonishingly irresponsible to be in the predicament we are in \nright now, with what is fair to describe as a looming global emergency \nthat we can't get anything done on.\n  The big oil companies, the big coal companies, the big energy \ncompanies are able to drop into this particular Chamber their delay, \ntheir desire to have nothing happen on this subject, and that trumps \nthe interests of all the people of the United States, all the people of \nthe planet, their children and grandchildren, off into our future.\n  I want to read into the Record a few things that have come out in the \npress in the last few weeks. Here is USA Today, in the middle of last \nmonth:\n\n       The world is hotter than ever. March, April, May and June \n     set records, making 2010 the warmest year worldwide since \n     recordkeeping began in 1880. . . .\n\n  That is not some fringe group reporting this. That is the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Government of the United \nStates of America.\n  In my home State, back in Rhode Island, ``July was more than 4 \ndegrees above normal,'' quoting from the Providence Journal on August \n2, ``and the second hottest month on record for Providence; 4.2 degrees \nhigher than normal.''\n  Here is a newsclip about what effect these temperatures are having on \nour oceans:\n\n       The rising temperatures have been particularly hard on \n     oceans, which have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat \n     trapped by greenhouse gases over the past 50 years.\n\n  This was another NOAA report.\n\n       Oceans are taking in increasingly more carbon. The report's \n     analysis of global ocean uptake of carbon dioxide estimates \n     that the seas stored 33 percent more anthropogenic [man made] \n     carbon in 2008 than they did 14 years earlier. Oceans' \n     absorbsion of CO2 has caused rising acidity that \n     is damaging the ability of shellfish, crustaceans, corals and \n     plankton to build shells and skeletons.\n\n  You might ask, who cares about shellfish, crustaceans, corals, and \nplankton? Shellfish keep a lot of American fishermen busy and occupied \nand productive, and feed an awful lot of families. Ditto crustaceans--\nthe Rhode Island lobster in particular. Corals are the nurseries of our \ntropic seas. When they die, it has a pronounced effect throughout the \noceanic food chain. And phytoplankton--all plankton--are the base of \nthe oceanic food chain. When you have a collapse in the phytoplankton, \nyou have a potential collapse of the entire oceanic food chain.\n  There have been massive die-offs in the historic record of the ocean \nand we are trending toward having another one, with an ocean that is \nmore acidic now than it has been in 8,000 centuries. We are getting to \nthe point where the small animals that form the base of the ocean food \nchain are becoming soluble in the water that is their environment.\n  Lobsters in particular--again from the Providence Journal of July 29:\n\n       Meanwhile, the water off our coast has been unusually warm. \n     Lobsters like cold water and in the colder waters east of \n     Cape Cod, the heartland of the fishery, the crustaceans seem \n     unaffected. No moratorium has been recommended there. The \n     lobstermen explain a decline in the local stocks by saying \n     there has been a general migration toward cooler waters.\n\n  So the warming of our waters is having a pronounced effect on Rhode \nIsland businesses, on Rhode Island lobstermen. I was out the other day \nwith Rhode Island lobstermen, hauling in pots, seeing what was down \nthere, and the fishery has not been wiped out, but it is suffering, it \nis under pressure, and it relates to our warming planet and to climate \nchange.\n  It is a global situation. According to the Wall Street Journal, there \nare 400 oxygen-depleted dead zones identified by scientists in our \noceans--oxygen-depleted dead zones in our oceans, 400 of them, covering \nan area of nearly 100,000 square miles of dead ocean because there is \nnot enough oxygen in it to support life, as though it is on some alien \nplanet.\n  Now a very recent study, July 29, reported:\n\n       Researchers at Canada's Dalhousie University say the global \n     population of phytoplankton--\n\n  Again, the basis of the oceanic food chain--\n\n     has fallen about 40 percent since 1950. That translates to an \n     annual drop of about 1 percent of the average plankton \n     population between 1899 and 2008. The scientists believe that \n     rising sea surface temperatures are to blame.\n\n  There is another side to this story and, frankly, most of it is phony \nbaloney science. It is bought-and-paid-for mercenary science. It is not \nthe real deal. It masquerades as the real deal, it is designed to fool \nthe public, and it is designed to prevent us from taking action. \nRegrettably, for a while it is working.\n  Here is what Paul Krugman wrote the other day, looking at the variety \nof evidence that supports the need for us to do something about that \nfor the sake of our planet, our children, and our grandchildren.\n\n       Nor is this evidence tainted by scientific misbehavior. You \n     probably heard about the accusations leveled against \n     climate researchers--allegations of fabricated data, the \n     supposedly damning e-mail messages of ``Climategate,'' and \n     so on. What you may not have heard, because it has \n     received much less publicity, is that every one of these \n     supposed scandals was eventually unmasked as a fraud \n     concocted by opponents of climate action, then bought into \n     by many in the news media.\n\n  This should be a win-win. This is an issue that is important to us as \nhumans trying to live on this planet as dramatic changes begin to take \nplace in our atmosphere and ecosystems. This should be a win for us \neconomically as green jobs grow, as we compete with China and India, as \nwe stop losing the race to China and India for this next economy, as we \nstop sending money overseas to people who do not care for us much, who \nfund our enemies, and who drain hundreds of millions of dollars a year \nout of our economy.\n  It should be a win on national security, protecting us from those \ncircumstances. It should be a win across the board. But the special \ninterests will not let go, will not step into the future. They know \nthey control enough votes in this place to make this not happen.\n  I promise my colleagues this is a day that the future will look back \nat and look at this Senate, and this will be our day of infamy. This \nwill be the day when all of the evidence was before us, we had every \nchance in the world to do\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nwhat was right, we in fact knew what was right, and we allowed lies and \nphony science, concocted evidence and the big money from big oil, from \nbig coal, from the big polluters, to steer us away from our duty.\n  I hope when we come back in September we will take this back up, that \nwe will take it up seriously. It is my strong belief that if we go at \nthis with real diligence as a Senate--if we have the White House with \nus and behind us and fighting for us, if we have the environmental \ngroups out there in the field doing their work, pushing this issue, and \nif we have the hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in green \nenergy industries and who are green energy investors and who are going \nto grow into this green energy economy out there explaining the true \neconomic value, and if we have our national security apparatus making \nthe point as to how important this is, as all the national intelligence \nestimates have already said--we can push this over the top. Not the \nfirst time, because the lies and the money will trump the first time. \nBut if we do it a second and a third and fourth time and force this \nissue, I think we can bring it home. I hope we will at least try. Some \nbattles are worth the fight even if you are not sure you can win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                            Child Nutrition\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nyielding me a few minutes to go in front of him even though he was here \nbefore me.\n  I want to say a couple of words in support of the child nutrition \nbill. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania also wants to speak about \nthat, the child nutrition bill that was passed by unanimous consent \nhere in the Senate this afternoon.\n  I thank Chairman Lincoln, chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, for her tireless efforts to bring this bill to fruition. She \nhas been a great advocate, a great champion of child nutrition and \nmaking the changes necessary to get better food for our kids in \nschools.\n  I also thank Senator Chambliss, with whom I served on the Agriculture \nCommittee for a number of years, either as ranking member or as \nchairman, working on agriculture bills.\n  I also particularly want to thank Senator Murkowski of Alaska. She \nand I have worked together as partners in this effort for several of \nthe past years on trying to get this bill put together and get the \nprovisions we have in the bill done. She has been a great champion of \nbetter food in our school lunch program, school breakfast program, \nafterschool meals.\n  I also thank our leader, Senator Reid, and Minority Leader Senator \nMcConnell, for working together on both sides to get this bill to the \npoint where we could actually get to a unanimous consent today.\n  There are many important components of this bill, many of which I had \npushed for many years when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee. \nI am particularly supportive of the provisions to increase \nreimbursement for school meals, expanded use of direct certification in \nthe National School Lunch Program, the expansion of afterschool meals, \na new and great focus on promoting breastfeeding, and the very real \nadvances that that makes to health promotion in the early stages of \nchildhood.\n  I want, however, to mention one provision I worked on for about 15 \nyears, a provision that would require the adoption of school nutrition \nstandards for all foods in all schools. Since the 1970s, the rates of \nchildhood obesity have tripled among children and adolescents in the \nUnited States. Type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically. Current \nestimates suggest that among children born today, the lifetime risk of \ndeveloping diabetes is 30 percent for boys, 40 percent for girls, and \nfor African Americans and Latinos it is even higher.\n  Again these are complicated problems that will require multifaceted \nsolutions. To improve the health of our children, all sectors of \nsociety must be involved--parents, the media, community organizations, \ncorporate America, and of course our schools.\n  Again, I am well aware that schools are not the only places where our \nkids have access to sugary beverages and fried foods, candy, and high \nsodium foods. But schools can and should do more to provide healthy \nfoods to our kids. What kids learn to eat at an early age they tend to \ndevelop habits and tastes for and eat those foods later on in life.\n  If you start feeding kids sugary soda and French fries for lunch, \nthey tend to keep eating that as they grow older, with all of the \nhealth problems that brings on.\n  To that end, it is critically important that we establish strong \nnutrition standards for all the foods sold in school through vending \nmachines, snack bars, a la carte lines in the schools. There are \nseveral reasons we need to set such standards. Existing USDA nutrition \nstandards for the foods sold outside of school meals are outdated. They \nallow for the sale of foods that are low in nutrition and high in fat, \nsugar, and salt. In addition, in recent years science has greatly \nincreased our knowledge of how kids' diets affect their health. Yet we \nhave done very little to adjust our nutrition standards to this new \nknowledge.\n  We have had a big loophole here and this is the way it is. The \nSecretary of Agriculture can set nutritional guidelines for all of the \nfoods sold in the school lunch, in the school lunchroom--school \nbreakfasts, school lunches, and can adopt those standards to follow the \ndietary guidelines. However, the Secretary has no authority to regulate \nthe foods sold outside the lunchroom. So you have a big loophole here. \nKids can eat lunch, they can have good food prepared according to \ndietary guidelines, but down the hall there are vending machines with \ncandy bars and potato chips and sugary sodas and all kinds of things \nsuch as that, which undermines what we are trying to do to get better \nfood for our kids in schools.\n  It undermines parental supervision. Parents think that if they send \ntheir kids to school, they are going to get good meals. Yet they can go \ndown the hallway from the school lunchroom and buy all of those bad \nfoods. So that is what this bill does. It provides that the Secretary \nof Agriculture now, for the first time, has the authority to regulate \nall of the foods in schools, even in the vending machines, snack bars, \nand a-la carte lines.\n  Again, I am proud this provision has had broad support on both sides \nof the aisle, among public groups and food and beverage companies. I \nparticularly would like to thank the following groups for their help \nthrough all these years to bring this bill to this point: the Center \nfor Science in the Public Interest, the American Heart Association, the \nAmerican Dietetic Association, the American Diabetes Association, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the American Association of School \nAdministrators, and the National PTA. They have all been wonderful in \nworking together to get this bill put together and through the floor of \nthe Senate. On the food and beverage side, I particularly wish to thank \nthe American Beverage Association, Mars, Incorporated, the dairy \nindustry, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and many others who brought us to this \npoint.\n  We cannot ignore the rising toll of diabetes, heart disease, and \nchildhood obesity. By including the commonsense provisions to protect \nthe nutrition environment in our schools, this bill makes a major step \nforward in efforts to protect our children and promote their health.\n  I sincerely thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for \nallowing me to take this time even though he was next in line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--I wish \nto thank the Senator from New York and those on the other side for \ntaking a significant step forward. I believe we have a lot more to do, \nbut this will contribute to our effort to get our border secured. And \nwe will be continuing to fight for all of the provisions Senator Kyl \nand I have put forward, but I thank my colleague for his cooperation in \nsending some $60 million to help our border get secured, and at this \ntime, it is not. But I think this is movement in the right direction. I \nthank my colleague.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague. As you \nknow, our goal--most of us on this side--is comprehensive reform. We \nbelieve securing the border is part of that, and this bipartisan effort \ncan help move us in that direction. I hope we can move forward in a \nbipartisan way on many other parts of immigration reform beyond the \nborder in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about the bill \nwe passed today, what is known as the child nutrition bill, but the \nactual title is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. We passed it \nby unanimous consent, which means we have done something that happens \nall too rarely around here. We passed a major piece of legislation in a \nbipartisan way, we got consent from the whole Chamber, and we did not \nhave to have a vote on it. That is a good development, to pass a big \npiece of legislation which will have a tremendously positive impact on \nour children, and passing it in that manner is encouraging.\n  I am grateful, as so many of us are, to our chairman, Senator \nLincoln, for her continued leadership to craft a child nutrition bill \nthat protects and assists the most vulnerable of our society--pregnant \nwomen and children who are food insecure, especially in a time of \neconomic difficulties for so many families and high unemployment in so \nmany communities across the country.\n  In the Scriptures, they tell us that a faithful friend is a sturdy \nshelter, and he or she who has found a faithful friend has indeed found \na treasure. I am paraphrasing a little bit, but I think that line from \nthe Scriptures about a faithful friend being a sturdy shelter has \napplication to this discussion we have had about the Child Nutrition \nAct and helping our children because so many elected officials around \nthe country say they are a friend of children. That is a good \nsentiment. We like to hear that. But often we do not have the \nopportunity to demonstrate our friendship, our concern for children, \nand sometimes we don't take the opportunity even when it is presented \nto us. So in our efforts to show and demonstrate--sometimes in small\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nways, sometimes in more substantial ways here in the Senate or in other \ninstances as well--we have a chance to demonstrate, to prove or to \nprovide some proof that we are trying to be a friend to children.\n  The bill itself reauthorizes our Nation's major Federal child \nnutrition programs which are administered by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. As many people who watch these proceedings know, \nreauthorization means we want to do it again, we want to continue a \npolicy and keep the policy moving in the right direction and fund it.\n  Under this program, the following are included: the National School \nLunch Program and the School Breakfast Program; the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known \nby the end of that program's name, WIC--women, infants, and children; \nthe Child and Adult Care Food Program, which is not something we hear a \nlot about but is critically important; and the Summer Food Service \nProgram.\n  The act itself--the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010--provides \n$4.5 billion in additional funding over the next 10 years, nearly 10 \ntimes the amount of money provided for the previous child nutrition \nbill and the largest new investment in child nutrition programs since \nthe inception of these particular programs.\n  This historic new investment provided by the act could not come at a \nmore important time, particularly given the incidence of hunger and the \ncorresponding need for Federal nutrition assistance, which has \nincreased in recent years. We know the economic realities. The numbers \ndo not begin to tell the story, but the numbers are part of the story.\n  Throughout the country, more than 15 million people are out of work. \nIn Pennsylvania, for example, a 9.2-percent unemployment rate equates \nto 591,000 Pennsylvanians out of work. I know some States are at 10 \npercent unemployment and 11 percent and 12 percent and some even over \n13 percent. But in our State, having more than 591,000 people out of \nwork is close to if not a record number of people.\n  I have always believed that when it comes to programs and policies \nthat impact our children, whether it is a nutrition program or an \neducation program, whether it is helping to protect our kids, I have \nalways believed that what motivates us and what motivates people across \nthis country to take steps to help children is a basic and fundamental \nbelief that every child in America is born with a light inside them.\n  Some children, because of their circumstances, because of the family \nthey are born into or because of other reasons, do not need a lot of \nhelp, and their light shines so brightly, it is blinding, it is \nboundless, it is assimilating--you can fill in lots of other words. \nSome children are born with a light inside them, but it does not burn \nas brightly because of limitations or because of adverse circumstances \nthey are born into or because the family they are born into does not \nhave some of the advantages many of us have had. They do not have a \nsteady job. They do not have income. They do not have the ability to \nprovide for their family.\n  I have always believed that it is the obligation of every public \nofficial, whether you are in the Senate or whether you are a State \nofficial or local official, but especially if you are elected, to do \neverything you can, to take every opportunity you can to help our \nchildren at a minimum with at least four things: nutrition and the \nprevention of hunger, early education, health care, and certainly basic \nsafety and protection. This legislation takes a substantial step \nforward in at least one of those areas--the area I mentioned as it \nrelates to preventing hunger and making sure kids are being given \nnutritious meals.\n  We know providing care at the beginning of a child's life is so \nimportant. That starts with that child's mother. Through the WIC \nProgram, pregnant women and new mothers have access to nutritious foods \nand learn more about healthy eating--something we could all learn a \nthing or two about. The program encourages breastfeeding and supplies \nformula, food packages, and farmers market vouchers. The WIC Program is \na strong investment in our future and serves more than half--more than \nhalf--of all infants in the United States. As babies grow into \ntoddlers, they benefit from the nutritious meals and snacks provided by \nchildcare homes and centers and Head Start Programs participating in \nthat program.\n  I mentioned before that we don't hear a lot about the Child and Adult \nCare Food Program. That program allows children to develop, it prepares \nchildren to enter school ready to learn, and it helps working families \nto work.\n  In the vast majority of States, the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram--the afterschool program that it is--only provides \nreimbursement for a snack. The bill we passed today gives communities \nin all 50 States the ability to be reimbursed for a meal.\n  When toddlers grow into young children and arrive for their first day \nof school, many are able to enter the cafeteria and eat a healthy meal \nfor breakfast and for lunch. These meals fuel them with the energy they \nneed to grow into healthy adults. We know the numbers on these for \nchildren are so substantial. More than 10 million children receive a \nfree or reduced-priced breakfast, and nearly 20 million children in the \nUnited States receive a lunch. In Pennsylvania, that translates into 1 \nmillion kids having the benefit of school lunch and just about a \nquarter of a million children getting the benefit of the School \nBreakfast Program.\n  Congress has taken a step now--at least the Senate has today--to \nensure more eligible children receive meals, increasing the number of \neligible children and increasing the nutritional value of meals. Hungry \nand malnourished children cannot fully participate in school. If a \nchild can't, during school, have the benefit of a school lunch or a \nschool breakfast or sometimes both, they can't learn. It is as simple \nas that. None of us could learn. None of us can function if we don't \nhave enough to eat. I have always thought that if we invest in \nchildren, making sure they can learn at a very young age, they can \nlearn more now and earn more later. We have to remain committed to \nthese programs.\n  I have had a very strong interest in and have advocated for a long \ntime for the so-called universal feeding concept because I believe the \nexperience in a major urban school district--in this case, the city of \nPhiladelphia--in that school district, that universal feeding concept \nas a model in one school district has reduced the stigma of poverty and \nincreased participation in the School Lunch Program. Philadelphia \nschools are reimbursed for only the number of students who qualify for \nfree or reduced-price meals but agree to offer free meals to all \nchildren. It covers everyone; it doesn't single children out for \ndifferent treatment. Universal feeding enhances efficiency by \ndramatically reducing the administrative burdens of the program, and it \nmaintains the integrity and congressional intent of the National School \nLunch Program.\n  There is a lot more I could talk about with regard to the bill, but I \nwish to move very quickly and then conclude by highlighting some \nphotographs.\n  This first photograph was made available to us by a Dr. Mariane \nChilton. Dr. Chilton is at Drexel University. I have met a lot of \npeople who have been champions for our children, who have stood up for \nchildren in all circumstances, but if there is one person who I can \nthink of in any university of the United States who has done so much \nfor our children and has stood up for them, who has been even more than \njust a faithful friend--Dr. Chilton has been the person who, time and \nagain, has reminded us about the moral gravity of making sure children \nare first on our list.\n  She developed a program called Witnesses to Hunger. This particular \nproject began after consent was given by mothers across the city of \nPhiladelphia who agreed to participate. More than 40 of them were given \na camera. They took pictures of their lives, the lives of their \nchildren, their own life, what happens in their homes. They made these \npictures available. They gave us a window into their own lives by their \nown consent. By providing that insight, they allowed us to see the real \nmisery of hunger for children. They allowed us to see the horrific \nnightmare so many children and so many families were living through, \neven before this recession.\n  The first picture I have is a photograph of a young boy sitting at a \ntable.\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nHere is what his mother Melissa said about him:\n\n       My son, he's already on the small side and he needs every \n     bit of food that he can get to make him healthy, keep him \n     healthy. He has failure to thrive. He has a bone deficiency \n     that doesn't allow him to grow. He's only 30 pounds. He has \n     acid reflux. He had RSV, failure to thrive, chronic asthma.\n\n  This is one example of a child who doesn't have enough to eat, which \nleads to the obvious health problems that entails.\n  This next picture is a photograph of three children sitting at a \ntable. They have beautiful smiles. They are wonderful children. The \ntitle of this picture is ``Oodles of noodles.'' These children are \neating lots and lots of noodles. Their mother says:\n\n       And the kids know my food stamps got cut off. Because when \n     they came home from school today, they didn't have their \n     snacks. So they know that I didn't go to the market. I really \n     didn't tell them why or anything like that, because I don't \n     think they understand. But it affected them.\n\n  When people make decisions about cutting programs or voting against \nprograms, we know they have real consequences.\n  The last picture is a young boy holding bananas and giving the \nphotographer a great smile. In this photo, Gale, his mother, captures \nher son's happiness as he holds up a bunch of bananas.\n  Some people tell us people choose to eat unhealthy foods. They use \nthat as a rationale, a pathetic and insulting rationale. But sometimes \nthey make that argument. We know families want more access to fresh \nfruits and vegetables. But, frankly, in a lot of inner cities, they are \nnot available, not at all. We have to recognize that, rather than \ndenigrate or judge people who live in those communities. There are \nplenty of folks in Washington who are good at judging. They are not \nreal good at responding to the needs of people.\n  There is so much in this bill. I will not go through more of it \nbecause we don't have time. I believe this bill does meet that basic \nobligation to do everything we can, at least in this program, at least \nwith this opportunity, to make sure that light inside every child burns \nas brightly as the full measure of that child's potential, as brightly \nas we can possibly allow it to burn with our help. I believe this bill \ndoes one thing as well, going back to that reference to Scripture about \na faithful friend being a sturdy shelter. This bill will not solve all \nthe problems of the families who will be positively impacted. It will \nnot eliminate hunger. It will not rescue a child from so many \nchallenges in the life of a child who lives in a poor family. But this \nbill is one example of one way we can demonstrate what that scriptural \nreference tells us. It gives us a chance to demonstrate in a \nsignificant way that we are trying to do all we can to be that faithful \nfriend to our children and to provide some measure of shelter when the \nstorms of this recession hit that family and hit that child. We can \ntake a step in proving that we are trying to be that faithful friend to \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6845-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6845-S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue that is \nstill pending before this body. Unfortunately, it looks as though we \nwill not be able to wrap this up in the next few hours. It looks \nencouraging that we may be able to take it up immediately when we \nreturn in September.\n  Before I speak about that, I compliment Senators Lincoln, Casey, \nHarkin, and others who have come to the floor in the last few hours but \nhave been working for months, if not years, on the child nutrition \nbill. It is quite extraordinary that this Chamber at this late hour, \nbecause of the work of Senators Lincoln, Harkin, Casey, and others, has \ndecided by unanimous consent to pass a significant and major piece of \nlegislation the Senator from Pennsylvania beautifully described. I \ncompliment all of them for their work.\n  I wish we had been able to do the same thing for the small business \nbill we have been fighting for, the Small Business Job Creation Act of \n2010. We can't seem to get to a point where we can get unanimous \nconsent. So we will have to fight this out a step at a time. We had \nsome significant votes this last week by including a Republican \namendment, including in the small business bill a $30 billion lending \nprogram. We have potentially other aspects to strengthen it. But the \nbill is in extremely good shape.\n  I wish to put this up for a visual. I know people will find it hard \nto believe we could have literally over 100 organizations, \nextraordinarily strong and powerful bipartisan, conservative, moderate \nand liberal organizations, supporting small business. It may seem \nsurprising that with all this support, we couldn't pass the bill before \nwe leave. I wish to call out again just a few: The American Hotel and \nLodging Association, the American International Automobile Dealers \nAssociation, the Associated Builders and Contractors of California, the \nCalifornia Bankers Association, Engineering Contractors, Hispanic \nBankers of Texas, National Association of Self-Employed, National \nRestaurant Association, Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, the \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. I just listed one-half dozen or a \ndozen. Members can see we have hundreds of extraordinary organizations \nthat have stepped up to say what I have been saying, what the Senator \nfrom Washington, Ms. Cantwell, has been saying, what the senior Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Murray, and Senators Boxer and Merkley are \nsaying: We are not going to end this recession until we find a way to \nget capital and cash in the hands of small business. That will lead the \nway out of this recession. It is not going to be led by Wall Street. It \nis going to be led by Main Street.\n  I would like to put up our Main Street sign. Main Street is going to \nlead the way. There was a beautiful article written by Harold Meyerson. \nIt was dated August 4 in the Washington Post. The article is entitled \n``Jobs in the Cards?'' It reads, in part:\n\n       All things considered, American big business is doing just \n     fine, thank you. Profits, productivity and exports are up. \n     New hires, rehires and wage increases, as I have written, are \n     nowhere to be seen. They're no longer part of the U.S. \n     corporate business plan, in which higher profits are premised \n     on having fewer employees. Sell abroad, cut costs at home--\n     the global marketplace that American business has created is \n     paying off big-time.\n       Not so for American small business, which inhabits those \n     less rarified realms of the economy in which depressed \n     domestic demand and bottled-up credit remain a mortal threat. \n     The great private-sector trickle-down machine has largely \n     stopped working for small business.\n\n  He is right. If we don't get small business started up again and \nfocus on them and help them, this recession will never come to an end. \nMaybe that is what some people on the other side of the aisle want. \nMaybe they put politics before progress. But this is dangerous, it is \nwrong, and it is painful. We have to figure out a way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article from which I just quoted \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 4, 2010.]\n\n                           Jobs in the Cards?\n\n                          (By Harold Meyerson)\n\n       All things considered, American big business is doing just \n     fine, thank you.

A May report from the \n     Congressional Oversight Panel on the TARP (chaired by \n     consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren) found that bank lending \n     to small businesses has plummeted, particularly among the big \n     banks that taxpayers helped bail out. The Wall Street banks' \n     lending portfolio declined 4 percent between 2008 and 2009, \n     the report concludes, but their lending to small business \n     declined 9 percent. Smaller banks--``strained by their \n     exposure to commercial real estate and other liabilities''--\n     have similarly reduced their lending.\n       As the corporate sector hums along without hiring, hope for \n     a recovery increasingly depends on boosting consumer demand \n     through public investment and jump-starting small-business \n     expansion through tax\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\n     credits and a reopened lending window. For the past half-\n     year, the administration and congressional Democrats have \n     been unable to overcome Republican senators' resistance to \n     increasing public investment. Senate Republicans have also \n     blocked their efforts to cut taxes and increase loans to \n     small business--even though such policies have long been GOP \n     priorities and small business has long been considered a key \n     Republican constituency.\n       Late last week, the Senate's 41 Republicans united to block \n     a bill that would have temporarily eliminated the capital \n     gains tax on small businesses that issue stock, increased the \n     tax deduction for start-ups, increased their depreciation \n     allowance, and established a $30 billion fund, offset by \n     budget cuts elsewhere, dedicated to small-business lending by \n     small banks. The bill was backed by generally pro-Republican \n     business lobbies; to add a further note of absurdity to the \n     GOP opposition, some of the bill was written by Republican \n     senators. The Republicans' ostensible reason for opposing \n     these motherhood-and-apple-pie provisions was that Democrats \n     were limiting the number of amendments they could bring up. \n     Their actual reason was to deny Democrats a legislative \n     victory on the kind of stimulus package that still commands \n     substantial public support and, just possibly, to forestall \n     any economic uptick before November.\n       Republicans are certainly right that Democrats, for \n     political and economic reasons, are focusing more on helping \n     small business recover. A June survey from the firm of \n     Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg argued that ``Democrats \n     can win the economic debate by making small business the \n     center of their agenda.''\n       But there's another way Democrats can assist small business \n     besides continuing to press for their small-business \n     stimulus. The president can choose a champion of small \n     business to direct the newly created Consumer Financial \n     Protection Agency. He can nominate Elizabeth Warren.\n       To date, we have heard chiefly that the big banks look \n     askance, and then some, at the prospect of Warren heading the \n     agency. She is among the nation's leading critics of the \n     credit card rip-offs that big banks have long inflicted on \n     cardholders as a matter of policy. Precisely for this reason, \n     she stands out as a small-business hero, because in the \n     absence of bank lending, small businesses increasingly are \n     turning to credit cards as a source of funding or operating \n     revenue. Fully 83 percent of small businesses, the Federal \n     Reserve reported in May, use credit cards. Three-quarters of \n     small businesses that apply for business credit cards secure \n     them, according to a 2010 survey from the National Federation \n     of Independent Business, while just 39 percent of bank-loan \n     applicants obtain loans. A 2009 study from the National Small \n     Business Association concluded that 59 percent of small \n     businesses used cards to meet their capital needs.\n       Bank loans to small businesses have been increasingly \n     supplanted by bank credit cards. And no one is more expert \n     that Warren on how banks exploit their cardholders. She is, \n     by common consent, one of the leading academic authorities on \n     the topic as well as a passionate advocate for getting \n     cardholders a fairer shake.\n       Enemy of Wall Street? When necessary, absolutely. Friend of \n     Main Street? None better. If he nominates Warren and can get \n     her confirmed, President Obama will have found one more way \n     to aid American small business.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The bill we have put forward, supported by hundreds of \norganizations, has a way forward.\n  I wish to also include for the Record another editorial by Mr. \nRichard Neiman of the Wall Street Journal. I submit it again because it \nis so good. The Journal mistakenly editorialized against this bill, but \nthere are people sending letters to the Wall Street Journal to take a \nsecond look. Richard Neiman is one of them.\n  He writes:\n\n       Unlike TARP, the SBLF would incentivize banks to loan by \n     lowering the dividend rate at which banks must repay the \n     government if the banks meet lending performance metrics. \n     Further, the SBLF removes the TARP stigma that discouraged \n     small banks from participating in government programs that \n     support lending. It is these banks that are the primary \n     source of credit for small businesses which lack the same \n     access to capital markets as large companies.\n       The SBLF is not a sequel to TARP, but it can be a segue \n     toward a stronger future for our nation's small businesses \n     and their employees.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 5, 2010]\n\n          Small Business Lending Fund Will Help Recovery, Jobs\n\n                          (By Richard Neiman)\n\n       Your editorial, ``Son of TARP'' (July 30) is unfortunately \n     titled, and underestimates the potential of the proposed \n     Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF).\n       Small business growth is the only way out of this \n     recession. Yet our entrepreneurs are not being provided the \n     credit they need, as the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel \n     often hears from small business owners. Our recent report on \n     the issue demonstrates that, during the crisis, lending to \n     small businesses fell by 9 percent at our Nation's largest \n     banks, and the bankruptcy of nonbank business lenders such as \n     the CIT Group has further limited credit options.\n       The financial crisis and recession have created the lack of \n     demand for credit that your editorial points out, but it is \n     as important to point out the lack of supply. Small banks are \n     reluctant to take on more risk when small businesses' \n     customer base is weak. Breaking this stalemate requires old-\n     fashioned underwriting to identify the good deals which are \n     still waiting to be made.\n       The SBLF is intended to provide public-sector support to \n     bring credit- and lending-worthy parties back to the table. \n     Unlike TARP, the SBLF would incentivize banks to lend by \n     lowering the dividend rate at which banks must repay the \n     government if the banks meet lending performance metrics. \n     Further, the SBLF removes the TARP stigma that discouraged \n     small banks from participating in government programs that \n     support lending. It is these banks that are the primary \n     source of credit for small businesses which lack the same \n     access to capital markets as large companies.\n       The SBLF is not a sequel to TARP, but it can be a segue \n     toward a stronger future for our nation's small businesses \n     and their employees.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord another very nice article that appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal by Ruth Simon, one of their reporters, who outlines a \nparticular story about Pinnacle Bank, which is basically in support of \nour bill. This is a story about a bank in Florida. It will be in the \nRecord for Members to read.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 5, 2010]\n\n            SBA Program Proves a Hit, But Now It Is in Limbo\n\n                            (By Ruth Simon)\n\n       Pinnacle Bank made just two loans through the Small \n     Business Administration in 2007 and 2008. So far this year, \n     the Orange City, Fla., bank's total is nine, to borrowers \n     from an auto dealer to a computer-equipment wholesaler to a \n     bakery.\n       ``The SBA program is the only way we can continue to lend \n     right now,'' says David Bridgeman, president of Pinnacle, \n     which has two branches and assets of $213 million, including \n     about 600 loans. For many of the $3.4 million in loans \n     Pinnacle made through the SBA in 2010, the bank has to set \n     aside capital against only the 10% slice that isn't \n     guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n       Across the nation, many banks have turned to the SBA's so-\n     called 7(a) program to help unfreeze credit. Nearly 3,000 \n     lenders have made 7(a) loans in the current fiscal year, up \n     21% from 2008.\n       The 7(a) program, the SBA's largest loan program, is hardly \n     a cure for the credit shortage affecting many borrowers. The \n     agency is involved in less than 10% of all small-business \n     loans, and some banks won't participate because of red tape. \n     Lenders must follow the SBA's rules when making 7(a) loans, \n     which can be used for working capital, fixed assets and other \n     business expenses. The term of the loan can be as long as 25 \n     years.\n       Last year, Congress temporarily sweetened the 7(a) program \n     by increasing the SBA guarantee to 90% of any given loan from \n     as little as 75% previously. Lawmakers waived fees costing \n     borrowers as much as 3.5% of the loan amount, as well as \n     costs charged in a separate SBA program providing structured \n     financing for fixed assets.\n       But the sweetened program is now in limbo, drawing \n     complaints from borrowers and lenders, as lawmakers haggle \n     over broader small-business legislation.\n       Since the SBA program was sweetened, more than 1,300 \n     lenders that hadn't made an SBA loan since at least 2007 have \n     barreled in, while existing participants like Pinnacle have \n     been pushing more borrowers through the agency's pipeline to \n     take advantage of better terms.\n       About $16.2 billion in 7(a) loans have been made under the \n     more-attractive terms. By May, the program's loan volume had \n     returned to before-the-credit-crunch levels.\n       ``The extra 15% of guarantee helped us stretch a little \n     more,'' says Vito Pantilione, president of Parke Bank, a unit \n     of Parke Bancorp Inc. The five-branch Sewell, N.J., bank \n     recently used the program to make loans to two printing \n     companies looking to adapt to electronic publishing.\n       Since hiring a local banker with expertise in SBA loans in \n     August 2009, Bank of Holland, a Holland, Mich., unit of Lake \n     Michigan Financial Corp., has made more than two dozen loans \n     through the federal agency.\n       ``We do not have capital issues, but it's very difficult to \n     find businesses that . . . have not lost money and suffered \n     some weakening of their balance sheet,'' says Garth Deur, \n     Bank of Holland's president.\n       Sweetened government backing makes it easier for banks to \n     stomach the risks of lending to local businesses that hit \n     bumps when the economy slowed or to finance entrepreneurs \n     with a solid business plan but little track record, Mr. Deur \n     says.\n       The SBA has repurchased 0.2% of the loans made with the \n     higher guarantees. That rate,\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\n     which reflects defaults, is in line with the program's \n     historical levels.\n       Congress extended the higher guarantees three times, but \n     the latest round of funding was exhausted in May, causing a \n     decline in SBA loan volume. A provision included in the \n     small-business job-creation bill now before the Senate would \n     resuscitate the 90% guarantee through Dec. 31 and allow the \n     SBA to increase the maximum loan amount to $5 million from $2 \n     million. The bill already has passed the House, but the \n     Senate is bogged down by disputes over the broader bill.\n       ``On the financing side we're stuck'' until Congress acts, \n     says Mark DeHaan, who is hoping to get a 7(a) loan for $1.6 \n     million from the Bank of Holland to pay construction and \n     start-up costs for an educational child-care center in Grand \n     Rapids, Mich.\n       Pinnacle largely avoided the worst sins committed by banks \n     throughout in Florida, such as lending on raw land being \n     purchased for housing developments. Still, Pinnacle had a net \n     loss of $1.8 million in 2009 as falling real-estate values \n     and rising unemployment forced the bank to boost loan-loss \n     reserves. Pinnacle has shed about a third of its troubled \n     loans but is looking for additional capital.\n       Mr. Bridgeman, who started his banking career 28 years ago \n     as a teller in Kentucky and took over as Pinnacle's president \n     in 2003, says the bank decided to rev up its SBA lending \n     after a tough regulatory exam forced it to halt most \n     traditional lending in order to conserve capital.\n       Pinnacle made 11 SBA loans for $3 million in 2009. The bank \n     has generated fee income by selling some of its SBA loans on \n     the secondary market.\n       Car dealer J. Brendan Hurley was rejected by four other \n     banks before Pinnacle won approval in March for a $560,000 \n     loan through the SBA to help him add Dodge cars to his \n     Chrysler franchise in DeLand, Fla. Since getting the loan, \n     Mr. Hurley has hired six new employees, and service volume \n     has doubled, he says.\n       ``The fact that I had a commitment from Pinnacle sealed the \n     deal to get the Dodge franchise,'' he adds. Mr. Hurley is \n     seeking a second SBA loan from Pinnacle that would allow him \n     to build a new facility designed to meet Chrysler Group LLC's \n     requirements.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Finally, I have another article written by Barbra \nBarrett of the Miami Herald. It reads:\n\n       The U.S. Senate might leave town this week without \n     finishing up what Democrats had hoped would be a significant \n     political achievement . . .\n       On its face, the legislation would pour billions into a \n     slate of programs to help small business obtain federal \n     microloans, government contracts and export assistance.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Aug. 5, 2010]\n\n           Small Business Bill Appears to be Stuck in Senate\n\n                          (By Barbra Barrett)\n\n       Washington.--The U.S. Senate might leave town this week \n     without finishing up what Democrats had hoped would be a \n     significant political achievement before the August recess: \n     passing a multibillion-dollar swath of programs to help \n     struggling small businesses.\n       On its face, the legislation would pour billions into a \n     slate of programs to help small business obtain federal \n     microloans, government contracts and export assistance. But \n     the bill also is part of the political wrangling that's going \n     on in Washington ahead of fall's midterm elections.\n       Republican senators unanimously blocked the legislation a \n     week ago, preventing an up-or-down vote that could have given \n     the Democratic majority a political victory going into the \n     August recess. In response, President Barack Obama gave a \n     speech Monday urging the Senate to pass the bill.\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has vowed to try again \n     this week, but it's uncertain whether the vote will happen.\n       Observers say the legislation could have sweeping effects \n     in North Carolina.\n       More than 85 percent of companies in the state have fewer \n     than 100 employees, said Scott Daugherty, N.C. small-business \n     commissioner and executive director of the Small Business and \n     Technology Center.\n       ``We are substantially a state of small companies,'' he \n     said.\n       The Economic Policy Institute recently calculated that \n     there are nearly five job seekers for every open job. The \n     unemployment rate in North Carolina remains above 10 percent.\n       Failure to pass the bill would bring Democrats such as U.S. \n     Sen. Kay Hagan, who supports the act, back to their states \n     this weekend with one fewer success to show from their party.\n       And it would give Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, who is \n     running for reelection, another point of criticism against \n     the Democratic majority and the Obama administration.\n       Burr declined to be interviewed for this story, but in a \n     prepared statement, his spokesman, David Ward, turned blame \n     for the struggle of small businesses on the Democrats.\n       ``What (small businesses) really need is for Congress and \n     the administration to stop overburdening them with federal \n     mandates, excessive bureaucratic red tape, tax increases and \n     high energy costs,'' Ward said.\n       Carter Wrenn, a Republican political consultant in Raleigh, \n     said Burr should easily be able to defend his ``no'' vote to \n     his Tar Heel constituents.\n       ``He can explain that all the job programs haven't worked, \n     and he can explain that this is just one more,'' Wrenn said.\n       He said the legislation is a spending bill dressed up as a \n     bailout.\n       ``The truth is there's a trillion dollars now in the \n     banking industry now that's loanable that ain't being \n     loaned,'' Wrenn said. ``The real problem is everybody's so \n     uncertain about the future that no one wants to loan money.''\n       Burr's no vote last week on the procedural question on the \n     bill drew immediate criticism from the Democratic Senatorial \n     Campaign Committee, which supports his challenger, Elaine \n     Marshall, in the upcoming Senate race.\n       ``Again and again, Burr shows he's more loyal to Republican \n     leaders in Washington than to North Carolina small \n     businesses,'' Deirdre Murphy, DSCC spokeswoman, said in a \n     statement.\n       And David Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said Tuesday \n     that GOP senators can expect to hear questions from \n     constituents about why the bill didn't move forward.\n       ``Make no mistake: It will be an issue if politics intrudes \n     on what we should be doing,'' Axelrod said. ``I think if I \n     was in the position of Senator Burr, I'd rather go home and \n     say I did something constructive for the small businesses of \n     my state.''\n       Much of the bill includes bipartisan proposals. Among them \n     are provisions that would increase amounts of Small Business \n     Administration loans, leverage $1 billion in export capital, \n     offer tax breaks for investments and startup costs, and give \n     temporary funding for rural exports.\n       At the bill's center is a $30 billion program for community \n     banks to extend loans to small businesses. Burr's opposition \n     puts him at odds with the N.C. Bankers Association, which \n     supports the legislation.\n       ``We think it is imperative,'' said Thad Woodard, the \n     group's president. ``Our folks have emphasized this as a \n     lubricant for small-business lending.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. She is right. We have worked across the aisle as much \nas we could. But for some inexplicable reason, we can't seem to get \nunanimous consent to move such an important and extraordinary bill \nforward.\n  The small business bill, the Main Street bill, has $12 billion in tax \ncuts for small business. Democrats are for tax cuts for small \nbusinesses that will help them to create the jobs we need. It is very \ntargeted, very strategic, very thoughtful, very careful, and focused on \nreducing the deficit as well. All I hear from the other side is: Extend \ntax cuts permanently to everybody, to heck with the deficit. Who cares \nif we get to a balanced budget. We want to go back to the way things \nwere.\n  Democrats don't want to go back to the way things were. We want to go \nforward in a new way--with sound fiscal policy, balanced budgets, \nfocused on Main Street, focused on small business. That is what \nDemocrats and a handful of our Republican colleagues want--\nunfortunately, not enough to get the job done. I do thank the great \ncoalition of Senators who have helped.\n  I also wish to submit an article by Jeff Cox, of CNBC, ``Four Things \nThat Could Help Companies Start Hiring Again.'' He talks about positive \nmomentum, loans to small business, and foreign demand.\n  One of the things he mentions is:\n\n       American consumers--even those with jobs and savings--are \n     focused on paying down debt and not greasing the economic \n     skids.\n       As such, job markets may have to rely on low export prices \n     and consumers in robust developing economies to help generate \n     demand.\n\n  He is correct. We are going to have to rely on markets outside the \nUnited States to sell our goods there and pull ourselves out of this \nrecession. Do Members think small businesses get the least amount of \nhelp with exports? No, they don't. In our bill, we have extra support \nfor the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration to \nhelp small businesses in Louisiana, in West Virginia, and around the \nworld to reach out from our main streets to main streets in foreign \ncountries to try to sell goods. It is going to be a Main Street-to-Main \nStreet partnership around the world. With the Internet, this is \npossible. Before the Internet, it would be laughable to even suggest \nsuch a thing.\n  But with the Internet, with the global air transportation, with \nexpanded trucking and train transportation, we literally can move goods \nfrom Main Street right here. I would not be surprised if Georgetown \nCupcake, which I\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nspoke about yesterday, ships their cupcakes to India or China because \nthey are really good cupcakes and maybe they do not make them as well \nthere. That may be a little exaggeration, but I think it makes the \npoint that if we can help our small businesses, there is no telling \nwhere these cupcakes--and in my State, it would be King Cakes--can go \nto support businesses on Main Street.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From CNBC, August 5, 2010]\n\n        Four Things That Could Help Companies Start Hiring Again\n\n                             (By Jeff Cox)\n\n       Job creation in 2010 has been slow but unsure, coming in a \n     weak trickle that has left investors unsatisfied and asking \n     what it will take to actually get employment moving in a \n     meaningful way.\n       Thursday's weekly jobless claims report only reinforced \n     what Wall Street already knew--that despite halting signs of \n     improvement, 479,000 new filings for unemployment insurance \n     was hardly indicative of a robust recovery.\n       As such, the stock market sold off and strategists and \n     analysts were left to ponder how long it will take for things \n     to turn accelerate off the weak growth that has taken place \n     this year.\n       ``The question is when is that going to pick up enough to \n     meaningfully lower the unemployment rate and spark the \n     virtuous cycle of upward momentum, to get employment, wages \n     and aggregate demand higher,'' says Tom Higgins, chief \n     economist at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles. ``That takes \n     time. If you look back at the last two cycles, employment \n     recoveries have been slow.''\n       Economists and employment experts say four things will have \n     to happen to get jobs moving:\n\n\n                          1. Positive Momentum\n\n       Slowdowns are as much psychological phenomena as they are \n     economic, with confidence the key as much as any other \n     factor.\n       With the news mostly bad about the economy, companies are \n     afraid to hire until a more positive tone comes about.\n       ``Hiring has tended to be slow the last two cycles,'' \n     Higgins says. ``The trajectory coming out of this recession \n     is even shallower. That likely means the trajectory of hiring \n     is much shallower.''\n       One of the main problems is an economic Catch-22: Companies \n     won't hire until they see more strength from consumers, and \n     consumer spending can't get stronger if people don't have \n     jobs. That means corporate America will have to rely on \n     ``small positives'' to keep building until confidence is \n     established, says Kurt Karl, chief US economist at Swiss Re \n     in New York.\n       ``Businesses like to look at year-over-year growth in \n     sales, and that just isn't that strong yet. But it should be \n     better and better as we get deeper into the recovery,'' Karl \n     says. ``With these unemployment recoveries, you either get \n     one extreme or the other. You're either booming, or it's \n     crash and burn. But we're muddling in between.''\n\n\n                       2. Loans to Small Business\n\n       While the biggest companies sit on the lion's share of the \n     $1.8 trillion in cash on corporate balance sheets, small \n     businesses are groping for funds.\n       That's not been made any easier by banks that have been \n     loathe to lend as they meet capital requirements laid out in \n     the new financial reform legislation. Without that access to \n     capital, small businesses will be unlikely to add new \n     employees.\n       ``We need small businesses, which generate 60 percent of \n     the jobs, to get more access to lending, to capital, so \n     people can take risks,'' says John Challenger, CEO at job \n     outplacement firm Challenger, Gary & Christmas. \n     ``Entrepreneurs rely on savings, but those savings have been \n     depleted.''\n       The ability to invest in companies and develop products \n     will help spur the demand needed to create jobs, Challenger \n     says.\n       Small businesses in the recessionary environment ``don't \n     have access to the savings they might normally have. On the \n     front end, with small businesses not there to pick up the \n     slack, that's a very important hindrance to getting this \n     economic engine going,'' he says.\n\n\n                           3. Foreign Demand\n\n       American consumers--even those with jobs and savings--are \n     focused on paying down debt and not greasing the economic \n     skids.\n       As such, the jobs market may have to rely on low export \n     prices and consumers in robust developing economies to help \n     generate demand.\n       ``One thing we do know is exports are strong. Overseas \n     economies are doing quite well,'' says Brian Gendreau, market \n     strategist with Financial Network Investment, based in El \n     Segundo, Calif. ``For large-cap stocks, more and more \n     revenues are going to come from abroad. That's where we're \n     going to get the growth.''\n       Of 250 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, 46.6 percent \n     of all sales came outside the US in 2009, actually a slight \n     decrease from the previous year, according to S\n       But Gendreau sees capital expenditures increasing in a way \n     that seems to anticipate more spending coming soon.\n       ``Companies seem to be spending a lot of money in \n     anticipation of demand that doesn't look obvious it will show \n     up,'' he says.\n\n\n                          4. Capital Spending\n\n       Indeed, one of the main precursors seen for employment \n     growth is capital spending by companies on plants and \n     equipment.\n       In fact, Deutsche Bank analysts say cap-ex spending this \n     year is robust--growing 20 percent over the previous \n     quarter--and the trend traditionally leads the jobs market by \n     a full quarter. The movement in cap-ex, says Deutsche \n     economist Joseph A. LaVorgna, suggest a strong jobs-creation \n     move in the third quarter.\n       ``Taken literally (the comparison between cap-ex and jobs) \n     implies we will see several million jobs created over the \n     next few quarters,'' LaVorgna said in a note to clients. \n     ``While we are not so bold to forecast such sizeable job \n     gains, we wonder whether there is some upside risk to our \n     slightly above consensus forecast for July private \n     payrolls.''\n       Deutsche is projecting Friday's nonfarm payrolls to show \n     job gains of 110,000 in July, compared to the consensus of \n     90,000.\n       That would be some indication that Wall Street is putting \n     cash to work.\n       ``We all know companies are sitting on mounds and mounds of \n     cash, possibly record amounts of cash,'' Gendreau says. ``The \n     question is, when are they going to start putting it to \n     work?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6848-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6848-S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MORATORIUM IN THE GULF COAST\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know there are Senators who wish to \nspeak, but I have one more subject to speak about before I yield the \nfloor.\n  In addition to fighting for Main Street, I am going to come back here \nin September--and continue through the August recess with many hearings \nin my State and meetings in my State--to fight for justice for the gulf \ncoast.\n  I have not spent a lot of time in the last week or two here on the \nfloor on this issue because I have been handling this small business \nbill, but I have been spending an awful lot of time on the phone, in \nmeetings, and in Louisiana and will continue around the country to talk \nabout this tragedy that has occurred.\n  As shown on this chart I have in the Chamber, this is what the gulf \ncoast looked like before the moratorium was put in place--this blanket \nmoratorium, unnecessary moratorium--by the administration. We had 33 \ndeepwater rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. As you can see, many of them were \noff the coast of New Orleans and Louisiana.\n  As shown on this other chart, this is what it looks like today. \nNobody is working. There is one rig being drilled. It is the Deepwater \nHorizon current site of the relief well. Everybody else has been put \nout of business in the Gulf of Mexico. This represents, at a minimum, \n40,000 direct jobs--40,000 direct jobs.\n  I want to show you a picture of the shallow water. This other one is \nof the deep water. That is what it looks like shut down. This one is of \nthe shallow water. There is no moratorium in the shallow water. But \nbefore the moratorium, there were 55 wells in the shallow Gulf of \nMexico. These wells--each one of them--represent hundreds of people \nsupporting them and on the shore supporting them. We are down to 13. \nAnd I have to fight so hard to get one permit issued by MMS.\n  I am proud, very proud, that my colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Charlie Melancon, did what I did not believe was even \npossible: he got the entire Democratic caucus on record asking the \nPresident basically to lift this moratorium. Yes, there was some \nlanguage in there. I would have liked it to have been immediately. But \nthe fact that we have now every Democrat and every Republican in the \nHouse of Representatives on record lifting this moratorium and helping \nus get back to work in the gulf is really extraordinary.\n  I am looking forward to coming back to lead the effort in the Senate \nto follow the lead of the Congressman from the district that is most \naffected, Mr. Melancon, to get the gulf back to work. There are 25 idle \nrigs, there are 5 nondrilling operators, one Deepwater Horizon, and 2 \nwells being drilled. We have to get the gulf coast back to work.\n  So in addition to passing the small business bill that we have to \npass for the whole country, we have work to do along the gulf coast. We \nhave a liability issue to settle. We are working on a compromise. I \nhave a justice for the gulf document I am going to submit, a bill I am \ngoing to ask to be filed right now so that we can work in earnest.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  I hope that before we get back here, the President will \nadministratively lift this moratorium. That is what he should do. We \nhave put new safety requirements in. BP is going to pay the fines, \nbillions of dollars of fines. They put $20 billion in escrow. Claims \nare being paid. That part is working fairly well. What is not working \nare the people in the gulf of Mexico. We do not want handouts. We do \nnot want welfare. We do not want food stamps. We want to go back to \nwork, and that is what we are going to work on.\n  So this Senate has some work to do. The House has done its job in \nthis regard. I hope, Mr. President, you and your team and the Secretary \nof Interior will think very hard about the economic damage that is \nbeing done right now. I understand safety is at issue. I understand we \nwant our oceans clean. Nobody wants them cleaner than those of us who \nswim in the gulf, live in the gulf, fish in the gulf, and have for \ndecades and centuries. But enough is enough. We have to get back to \nwork. There are things that can be done, and I submit the bill at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express strong support \nand to echo the comments of the previous speaker before Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Casey, for the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.\n  Chairwoman Lincoln has led the reauthorization efforts--chairing \nhearings of the Agriculture Committee, on which I sit, and speaking \neloquently in this Chamber about what is at stake in the Healthy, \nHunger-Free Kids Act.\n  The health and well-being of our Nation's children, it goes without \nsaying, has a direct effect on the health and well-being of our Nation. \nOur economic security depends on a strong and capable workforce. Our \nnational security depends on a highly skilled and physically fit \nmilitary. In fact, when President Truman signed the National School \nLunch Act--laying the foundation for President Johnson to sign the \nChild Nutrition Act of 1966--he did so at the request of our military \nleaders, who saw firsthand the malnutrition plaguing so many of our \nsoldiers--especially rural soldiers, White and Black alike--in World \nWar II.\n  When Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946, it said:\n\n       It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress, as \n     a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and \n     well-being of the Nation's children.\n\n  Today, our military leaders once again support the Child Nutrition \nAct and have joined with hunger and nutrition advocates to urge \nCongress to pass this critical legislation.\n  So, too, are educators and business leaders and health care \nproviders, who are worried about the costs of poor nutrition to our \neconomy and our health care systems and the educational development of \nour children.\n  As Senator Casey said so well, hungry children simply cannot learn. \nAnd my guess is, there are few, if any, in this Chamber who went to \nschool so hungry as kids that they could not learn. But it certainly is \nproven, and we know that from observing kids, from talking to children, \nfrom watching their performance.\n  Study after study indicates that access to healthy, nutritious foods \nis critical, obviously, to our children's health and their ability to \nlearn. Yet the stories behind these studies put a real face on the \nissue of childhood hunger.\n  Twenty percent of Ohio children under 18 years of age--570,000 \nchildren--think of that, 1 out of 5 children in a State, in a generally \nwealthy State, in a very wealthy country; 20 percent, 1 out of 5 \nchildren in my State under 18 years of age, more than 500,000 \nchildren--live in food-insecure homes. Those numbers are comparable in \nthe Presiding Officer's State, in cities such as Huntington and \nCharleston and Morgantown and Beckley and all over his State.\n  Too many students nationwide--more than 1 million children--slip \nthrough the cracks and do not receive free or reduced-priced lunches \nfor which they are eligible. In Ohio, about 700,000 children are \neligible for reduced-priced or free breakfast or lunch. Every day, that \nnumber is significantly fewer as to those children who actually receive \nlunch and breakfast.\n\n  Understand, too, on weekends in the summer months, those numbers \nshrink dramatically. There are feeding programs in the summers, but \nonly about 1 out of 10 children who are eligible actually gets those \nfree breakfasts, free lunches, free snacks in those summer months. So \nthe effects of poor nutrition reach beyond the boundaries of hunger. It \nalso fuels childhood obesity, ironically. So it plagues communities \nacross the Nation.\n  That is why this reauthorization is so important. Every 5 years, we \nhave a chance to make the programs and resources available to our \nchildren better and more effective. This year we did that, and the \nSenate passed it today.\n  The bill will improve the quality of food in the National School \nLunch Program and make sure children who need the help most are \nactually getting it. Each day, some 30 million schoolchildren across \nthe country participate in the National School Lunch Program, from \ncities as large as Cleveland and Cincinnati and Columbus to rural towns \nsuch as Gallipolis and Galion and Grafton.\n  Each school day, the number of schoolchildren receiving free or \nreduced-price meals increases as more families struggle with high \nunemployment and increased poverty. We know that during the extension \nof unemployment benefits, the number of families who lost their jobs, \nthen lost their unemployment insurance, then lost their health care, \nthen lost their cars in some cases and in far too many cases then lost \ntheir homes to foreclosure--that those families even more relied on the \nschool breakfast and lunch program.\n  The reauthorization includes provisions from the Hunger Free Schools \nAct that Senator Casey from Pennsylvania and Senator Bennet from \nColorado and I introduced earlier this year.\n  This legislation would auto-enroll eligible children and eliminate \nduplicative paperwork that costs schools and families valuable time \nand, in too many kids' cases, access to healthy school meals. It would \nallow eligible schools in high-poverty areas to serve universal free \nschool lunches and breakfasts. In Ohio, an estimated 432 schools \nenrolling more than 150,000 students could opt into this program. So \nmaking this part of the reauthorization absolutely matters to embrace \nmore children in these programs.\n  This bill is about reaching the very children--the neediest and most \nvulnerable--we should have been reaching in the first place.\n  The reauthorization would also expand the Afterschool Meal Program \nand the Summer Food Service Program, which play critical roles in \nchildhood development outside of the classroom. We know that for \nparticularly young children, if they are not eating right, their \ndevelopment as sentient, strong, healthy, intelligent human beings is \nsignificantly arrested.\n  Less than 10 percent of Ohio's eligible schoolchildren receive summer \nnutrition assistance. As I said, in rural Appalachia, across the river \nfrom the Presiding Officer's State, the numbers are bleaker as meal \nlocations are fewer and farther between. The numbers are not good \nenough in Cleveland. They are not good enough in Youngstown. They are \neven worse in Malta and McConnelsville, in Pomeroy, in Piketon, and \nespecially in the even more rural areas such as Colton in Jackson \nCounty, Coolville in Athens County, and those small remote areas where \nmeal locations are even harder to reach. By strengthening these summer \nprograms, we ensure more children have a nutritious breakfast, lunch, \nor snack during the summer months. It is a key ingredient in keeping \nchildren healthy, educated, and active.\n  Steve Garland of the E.L. Hardy Center--a summer feeding site outside \nof Columbus--tells a story of a single father with three sons who \nrelies on the center for meals and mentoring. The father says that \nwithout the center, his young sons are at risk of falling behind in \nschool and getting in trouble in the community.\n  It is not just keeping children fed. It also matters for their school \nwork. It\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nmatters for keeping them out of trouble. It matters for their \nintellectual development.\n  Fifty children per day in past summers would show up for a healthy \nmeal and recreational activities at the Hardy Center. This summer, \nbecause of enthusiastic and dedicated VISTA volunteers, attendance at \nthe Hardy Center has ballooned to 300 children per day.\n  Now, get this: Typically, only about 1 out of 10 eligible children \nacross the country--Ohio is actually slightly above the national \naverage--only about 1 out of 10 children across the country who are \neligible for free breakfast and free lunch is getting it during the \nschool year. Only 1 out of 10 gets these breakfasts, lunches, or snacks \nin the summer--1 out of 10.\n  That is why what we did when Senator Dorgan and Senator Kaufman and \nall of us worked together in expanding national service--VISTA; Peace \nCorps; City Year, which two of my daughters have been part of as \nvolunteers; AmeriCorps; all of those programs--more of those kids, more \nof those volunteers are now helping these summer feeding programs.\n  So instead of feeding 50 people at the Hardy Center, thanks to the \nVISTA volunteers, 300 children--all those 300 were eligible last \nsummer; they just were not there because they did not know about it, \nthey could not get there, whatever--now, because of these VISTA \nvolunteers, 300 children are getting fed almost every day this summer. \nThat is the good news. The bad news is that Steve Garland of the Hardy \nCenter says there are still some 5,000 children in the surrounding \ncommunities who do not have a site in their area.\n  I said 5,000, and that is just Columbus. That is not the whole State. \nThat is not the whole country. That is 5,000 children in Columbus who \naren't getting fed who are eligible, who won't do as well in this life \nprobably because they are not getting adequate nutrition as children.\n  When the President signs this bill into law, we will help countless \nother community leaders such as Steve provide more meals and activities \nto keep our children healthy.\n  The reauthorization dramatically reshapes and updates nutrition \nstandards to help us reduce childhood obesity rates ands put healthier \nfood in school cafeterias.\n  Steve Grundy, director of Nutrition Services for Dayton Public \nSchools, faces the choice between doing what is right--feeding our \nchildren healthy foods--and what is cost-effective--serving cheaper, \nless healthy foods.\n  Craig Hokenberry of Cincinnati Public Schools sees children with \nstunted growth because they have too little to eat. Without access to \nhealthier fresh foods, families and schools look to the local food bank \nfor afterschool or weekend meals. Because they are just getting these \nprograms during the week, they are getting breakfast and lunch. \nWeekends, not so good; summers, not so good.\n  As Nora Nees of Ohio's Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks can \nattest to, these programs are in demand now more than ever.\n  Ginny Black in Columbus teaches children about healthy eating habits. \nMs. Black has been a school nurse in Columbus for more than 20 years. \nShe has seen firsthand how good nutrition contributes to higher \nacademic achievement and better classroom behavior. According to her, \nreauthorizing the Child Nutrition Act means no more vending machines \nwith junk food, no more having to rely on outside vendors for pizzas \nand burgers.\n  I was recently in Mansfield, my home town, about 50,000 people, \nvisiting with community health workers at CHAP--women who travel across \nthe country to provide prenatal care for underserved communities. CHAP \nis a facet of the social service safety net that is working to improve \noutcomes and reduce costs, but it is stretched thin.\n  By authorizing the Child Nutrition Act, we can help these workers and \neducators and parents do much more for our Nation's children. The more \nchildren who are healthy, the more we can lower rates of childhood \nobesity and diabetes. The more children who are not going hungry during \nschool, the greater their chance to learn and succeed.\n  It is important we took this step today. This legislation means not \njust a lot for hungry children today; it means a lot for the future of \nthis country, because children who in the past have not been so well \nserved will have the opportunity to eat better, will have the \nopportunity to grow better, will have the opportunity to intellectually \ndevelop better, and will have the opportunity to be healthier. We owe \nthat to our children. We took an important step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the need of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to take meaningful action to protect \nthe credibility of our markets.\n  As my colleagues know, I believe deeply in the importance of our \ncapital markets to America's future economic success and the ability of \nAmericans to invest for their retirement years. I have said many times \non this floor that democracy and our capital markets are the \nfundamental pillars that make America great. I have always maintained \nthat if we do not have credible markets, our country will be in serious \ntrouble. Credible capital markets are one of America's crown jewels and \nwe should protect them as such.\n  I am deeply concerned about the state of our equity markets. Many \nrapid and dramatic developments have inextricably changed the way \nstocks are traded in today's marketplace. The markets have become \nfragmented and dominated by high-frequency trading.\n  These changes came to a head on May 6 when stock prices spiraled out \nof control, ultimately dropping and recovering over 500 points during a \ndizzying 20-minute time period.\n  It is clear we must rely more than ever on our regulators to protect \nthe integrity and credibility of our capital markets. Without a doubt, \nthe SEC--the Securities and Exchange Commission--along with the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission--CFTC--has worked heroically to \nstudy the flash crash and put circuit breakers in place to prevent \nanother event of the magnitude we witnessed on May 6 from occurring, or \neven more. But that is not anywhere--nowhere even close--to enough.\n  As Chairman Mary Schapiro has repeatedly stated, our markets exist to \nperform two principal functions: capital formation so that companies \ncan raise capital and invest, create jobs and grow; and attracting and \nserving long-term investors to help facilitate that process. The May 6 \nflash crash revealed structural flaws in our market structure that must \nbe addressed--must be addressed--in order to ensure our markets are \nperforming their best and highest purposes.\n  There are many questions that remain unanswered and many solutions \nthat I hope the SEC already has been exploring. More and more market \nparticipants and regulators are sharing their own concerns about the \noverall performance of our equity markets.\n  Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer of J.P. Morgan's \nprivate banking division, wrote a commentary on July 13. This is J.P. \nMorgan. Mr. Cembalest outlined several areas of current market \nstructure, including the market's increasing reliance on volume driven \nby high-frequency traders, which merit careful review.\n  In addition to supporting circuit breakers, Mr. Cembalest suggested \nthat high-frequency traders should: ``be required to register as \nbroker-dealers . . . [and] act more like the floor specialists they're \nreplacing.''\n  Cembalest also noted that while high-frequency volume has ostensibly \nmade trading cheaper by narrowing the spreads investors often pay to \nget their orders filled, there are other costs associated with trading \nthat might be less obvious. One such cost, according to Cembalest, \noccurs when high-frequency traders ``spray the tape'' with thousands of \nquotes to ``ferret out'' the intentions of large investors, and then \ntrade ahead of their order flow.\n  A draft report submitted by a British member of the European \nParliament to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs expresses \nsimilar concerns.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\nThe report, which could influence the European Union's ongoing review \nof market structure, states ``limiting systemic risk must be \nprioritized.'' Accordingly, it proposes that all trading platforms \nshould ``stress-test their technology and surveillance systems.'' It \nalso called for ``an examination of the costs and benefits of high \nfrequency trading on markets and its impact upon other market users. . \n. .'' Finally, the report calls for ``the regulation of firms that \npursue high frequency trading strategies to ensure that they have \nrobust systems and controls with ongoing regulatory reviews of the \nalgorithms they use.''\n  While I stated many of these concerns last August 21 in a letter to \nChair Schapiro, it has taken almost a year later--and in large part due \nto the May 6 flash crash--that these ideas have finally gone mainstream \nand people are talking about it in all the different areas of the news \nmedia. Although the task before us is daunting, as even tweaking the \nmarket's structure is rife with potential unintended consequences, the \nSEC must act to protect investors and restore market credibility in the \ncoming months. Navigating these issues will be difficult, particularly \nwith so many business models based, or even dependent, on the existing \nregulatory framework.\n  Another challenge comes in the form of the recently enacted Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which places a \nraft of new responsibilities, including 95 rulemakings and 22 studies, \non the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nevertheless, the SEC must \ntriage its responsibilities and work expeditiously to adopt much needed \nreforms in the market structure area. There can be no back burner when \nit comes to resolving a broken market structure. There can be no delay \nwhen long-term investors are losing confidence. The time for action is \nnow.\n\n  The direction the Commission takes in its bid to fulfill its mission \nwill say much about the type of country in which we live. As difficult \nas it might be, regulators must stand apart from the industries they \nregulate, listening and understanding industry's point of view, but \ndoing so at arm's length and with a clear conviction that on balance, \nour capital markets exist for the greater good of all Americans.\n  This is a test of whether the Commission is just a ``regulator by \nconsensus,'' which only moves forward when it finds solutions favored \nby large constituencies on Wall Street, or if it indeed exists to serve \na broader mission and therefore will act decisively to ensure the \nmarkets perform their two primary functions of facilitating capital \nformation and serving the interests of long-term investors.\n  A consensus regulator may tinker here and there on the margins, adopt \npatches when the markets spring a leak, and reach for low-hanging fruit \nwhen Wall Street itself reaches a consensus about permissible changes. \nIn these times, however, the Commission must be bold and move forward. \nThe American people deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today we had some suggestion on \nthe floor of the Senate about the Cobell case--that is the settlement \nof the Cobell case--the Federal court case Cobell, et al. v. Salazar. A \nnegotiation ensued late last year with an agreement in December of last \nyear that would settle at last--at long, long last--a 15-year \nlitigation in Federal court dealing with American Indians and the \nmismanagement of their trust accounts--literally stealing and looting \ntrust accounts over the years and, in addition to that, a substantial \namount of incompetence along the way.\n  I described today people who have had oil wells on their land and who \nhave lived in poverty because somebody else got the money from their \noil wells. They didn't get it, despite the fact that the government \nheld their land in trust and promised to provide them their income from \nthat land, whether it was from minerals, oil, grazing, agriculture, or \nanother activity. For 140 years, American Indians have too often been \ncheated.\n  Well, a court case that has existed now for 15 years determined that \nthe Federal Government had a responsibility and liability. Rather than \nhave that court case continue for more years in the Federal courts, \nthere was a negotiation late last year with Interior Secretary Ken \nSalazar and Cobell plaintiffs. They reached an agreement and the \nFederal judge gave Congress 30 days to provide the funding and approve \nthe settlement. The Congress did not do that in 30 days. In fact, the \ndeadline for the settlement has been extended now six times during \nwhich the Congress has not acted.\n  We have tried very hard to find ways to satisfy everybody here, but \napparently that is not capable of being done today. I am profoundly \ndisappointed in that. I think my colleague from Wyoming wishes he were \none of the negotiators. He was not, of course. It was the Interior \nSecretary who and the plaintiffs who negotiated. The Congress simply is \nan evaluator of whether it wishes to dispense the funding for the \nsettlement that was done. I was not a negotiator. Nobody in Congress \nwas a negotiator.\n  The question isn't, by the way, whether Indians were cheated or \nwhether they are owed money as a result of mismanagement and fraud over \nthese decades. The Federal court has already determined that was the \ncase. They found in favor of the plaintiffs, and then the case was \nappealed further by the Federal Government.\n  The question is whether we have a responsibility here. We do. The \nFederal court has already found that to be the case. The question is \nwhether we will meet our responsibility. This negotiation that ensued \nwith Cobell v. Salazar, as far as I am concerned, represented a sound \nand reasonable approach, and I believe we should fund and approve it \nand move forward.\n  The unanimous-consent request that I am going to offer includes \nCobell v. Salazar and the authorized settlement in that case, as well \nas the approval and funding for the final settlement of claims from the \nBlack farmers discrimination litigation that has been discussed at some \nlength on the floor as well.\n  Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFinance Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n4994, and that the Senate proceed to its consideration; that the \nsubstitute amendment at the desk, which authorizes the settlement of \nCobell, et al., v. Ken Salazar, et al., and to provide an appropriation \nfor final settlement claims from In re Black Farmers Discrimination \nLitigation, be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read \na third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do \nsupport the Cobell lawsuit. I have great admiration for my colleague \nfrom North Dakota and the considerable work he has done as chairman of \nthe committee. He has worked very effectively and passionately and he \nalso worked with Secretary Salazar to get to a point where we can move \nforward. We are not quite there yet in terms of the policy or the \npayment issue. We are not quite there, but I will offer the following \nalternative to the proposal the chairman has presented to the Senate. \nIt is along the lines of things I have been discussing with Secretary \nSalazar and the administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 3754, which was introduced earlier today; that the \nbill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say again how extraordinarily \ndisappointed I am. I have in my hand the proposal Senator Barrasso \noffered to the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\n  By the way, I don't accuse anybody of bad faith. The Senator from \nWyoming is a friend of mine. I am enormously disappointed with him at \nthis point. He has a right to be disappointed with me, if he wishes. \nLet me just say this. This negotiation ensued last November and \nDecember, resulting in a settlement. None of us here were part of that \nsettlement--excuse me, we weren't a part of the negotiation that \nreached the settlement. That is not the role of the Senate, to be \ninvolved in a 100-person negotiation.\n  The lawsuit was a suit brought by plaintiffs against the Secretary of \nthe Interior. The negotiations were negotiations with the Secretary of \nthe Interior, who was the defendant in that suit. That is appropriate \nand the way it should be.\n  If we don't like what that negotiations developed and don't support \nthe settlement and believe we can do better, then we should object. But \nthen we don't get this done. That has happened six times this year. \nOver and over and over again, we have failed to act on this matter.\n  My colleague has five things he wants that are different than the \nsettlement. Maybe they are better, I don't know. I don't have the \nfoggiest idea. I said to him a while ago that I wish he would take yes \nfor an answer because the response to his requests of the Interior \nSecretary was a letter from the Secretary saying he agreed with him and \nwould do them. But my colleague wants them in legislative language. \nThat changes the settlement and the negotiation.\n  It is 7:30 on a Thursday night in August, months and months and \nmonths after the settlement was sent to the Congress by a Federal \njudge, saying do this in 30 days. I just say it is very hard to get \nthings done. Next, it will be somebody else who has four provisions or \nfive provisions or who can write the settlement better or think it \nthrough more clearly. I don't know. I do know this. The people who have \nbeen cheated--and there are a lot of them and many of whom have died \nwaiting for this settlement--are not going to get any benefits from \nthis settlement until this Congress decides whether it is going to pass \nlegislation dealing with the settlement.\n  It may be that any Member of the Congress can do a better job and \nwrite better provisions, except that we weren't the negotiators because \nwe were not the defendants in the lawsuit. We have every right to say \nno, if that is the point. We have said no since last December. If that \nis the point, I suppose more plaintiffs will die. They will wait years \nand probably go back to Federal court. Maybe we can go another 10 years \nin Federal court, having lawyers earning money and Indians living on \nlands with oil wells 100 yards from their house and they get checks of \n5 cents or 8 cents or maybe $3 as revenue from the wells. That is what \nhas been happening for the last 130 years.\n  I understand why there is frustration. If I sound frustrated, think \nof the people I describe who have been cheated and have lived in \npoverty most of their lives because they have not had the opportunity \nto get income from the lands they owned. I don't understand it. I guess \npeople see competing UCs, and wonder what is the result of what are \ncalled in the Senate competing UCs? Does anybody go home feeling good? \nNot me. We are either going to do this or not. If we don't like this \nsettlement, let's not do it. I happen to like it; let's do it. My \ncolleague, perhaps, wants to respond.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, again, I have a great deal of respect \nfor my colleague from North Dakota. He is compassionate and makes a \ncompelling argument. We do need to settle the Cobell lawsuit. I ask the \nleaders to, over the next couple weeks, come together and allow for a \nvery limited debate, possibly a few amendments on the floor, and then \nan up-or-down vote.\n  That is the sort of thing we need to do--in the light of day--with \nthe Members of the Senate, not something that continues to be brought \nforth with the goal of getting a unanimous-consent agreement. We are \nnot there.\n  I think the ideas I have brought forward are good. They come forward \nbecause those are the ideas I have had brought to me through various \ntribes from around the country who have concerns about the settlement. \nThere have been large meetings of different tribes who have come out in \nsupport of these ideas that they have brought to me. I think it is very \nreasonable for the Senate, if we can arrange for a limited time for \ndebate on the specifics and not be asked in a unanimous consent on the \nlast evening before Members of this body have scattered home to their \nStates, when they are no longer here. They have been told they are not \ngoing to vote again until the middle of September.\n  I think it is reasonable to ask the Senate to have a discussion on \nthis and then a vote. If the Senate, in its wisdom, decides that is \nwhat they want and they want to pass this as written, then the will of \nthe Senate has been worked. That is why I raise these concerns tonight.\n  With great admiration for the chairman, who has worked so well, in a \nbipartisan way on our committee, we have worked together on legislation \non Indian affairs. He is chairman and I am vice chairman. I can \nunderstand his concerns and wanting to get this settled. I do too. I \nfeel obligated to bring forth the concerns I have heard from across \nthis country and bring them here.\n  That is the reason I object to the settlement tonight, and I would \nlove to have our leaders work together to bring this forward to the \nfloor for discussion, debate, and then an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe the difficulty with the \nprocedure my colleague described. We can't just bring something up for \na vote, because if somebody here doesn't like it, they object. Then you \nhave to file a cloture motion, and it takes 48 hours to get a cloture \nvote. Then you have 30 hours postcloture. That is what we run into. I \nagree with that; let's put the best idea up and have a vote on it. If \nyou don't like the settlement and decide that somehow these plaintiffs \nare not worthy, despite the fact they have been bilked for 130 years, \nthen vote no. But we can't even get a vote.\n  At any rate, I will wait and see if there is a better idea that will \nget votes in the Senate or are we going to continue every 30 days or so \nto say to this Federal judge that we understand a settlement was \nnegotiated and reached on behalf of the United States of America, but \nwe don't intend to vote for it?\n  I have another bill at the desk. Before I ask unanimous consent, I \nwill describe it. In the piece of legislation we passed today, dealing \nwith FMAP, and funding for teachers, and so on, there was a provision \nthat was first described as a pay-for but actually scored as zero, \nwhich meant it was a pay-for that had zero impact. It does have an \nimpact on American Indians, and I wanted to describe it briefly.\n  When the Economic Recovery Act was passed, we proposed that at least \na small amount of money go to Indian reservations around this country \nbecause they had the highest rates of unemployment. So there was put in \nplace a piece of legislation that provided an Indian guaranteed loan \nprogram account. There was $6.8 million remaining in that account that \nwould support a substantial number of projects around the country--\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $80 million--that would put a lot of \npeople to work--investing in new infrastructure and projects. That \nlegislation--the so-called pay-for that is scored as zero in the bill \npassed today--in my judgment, we need to rescind that action because it \nhad no impact on the legislation the Senate passed. But it will have a \nsubstantial impact on loan guarantees for these Indian reservations, \nmost of which have the highest rates of unemployment in the country.\n  I have spoken to a good many people about the need to do this. Again, \nI have been on the phone to the Congressional Budget Office. They say \nthat a zero score--as I introduced it today, it will not score. \nTherefore, I believe it is very important to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 3761, which is at the desk; that the bill be read \nthe third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; and that any statements related to the bill be printed in \nthe Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is \nsomething my colleagues have not had a chance to review. As a result, \nand not knowing the specific details and with colleagues now traveling \nback to their home States, on behalf of them, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Wyoming \nsuggests there are some here who may not be acquainted with this \nlegislation. I have spoken to both Republicans and Democrats today, \nduring the course of the proceedings, because I think it is very \nimportant. I think this is something we need to fix as well. I \nunderstand my colleague from Wyoming is objecting on behalf of others.\n  Let me make one other point on this. I have spent a fair amount of \ntime talking to Senator Kyl about this. He is on an airplane at the \nmoment. He was not able to hear from the Congressional Budget Office \nbefore he left town. I do hope, even though there is an objection now--\nand to be fair to my colleague, he is objecting on behalf of other \nSenators with respect to this--that we can find a way to repair this \nbecause I think it is very important that we do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated August 5, 2010 from the CBO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 2010.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, CBO has reviewed a \n     draft bill to ensure that amounts appropriated to the Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs under the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 remain available until September 30, \n     2010. The draft bill would repeal a provision in H.R. 1586, \n     the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \n     Improvement Act, as passed by the Senate on August 5, 2010, \n     that would rescind certain unobligated balances from the \n     Indian Guaranteed Loan Program Account.\n       CBO estimates that for the purpose of budget enforcement \n     procedures in the Senate, passage of the draft bill would be \n     considered to have no budgetary effect, because it would be \n     amending legislation that had not yet cleared the Congress.\n       We also estimate that if the draft bill is passed by the \n     Senate, passage of both bills by the House would lead to \n     about $3 million more in direct spending than passage of just \n     H.R. 1586 because the rescission in H.R. 1586 would be \n     repealed. For the purpose of budget enforcement procedures in \n     the House, that $3 million would affect the cost of whichever \n     bill cleared the House later.\n       That $3 million cost would not count for the purpose of \n     statutory pay-as-you-go procedures, because the funds \n     affected were designated as an emergency requirement when \n     originally appropriated.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If you wish \n     further details on this estimate, we would be pleased to \n     provide them. The CBO staff contact is Jeff LaFave who may be \n     reached at 226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6853-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HERCULEZ GOMEZ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to \ncongratulate Herculez Gomez, a dedicated and disciplined soccer player \nfrom Las Vegas, who was one of 23 men to represent the country during \nthe 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa as part of the U.S. Men's \nNational Team. Herculez, who currently plays in Mexico's Professional \nFirst Division for Pachuca F.C., made the final cut after being \nselected from the 30-man provisional World Cup U.S. roster.\n  As the oldest of five children, Herculez was born in Los Angeles to \nMexican-American parents and later moved to Las Vegas where he was \nraised. While attending Las Vegas High School, he joined the high \nschool's soccer league, where he cultivated a passion that would launch \nhis career in the MLS league, and later earn him an unexpected, but \nwell-deserved slot to represent his home State of Nevada and the United \nStates in the 2010 World Cup this past June.\n  Throughout the years Herculez has developed a very successful soccer \ncareer, playing for several teams both in the United States and Mexico. \nDespite having suffered several physical injuries, such as broken foots \nand torn ligaments, through perseverance and patience Herculez has made \na name for himself as dedicated player and rising star. While playing \nwith the Puebla F.C. in Mexico, he became the first American player to \nscore the most number of goals for a foreign league, netting 10 goals \nin the 2010 Mexican season.\n  During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Herculez played in three of the four \nU.S. men's team World Cup games, and started in one of them. Although \nthe team's quest for our first World Cup ended in the round of 16, \nHerculez represented Nevada and his country brilliantly and I look \nforward to seeing bigger and better performances from this Las Vegan \nstar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6853-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6853-S6855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, lately it seems that there is nothing the \nSenate can agree on. We argue on partisan lines over every issue \nimaginable.\n  But I know of at least one issue that would bring every Member of the \nSenate to the floor in agreement: Pell grants.\n  This is a program designed to help poor students get the education \nthey need to give themselves and their families a better future. \nMillions of Americans have seen the benefits of the Federal investment \nin Pell grants first hand.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Congress has provided significant \nincreases in funding to the Pell grant program. We have raised the \nmaximum Pell grant to an all time high of $5,550 and we set a course so \nthe grants will continue to rise reaching almost $6,000 in 2017.\n  I have supported those increases. The recent expansion of the Pell \ngrant program is essential for our economic recovery as Americans are \nreturning to college to learn new skills.\n  But the investment does not come without a cost. To finance the \nhigher Pell grant levels, we invested $17 billion from the Recovery Act \nand $36 billion from the recent reconciliation bill.\n  And we still have a shortfall this year caused by the tremendous new \ndemand for Pell grants.\n  I have spoken before about my concern that increases to Federal \nstudent aid are diminished by the skyrocketing cost of higher education \nat many colleges and universities, but today I want to discuss a new \nthreat to the Federal Pell grant program--in the form of for-profit \ncolleges.\n  I am worried that a portion of the investment of taxpayer funding \ninto higher education may be going to waste at the hands of for-profit \ncolleges.\n  For-profit institutions of higher education have experienced a \nmeteoric rise. Two decades ago, the phrases ``for-profit college'' or \n``proprietary school'' would have conjured up images of the beauty \nschool around the corner or the trade school down the street. Most of \nthose schools were small mom-and-pop operations. Some were bad apples \nthat wasted taxpayer money and some provided needed training to \nstudents with no other opportunities, but their impact was small.\n  That is no longer the case. Today, the largest recipient of Federal \nfinancial aid is a for-profit institution that enrolls over 450,000 \nstudents, many of those online.\n  Enrollment at for-profit colleges has grown by 225 percent over the \npast 10 years.\n  The 14 publicly traded companies in the industry enrolled 1.4 million \nstudents as of 2008.\n  Because of the high price of tuition and the active recruitment of \nlow-income students, for-profit colleges receive a tremendous amount of \nFederal financial aid funding. For-profit colleges received $4.3 \nbillion in Pell grants in 2009.\n  We also need to examine the funding that for-profit schools are \nreceiving from other Federal sources.\n  Along with the billions of dollars in Pell grants and Federal student \nloans, the for-profit college industry also receives significant \nfunding from the Department of Defense through tuition assistance and \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs through the G.I. bill.\n  Some for-profit institutions serve active-duty students and veterans \nwell by offering flexible course schedules, distance learning, and \ncourse credit for military training.\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\n  But there are also reports of for-profit colleges aggressively \ntargeting military personnel. One prominent for-profit has 452 \nmilitary-focused recruiters. It is troublesome that so much money is \nspent on recruiting students whose tuition is paid by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The tuition payments for active military and veterans funding does \nnot count towards the 90 percent Federal funding limitation, which \nmakes Defense and G.I. bill funding particularly attractive to for-\nprofit colleges.\n  Their tactics are working. Seven of the top 10 recipients of G.I. \nbill funding in the last school year were for-profit colleges.\n  It is time we examined these sources of funding. This week, Senator \nWebb and I are sending letters to Secretary Gates and Secretary \nShinseki asking some important questions about the Federal investment \nin for-profit colleges as well as the quality controls over these \ninstitutions.\n  And students who attend for-profit colleges are more likely to borrow \nstudent loans than students attending public or nonprofit colleges. And \nthey take out larger student loans.\n  In 2008, one-quarter of graduates from for-profit schools had \nborrowed more than $40,000 to finance their education.\n  There are good trade schools and for-profit colleges, and they serve \nan important purpose with job training that provides a way up the \neconomic ladder.\n  But that is not the case across the board. Too often, those loans and \nPell investments are not paying off.\n  For-profit schools enroll just 10 percent of all students in higher \neducation, but their students use 25 percent of all Federal aid and \nrepresent over 40 percent of all student loan defaults.\n  Students are enrolling in for-profit colleges in search of \nopportunity. At some of these schools they learn important skills, \ngraduate, and move on to good careers.\n  But too many students drop out or graduate only to realize that the \neducation they have borrowed so heavily for has not provided them the \nskills or credentials they need to find employment.\n  These students will often find their high monthly student loan \npayments impossible to meet and stop paying.\n  A few weeks ago, the Chicago Tribune told the story of Denise \nParnell. Denise is a single mother who dreams of becoming a nursing \nassistant.\n  She enrolled at an Illinois for-profit college where she completed an \n8-month program that she was promised would lead to a career.\n  But in June, Denise and the other students in her program learned \nthat the school's program wasn't approved by the State Department of \nPublic Health. Denise was not eligible to take the exam she needed to \nbecome a certified nursing assistant.\n  Denise had wasted a year of her life in a program leading nowhere. \nAnd even worse, she owes more than $13,000 in student loans for her \ntrouble.\n  Before she enrolled at that for-profit college, I wish Denise had \nlooked to her local community college.\n  There, she would find many programs of study that could give her the \nskills she needs to start a new career as a health care worker. But \ncommunity colleges are not able to compete with the marketing skills of \nfor-profit colleges.\n  Many for-profit colleges spend substantial sums of money on \nrecruiting and marketing through television commercials, billboards, \nphone solicitation, and other direct marketing.\n  In fact, many for-profit colleges spend barely half of their budget \non education and nearly one-third on recruiting and marketing. At least \none prominent school actually spends less on teaching than it does on \nmarketing.\n  This is a recipe for disaster. Low-income students come to for-profit \ncolleges in droves, lured by promises of high-paying careers, flexible \ncourses, and easy financial aid.\n  But when they enroll, they may find that far less money is put into \neducating them than on recruiting them.\n  Today, the Government Accountability Office released a report \ndocumenting the recruiting practices of for-profit colleges.\n  Senator Harkin asked GAO to send undercover investigators to \ndetermine if for-profit colleges' admissions representatives were \nengaged in deceptive marketing tactics.\n  GAO sent undercover applicants to 15 for-profit colleges, including \ntwo in Illinois.\n  At every single one, they found that recruiters made deceptive or \notherwise questionable statements.\n  And at four of the schools, the for-profit college representatives \nactually encouraged fraud.\n  Some of the tapes of those encounters would shock you.\n  The recruiters made false claims about potential salaries, program \nduration, cost, and graduation rates. Other recruiters encouraged \nstudents to lie on their financial aid forms.\n  In one video, the representative informs a prospective applicant that \nsome graduates are making $1,000 a day as barbers in the District of \nColumbia. That would be a salary of around $250,000 per year. The \naverage barber in DC makes $19,000.\n  In another video, the recruiter claims that you don't have to pay \nback your student loans at all. She says that unlike a car loan, no one \nwill come after you for not paying a student loan.\n  In several videos, recruiters refuse to let the applicant speak to \nfinancial aid officers until he enrolls in the school.\n  Throughout, the representatives of the for-profit colleges employ \naggressive tactics and convey false information to prospective students \nin order to sign them up.\n  Why is all this pressure placed on students? Money.\n  In many for-profit schools, recruiters' salaries, bonuses, or \npromotions are determined by how many students they sign up.\n  As a result, they try to bring in as many students as possible--\nregardless of their ability to succeed or complete the program--and \nload them up with loans.\n  Students deserve full and complete information when enrolling in a \ncollege and taking on large amounts of debt.\n  Students should be informed about debt loads, completion rates, job \nplacement rates and salaries, and accreditation information so that \nthey and their families can make smart choices.\n  Instead, students are being misled, misinformed, and lied to.\n  Students are not the only ones being taken advantage of by the worst \nfor-profit colleges. Taxpayers are on the hook as well when Pell grants \nare wasted or when student loans are defaulted on.\n  When a student cannot repay his loan, the college he attended bears \nno responsibility. Instead, the taxpayers take the loss.\n  Steve Eisman, profiled in the book ``The Big Short,'' has discussed \nthe similarities between the subprime mortgage industry and the for-\nprofit college industry. Some of his predictions are startling.\n  He estimates that over the next 10 years, former students of for-\nprofit colleges will owe $330 billion on defaulted loans and fees. \nGiven our current fiscal situation, that is not a cost we can bear.\n  Eisman believes that if we don't rein in this industry, we will face \nanother social disaster akin to the collapse of the housing industry. I \nhope that does not come to pass.\n  This is a situation that demands our attention.\n  Along with several of my colleagues in the House and Senate, I've \nasked the Government Accountability Office to review the quality of \nfor-profit colleges and make recommendations based on its findings.\n  I commend Senator Harkin for holding oversight hearings in his \ncommittee on this important issue, including a hearing this week on \nmarketing and recruitment by for-profit colleges. I look forward to \nworking with him on legislative action.\n  I also commend the administration and specifically the Department of \nEducation for their engagement on this issue.\n  Unfortunately for the taxpayer and for countless students, the \nprevious administration loosened many regulations that have made it \neasier for abuses to occur. I am pleased to see the current \nadministration back on the appropriate track. The Department of \nEducation has proposed a number of new regulations that will address \nsome of the abuses in the industry.\n  Several of my colleagues are working with me on the President's \nDeficit Reduction Commission. One of the principles guiding our work is \nnot just what we're spending, but how wisely.\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\n  Does it make sense for the Federal Government to send Pell grants to \nschools that are spending more of that money on marketing than on \neducation? Does it make sense for the Federal Government to guarantee \nloans to students who are given no realistic chance at the career they \nthink they are training for?\n  We need to look carefully at this trend in for-profit schools. If \nenrollment has increased by 225 percent over 10 years, while $4 billion \nin Federal dollars went to for-profit schools last year, and 40 percent \nof their students are defaulting on their loans . . . this may not make \nsense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6855-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6855-S6857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the death of Senator Robert Byrd is a \ntremendous loss to the Senate, the State of West Virginia, and the \nentire Nation. As the longest serving Member of Congress, his political \ncareer spanned multiple Presidencies, and he was a witness to countless \nAmerican advances and achievements. He has served his state and our \ncountry for more than half a century, and he will be greatly missed.\n  Senator Byrd embodied the history and traditions of the Senate, and \nhis incredible knowledge of our Constitution, Congress and the \nlegislative process benefited every Member who served alongside him. I \nmet with Senator Byrd when I was first elected to the Senate, and I \nwill be forever grateful for his generosity and willingness to assist \nhis colleagues.\n  I will always remember Senator Byrd as a committed public servant who \nwas deeply devoted to his State and his country. He was known as the \nconscience of the Senate for his dedication to the body's history, \nlegislative process and rules, serving as a principled legislator. He \nmade many sacrifices to give his life to public service, and we owe a \nlot to Senator Byrd for this reason. I am deeply saddened by his \npassing and know he will be missed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague \nwhose devotion to this body, and to this Nation, was personal, \nheartfelt and legendary. I am talking about none other than the senior \nsenator from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd's time on Earth was a life characterized by commitment. \nHe exemplified this rare quality through his 70-year marriage to his \nhigh school sweetheart Erma James Byrd. But this was far from the only \ndeep commitment in Senator Byrd's life. His dedication to the U.S. \nSenate was proved by his actions and his storied career. His life in \nthe Senate began in 1958 with a victory that included 59 percent of the \nvote, the smallest margin of victory in Senator Byrd's half century-\nplus career. During his 57 years in Congress, Byrd worked with 12 \nfuture Presidents. He was known for telling his colleagues that he did \nnot serve under any Presidents, but alongside them.\n  In Senator Byrd's portrait in the Old Senate Chamber, his image is \nsurrounded by his wife, the Bible, and the U.S. Constitution. This is \nonly fitting, considering that Senator Byrd used references from the \nBible and the U.S. Constitution in many of his speeches and in his \neveryday dealings with fellow lawmakers. In a speech by Senator Byrd on \nOctober 13, 1989, he said, ``The Constitution is the old landmark which \nthey have set. And if we do not rise to the call of the moment and take \na stand, take a strong stand, against our own personal interests or \nagainst party interests, and stand for the Constitution, then how might \nwe face our children and grandchildren when they ask of us as Caesar \ndid to the centurion, `How do we fare today?' and the centurion \nreplied, You will be victorious. As for myself, whether I live or die, \ntonight I shall have earned the praise of Caesar.' ''\n  I can say that Senator Byrd is deserving of the praise of West \nVirginians, and, indeed, all Americans, for his devotion to the Senate \nand to our Nation. He will be missed by his colleagues, and we are \ngrateful for his life's work.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, no Senator has ever loved the institution \nof the U.S. Senate more than Senator Robert Byrd. I firmly believe \nthat. He truly believed that the upper Chamber of Congress was the \ngreatest deliberative body on Earth and he always strived to preserve \nits traditions and history for the generations to come as well as being \nthe Senate's foremost instructor on Senate procedure and process.\n  I was able to be a ``student'' of Senator Byrd's instruction when we \nworked together in 2005 to preserve Senate rule XXII, commonly known as \nthe ``filibuster.'' Senator Byrd joined with me, along with six other \nRepublican Senators and six Democrat Senators to form what became the \n``Gang of 14.'' During the meetings between these 14 Members, which \nwere often held in my office, I fondly recall the silence that would \novercome the room when Senator Byrd spoke about the history of the \nfilibuster and the rights of the minority in the Senate. It is not \noften that 13 members of the Senate are quiet for any given period of \ntime. But Senator Byrd's stature and intellect brought the room to a \nstandstill.\n  Senator Byrd is remembered for being a strong majority leader and \nminority leader for his party. But as he reminded all of us during \nthose meetings in my office, when he served as majority leader during \nPresident Reagan's time in office, Senator Byrd did not lead his \nDemocratic caucus to filibuster any of President Reagan's judicial \nnominees. That was a different time with different leaders, but Senator \nByrd's actions reflect his sincere desire for statesmanship and his \nrespect for the President's nominees. His speech on the Senate floor in \n2005 regarding the filibuster reflected this desire when he said:\n\n       I rise today to make a request of my fellow Senators. In so \n     doing, I reach out to all Senators on both sides of the \n     aisle, respectful of the institution of the Senate and of the \n     opinions of all Senators, respectful of the institution of \n     the Presidency as well. I ask each Senator to pause for a \n     moment and reflect seriously on the role of the Senate as it \n     has existed now for 217 years, and on the role that it will \n     play in the future if the so-called nuclear option or the so-\n     called constitutional option--one in the same--is invoked. I \n     implore Senators to step back--step back, step back, step \n     back--from the precipice. Step back away from the cameras and \n     the commentators and contemplate the circumstances in which \n     we find ourselves. Things are not right, and the American \n     people know that things are not right. The political \n     discourse in our country has become so distorted, so \n     unpleasant, so strident, so unbelievable . . .\n\n  He was not only a leader in 2005 against removing the judicial \nfilibuster rule, he was a life-long leader in the Senate against \nallowing Senators to issue secret holds. His motives were noble, and he \nfought for its elimination until the end. In his final speech, entered \ninto the Record but not delivered, he defended an individual Senator's \nright to block legislation in secret. ``Our Founding Fathers intended \nthe Senate,'' he lectured colleagues last month in one of his last \nappearances, to have ``unlimited debate and the protection of minority \nrights.''\n  Senator Byrd's respect for Senate rules and procedure were second \nonly to his defense and passion for the Constitution. Because of his \nleadership, we were able to establish September 17 as Constitution Day. \nNow, annually, students across the country will learn about and \ncelebrate the document that governs our Nation and hopefully understand \nthe significance of this unparalleled document that has established \nfreedom and sovereignty of our citizens for hundreds of years.\n  Senator Byrd spent practically all of his adult life serving the \nAmerican people for which we are all grateful. Even when he disagreed \nwith his peers in the Senate, he respected their intellect and views. I \nam honored to have served beside him. He once said, ``On the great \nissues, the Senate has always been blessed with senators who were able \nto rise above party and consider first and foremost the national \ninterest.'' I agree and hope the Senate continues to attract candidates \nwho will rise above politics for the good of our country and who will \nappreciate the history of the institution as Senator Byrd did.\n  Senator Byrd gave his life to the service of his country and the \nSenate and the Nation will miss him and the important leadership and \nsense of history that he brought to this body every day.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I would like to add to the heartfelt \nsentiments we have heard expressed by many colleagues and many more\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\naround the country over these past several weeks in paying tribute to \nour departed colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  As an American, pondering what Senator Byrd has done, the history he \nhas been a part of, and the path he took from the small towns of \nsouthern West Virginia's coalfields, is inspiring. From the perspective \nof a new Senator, I must say that the life and career of Senator Byrd \nis more than a little daunting. I have served just shy of 20 months, \nand I have voted in this Chamber slightly more than 600 times.\n  Those numbers seem like rounding errors compared to the numbers we \nhave heard over the last several days in reference to the service of \nSenator Byrd: Elected to nine full terms, more than 51 years in the \nSenate--more than 4 years longer than the next longest serving Senator; \nhe cast nearly 19,000 votes, 18,689, including 4,705 consecutive votes; \nhe was twice majority leader; served also as Whip, conference \nsecretary, minority leader, and President pro tempore; and he served on \nthe Appropriations Committee continuously since being placed there in \n1959 by then-majority leader Lyndon Johnson as a freshman in this \nbody--more than 3 years before I was born and only about 2 weeks after \nAlaska became a State.\n  I am told by colleagues who served longer with Senator Byrd that \nwhile he was proud of those facts, the record he cherished the most was \nthe time he spent with the love of his life, his childhood sweetheart \nand wife of 68 years, Erma. Senator Byrd was a man of deep faith, but \nfrom what I have heard of them as a couple, I do not doubt that all the \nglories of the afterlife pale for Senator Byrd compared to rejoining \nErma.\n  I came to the Senate too late to hear most of his greatest speeches, \nbut when he spoke, whether it was about a funding bill or the wars that \nwe continue to wage, you listened. We all felt a great sadness when \nSenator Kennedy died last year, but many of us probably came to \nappreciate the depth of the historical significance of his departure \nfrom this body months earlier when we heard and saw another of the \ngreat legislators in American history, Robert C. Byrd, weep openly and \nunabashedly as he paid tribute to his friend and colleague. My service \nwith Senator Byrd was nowhere as lengthy as his with Senator Kennedy, \nbut I am profoundly affected by the honor of knowing the man, even for \nthese past 2 years.\n  In the short time we did serve together, I have still been able to \nlearn from Senator Byrd. He was a statesman and a pillar of this \ninstitution, and a genuine historical figure that my son Jacob will \nlearn about in school. But the thing that I will take from watching \nSenator Byrd that showed every day that we served together was that \nnothing was more important than the work he did for the people of the \nState that sent him here. All of us look to the people of our States \nfor guidance on the matters of the day, and certainly Senator Byrd was \nattuned to the thoughts of the people of West Virginia. But there was \nmore to it than just knowing what the people of his State thought.\n  His whole career was about making West Virginia a better place, \nexpanding its infrastructure, educating its people, supporting its \nindustries, and providing the circumstances in which economic \ndevelopment could take root and flourish. Improving the lives of the \npeople of his State was what motivated Senator Byrd to come here almost \n19,000 times for votes on any number of issues.\n  As I think of the impact Senator Byrd's career has had on West \nVirginia, I cannot help but think of the similarities between our two \nStates. Alaska and West Virginia are both mostly rural, energy-\nproducing States with pockets of intractable poverty. It is a mark of \nrespect for his success at changing the world for the better that West \nVirginia has fewer poverty-stricken residents, and that remote regions \nof his state are less difficult to travel to and from than when Senator \nByrd was first elected to Congress. He was an ardent supporter of the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, ARC, which was created to help solve \nthe problems of poverty and hopelessness in his State by upgrading \ninsufficient public infrastructure, building and maintaining \neducational facilities, and providing access to public and private \nsector assistance to improve health care, foster economic development \nand diversity, and provide opportunities for the people of the region \nbeyond energy extraction and the few other traditional industries that \nexisted there.\n  It is no surprise that when my predecessor, Senator Ted Stevens, was \nlooking for a way to improve the lives of Alaskans, he saw in the ARC \nthat his close friend and colleague, Senator Byrd, had worked so hard \nto support a model for the Denali Commission that he believed could \ncreate similar hope and opportunity in our State. My colleagues and I \nin the Alaska congressional delegation today are just as dedicated to \nthe potential the Denali Commission represents for our State. We can \nonly hope to have as much positive impact on the lives of Alaskans as \nSenator Byrd had with those of the West Virginians he was so proud to \nrepresent.\n  I do not have as many great stories about Senator Byrd as many of our \nother colleagues, but I will close with observations about the man, \nhard at work doing what he knew was right for his people, which \ninspired me. As the Senate worked to reform the Nation's health care \nsystem last year, a number of votes were late at night or early in the \nmorning, and as many will remember, the weather last December was \nuncharacteristically cold and snowy. As an Alaskan and a relatively \nyoung man, getting to the Capitol during a blizzard was not a big \nordeal. Watching Senator Byrd, in his nineties and in obvious frail \nhealth, make his way to the Senate Chamber time and time again in his \nwheelchair, including for a final vote very early on the morning of \nChristmas Eve, was an inspiration. Seeing it then, and reflecting on it \nin the last several days, made me appreciate more fully the man's \ndedication to the people he served.\n  Every State deserves Senators with those motivations, and while I \nwill always marvel at the man's encyclopedic knowledge of the Senate \nand countless other things, the thing I will emulate about the life and \ncareer of Robert C. Byrd, for however long the voters of Alaska choose \nto have me as their Senator, is that my job is to make the lives of \nAlaskans better.\n  I believe Senator Byrd would approve.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, today I rise to speak \nabout our Nation's longest serving Senator who dedicated his life to \npublic service. Senator Byrd first came to the Senate the same year I \nwas born, 1959, and I took office just a few months before he passed \naway. Though I did not have the opportunity to know him well, each day \nI learn more of his legacy and his impact on what he referred to as the \nSecond Great Senate.\n  Robert Byrd was a staunch defender of the Constitution and the \ninstitution of the Senate. Many have told the story of how he carried \nhis pocket Constitution in his jacket wherever he went to remind us all \nof that document's importance in making the laws of today. His speeches \non the Senate floor were legendary and illustrated his devotion to the \nplace where he served for more than 50 years.\n  In his role as a Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd worked \ntirelessly to modernize his State and end its economic isolation. But \nhe did more than just serve his State. Robert Byrd's dedication to the \ncomplexity and the many traditions of the Senate was extraordinary. He \nwas passionately, and often solely, committed to the Founders' wise \nintent that the Senate was to remain a bulwark against the power of the \nPresidency.\n  Through relentless effort, dedication, and commitment, Robert Byrd \nrose from humble beginnings to become one of our Nation's most skilled \nlegislators. I thank him for his many years of public service in \nrepresenting West Virginia and our Nation. My thoughts and prayers go \nout to his family and friends as they mourn his great loss.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere \ncondolences following the passing of my friend and colleague, Senator \nRobert C. Byrd. This is obviously the end of an era. Senator Byrd has \nseen the landing of man on the Moon, the passage of the Civil Rights \nAct, the resignation of one President and the impeachment trial of \nanother, and countless other significant and historical landmarks \nduring his unparalleled Senate career.\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\n  Each of us has his or her own memories of Senator Byrd's kindness and \ndevotion to the Senate as an institution. The place will not be the \nsame without him.\n  My wife Joyce and I extend our deepest condolences to his daughters \nand the entire Byrd family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6857-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6857-S6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in Wyoming's 120 year history, only 21 \npeople have served as U.S. Senator for our State. One stands out as a \ncompassionate, skilled and illustrious figure. United States Senator \nAlan K. Simpson is a lifelong public servant who is dedicated to his \nfamily, to Wyoming, and to the United States.\n  Al Simpson has fought to uphold the values and ideals of our country \nfor most of his life. Whether he was serving in the U.S. Army in \nGermany, the Wyoming House of Representatives or in the U.S. Senate \nChamber, his commitment and contributions were evident. When the Nation \ncalls on Al Simpson to serve, he is always there to work and fight for \nour best interests.\n  United States Senator Alan K. Simpson served in this Chamber from \n1979 to 1997. Fortunately for Wyoming and our Nation, his service did \nnot end when he retired. He has enthusiastically served numerous groups \nand organizations, which all have benefitted from his presence. From \nhis beloved alma mater, the University of Wyoming, to the world \nrenowned Buffalo Bill Historical Center, Al Simpson devotes his time, \ntalent and treasure. When Al sees an unmet need in our community, he \nworks to see that it is addressed. Wyoming--and America--are better \nbecause of him.\n  This year, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming have selected \nAl Simpson as their Man of the Year. While Al has received many honors \nthroughout his life, to be honored by the Boys and Girls Clubs is very \nspecial to him.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming plays a vitally important \nrole in our State. They serve all youth regardless of economic \ncircumstances. They continue to expand thanks to the generous support \nof the McMurry Foundation, the Martin Family Foundation, the Daniels \nFund, the Casper Star Tribune and the Reader's Digest Foundation. Their \ninspiration and work has spread to adjacent counties.\n  The work of the Boys and Girls Clubs' dedicated staff and volunteers \ncreates a positive environment for all children. As a result of the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming, hundreds of Wyoming youth will \nhave the opportunity to gain the experiences and build the skills \nneeded for success. Their mission is the same as Al's--to make our \ncommunity and our Nation a better place.\n  This award is special to Senator Al Simpson because his life's \nsuccess is due in large part to the strength of his family. He lovingly \ncalled his mother Lorna `the velvet hammer.' His father Senator and \nGovernor Milward Simpson was Al's model for public service and civic \nleadership. His big brother Pete Simpson explains, ``The extent to \nwhich we became men we owe to our father.'' Even Pete helped mold Al \ninto the man who continues to have a positive impact on Wyoming and our \nNation. Al readily admits that he and Pete were a spirited duo and gave \ntheir parents heartburn. Certainly, Al would have benefitted from the \ninfluence of a Boys and Girls Club! However, he was fortunate that the \nstrong love and solid support of his parents carried him through a \ntumultuous adolescence.\n  It was Al's good fortune that Ann Schroll accepted his proposal for \nmarriage. Over the years, Ann has been a guiding force for Al. He \nregularly says he would not have accomplished anything without Ann by \nhis side.\n  Many years ago, in a high school commencement address, Al said, ``The \nreal reason I made it in life is because there were other people who \nbelieved in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. They were people \nwilling to give me a second chance. Those are the people I never forgot \nin life: parents, teachers, many people who took time with me, and for \nme. . . . `` Just like Al had folks who stood by him and held him \naccountable, the staff and volunteers at the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nCentral Wyoming believe in our youth. Al Simpson is a wonderful choice \nfor the 2010 Man of the Year award. He is thankful for the support he \nreceived as a youth and is committed to give all\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nyoung people in Wyoming a second chance.\n  It is because of his strong family values and his sense of duty to \nhis community that the Boys and Girls Clubs Man of the Year is so \nmeaningful to Al Simpson. This award tells this great statesman that \nWyoming is thankful for his leadership.\n  I am so proud to call Al Simpson my friend. He is a respected mentor \nand adviser. It is fitting and terrific that the Boys and Girls Clubs \nof Central Wyoming have named him Man of the Year--and I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in sending our congratulations to Al for this well-\ndeserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6859-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN EMILIO DADDARIO\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of former \nConnecticut Congressman Emilio Daddario who passed away on July 6, \n2010.\n  One of the unique strengths of the United States of America is that \nour government derives its power from the people. It is dependent upon \nan educated populace, engaged in public affairs, and prepared to offer \ntheir services to make our society better and fairer for all of our \nbenefit.\n  That system has worked well for more than 200 years thanks to \ncitizens such as Emilio Daddario.\n  He was born in Newton Center, MA, on September 24, 1918. As a young \nman, he moved south to Middletown, CT, to attend Wesleyan University \nwhere he starred on the baseball and football teams. He was an \nexemplary athlete who twice received MVP honors in football, and was \nnamed team captain in 1938.\n  Upon his graduation in 1939, Emilio chose to pursue a career in law. \nAfter beginning law school at Boston University, he graduated from the \nUniversity of Connecticut in 1942. He successfully passed the bar and \nmoved back to Middletown to begin private practice. But then the call \nto serve his country came.\n  In 1943, he enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army. He was sent to \nthe Mediterranean theater during World War II. There he was a key \nmember of the team which captured Rodolfo Graziani, then-chief of staff \nto Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini, at the Hotel Milan in 1945. His \ndistinguished service earned him the rank of captain, as well as the \nLegion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, and the Italian Medaglia d'Argento.\n  After the war, he could have easily gone back to private legal \npractice and no doubt would have been very successful at it. Instead, \nhe chose to continue his military service as a member of the \nConnecticut National Guard and to pursue a life in the public arena by \nrunning for mayor of Middletown.\n  At just 28 years old, fresh from his service overseas, Emilio \nDaddario won that election. He served as mayor from 1946 until 1948 and \nwas appointed judge of the Middletown Municipal Court.\n  In 1950, the Nation called on him again. This time, the 43 Division \nof the Connecticut National Guard, of which he was a member, was sent \nto engage in the Korean war. His military service in that conflict as a \nmember of the Far East Liaison Group earned him promotion to the rank \nof major.\n  Upon returning to the United States in 1952 he chose to resume \nprivate law practice, this time in Hartford, CT. But the call to serve \nproved to be too strong, and in 1958, Daddario ran for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Connecticut's 1st Congressional District.\n  He won that election, as well as five more, serving as a member of \nthe U.S. Congress until 1971. While in Congress, he sat on the House \nScience Committee where he became an advocate for science and \ntechnological innovation. He chaired two subcommittees and also in the \nplanning and development of the Apollo missions to the moon.\n  In 1970, Emilio decided not to run for reelection to the House, and \ninstead ran for Governor of Connecticut. He did not win that race. But \nhe sought ways to remain involved in public policy, in particular \nissues related to science and technology. He returned to Congress in \n1973, not as a member, but as the Director of the Office of Technology \nAssessment.\n  He also went on to serve as the president of the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science, and as cochair of the American Bar \nAssociation's Association for the Advancement of Sciences, Conference \nof Lawyers and Scientists.\n  Emilio Daddario was just the sort of American citizen that our \nNation's Founders were hoping for, and his legacy is one of exemplary \npublic service, and commitment to making our Nation a better place for \nfuture generations. He was a devoted husband and father, and I know \nthat he will be deeply missed. My deepest sympathies and prayers go out \nto his children, Richard, Anthony, and Stephen, and to the rest of his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6859-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6859-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               90TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN'S RIGHT TO VOTE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the 90th \nanniversary of women gaining the right to vote on August 26, 1920, and \nto acknowledge the celebration of this anniversary by the community of \nLas Cruces, NM.\n  The struggle for the right to vote began in 1848 at a convention in \nSeneca Falls, NY, hosted by Lucretia Mott, Mary Ann McClintock, and \nElizabeth Cady Stanton. This convention began the seventy-two year \nstruggle by women to win the right to vote, which was also a struggle \nto rise from second class citizenship and a struggle to gain equality. \nWomen throughout the United States are empowered by the efforts of the \nbrave and pioneering suffragists Susan B. Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt, \nand Alice Paul. These women serve as an inspiration to those who secure \nleadership positions in industry, government, the military, and \nacademia.\n  Las Cruces was founded in 1849 and became a town of the Territory of \nNew Mexico in 1907. After gaining the right to vote, the women of Las \nCruces sought elected office. These women include Bertha Paxton, who \nwas the first female elected to the New Mexico State House of \nRepresentatives in 1922, Mrs. E. C. Wade, who was the first female \nelected as a Trustee in the town of Las Cruces in 1932, Ellen Steele, \nwho was the first female elected as a New Mexico State Senator in 1985 \nfrom Dona Ana County and Dolores C. Archuleta who was the first Native \nAmerican female elected to the Las Cruces City Council in 2001. In \ncontinuation of this tradition, the first female Governor will be \nelected by New Mexicans on November 2, 2010.\n  To celebrate and commemorate the 90th anniversary of the ratification \nof the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, women will continue to \nadvocate for responsible and responsive government through the election \nprocess. The League of Women Voters of Greater Las Cruces will hold a \ncelebration with an informative panel on women's history of performance \nand films on the suffragists and the role of women in the political \nsystem to further commemorate this praiseworthy day.\n  I join with the League of Women Voters, the people of Las Cruces, and \nthe people of New Mexico in celebration of this important day, August \n26 when women finally won the right to vote and greatly enhanced their \ngreat contributions to our government and our society.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the 45th anniversary of the \nVoting Rights Act, a landmark piece of legislation which helped \nguarantee the right to vote to all Americans. As we approach the \nupcoming midterm elections, it is important to remember the journey of \nvoting rights in America. Without this right, words and phrases like \n``democracy,'' ``land of the free,'' and ``equality'' lack true \nmeaning.\n  The right to vote traveled a long ugly road--a road we must all \nremember. Edmund Burke once said ``those who do not remember history \nare destined to repeat it.'' Some would say they are doomed to repeat \nit. For this reason, on this day and every day, we should remember how \nAmericans, Black and White; young and old; men and women; stood, \nmarched and fought together for equal access to the voting booth. We \nmust ensure that all barriers to voting are removed.\n  There are many people who contributed to the voting rights movement. \nToday I would like to highlight one woman--Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, a \nwoman who was ``sick and tired of being sick and tired'' when it came \nto the denial of equal voting rights. Hamer, a great American hero, led \na\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nlife most people could not imagine today. Despite having polio and only \n4 months of schooling, Hamer became a matriarch of the voting rights \nmovement.\n  On August 31, 1962, Hamer decided to exercise her constitutional \nright to vote by traveling 26 miles in Mississippi to register only to \nbe confronted by the highway patrol and literary test requirements. \nAfter being denied her right to vote she didn't just sit down, she \nstood up and joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and \ntraveled all across the country speaking and registering other people \nto vote.\n  Hamer also helped organize ``Freedom Summer'' in 1964. She and \nthousands of civil rights supporters, many of them White college \nstudents, traveled to Mississippi and other Southern States to try to \nend the long time political disenfranchisement of African Americans in \nthe region. Despite these nonviolent efforts for equality, on the very \nfirst day of Freedom Summer, three volunteers were brutally murdered. \nAs America continued to march toward equality the Nation and its \npolitical leaders began to realize the horrific battle being waged \nagainst African Americans seeking equal treatment under the law.\n  As violence and frustration mounted, President Johnson pushed \nCongress to act and pass voting rights legislation. After research, \nmultiple hearings and the longest filibuster in Senate history, \nCongress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This bill provided all \nAmericans--regardless of color--with nationwide protections against \nbarriers and access to the voting booth. It contained protections \nagainst systematic methods of disenfranchisement by States and \nlocalities. Since its enactment, Congress has reauthorized the landmark \nlegislation in an effort to remain vigilant against any forms of \ndisenfranchisement.\n  In 2006, when Congress last took up reauthorization of this \nlegislation, civil rights leader Congressman John Lewis said, ``forty-\none years ago I gave a little blood on that bridge. So when I see \nwhat's happening in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, it's a beginning of \nan effort not only to violate the letter but the spirit of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965. And that must not be allowed to happen.'' With \noverwhelming bipartisan support, the House of Representatives passed \nthe bill by a vote of 390-33 and the U.S. Senate passed the bill by a \nvote of 98-0.\n  Despite the bipartisan support and a large array of evidence \ndemonstrating the continuing need for this legislation, some have \nargued that this legislation is no longer warranted. To those people, I \nsay you are wrong. I have seen examples in my own State that prove how \nnecessary this legislation is today. During my Senate campaign, just 4 \nyears ago--the very same time the Congress was providing near unanimous \nsupport for the Voting Rights Act--I had the unfortunate experience of \nwitnessing deceptive practices and tactics used to undermine the \nconstitutional right to vote. Lines were inexplicably longer and slower \nat polling locations in African-American districts and not simply \nbecause there were more people voting. Phone calls were made to \nminority districts reminding them to vote on Wednesday, not Tuesday; \nand a fraudulent sample ballot was targeted to confuse minority voters. \nI remind you that this was in 2006, not 1956.\n  Just two years later, in the 2008 election, substantial barriers were \nimplemented making it difficult for eligible voters to vote. These \nincluded the purging of voter rolls, misleading voter information and \nvoter intimidation. Take for example, an election administrator in \nMississippi improperly purging approximately 10,000 voters from the \nrolls from her home computer; or the local prosecutor in Ohio who \nrequested via subpoena personal information for 40 percent of voters \nwho had registered during the same day registration and voting period \nin the State. These are real examples of incidents occurring today--45 \nyears after we passed the Voting Rights Act.\n  Despite attempts to ignore or chip away at the protections provided \nto all Americans by the Voting Rights Act, this legislation remains \nrelevant and provides the most significant and essential tool in \nensuring continuity and the integrity of our democratic system. Our \nformer colleague Ted Kennedy once said we need to ``seek the reign of \njustice in which voting rights and equal protection of the law will \neverywhere be enjoyed.'' On this 45th anniversary of the Voting Rights \nAct, I urge my colleagues to continue their bipartisan support for this \ncritical legislation and for equal access to the voting booth for all.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe women of America to recognize, honor, and celebrate the 90th \nanniversary of their voting rights on August 26, 2010--Women's Equality \nDay. I know my colleagues join me, in acknowledging the tremendous \ncontributions women have made to America and the historic significance \nof reaching this milestone in women's history.\n  The 72-year struggle of suffragists, from the first women's rights \nconvention held in Seneca Falls, NY, in July 1848 to the passage of the \n19th amendment of the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920, bears \nwitness to the sacrifice and dedication of the leaders of the early \nwomen's rights movement who never wavered from their intent to reach \nthe goal of full enfranchisement.\n  We must thank Elizabeth Cady Stanton, born in 1815 in Johnstown, NY, \nwho organized the first women's rights convention with Lucretia Mott \nand other courageous women in 1848. Their early advocacy for voting \nrights, protection from domestic violence, the right to own property, \nand other social reforms that promoted equality are what we continue to \nsupport for women today. The ``Declaration of Sentiments'' speech Mrs. \nStanton delivered at that July convention called for ``all men and \nwomen'' to be recognized as created equal under the law. Her celebrated \n50-year partnership that began in 1851 with Susan B. Anthony brought to \nthe public consciousness the importance of equality rights for women. \nThat is a sacred trust we must continue to support.\n  On August 26, 1970--the 50th anniversary--the National Organization \nof Women, NOW, called upon women nationwide to strike for equality in \nprotest of the fact that women still did not have equal rights, 40 \nyears after passage of the 19th amendment. In New York City, 50,000 \nwomen marched down Fifth Avenue to demonstrate in support of the \nwomen's movement and securing equality rights, as did women in 40 other \ncities across America that day. U.S. Representative Bella Abzug \naddressed the NYC crowd and was instrumental in getting Congress in \n1971 to officially recognize August 26 as Women's Equality Day.\n  In 1776, Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams, sent an urgent message to \nher husband, who was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, \nstating: ``In the new Code of Laws, I desire you would remember the \nladies.'' It took 144 years for women's equality rights to be \nsanctioned by Congress, and I ask, Mr. President, that we take this \nopportunity on August 26, 2010, to honor this 90th anniversary and the \nremarkable contributions women have made to this country. The American \npeople owe a debt of gratitude to the early suffragists for remaining \nsteadfast in the face of overwhelming opposition in advocacy on behalf \nof the equality rights for all American citizens that our Constitution \nsupports today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6860-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6860-S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SECURE AND RESPONSIBLE DRUG DISPOSAL ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support \nin passing S. 3397, the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act by \nunanimous consent this week. I thank the Senate cosponsors of this \nbill--Senator Grassley, Senator Brown of Ohio, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Collins, Senator Corker, Senator Feingold, Senator Kohl, \nSenator Schumer and Senator Durbin. I especially thank my lead \ncosponsor, Senator Cornyn, and his counsel Gustav Eyler for their \nsignificant efforts on behalf of this important legislation.\n  When the Drug Enforcement Administration brought this issue to my \nattention, I was eager to work on it because this is such a commonsense \nbill.\n  We know that prescription drug abuse is on the rise and what is even \nscarier is that it is on the rise among teenagers. In fact, teens abuse \nprescription drugs more than any illicit drug\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\nbesides marijuana. And according to the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, 55 percent of teens say that it is easy to get prescription \ndrugs from their parents' medicine cabinets. We also know that up to 17 \npercent of all prescription drug medication goes unused each year.\n  This bill is an important step towards getting unused, unwanted or \nexpired medication off families' shelves and into the hands of proper \nauthorities. The bill makes it possible for State and local law \nenforcement ``take-back'' programs to accept controlled substances as \nwell, which is something that is currently very difficult for them to \ndo. I introduced this legislation because I believe we have to give \nfamilies a better option than either leaving dangerous medication in \ntheir homes or flushing such medication into the water supply.\n  Parents know that keeping unwanted prescription drugs in their homes \nincreases the risk that young people will find them, but current law \nprovides them with few alternatives. By making it easier for people to \ndispose of controlled substances they no longer need, we can reduce \nteens' access to these drugs and help curb teen drug abuse. This bill \namends the Controlled Substances Act to allow the Attorney General to \ndraft regulations permitting authorized entities to accept and dispose \nof controlled substances. These regulations will enable state, local, \nand private entities to operate drug take-back programs for all \nprescription drugs, while taking the necessary steps to prevent \nunlawful diversion and promote safe disposal.\n  Senator Cornyn recounts with great specificity the provisions of this \nbill that were added after consultation with many of our House \ncolleagues and their staffs. I want to mention those members whose \ncontributions to this bill have improved it greatly: Representatives \nHenry Waxman, Joe Barton, Jay Inslee, Bart Stupak, and Lamar Smith. I \nam grateful to their offices for working with us to get this bill to a \nplace where it could obtain the unanimous support of the U.S. Senate, \nand I second Senator Cornyn's comments about the specific contributions \nof each of those individuals and their offices.\n  The provisions that we added after collaboration with House offices, \nalong with the bill's ``no cost'' estimate from the Congressional \nBudget Office, are among the many reasons the bill enjoys the support \nof 41 State attorneys general, the Department of Justice, and the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores. They also prove that this \nbill is bicameral in its design, as well as bipartisan.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues again for their support.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to thank and congratulate my \ncolleagues for passing the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act by \nunanimous consent. I am proud to have worked closely with Senator \nKlobuchar to draft and introduce the bill, and I thank her and her \nchief counsel, Paige Herwig, for their ideas and advocacy of \ncommonsense drug disposal solutions.\n  The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act will make a cost-free \nchange to the Controlled Substances Act to permit State and private \nentities to accept unused controlled substances through drug take-back \nprograms. As the Senate unanimously recognized, the Secure and \nResponsible Drug Disposal Act is necessary because up to 17 percent of \nprescribed medication goes unused every year.\n  State, local, and private entities already have established drug \ntake-back programs to keep some of this unwanted medication away from \nchildren and drug abusers. But the Federal Controlled Substances Act, \nCSA, currently prevents these drug take-back programs from accepting \nthe most dangerous medications--controlled substances. The CSA \nparticularly prohibits people prescribed controlled substances from \ngiving them to any person or entity without express permission from the \nDrug Enforcement Administration. As a result, individual consumers and \nlong-term care facilities now either stockpile unwanted controlled \nsubstances or dispose of them in improper ways, such as flushing them \ninto the water supply. This can lead to drug diversion or water \npollution.\n  Diverted prescription drugs contributed to a 114-percent increase in \noverdose deaths involving prescription opioids between 2001 and 2005, \nand the number of treatment admissions for prescription opioids \nincreased 74 percent from 2002 to 2006. Troublingly, over one-third of \nnew prescription drug abusers are teenagers, who now abuse prescription \ndrugs more than any controlled substance except marijuana.\n  This bill will fix the problems of unwanted prescription drug \nstockpiling and improper disposal by amending the CSA to allow the \nAttorney General to draft regulations permitting authorized entities to \naccept and dispose of controlled substances. These regulations will \nenable state, local, and private entities to operate drug take-back \nprograms for all prescription drugs in a safe and effective manner \nconsistent with diversion controls.\n  In discussing how the bill will allow drug take-back programs to \naccept unwanted controlled substances, I want to highlight certain \nprovisions we added to the bill after collaborating with House \ncolleagues and their staff. First, in authorizing new drug disposal \nregulations, the bill makes clear that ``the Attorney General shall \ntake into consideration the public health and safety, as well as the \nease and cost of program implementation and participation by various \ncommunities.'' Representative Jay Inslee, who has been a strong \nadvocate for drug disposal programs, suggested this important \nprovision. It ensures that the planned drug disposal regulations will \ngive States and private entities wide latitude to design the most \neffective take-back programs for their communities. This includes \nconsidering the differences between rural and urban communities.\n  Second, the bill notes that the Attorney General's regulations ``may \nnot require any entity to establish or operate a delivery or disposal \nprogram.'' Representative Joe Barton, along with other members of the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, proposed this language to clarify \nthat no State, town, or business will have to run a drug take-back \nprogram unless they want to do so. This provision is a welcomed change \nfrom the type of unfunded mandates we so often see in Federal laws.\n  Third, the bill allows long-term care facilities to dispose of their \nresidents' medications, and it permits ``any person lawfully entitled \nto dispose of [a] decedent's property'' to deliver the decedent's \nunused medication for disposal. These common-sense provisions were \nadvanced by Representatives Bart Stupak, Henry Waxman, Lamar Smith, and \nother House members. They address the specific concerns of long-term \ncare facilities and the practical worries of anyone who loses a loved \none.\n  These collected provisions, along with the bill's ``no cost'' \nestimate from the Congressional Budget Office, are among the many \nreasons the bill enjoys the support of 41 State attorneys general, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the National Association of Chain Drug \nStores. They also prove that this bill is bicameral in its design, as \nwell as bipartisan.\n  By passing this bill, we have taken a major step toward getting \nunwanted prescription drugs out of medicine cabinets and off our \nstreets. We have given State, local, and private groups more authority \nto serve their communities, and we have done so in a cost-free manner.\n  I believe the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act exemplifies \nthe type of bipartisan legislation Congress should look to pass.

On August 14, Social Security will \nturn 75.\n  In a special Message to Congress in June 1934, President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt stated the promise of Social Security, saying:\n\n       If, as our Constitution tells us, our Federal Government \n     was established among other things, to promote the general \n     welfare,' it is our plain duty to provide for that security \n     upon which welfare depends.\n\n  President Roosevelt outlined his intention to ``undertake the great \ntask of\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\nfurthering the security of the citizen and his family through social \ninsurance.'' Executive Order 6757 created the committee on Economic \nSecurity, putting his plan into action. The committee included 5 \nCabinet-level officials and 21 government experts from several Federal \nagencies.\n  At the committee's 25th birthday celebration, Francis Perkins, who \nwas Secretary of Labor and member of the Committee on Economic \nSecurity, recounted the work of that committee. And she remembered an \nembarrassing oversight in the rush to create it--the committee had not \nbeen funded. But that was not going to stop its members. Relying on a \nsmall personal loan from one committee member, the committee hired \nunemployed stenographers and typists and recruited professionals and \nexperts to help out. They sent a telegram that stated:\n\n       We have no money. We can pay your railroad fare and your \n     expenses if you really need expenses while you are in \n     Washington, but there is no salary.\n\n  The response was huge. A team of great minds converged on Washington, \nDC, in the heat of August, long before air conditioning. They worked \ntirelessly. And about 6 months later, in early January 1935, they \npresented their committee report to the President. He, in turn, brought \nit to Congress.\n  Congress heard the call. Or perhaps Congress heard the voices of its \nconstituents. Or perhaps Members of Congress carried with them the \npictures of closed factories, desolate farms, and breadlines that \nweaved around city blocks. Unemployment topped 20 percent, and the \nhomeless population was growing.\n  In a 1962 speech, Francis Perkins described the backdrop of the \ncreation of Social Security:\n\n       People were so alarmed the specter of unemployment--of \n     starvation, of hunger, of the wandering boys, of the broken \n     homes, of the families separated while somebody went out to \n     look for work--stalked everywhere. The unpaid rent, the \n     eviction notices, the furniture and bedding on the sidewalk, \n     the old lady weeping over it, the children crying, the father \n     out looking for a truck to move their belongings himself to \n     his sister's flat or some relative's already overcrowded \n     tenement, or just sitting there bewilderedly waiting for some \n     charity officer to come and move him somewhere. I saw goods \n     stay on the sidewalk in front of the same house with the same \n     children weeping on top of the blankets for 3 days before \n     anybody came to relieve the situation!\n\n  Congress went to work. Committees held hearings, and a long list of \nindividuals and groups, charities, hospitals, industries, actuaries, \nhistorians, and interested citizens testified. There were debates and \narguments, compromises and drafts, more drafts and then more meetings \nand compromises. And then, 7 months later, on Wednesday, August 14, \n1935, at about 3:30 in the afternoon, President Roosevelt signed the \nSocial Security Act into law.\n  Upon the law's enactment, the President appointed a three-person \nSocial Security Board to run the new program. One of the Board's first \ndaunting tasks was to register employers and workers by January 1, \n1937, when workers would begin earning credits toward old-age insurance \nbenefits. The Board contracted with the Post Office to distribute \napplications, and numbers were assigned in local post offices. Long \nbefore computers, typists created each card in typing centers and \ndelivered it to Social Security's headquarters in Baltimore. Between \nNovember 1936 and June 1937, Social Security issued more than 30 \nmillion Social Security numbers through this manual process. By June \n30, 1937, Social Security had established 151 field offices, and these \nfield offices took over the task of assigning Social Security numbers.\n  Over the course of the next several decades, Social Security expanded \nto help more people secure themselves, as President Roosevelt said, \n``against the hazards and vicissitudes of life.'' In 1939, Congress \nbroadened the program to include payments to dependents and survivors \nof retirees. In 1956, Congress created the disability program and later \nexpanded the program to include benefits for dependents of disabled \nworkers.\n  The Social Security Act of 1965 created a new social insurance \nprogram called Medicare that extended health coverage to almost all \nAmericans aged 65 or older or receiving disability benefits.\n  In 1969, under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, Social \nSecurity began processing claims for disabled coal miners suffering \nfrom black lung disease and to their dependents or survivors.\n  Legislation passed in 1972 provided for automatic annual cost-of-\nliving allowances and created the Supplemental Security Income program. \nSSI, funded from general revenues, provides a small benefit to people \nwith limited income who have reached age 65 or are blind or disabled.\n  The Social Security Amendments of 1980 made many changes in the \ndisability program. Most focused on various work incentive provisions \nfor disability beneficiaries.\n  In the early 1980s, the Social Security program faced a financial \ncrisis. President Ronald Reagan appointed the Greenspan Commission to \nstudy the issues and make recommendations on how to sustain Social \nSecurity. In 1983, Congress enacted comprehensive changes in Social \nSecurity coverage, financing, and benefit structure.\n  On December 17, 1999, President Bill Clinton signed the ``Ticket to \nWork and Work Incentives Improvement Act,'' which placed greater \nemphasis on assisting beneficiaries in efforts to return to work.\n  In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act to give seniors extra help in paying \nfor prescription medications.\n  Throughout the years, Congress passed amendments, added programs, and \naddressed issues with Social Security. Presidents from both parties \nrepeatedly acknowledged Social Security's importance.\n  President Richard Nixon said, ``This Nation must not break faith with \nthose Americans who have a right to expect that Social Security \npayments will protect them and their families.''\n  A few years later, President Jimmy Carter said, ``The Social Security \nprogram represents our commitment as a society to the belief that \nworkers should not live in dread that a disability, death or old age \ncould leave them or their families destitute.''\n  Today, Social Security benefits are essential to the economic \nsecurity of millions of Americans. An estimated 159 million workers, or \nabout 94 percent of all workers, are covered under Social Security. \nSocial Security is critical, as 52 percent of the workforce has no \nprivate pension coverage, and 31 percent has no savings set aside for \nretirement.\n  In 2009, nearly 51 million Americans received a total of $672 billion \nin Social Security benefits. In Montana, 181,000 of our 975,000 \nresidents or about 19 percent of all Montanans receive Social Security \nbenefits. The payments were modest, with the average retiree receiving \nabout $14,000 annually. The average monthly benefit for a disabled \nbeneficiary was about $1,060.\n  Virginia Reno, vice president for Income Security from the National \nAcademy of Social Insurance testified before the Subcommittee on Social \nSecurity: ``If seniors had to count on only their income other than \nSocial Security, almost one out of two would be living in poverty.''\n  Social Security is anchored by a promise between generations. But its \nsuccess has been due in large part to the vision and sincerity of its \ncreators and the ongoing commitment of its stewards, the public \ntrustees, Advisory Board members, Members of Congress and the \napproximately 70,000 employees who work for Social Security. As well, \nwe owe a debt to the thousands of dedicated employees who have worked \nfor Social Security since its inception. For those that have embodied \nthe agency's mission, ``to promote the economic security of the \nnation's people through compassionate and vigilant leadership in \nshaping and managing America's Social Security programs,'' we owe a big \nthank you.\n  Social Security's success was not built with the stroke of a pen. \nSocial Security did not simply survive for 75 years. Rather, Social \nSecurity was built by embracing the promise of assisting people through \nlife's hazards.\n  In a campaign speech in 1944, President Roosevelt said, ``The future \nof America, like its past, must be made by deeds--not words.'' Social \nSecurity is the embodiment of many good deeds. In times of crisis, over \nand over again, Social Security has risen to the challenge.\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n  Fifteen years ago, a bomb in Oklahoma City took the life of fifteen \nSocial Security employees, one office volunteer, and 21 office \nvisitors. Social Security employees across the country responded to \nhelp survivors and the families of victims. Employees from around the \ncountry converged on Oklahoma to assist taking claims, answering \nquestions, and providing comfort to the hundreds of victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Following the devastation of September 11, 2001, employees in the New \nYork region immediately came to the assistance of families of those \nkilled in the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, and at the plane \ncrash site in Pennsylvania, so that claims could be taken and paid as \nquickly as possible. Social Security allowed payment of survivors' \nclaims with airline manifests or employer records rather than death \ncertificates. Within days, Social Security launched a full-scale \noutreach effort to find families of victims and help them apply for \nbenefits. A special Web page was set up. Public information spots aired \non television. And Social Security contacted about 60 consulates to \nensure that foreign survivors who might be eligible for benefits were \nreached.\n  By December 2001, Social Security had taken more than 5,000 disaster-\nrelated claims. Social Security set up Family Assistance Centers at \nPier 94 in Manhattan and Liberty State Park in New Jersey. The New York \nRegional Commissioner continued to work with the Bureau of Vital \nStatistics to post death certificates for the survivors of victims \nwhose bodies had not been recovered.\n  Social Security was also one of the first agencies at the Pentagon \nFamily Assistance Center in Virginia offering assistance to victims and \ntheir families. In Pennsylvania, Social Security staff assisted family \nmembers of victims on applying for benefits.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Social Security moved quickly \nto ensure that monthly payments to beneficiaries continued \nuninterrupted. Immediate payment procedures allowed for on-the-spot \npayments if beneficiaries could not get their benefit check. Social \nSecurity opened a temporary office in the Houston Astrodome, and \nprovided service 7 days a week. Social Security employees were on site \nat FEMA's Family Assistance Centers, and many offices offered extended \nhours of service through Labor Day weekend to help evacuees.\n  Just recently, in my home State of Montana, in the old city hall \nbuilding next to the Libby Police Department in Lincoln County, eight \nemployees from Social Security arrived. They quickly set up a \nprocessing center to assist the victims of the Environmental Protection \nAgency's first-ever public health emergency. The Social Security \nemployees tirelessly answered questions and handled a steady stream of \nclaims from applicants diagnosed with asbestos-related disease. Social \nSecurity's work helping the good people in and around Libby Montana was \ndeeply important to me.\n  Social Security has been described as the bedrock of our industrial \nsociety. It has been called the beacon of light for those on life's \nstormy seas. It has been called a pillar of our democracy. Social \nSecurity offers Americans peace of mind.\n  Social Security has lived up to its message. It has stood as a silent \npartner to those in need. It has done all this by sending about 99 \npercent of its annual budget back to the people as benefit payments. \nOnly about 1 percent of Social Security's budget goes toward \nadministrative expenses. The rest fulfills the promise of its mission.\n  Social Security can and should work for the next 75 years, and for \ngenerations beyond that. Now that Social Security is here, now that \nSocial Security has proven itself, it is up to all of us to protect and \nmaintain it. It is up to us to assure the millions of Americans that \ncurrently rely on Social Security and the millions more who pay into it \nthat Social Security is a promise that we can and will keep.\n  In the words of Carl Sandburg, ``In these times you have to be an \noptimist to open your eyes when you awake in the morning.'' Our \noptimism can be found in the accomplishments of Social Security. I \ncelebrate its 75th birthday.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, next week our Nation celebrates the 75th \nanniversary of Social Security, a vital program that has provided \ncomfort and security for millions of Americans through the years.\n  During my career in the Senate, I have fought to protect Social \nSecurity benefits for our Arkansas seniors. I believe in the promise \nour government made to working Americans--that if we work hard, Social \nSecurity will be there to help us in our golden years. Social Security \nhas made a healthy and secure retirement possible for tens of millions \nof Americans, including my own mother.\n  Since its inception, Social Security has helped provide stability for \nArkansans who otherwise may not have had an income at all.\n  When President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law on August \n14, 1935, he said:\n\n       The civilization of the past hundred years, with its \n     startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to \n     make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what \n     would be their lot when they came to old age. The man with a \n     job has wondered how long the job would last. This law, too, \n     represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built \n     but is by no means complete. It is, in short, a law that will \n     take care of human needs and at the same time provide the \n     United States an economic structure of vastly greater \n     soundness.\n\n  More than 600,000 Arkansans are enrolled in Social Security, and I am \nproud of my work on their behalf. Last year, I pushed for relief for \nArkansas's beneficiaries who would not receive cost-of-living \nadjustments because of the economy. I have consistently opposed \nattempts to privatize Social Security, and I do not support a reduction \nin Social Security's current guaranteed benefits.\n  I have met with Arkansans from all four corners of the State to hear \ntheir concerns about Social Security. I believe that providing adequate \nresources for the Social Security Administration is a crucial first \nstep toward strengthening this vital program. As the baby boom \ngeneration enters retirement, we will be asking more of the Social \nSecurity Administration's services, and we must work to make certain \nthe trust funds are well maintained.\n  As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of Social Security, I remain \ncommitted to protecting Social Security benefits for Arkansans and all \nAmericans. I will continue to use my position as the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Social Security to fight to ensure seniors \nreceive the benefits they have earned and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6863-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6863-S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ALCOHOL REGULATORY EFFECTIVENESS ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to bring the attention of the \nSenate to a recent joint resolution passed by the California State \nLegislature. This resolution, S.J. Res. 34, urges Congress to defeat \nthe Comprehensive Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness Act of 2010, H.R. \n5034, a bill that would restrict legal challenges to unconstitutional \nalcohol regulation laws and negatively impact the American wine \nindustry.\n  This bill is being described by its proponents as an effort to \npromote regulation of alcohol and protect the public from dangerous \neffects. What the bill does instead, however, is to erect new legal \nbarriers which give preference to in-State beer, wine, and spirits \nwholesalers at the expense of free and open competition. With its broad \nsweep, the bill cedes Federal authority over licensing, labeling, \nadvertising, taxation policy and other matters.\n  Under current Federal law, each and every State has authority to set \nits own law regarding the direct shipment of alcohol. A State can allow \ndirect shipments to consumers, or a State can prohibit it. What a State \ncannot do, however, is to allow in-State producers to ship directly to \nconsumers while barring out-of-State producers from doing so. This is a \nconstitutional requirement, stated most recently in the case of \nGranholm v. Heald.\n  The House bill could not constitutionally alter this system. Instead, \nit would erect new legal barriers that would make it more difficult for \nout-of-State producers to enforce their rights to equal treatment under \nState laws.\n  I am very proud to say that my State of California is the fourth \nlargest wine-producing region in the world. Our wine industry creates \nmore than 330,000\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\njobs and contributes $61.5 billion to the States economy each year.\n  We are not, however, alone. Nationwide, the coast-to-coast wine \nindustry, active in all 50 States, has an economic impact of some $122 \nbillion annually.\n  And, in fact, 37 States and the District of Columbia currently allow \ndirect shipment of wine from winemakers to consumers. Such laws \nincrease choice for consumers. They also keep small wineries in \nbusiness as wholesalers grow increasingly consolidated, offering less \nselection and squeezing out producers in the process.\n  As the joint resolution passed Monday, August 2, 2010, makes evident, \nH.R. 5034 threatens serious harm to winemakers in California and across \nthe country, as well as to consumers and competition in these markets. \nShould it be introduced in the Senate or passed by the House, I will \noppose it and will urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6864-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TIBETAN REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to call attention to language in \nSenate Report 111-237 accompanying the fiscal year 2011 Department of \nState, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill, \nwhich passed out of the Appropriations Committee on July 29, 2010.\n  That language notes the committee's concern with recent events in \nNepal, where Tibetan refugees have been forcibly turned over to Chinese \nborder police. This contradicts Nepal's long and generous history of \nproviding safe passage for Tibetans on route to India, and it is \ninconsistent with international law. In the past, Nepal has provided \nsafe haven, and the United States, the United Nations, and other donors \nhave provided the funds necessary to care for these people in transit.\n  This is a matter of grave concern to the Congress and to people \neverywhere who know of the danger of arrest and imprisonment and the \nphysical hardships Tibetans face, fleeing their homeland by crossing \nthe Himalayas with little more than the clothes on their backs. I hope \nthe Nepali Government will take note of the committee's concern and \ntake immediate steps to reaffirm its policy of permitting Tibetan \nrefugees to travel safely to India.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this language in Report 111-237 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``Tibetan Refugees.--The Committee is concerned with recent \n     actions by the Government of Nepal to prevent safe passage \n     for Tibetan refugees, including reports that some fleeing \n     Tibetans have been turned over to Chinese border authorities. \n     The Committee urges the Government of Nepal to reaffirm its \n     long tradition of permitting Tibetans to safely transit \n     Nepal, and continues to support assistance for these refugees \n     as well as Tibetans who have resettled in India.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6864-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6864-S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram turns 13. But instead of facing the difficulties of \nadolescence, CHIP is enjoying the advantages that come with being one \nof the most popular programs in the country.\n  I would like to take this moment to reflect on the history of CHIP \nand to think about the role that CHIP will play in the future.\n  Prior to 1997, kids of the working poor had nowhere to go to get \nhealth insurance. Their parents' employers didn't offer health \ninsurance benefits, and the individual market offered only low-quality \ninsurance options at unaffordable prices.\n  Without health insurance, kids couldn't see the doctor for a checkup, \ncouldn't get a prescription for an earache, and couldn't get treatment \nfor common chronic conditions like asthma. Unhealthy kids can't run and \nplay, can't do well in school, and can't grow into healthy and \nproductive adults.\n  In 1997, Congress took action to address this problem by establishing \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. And today, we celebrate 13 \nyears of success--expanding high quality coverage to kids all across \nthe country.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of CHIP's history--its \nbipartisan roots and its tremendous success in achieving what we \ncreated the program to do: cover low-income, uninsured kids.\n  Congress enacted the Children's Health Insurance Program as a \nbipartisan compromise back in 1997, with leadership from Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Hatch, and the late Senators Kennedy and Chafee. \nAt that time, Members of Congress wanted to address the rising number \nof children without health insurance.\n  The Finance Committee reached a compromise that allowed States to set \nup Children's Health Insurance Programs that would meet their unique \nneeds. CHIP is optional for States, but within just 2 years of its \ncreation, all States decided to participate to address the health care \nneeds of our country's most vulnerable children.\n  I am proud to have helped write and pass CHIP 13 years ago. It has \nbeen a tremendous success.\n  In its first decade, CHIP cut the number of uninsured children by \nmore than a third. Today, more than 7\\1/2\\ million children get the \ndoctor's visits and medicines they need to have a healthy childhood, \nenabling them to become healthy and productive adults.\n  After 10 years of success, CHIP came up for reauthorization in 2007. \nIn the summer and fall of that year, Congress worked hard to pass a \nbipartisan reauthorization package. But President Bush vetoed it twice. \nUltimately, we had to settle for an extension.\n  In January of 2009, with two of our former colleagues in the White \nHouse, I was thrilled to get started on a CHIP reauthorization bill as \nsoon as possible. Finally, the stars had aligned--President Obama was \nlooking forward to signing the CHIP reauthorization bill, and the \nCongress was prepared to act. We were finally able to deliver what \nAmericans had asked for--reestablishing kids' coverage as a national \npriority.\n  President Obama signed the bill on February 4, 2009. The new law \nmaintained coverage for all children in the program at that time and \nstarted on a path to reach more than 4 million additional uninsured, \nlow-income kids.\n  We had a couple of goals in mind as we drafted the CHIP \nReauthorization Act of 2009.\n  We kept CHIP focused on low-income kids. We prioritized coverage of \nthe lowest-income kids, but without limiting State flexibility in \ndesigning CHIP programs. We set up parameters to transition adults out \nof CHIP and into Medicaid or other appropriate coverage. And we also \nencouraged States to improve their outreach practices and streamline \ntheir enrollment procedures in order to reach all eligible kids.\n  We maintained State flexibility. We gave States the option to cover \nlegal immigrant children and pregnant women during their first 5 years \nin America and receive the corresponding Federal match. We also created \na State option that allows States to designate CHIP funds to offer \npremium assistance, helping families afford private coverage offered by \nemployers or other sources.\n  And we improved the quality of care. The CHIP Reauthorization Act \nlaunched a substantial new initiative to improve children's health \nquality. This initiative invested $45 million a year for 5 years to \ndevelop national core measures for children's health quality, improve \ndata collection in CHIP and Medicaid, and promote the use of electronic \nhealth records.\n  The CHIP Reauthorization Act I helped to craft allowed us to cover as \nmany uninsured low-income kids as possible. I made sure that we \nrespected our budgetary limits, and made compromises in good faith with \nmy Republican colleagues. In committee, further compromises were made \nwhich I hope strengthened the act even more.\n  The only disappointment that came out of the 2009 CHIP \nReauthorization Act was that we weren't able to come to agreement with \nSenators Grassley and Hatch, two colleagues that worked tirelessly to \nreauthorize CHIP in 2007. But I'm proud to say that CHIP's bipartisan \nreputation has not been marred.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle continue to support CHIP and have \neven used it as a model for other programs. And I have continued to \nwork with Senator Grassley and all Senators on the Finance Committee \noverseeing the implementation of the CHIP Reauthorization Act.\n  A year and a half after enactment, more than half the States have \ntaken advantage of the new coverage options in the CHIP Reauthorization \nAct, including 15 States that expanded income\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\neligibility levels for CHIP or Medicaid to cover more kids. States have \nalso taken advantage of the enrollment simplification options--making \nit easier for kids to get enrolled and stay covered.\n  In health reform, we extended CHIP for an additional 2 years, \nensuring that kids will have a stable source of coverage as we expand \ncoverage to other groups. In 2015, Congress will revisit CHIP in a new \ncontext. CHIP has been instrumental in providing children with access \nto care where none existed before, but it may need to take on a \ndifferent role as health reform is implemented.\n  Whatever happens in 2015, I am confident that CHIP will continue to \nbe an important part of our health system. CHIP is tried and true, and \nthings just keep getting better and better in the program. As we \ncelebrate CHIP's 13th birthday, we can be proud of everything Congress \nhas done to provide low-income kids with high quality, affordable \ncoverage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6865-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FIRST RESPONDERS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to discuss a heart wrenching \ntragedy that occurred in my home State earlier this week and to \nacknowledge the heroic efforts of our local first responders. On Monday \nevening, under sweltering temperatures that had surpassed 100 degrees, \ntwo Shreveport families gathered on the banks of the Red River, in \nShreveport, LA, to enjoy a picnic. What is normally a routine summer \nouting for millions of people across America quickly turned into a \ndisaster.\n  Seven teenage children from these two families had wandered off into \nan unfamiliar part of the river. One of the children stepped off of a \nsand bar and into deeper, more dangerous water and began to scream for \nhelp. The other six children followed in an attempt to rescue the \ndrowning teen. None of the seven children knew how to swim, nor did the \nadults who were with them. As the seven children struggled for their \nlives against the treacherous waters of the Red River, witnesses called \n911 for help.\n  Teams of first responders from Shreveport and Bossier City were \ndispatched and arrived on the scene at 6:30 p.m., roughly 10 minutes \nafter the 911 call was made. Dive teams entered the water four at a \ntime in search of the drowning children. Despite the tremendous efforts \nof the divers, the river's waters claimed the lives of six of the seven \nchildren. The lone survivor was rescued by a bystander named \nChristopher Partlan, before the dive teams could get to the area.\n  At 7:51 p.m., the first of the victim's bodies was recovered from the \nwater. This unthinkable task continued for more than 2 hours before the \nlast of the victims was recovered at 10:02 p.m.\n  At this time, I would like to read the names of the first responders \nfrom Shreveport and Bossier City who were dispatched to this tragic \naccident:\n  Captain John Davis; Fire Engineer Craig Bynog; Firefighter Jared \nMourad; Firefighter Chad Alexander; Battalion Chief Tim Thames; and \nFire Engineer Jimmy Lockey of the Shreveport Fire Department. Officer \nPhillip Tucker of the Shreveport Police Department; Fire Driver Chad \nArnette of the Bossier City Fire Department; and Christopher Partlan, \nthe bystander who rescued 15-year-old DeKendrix Warner.\n  All these brave men deserve to be recognized for their heroism. First \nresponders in Shreveport and Bossier and in cities and towns across \nAmerica protect our communities every day. We depend on them during \nfires, floods and other disasters and they put their lives on the line \nto save ours. For that, we owe them a debt of honor and gratitude.\n  I would also like once again to send my condolences to the Warner and \nStewart families for their tragic loss. I know the Shreveport community \nwill wrap its arms around them and pray for them, comfort them and \nsupport them during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6865-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \nmatter involving the future of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  As you may know, TVA is led by a Board of Directors that consists of \nnine individuals appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. These board members serve for staggered 5-year terms.\n  For some time, it has been understood that each State within TVA's \nservice area should be represented on the board. This makes sense given \nTVA's diverse energy production and economic development activities, \nwhich affect communities in each State differently as do the \nAuthority's various power plants and dams.\n  Recognizing this, President Bush, in 2006, nominated to the board a \nfabulous individual from my State, Howard Thrailkill. The Senate \nconfirmed the nomination unanimously.\n  Mr. Thrailkill has undoubtedly served with distinction. He was \npresident of AdTran, a successful technology company in Huntsville, and \nhe brought to TVA a familiarity with the complexities of running a \nlarge organization.\n  Upon his confirmation, Mr. Thrailkill immersed himself in the \nfinancial records, business plans, and technical data surrounding TVA's \nmany functions. He became an expert on the organization in a way that \nmany board members do not. When he identified a poor performing project \nor a proposal with downsides, he was not afraid to say so. And he was \nespecially familiar with TVA's activities in North Alabama, where he \nlived.\n  Undoubtedly, Mr. Thrailkill's willingness to devote his personal time \nand energy to the position was of great benefit to both TVA and its \nAlabama customers.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Thrailkill's term on the Board is now nearing its \nend. I was dismayed to learn recently that President Obama apparently \nfailed to recognize the importance of this position to the people of \nAlabama, and had nominated an individual from another State to fill it.\n  This is no small matter. Of the seven States that make up TVA, \nAlabama is the second largest in terms of revenue, the second largest \nin terms of employees, and the third largest in terms of service area.\n  Also, Alabama is home to several important TVA facilities, such as \nGuntersville Hydroelectric Dam, Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, and the \nBellefonte facility--which could become one of the first new nuclear \npower plants in the country.\n  Seven States make up the TVA service area. There are nine seats on \nthe board. It is unacceptable that Alabama's long term representation \nbe put in jeopardy.\n  Accordingly, I have been forced to use my position in the Senate to \nblock the progress of these TVA nominations until this matter could be \nresolved.\n  I am pleased to inform the Senate today that after a series of \nconversations with the White House, we have reached an agreement that \nthe next opening on the board will be filled by a nominee from the \nState of Alabama.\n  That vacancy is expected in March of next year, and we have agreed to \nbegin in the next month discussing which individuals should be \nconsidered for this important position. I wish to thank the President \nand his staff for working with me on this compromise.\n  Senator Carper, who chairs the Environment and Public Works \nsubcommittee that considers TVA nominations, has also stated his \nwillingness to begin consideration of the Alabama nominee early to \nensure he or she is confirmed before the start of the term. I thank him \nfor that offer.\n  I am pleased we could reach an agreement on this issue, and I look \nforward to the Senate confirmation of an individual from my State who \nwill offer strong leadership to TVA in the coming years.\n  Accordingly, I am also pleased today to lift my hold on the \nnominations to the TVA Board that are currently pending in the Senate. \nI urge my colleagues to move quickly with the nominations to ensure \nthat the Board of Directors will have a quorum in August so that it may \neffectively conduct the business before it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6865-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6865-S6866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       1099 REPORTING REQUIREMENT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about a \nprovision in the new health care law that will impose monumental \nburdens on small businesses, reduce wages and eliminate jobs.\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n  A provision that was included in the new health care law will require \nbusinesses to submit new tax forms every time they purchase more than \n$600 worth of goods. This new government mandate will impose \nsignificant new costs on 26 million businesses across America.\n  Given the economic challenges that our Nation already faces, this is \na burden that we cannot afford. If it is not fixed, this new mandate \nwill slow economic growth and prevent the creation of new jobs. The \nCommerce Department reported last week that the pace of economic growth \nis slowing down. U.S. economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.4 \npercent in the second quarter, the weakest showing in nearly a year. \nAccording to the Labor Department, wages and salaries are also \nsuffering and the unemployment rate still hovers around 9.5 percent.\n  If these numbers are going to improve, it's going to be a result of \nthe hard work and ingenuity of our Nation's small business owners. The \nentrepreneurial small business community has been the driver to pull us \nout of all recent recessions. They are the key to job creation that \nwill pull us out of this economic downturn as well. Small businesses \ncreate 65 percent of all new jobs in America. In Wyoming, that number \nis a lot higher. We have 62,000 small businesses in Wyoming that employ \nnearly 70 percent of our workforce. We need to advance policies that \nencourage small businesses to grow and hire new workers.\n  Unfortunately, buried in the new healthcare law is a provision that \nwill have the opposite effect. It will cost every business, even the \nsmallest of the small, more money to file their taxes.\n  Because of the new healthcare law, beginning in 2012 businesses will \nhave to send new tax forms to the IRS for every business to business \ntransaction of $600 or more for both goods and services. This new \nrequirement creates a punishing new paperwork mandate for small \nbusinesses.\n  The new paperwork requirement means that a small business owner will \nhave to file two forms--one to the vendor and one to the IRS--for \nalmost every purchase his or her business makes. Imagine you're a \nfreelance writer and you buy a new laptop. Well, now you have to send \nForm 1099 to Apple and the IRS or, be labeled a tax cheat. Oh, and \nyou'll need Apple's Taxpayer Identification number too so don't forget \nto ask the salesman for that.\n  Complying with the tax code is already one of the most expensive \nburdens placed upon small businesses. According to the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, the typical small business pays \nas much as $74 per hour to prepare and file various tax-related \ndocuments. Because they cannot afford to have their own finance \ndepartments, the costs of complying with the Federal tax code are 66 \npercent higher for small businesses as compared to their larger \ncompetitors. The new healthcare law will significantly increase these \ntax burdens and the costs that come with them.\n  This new reporting requirement hits small businesses hardest because \nthey typically don't have in house accounting departments and have to \nhire outside help. Every penny a small business spends on these \nservices is money they can't spend on hiring new workers and expanding \ntheir business. Every hour a small business owner spends filling out \nthese new tax forms is time he or she is not making a sale, \nmanufacturing a product or working with a customer.\n  I understand the challenges this can create for a small business. \nBefore I came to the Senate, my wife and I started and owned several \nshoe stores back home. When you own a small business, you have to be \nthe CEO, the bookkeeper, the salesman and the person who empties the \ntrash and cleans the toilets.\n  Every hour that I spent filling out government-mandated paperwork, \nwas an hour I couldn't spend selling shoes. Government mandates, like \nthe new 1099 requirement, have a real cost, and it is small businesses \nwho end up having to pay them. The National Taxpayer Advocate, based \ninside the IRS, has already warned of the new reporting burden on small \nbusiness.\n  This new reporting requirement hurts small businesses at the same \ntime our economy needs them to help our recovery. Small businesses \nacross this country are still struggling to stay open. Rather than \nforcing these businesses to comply with burdensome new paperwork \nrequirements, we should be finding ways to encourage them to reinvest \ntheir money in growing their businesses and hiring more workers.\n  Our country has always relied on small businesses to grow the economy \nand create new jobs and they have always been the drivers to pull us \nout of economic downturns. Given the still difficult challenges facing \nour economy, the last thing we should be doing is piling on the \npaperwork that takes their time and precious resources away from \ncreating jobs.\n  I believe things like the 1099 requirement are causing our \nentrepreneurs to think twice about taking new risks for fear of more \ngovernment burdens and regulations. That's the worst thing Washington \nshould be doing right now. Instead, we need to be focused on creating \nan environment where small businesses can grow and aren't worried about \nwhat might be the next new burden thrown on them from Washington.\n  It seems like a reoccurring bad dream around Washington over the past \nfew years. Washington politicians tuck something into a giant bill \nthat's rammed through Congress without fully understanding the impact \nin the real world.\n  This 1099 reporting requirement is just one of the many things in the \nnew health law that need to be re-examined. Our small businesses need \nto be focused on creating jobs and helping our economy recover, not on \nnew paperwork burdens. When a business is considering making new long \nterm investments in employees or equipment, they shouldn't have to be \nworried about the next new wrinkle to be uncovered in the health reform \nlaw.\n  We can make a statement right now to America's small businesses that \nwe want you out there creating jobs, hiring new employees and growing \nyour business--not worrying about what Washington will require of you \nnext. Let's tell our small business men and women that we stand behind \nthem, not on top of their backs, and let's repeal this new tax \npaperwork burden.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nimportant to us all--the safety of our food. Food safety is not a \npartisan issue--we all want to be confident that the food we eat and \ngive to our children will not make us sick. That is why I have been \nworking with my colleagues in a bipartisan way to pass S. 510, the FDA \nFood Safety Modernization Act.\n  This bill goes a long way to bringing the regulation of food into the \n21st century. No longer will outdated laws hold the FDA back from \nprotecting us. This bill takes into account the changes in our food \nsupply over the more than 100 years since food safety authorities were \nfirst granted to the agency. This bill provides real consumer safety \nimprovements, while maintaining an appropriate balance between \nregulatory burden and food safety benefit.\n  I want to thank Senators Gregg, Burr, and Durbin for their hard work \nand leadership in developing and introducing this bill. Their efforts \nto ensure that this was a bipartisan process, starting from a blank \npiece of paper, were critical to seeing this bill move. I also commend \nSenator Harkin, the chairman of the HELP Committee, for prioritizing \nthis bill and moving it through committee.\n  We, along with Senator Dodd, have continued to work together over the \nlast few months, which resulted in only a few issues remaining to \ndebate on the floor. That kind of cooperation is what the American \npeople expect of us. It certainly wasn't easy at times, but this is how \nwe are supposed to legislate, and I am glad we met our obligations.\n  The House passed a food safety bill 1 year ago. There are significant \ndifferences between the House and Senate bills, and I hope we can bring \nthis bill to the Senate floor as soon as possible so that there is \nsufficient time to conference the two bills and see legislation signed \ninto law this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6866-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6866-S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAIR SENTENCING ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the enactment of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nFair Sentencing Act of 2010, S. 1789, which was signed into law on \nTuesday by President Obama. This reform, which significantly narrows \nthe sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to \n18:1, is a long overdue victory for a criminal justice system rooted in \nfundamental fairness.\n  I am all for tough antidrug laws, but those laws must also be fair. \nCurrent law is based on an unjustified distinction between crack \ncocaine and powder cocaine. The mere possession of 5 grams of crack--\nthe rough equivalent of five packets of sugar--carries the same \nsentence as the sale of 500 grams of powder cocaine.\n  As it turns out, this 100-to-1 disparity is unjustified by science. \nMoreover, it disproportionately affects African Americans who make up \nmore than 80 percent of those convicted of Federal crack offenses.\n  Law enforcement experts say that the disparity has undermined trust \nin the criminal justice system, particularly in minority communities.\n  Making this change a reality required leadership from the very top: \nfrom President Obama's personal involvement to great efforts by \nSenators Dick Durbin, Jeff Sessions, Orrin Hatch, and others. Achieving \nthis reform took significant political muscle and it took a continuing \neffort.\n  I especially want to note the Vice President's early and sustained \nleadership on this issue.\n  Back in 2002, when very few in this body wanted to touch this \npolitically toxic problem, then-Senator Biden held a hearing that \nexposed the need to reduce the crack-powder disparity. Particularly \nsignificant was his willingness to admit that he, and Congress \ngenerally, made a mistake when they created the distinction back in \n1986.\n  In June 2007, Senator Biden without any cosponsors on either side of \nthe aisle introduced the first Senate bill that would have equalized \nthe penalties for crack and powder cocaine without raising penalties \nfor powder. The introduction of this bill changed the entire landscape \nof the crack-powder debate. No longer was the question ``Should the \ndisparity be reduced?'' No longer was the debate about whether the \n100:1 disparity was reasonable. The Biden bill shifted the burden to \nthe naysayers to justify why 1:1 wasn't the right policy solution.\n  After Senator Biden assumed his duties as Vice President of the \nUnited States, Senator Durbin picked up the Senate torch and \nreintroduced the Biden bill. I was proud to join him as a cosponsor of \nS. 1789. He then worked closely with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to find a compromise that would both satisfy the needs of law \nenforcement and return fundamental fairness to the sentencing for these \nsorts of offenses.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention one more crucial participant \nin this long-running effort. As my colleagues in this body know, much \nof what we accomplish here on behalf of the American people is \ninfluenced greatly by our talented staff.\n  In this case, reducing the disparity between crack and powder \ncocaine--without increasing penalties for powder--would not likely have \nbeen achieved without the dedication of a very talented public servant, \nAlan Hoffman.\n  Alan, while serving as then-Senator Biden's chief of staff, delivered \none of the first pushes that started to roll this stone forward, and he \nkept at it for many years. It is undeniable that many had significant \nroles to play in this remarkable achievement. But it is equally \nundeniable that Alan's longstanding drive to right this wrong and shift \nthe policy debate fundamentally was crucial to our being able to \ncelebrate this accomplishment today.\n  As my colleagues know, I have spoken many times in the Senate about \nthe outstanding men and women who constitute our Federal workforce. \nAlan Hoffman has been a loyal and dedicated public servant who deserves \ncredit for his work today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6867-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6867-S6868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FINDINGS OF THE NTSB\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the findings of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board's final report on its \ninvestigation into the fatal June 22, 2009, Metrorail crash on the Red \nLine near Fort Totten.\n  This report is a call to action for Congress to pass legislation that \nwill help prevent such tragedies on our Nation's public transit systems \nfrom ever happening again.\n  Last week, the NTSB presented the findings of its year-long \ninvestigation into last year's Metrorail crash that killed eight \npassengers and the train's conductor nine total. The fatal accident \nalso hospitalized 52 passengers with serious injuries and left \napproximately 30 others with minor injuries.\n  The investigation concluded:\n\n       The cause of the crash was a series of faulty track \n     circuits that failed to detect the presence of a stopped \n     train on the right-of-way.\n       The severity of the accident was compounded by the poor \n     crashworthiness of the 30-plus year-old railcars involved in \n     the accident where most of the injuries and fatalities \n     occurred.\n       Lastly, NTSB determined that safety has not been a priority \n     for WMATA. Simply put, Metro lacks a ``Culture of Safety'' \n     throughout its entire organization.\n\n  NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman aptly put it in her statement regarding \nthe release of its findings: ``Metro was on a collision course long \nbefore this accident. The only question was when Metro would have \nanother accident--and of what magnitude.''\n  The root cause of the crash was a faulty track circuit that failed to \ndetect the presence of a train pulling into Fort Totten Station.\n  As a result, the system did not signal a second approaching train to \nhold at a safe distance on the track.\n  When working properly, the track circuits are designed to detect and \ntrace the presence of trains on the right-of-way. This effectively \nprevents two trains from occupying the same stretch of track at the \nsame time.\n  A particularly troubling finding of the NTSB's investigation is that \na 2005 ``near accident'' on the Orange and Blue lines' in the Potomac \nRiver tunnel coming into the Rosslyn Station was caused by an identical \ntrack circuit malfunction to the one that caused the June 22 crash.\n  In other words, Metro knew, from firsthand experience, about the \nserious risks track circuit failures present.\n  The NTSB concluded that if WMATA had taken a lesson from the 2005 \n``near accident'' at Rosslyn and made fixing the track circuit failures \nthroughout the system a priority, the June 22, 2009, tragedy would have \nbeen avoided entirely.\n  The second layer of safety meant to prevent a crash in the case of a \ntrack circuit failure are automatic alerts sent to Metro Central \nCommand to alert control officers when a track circuit failures occurs.\n  However, ignoring these warnings were part of Metro's operational \nprotocol.\n  The NTSB reported that prior to the Red Line crash, track circuit \nfailures were such a frequent occurrence, that Central Command was \nreceiving an average of 3,000 system alerts a week.\n  Central Command's response to the overwhelming number of alerts was \nto implement an automatic override program.\n  The override allowed Metro to operate around the alerts, rather than \nfixing the circuit failures triggering the alerts.\n  The constant barrage of alerts ended up creating a culture of \ncomplacency rather than creating a culture of urgency.\n  This negligent managerial approach to solving the warning rather than \nsolving the problem is entirely irresponsible and exemplifies the lack \nof a Safety Culture at Metro.\n  Because the approaching train was under automatic control it was \ncompletely reliant on receiving the correct operations signals from the \ntrack circuits.\n  Since the system failed, it was on the train's conductor to stop the \ntrain. The investigation concluded that operator Jeanice McMillan, of \nFairfax, VA, acted quickly and appropriately to do all she could to \nstop the train.\n  The curvature of the track, combined with the high speed that the \nautomatic controls had her train travelling at, made it impossible for \nMs. McMillan to prevent her train from striking the train ahead.\n  Based on the emergency brake marks on the tracks, Operator McMillan \nacted as soon as she had visual contact with the train ahead.\n  She made a selfless choice to remain at her post and do everything \nshe could\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\nto slow the train, even when she surely must have realized that a \ncollision was inevitable.\n  Operator McMillan gave her life to save her passengers. Ms. \nMcMillan's heroism surely prevented an even greater tragedy and for \nthat we are all grateful.\n  The NTSB pointed to the crashworthiness of the railcars as a major \ncontributing factor in the severity of the accident.\n  These are the first-generation 1000 series cars that are subject to \nshearing in crash situations.\n  Metro has known about the compromised crashworthiness of its oldest \nrailcars for many years.\n  A relatively low-speed accident at the Woodley Park Station in 2004 \ndemonstrated how dangerous these railcars are in a crash situation. \nFortunately, in that accident no one was seriously injured.\n  After the June 22 accident, Metro implemented a plan to place the \nolder 1000 series cars in the center of trains as claiming that this \nshelters the older, less crashworthy cars in an accident.\n  The NTSB has pointed out that there is no factual basis for this \npractice, known as ``bellying,'' in creating safer trains.\n  The only way to make for safer trains is to get the old, unsafe \nrailcars off the system. I am happy to report, that WMATA is working to \nreplace the 1000 series cars incrementally with newer, safer cars.\n  In fact, last Monday, Metro announced it has placed the order for the \n7000 series cars that will finally replace all of the oldest, most \nunsafe, railcars on the system.\n  The NTSB's top-line recommendations to the Washington Metropolitan \nArea Transit Authority are the following:\n\n       Expedite the detection and replacement of all faulty track \n     circuits within the System.\n       Expedite the replacement or reinforcement of all of the \n     oldest least crashworthy railcars in operation.\n       Ensure that all new and current railcar cockpits are \n     outfitted with event data recorders.\n       And lastly, management, starting with the board, must \n     establish a culture of safety that pervades the entire \n     organization.\n\n  The last point is incredibly important because despite Metro's \nongoing budget woes, making safety a genuine priority would come at no \nadditional cost to WMATA.\n  The NTSB also had many compelling recommendations for how the Federal \nTransit Administration should establish better safety guidance.\n  Because of Metro's unique relationship with the Federal Government, \nthe FTA should provide immediate guidance to Metro on improving the \nsafety of its operation.\n  Because the FTA has no actual regulatory authority, Congress must \ntake the NTSB's safety improvement recommendations as a call for \nlegislative action.\n  We must act to ensure that the NTSB's recommendations to FTA can be \nimplemented in a way that achieves results.\n  Senators Dodd, Menendez, Mikulski, and I introduced legislation \nrequiring the Transportation Secretary to establish and implement a \ncomprehensive transit Public Transportation Safety program.\n  With the support of Senator Shelby, this bill was reported out of \ncommittee and is awaiting action on the floor.\n  This legislation will give the FTA the ability to take decisive \nactions such as conducting inspections, investigations, audits, \nexaminations of public transit systems.\n  The Public Transportation Safety Program Act of 2010 came about at \nthe request of the President and Transportation Secretary LaHood.\n  I applaud the Obama administration for recognizing the need to give \nthe FTA legal enforcement authority of its standards and rules.\n  This legislation establishes the type of safety enforcement authority \nfor the FTA that currently exists for the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's over commuter rail systems and that the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration has for commercial trucking.\n  It makes sense for public transit systems that receive federal \nfunding to meet federal safety requirements set by the FTA.\n  These are safety requirements that could have saved the lives lost in \nlast year's Red Line crash and would help make transit systems across \nthe country safer for all users.\n  Just as I believe that the Federal Government has a role in ensuring \nMetro is safe for its riders and employees, I also believe the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to help fund the safe operation of the \nsystem since Metro provides the Federal Government and its employees a \nvital transportation service.\n  I was proud to work alongside Senators Mikulski, Webb and former \nSenator John Warner to include major new funding authorization for \nMetro in the Federal Rail Safety Improvement Act, which was signed into \nlaw in 2008.\n  This law authorizes $1.5 billion over 10 years in federal funds for \nWMATA, and is matched dollar-for-dollar by the local jurisdictions, for \ncapital improvements.\n  This arrangement will finally provide Metro with the dedicated \nfunding the system needs.\n  President Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget request to Congress \nincludes $150 million for Metro.\n  This builds on the substantial downpayment Senators Mikulski, Webb, \nMark Warner and I were able to secure for Metro last year. I am happy \nto see that the Appropriations Committee has included this request in \nthe Transportation appropriations bill reported out of Committee.\n  This is an important investment, but it is not nearly enough to \nfulfill all of Metrorail's obligations.\n  Metro maintains a list of ready-to-go projects totaling about $530 \nmillion and $11 billion in capital funding needs over the next decade.\n  When Metro was a relatively new system it was the epitome of safe and \nreliable public transit.\n  After 34 years of operation, and a managerial focus on system \nexpansion rather than system preservation, the backlog of maintenance \nneeds have taken its toll.\n  I find it unacceptable that the transit system in our Nation's \nCapital does not have enough resources to improve safety and maintain \nits aging infrastructure.\n  My deepest sympathies remain with the families and friends whose \nlives are forever affected having lost someone dear to them in last \nyear's tragedy.\n  I want them to know that you and the loved ones you lost are not \nforgotten.\n  This tragedy has served as a constant reminder and inspiration for my \nwork to fix the problems that led to the tragedy.\n  I call on my colleagues to honor the memory of those by working to \npass the Public Transit Safety Act so that we can prevent similar \ntragedies from happening in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6868-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6868-S6871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we spent nearly 6 weeks debating a bill \nthat would help small business.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle exclaimed that the bill was \na jobs bill, one that would help small business--the engine of our \neconomy.\n  The senior Senator from Louisiana--for whom I have great admiration \nas an advocate for small business--said, ``If the Democrats aren't for \nsmall business, I don't know what we're for.''\n  Well, the small business jobs bill was not passed by this body.\n  My friends on the other side will claim that Republicans blocked the \nbill.\n  But I think my friends need to look in the mirror when placing blame \non their inability to govern.\n  Even if the small business jobs bill would have passed, the tax \nmeasures in that bill are only a drop in the bucket when it comes to \nthe taxes and increased regulation small business is going to have to \nendure.\n  That's right, although Democratic leadership and the White House \ncontinue to say that they are for small business, any legislative \nmeasure that has been advertised as helping small business has not \nlived up the hype.\n  Let's start with the new health care reform law.\n  During the debate over health care reform, my friends on the other \nside of the aisle--including top officials in the White House--\nexplained that the new law would provide tax credits to small business \nto help them pay for health insurance.\n  My friends said it so many times, you would almost think that the so-\ncalled tax credit was the best thing since sliced bread.\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\n  Many Democratic Senators based their vote in favor of the health care \nreform bill solely on the belief that the small business tax credit for \nhealth insurance would help struggling small businesses.\n  Well, even after the White House spent taxpayer dollars to send \npostcards to 4 million small businesses informing them of the so-called \ntax credit for health insurance, the tax credit has been a dud.\n  That is not according to this Senator; that is according to small \nbusiness owners and brokers who are in the business of selling \ninsurance to small business.\n  For example, just the other day--Thursday, July 29--the Bloomberg \nnews organization wrote an article noting that the response to the so-\ncalled tax credit for small business ``has been cool'' according to \n``health-plan brokers across the country.''\n  Here are some quotes from the article about the small business tax \ncredit:\n  James Stenger, director of business development for Benefit-Mall, \nsaid, ``The reality is it doesn't meet the hype . . . It's had very \nlittle traction so far . . .''\n  Russ Childers, a broker in Americus, GA, said, ``It fell short of \nwhat was needed to help businesses.''\n  Todd Page, of Warrenville, IL, said, ``We've really wanted it to \nwork, because we'd sell more . . . It just hasn't worked out, and most \nfirms have been disappointed.''\n  Thomas Harte, president of Landmark Benefits, Inc., said, ``We're not \nseeing more people becoming insured as a result of a subsidy coming \ntheir way.''\n  They are not the only ones decrying the so-called tax credit for \nhealth insurance.\n  The chief executive officer of the largest organization representing \nsmall business--the National Federation of Independent Business--\nquestioned the effectiveness of this tax credit.\n  Small business owners who also had high hopes that the credit would \nhelp them were surprised and extremely disappointed when they found out \nthey did not qualify for the credit.\n  A May 20 Associated Press article chronicles these frustrations.\n  I would like to read one passage from the article before I move on. \nThe article said:\n\n       Zach Hoffman was confident his small business would qualify \n     for a new tax cut in President Barack Obama's health care \n     overhaul law. But when he ran the numbers, Hoffman discovered \n     that his office furniture company wouldn't get any assistance \n     with the $79,200 it pays annually in premiums for its 24 \n     employees. `It leaves you with this feeling of a bait-and-\n     switch,' he said.\n\n  Every day, I hear from Iowa small business owners who are frustrated \nwith the so-called small business tax credit for health insurance.\n  I have been told that--after gathering all of the required \ninformation and paying an accounting professional to calculate all of \nthe phaseouts and limitations--the time and cost almost outweighs any \nbenefit for those businesses lucky enough to qualify.\n  Steven Yeater of Wilton, IA, the co-owner of a products finishing \nbusiness, wrote me a letter telling me that the tax credit is ``(1) not \nwell thought out or discussed, (2) ridiculously complicated for a small \nbusiness owner to understand and implement, and (3) once again, \nCongress is over-selling/over-promising the benefits of the tax \ncredit.''\n  This is just one example where the Democratic majority has failed \nsmall business.\n  This is one example where the Democratic majority has touted a so-\ncalled benefit for small business that did not live up to its hype.\n  And now, small business is faced with mounting tax increases and \nregulatory burdens.\n  What do I mean?\n  The new health care reform law included 20 tax increases. Thirteen of \nthem fall on individuals and families, and 7 of them hit businesses.\n  These tax increases will be devastating for small business. Moreover, \nthese tax increases far outweigh the benefit of the so-called small \nbusiness tax credit for health insurance that some businesses are lucky \nenough to receive.\n  And this is not the only tax increase small business will face. When \nCongress returns after the August recess, we are going to debate the \nbipartisan tax relief that was enacted back in 2001 and 2003. That tax \nrelief is set to expire at the end of this year unless Congress acts. \nAllowing the bipartisan tax relief to expire will result in the largest \ntax increase in our Nation's history.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have indicated that they \nwould like to extend the bipartisan tax relief for the ``middle \nclass.''\n  I want to emphasize that this means that my Democratic colleagues \nwant to extend 80 percent of the bipartisan tax relief that they like \nto call the Bush tax cuts.\n  Actually, the only reason why they call it the Bush tax cuts is to \nvilify the tax relief. But my friends seem to support 80 percent of the \ntax cuts they enjoy vilifying so often.\n  Which brings me to my final point. My friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would extend some of the tax relief but not all of it. My \nfriends want to allow the top marginal tax rates--and a number of \nhidden taxes that affect these taxpayers--to expire. Why? Because my \nfriends say the country--our Federal Government--cannot afford to give \ntax cuts to the ``rich.''\n  But, it is not the rich who are going to be burdened if the rates \nwere allowed to expire; it is small business that will suffer.\n  So in closing, I refer back to the statement of the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, which was, if Democrats are not for small \nbusiness, I don't know what we are for.\n  The Democratic leadership is not for extending all of the bipartisan \ntax relief. So I will leave it to others to decide whether or not my \nDemocratic colleagues are for small business.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the items to which I referred printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Bloomberg Government in Development, July 29, 2010]\n\n     Small Business Slow To Embrace Health Tax Credits, Brokers Say\n\n                    (By David Lerman and Liz Smith)\n\n       One of the ways President Barack Obama envisioned expanding \n     coverage under the health overhaul was by giving small \n     businesses a tax credit worth tens of thousands of dollars to \n     help cover their employees.\n       Though 4 million postcards were mailed to eligible firms, \n     response has been cool, say health-plan brokers across the \n     country. The reason is that the credit starts to phase out \n     for companies that pay average annual wages of more than \n     $25,000, leaving out many businesses in higher-wage states \n     and discouraging others who don't think the credit will help.\n       ``The reality is it doesn't meet the hype,'' said James \n     Stenger, director of business development for BenefitMall, \n     which sells small-group plans in New Jersey. ``It's had very \n     little traction so far.''\n       Todd Page, vice president of sales at JLBG Health in \n     Warrenville, Illinois, said about 40 percent of the 460 small \n     businesses his firm contacted were eligible for the credit. \n     Only about seven would get the full benefit and be able to \n     claim a credit equal to 35 percent of the premiums they pay.\n       Independent brokers sell small-group policies from insurers \n     such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Aetna Inc. to firms with \n     up to 50 employees and can assess how tax incentives affect \n     coverage decisions.\n       Karen Mills, administrator of the U.S. Small Business \n     Administration, said complaints about the credit's limited \n     reach are premature.\n       ``I think this is all still in anecdote land,'' Mills said \n     in an interview. ``The math says it's likely to be \n     positive.''\n       Mills said the income cap was necessary because Congress \n     was intent on keeping program costs under control. ``It's \n     just trying to get to the people who need the help the \n     most.''\n\n\n                           Estimated Savings\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax credit \n     will save small businesses $40 billion by 2019, and Obama \n     said it will help millions of companies solve one of their \n     biggest worries: offering health insurance to their workers.\n       The plan is intended for enterprises such as independent \n     printers, mechanics shops and restaurants, which lack the \n     negotiating power that big companies have with insurers. The \n     biggest breaks go to the smallest, least-wealthy workforces \n     under the plan.\n\n\n                           Targeted Employers\n\n       The Internal Revenue Service said the plan is for employers \n     who pay at least half the cost of individual coverage for \n     their employees in 2010. From 2010 to 2013, the maximum \n     credit goes to companies with 10 or fewer full-time employees \n     that pay annual average wages of $25,000 or less.\n       The credit is completely phased out for employers that have \n     25 or more workers or that pay average wages of $50,000 a \n     year or more. Because eligibility rules are partly\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n     based on the number of employees, brokers complain that the \n     tax break diminishes relatively quickly. For example, a firm \n     with 14 workers that pays an average of $30,000 gets to claim \n     a credit worth 19 percent of premiums paid.\n       The Obama administration said the program can help as many \n     as two thirds of the nation's 6 million small businesses, \n     based on Small Business Administration figures.\n       ``It's worth perhaps tens of thousands of dollars to your \n     companies,'' Obama said in a May 25 speech at the White \n     House. ``And it will provide welcome relief to small business \n     owners, who all too often have to choose between hiring or \n     keeping your health care for yourselves and your workers.''\n       Mills said ``a huge proportion'' of these small businesses \n     haven't been able to afford insurance or get access to it.\n       ``This could very well tip the scales for some of them,'' \n     she said.\n\n\n                             Cost of Living\n\n       Many businesses who buy small-group health insurance have \n     10 or fewer employees. Most won't enjoy anything close to \n     that 35 percent maximum credit because they pay more than \n     $25,000 in average wages, the brokers said.\n       Stenger said the average family plan in New Jersey costs \n     $1,500 to $1,800 a month. So a tax break that ends up cutting \n     premium costs by 10 percent, for example, wouldn't induce \n     firms to start offering coverage.\n       ``The impact is a lot less than the crafters of this \n     provision thought it would be, at least in New Jersey,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                            `Bleeding Wound'\n\n       Brokers in other regions said the income issue isn't \n     isolated to high-cost states like New Jersey.\n       ``The income hurts the worst,'' said Russ Childers, a \n     broker in Americus, Georgia. ``It fell short of what was \n     needed to help businesses.''\n       The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-\n     business lobbying group, disputed the administration's \n     estimates for how many businesses will benefit.\n       ``It's the equivalent of putting a band aid on a profusely \n     bleeding wound,'' said Michelle Dimarob, head of legislative \n     affairs for the federation. ``It won't solve the number-one \n     problem for small businesses.''\n       The group in May joined Florida's legal challenge to the \n     health-care reform law, becoming the first private \n     organization seeking to overturn the measure.\n       Some 46 percent of companies have fewer than 10 workers, \n     and many of those businesses insure only owners' families, \n     Dimarob said. The credit, which expires in its current form \n     in 2014 and fully in 2016, isn't likely to change this, she \n     said. The credit can increase to 50 percent for the last two \n     years if owners purchase insurance through a state exchange.\n\n\n                           Michigan Insurers\n\n       Insurers in Michigan are scaling back attempts to sell to \n     small businesses, said Steven Selinsky, the incoming \n     president of his industry's trade group, the National \n     Association of Health Underwriters. Selinsky closed his \n     agency that sold small-group health insurance.\n       ``After the economy collapsed, people just weren't \n     purchasing,'' said Selinsky, who now works for BeneSys Inc., \n     a third-party insurance administrator for unions. ``It's just \n     not doing what we had hoped.''\n       Page, the Illinois broker, said his staff has provided 61 \n     new quotes for potential clients and has sold two new \n     policies to that group.\n       ``We've really wanted it to work, because we'd sell more,'' \n     said Page, whose clients include doctors' offices and auto-\n     body repair shops. ``It just hasn't worked out, and most \n     firms have been disappointed.''\n       Thomas Harte, president of Landmark Benefits Inc., who \n     serves about 400 employers in New Hampshire and \n     Massachusetts, said he hadn't come across any clients \n     eligible for the tax credit. He has a long list of customers \n     that exceed allowable income thresholds, or who have too many \n     full-time workers.\n       ``We're not seeing more people becoming insured as a result \n     of a subsidy coming their way.''\n\n\n                            Blue Cross Gains\n\n       One exception to the experience of many insurance brokers \n     has been Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, which \n     started an intensive advertising campaign to promote the tax \n     credit when the law was enacted.\n       The group sold 227 plans to small businesses in the past \n     three months--an 80 percent increase in sales compared with a \n     normal three-month period, said Tom Bowser, chief executive \n     officer.\n       Even with the added business, Bowser said most small \n     businesses in the Kansas City market don't qualify for the \n     tax credit. Of the firms with fewer than 25 employees, no \n     more than a quarter of them qualify, he said.\n\n\n                             Help for Idaho\n\n       The credit has potential to help in Idaho because its \n     economy is dominated by small businesses averaging eight \n     workers, said Scott Leavitt, owner of an insurance brokerage \n     in Boise and the immediate past president of the health \n     underwriters association. On the other hand, Idaho's average \n     per capita income is $33,000, and more than $35,000 for his \n     block of customers, he said.\n       About a quarter of his clients could see some relief, \n     though it would only be significant for 12 percent, he said.\n       Administration officials say they expect more businesses to \n     warm to the incentives.\n       ``These tax credits will make it easier for small \n     businesses to give their workers the insurance they need,'' \n     said Nicholas Papas, a spokesman for the White House. ``We're \n     working diligently to ensure small businesses know about this \n     credit.''\n       ``Small businesses are looking into it because they're not \n     dumb,'' Mills of the Small Business Administration said. \n     ``People want to provide health insurance. The reason is \n     they're losing good employees when they don't.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Fact Check: Tax Cut Math Doesn't Add Up for Some\n\n Fact Check: `Broad' Health Care Tax Cut for Small Business Leaves Out \n                             Some Companies\n\n         (By Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Associated Press Writer)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Zach Hoffman was confident his small \n     business would qualify for a new tax cut in President Barack \n     Obama's health care overhaul law.\n       But when he ran the numbers, Hoffman discovered that his \n     office furniture company wouldn't get any assistance with the \n     $79,200 it pays annually in premiums for its 24 employees. \n     ``It leaves you with this feeling of a bait-and-switch,'' he \n     said.\n       When the administration unveiled the small business tax \n     credit earlier this week, officials touted its ``broad \n     eligibility'' for companies with fewer than 25 workers and \n     average annual wages under $50,000 that provide health \n     coverage. Hoffman's workers earn an average of $35,000 a \n     year, which makes it all the more difficult to understand why \n     his company didn't qualify.\n       Lost in the fine print: The credit drops off sharply once a \n     company gets above 10 workers and $25,000 average annual \n     wages.\n       It's an example of how the early provisions of the health \n     care law can create winners and losers among groups lawmakers \n     intended to help--people with health problems, families with \n     young adult children and small businesses. Because of the \n     law's complexity, not everyone in a broadly similar situation \n     will benefit.\n       Consider small businesses: ``The idea here is to target the \n     credits to a relatively low number of firms, those who are \n     low-wage and really quite small,'' said economist Linda \n     Blumberg of the Urban Institute public policy center.\n       On paper, the credit seems to be available to companies \n     with fewer than 25 workers and average wages of $50,000. But \n     in practice, a complicated formula that combines the two \n     numbers works against companies that have more than 10 \n     workers and $25,000 in average wages, Blumberg said.\n       ``You can get zero even if you are not hitting the max on \n     both pieces,'' Blumberg said.\n       Hoffman used an online calculator to figure his company's \n     eligibility. At least three are available: from the House \n     Energy and Commerce Committee, which helped write the \n     legislation; from the progressive Center for American \n     Progress; and from the National Federation of Independent \n     Business, which is seeking to overturn the law in federal \n     court. All produced the same result.\n       ``I think (the administration's) intentions are good, but \n     the numbers and applications don't come out to what they \n     intend,'' said Hoffman, part owner of Wiley Office Furniture, \n     a third-generation family business in Springfield, Ill.\n       The Treasury Department, which administers the new credit, \n     did not dispute the calculations.\n       ``The small-business tax credit was designed to provide the \n     greatest benefit to employers that currently have the hardest \n     time providing health insurance for their workers--small, \n     low-wage firms,'' said Michael Mundaca, assistant secretary \n     for tax policy. ``Small employers face higher premiums and \n     higher administrative costs than large firms and in many \n     cases cannot afford to provide coverage.''\n       Small business owners are a pivotal constituency in the \n     fall congressional elections, and Democrats are battling to \n     win them over. Major benefits of the health care law--\n     competitive insurance markets, more stable premiums and a ban \n     on denying coverage to those in poor health--don't take \n     effect until 2014. But the health care credit is available \n     starting this year.\n       It can be a boon for smaller companies paying lower wages. \n     Betsy Burton, owner of The King's English Bookshop in Salt \n     Lake City, estimates that she will get a credit of roughly \n     $21,000 against premiums of about $67,800. She has 11 full-\n     time equivalent employees averaging $26,100.\n       ``What it means is that I can afford to carry this \n     insurance and insure people's families,'' said Burton. ``I \n     was afraid that we were fast approaching a time when I would \n     have to choose between insuring my employees and closing my \n     doors.''\n       Burton believes offering health insurance is the right \n     thing for an employer to do--and also makes good business \n     sense because it helps her retain valued employees.

But his company's premiums rose 15 percent this year, \n     and it's a struggle to keep paying.\n       To get the most out of the new federal credit, Hoffman said \n     he'd have to cut his work force to 10 employees and slash \n     their wages.\n       ``That seems like a strange outcome, given we've got 10 \n     percent unemployment,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Wyatt: I am contacting you as I believe you are \n     the individual who assists Sen. Grassley on tax matters \n     connected to his Senate Finance Committee position.\n       I am writing you to comment on the Small Business Health \n     Care Tax Credit.\n       Some brief background about our company:\n       We are a small manufacturer of abrasives in Wilton, IA, \n     currently employing 17 full-time people.\n       Our major competitors are the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese \n     sandpaper manufacturers and the recession has hit us hard.\n       We provide some of the following historical benefits to our \n     employees:\n       We pay 100% of all employees' health insurance premiums;\n       We provide $40,000 of life insurance to each employee;\n       We contribute approximately 14% of each employee's \n     compensation into a profit-plan for their retirement;\n       Paid vacation;\n       Approximately 2 weeks paid time off during Christmas which \n     does not count against an employee's vacation time;\n       What the recession has done to us:\n       Like many small businesses, we are losing money;\n       This has caused us to hire some workers through a local \n     temporary business to replace full-time employees as we have \n     turnover and as we try to expand into other areas to keep our \n     business going;\n       For the last 2 years we have only been able to contribute \n     the 3% safe harbor to the profit-sharing plan (for at least \n     the prior decade we contributed the full roughly 14% of \n     compensation to the profit-sharing plan);\n       We were forced to change the safe harbor profit-sharing \n     contribution from a 3% mandatory to a matching type plan \n     since a few of the temporary workers will have met the 1,000 \n     hours/12 month rule--essentially punishing the full-time work \n     force as we don't have the discretionary cash to make the \n     contributions for the temps (a whole other tax issue for \n     small businesses); and\n       We have continually had to reduce some health benefits (via \n     increasing deductible to $1,000; however, we continue to pay \n     100% of the premium cost).\n       Now back to the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit.\n       Early on I had high hopes that the credit would be quite \n     helpful in defraying the health care premium costs. We \n     currently pay $11,410.39 per month in Wellmark BCBS premiums \n     (nine on the single plan at $413.67/month and eight on the \n     family plan at $960.92/month) for a total annual premium cost \n     of $136,924.68; and this is before anyone gets sick as we \n     self-insure for the co-insurance. Our annual premium increase \n     will be communicated to us by Wellmark about August and I \n     anticipate another 20+% jump.\n       However, now some of the details of the credit are leaking \n     out. Today I received the attached letter from our CPA firm, \n     RSM McGladrey. I point you to the limitations and phase-out \n     of the credit. Are you kidding me? By the time I gather all \n     the required information, pay RSM McGladrey to calculate all \n     the phase-outs, the resulting credit will not even cover the \n     expected annual premium increase from BCBS!\n       What small business is this helping? This is about like all \n     the back to work credits, or whatever they are called, which \n     we concluded with RSM McGladrey are not worth the manpower \n     costs to fully investigate and gather the information.\n       This credit is worthless. If Congress thinks this is going \n     to encourage small businesses to keep providing health care \n     for their employees, they are grossly mistaken. It just isn't \n     meaningful enough to even enter into the equation in making a \n     decision of what to do for my employees.\n       Effective today, we can no longer hire someone and provide \n     them with subsidized health insurance beyond what is required \n     by law. We hope to continue with existing employees, but \n     clearly, with what little bit I know about the Health Care \n     Act, come 2014 we are dropping our health plan; if not \n     sooner.\n       I would hope as Senator Grassley's Finance Committee tax \n     assistant, someone who would understand ``the devil in the \n     details'', you will pass on to him my frustrations. Such \n     frustrations with respect to the Small Business Health Care \n     Tax Credit being, but not limited to: (1) not well thought \n     out or discussed; (2) ridiculously complex for a small \n     business to understand and implement; and (3) once again, \n     Congress' over selling/promising the benefit of.\n       I would greatly appreciate if you would convey my thoughts \n     on this matter to Senator Grassley to help him understand \n     what is happening with small business on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steven D.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the centennial \nof the town of Springfield in my home State of Idaho.\n  On September 13, 1910, the County Commission of Bingham County \napproved a plat plan for the town-site of Springfield. It was an \nambitious vision of a city on the shores of Springfield Lake--a body of \nwater created years earlier to supply irrigation water from Danilsen \ncreek. The area was a popular stopping place on Goodale's cutoff along \nthe Oregon Trail.\n  In Springfield, 1910 was a busy and exciting time. Water from the \nAberdeen-Springfield Canal reached Springfield. The Oregon Short-Line \nrailroad came through and provided service to the community. And in \nJune, a group of women organized the Springfield Domestic Science Club \nwith a focus on community service.\n  The club quickly became a force in the community, establishing a hot \nlunch program at the local school and creating and managing the \nSpringfield Cemetery, something members did until 1946. The club also \nsponsored many educational, cultural and entertainment events.\n  The Aberdeen-Springfield Canal was a major asset to the area. Not \nonly did it provide much-needed water to the surrounding agricultural \nland, it provided jobs for many of the early settlers. The canal, begun \nin 1895, was dug using horse-drawn equipment and manual labor.\n  Today, the canal is a tribute to private enterprise. No government \nmoney was used during its construction. It is owned by its shareholders \nunder a Carey Act corporation and is a ``not for profit'' organization, \nwhich financed it by the sale of shares in the company. The canal was \ncompleted at a cost of about $886,000, irrigates about 63,000 acres of \nfield and helps produce crops valued at roughly $140 million each year.\n  On August 28, 2010, the Springfield community will honor its early \npioneers with a centennial celebration. During the festivities, a \nmonument in honor of the early settlers will be unveiled. The monument \nidentifies those settlers who formed the backbone of the community by \nbuilding the canal, operating the markets and shops and organizing the \nschools and churches. The names of these early pioneer families with \nthe vision of seeing the desert bloom are:\n  Anderson, Baird, Bedwell, Berg, Blackburn, Bradley, H. Chandler, W. \nChandler, Criddle, Cushman, Edwards, Evans, Gravatt, Grover, Hawker, \nHolland, Houghland, Judge, Line, Leach, Lloyd, Lofgreen, Loomis, \nParmalee, Reid, Rupe, Sainz, Sellers, Shelman, Stoddard, Stufflebean, \nSnyder, Sommercorn, Thurston, Wells, Whyte, Willis.\n  Although the present day Springfield town-site did not quite live up \nto the vision laid out in the original plat, those living in the \ncommunity strive to honor their heritage. Out of that sturdy pioneer \nstock have come doctors, lawyers, politicians, farmers, ranchers, \nchemists, accountants, educators, firemen, homemakers, artists, \nlaborers, mechanics, business owners, civil servants, religious leaders \nand military servicemembers.\n  I congratulate the people of Springfield on this occasion and pay \ntribute to those pioneers and others like them across our land, who, \nwith vision, determination and hard work, created what we now enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6871-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6871-S6872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK KOSTER\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize Mark \nKoster. This month, the Senate will bid farewell to one of the unsung \nheroes of this body. Mark, an associate counsel in the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, is retiring and concluding his career on Capitol \nHill.\n  Over the last two decades, there is hardly a major Federal education \nlaw that doesnt have Marks imprint. Marks areas of focus have included \nhigher education, special education, career and technical education, \nliteracy, elementary and secondary education, and a number of early \neducation programs. Mark has more bipartisan legislative \naccomplishments than many Members of Congress.\n  Mark has made certain our ideas are drafted into legislation with \ntechnical precision, and his dedication to his\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nwork over the past two decades exemplifies true professionalism. Mark \nhas treated every legislative initiative equally, no matter if he was \ndrafting a relatively small amendment or a major reauthorization \nproposal for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Higher \nEducation Act, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \nSenators and their staffs all knew that when one saw Marks legislative \nsignature, ``KOS,'' atop a document that the draft that had emerged \nfrom legislative counsel was in perfect technical shape and it was now \nup to us, as Members of the Senate, only to argue the draft's merits \nand relevance, not the format.\n  As a member of the Senate HELP Committee, I am proud and honored to \nsay that we, both present and former committee members, have considered \nMark our staff, even though he has never been on the HELP Committee's \npayroll. Mark has been one of our cornerstones because he has always \ntreated every HELP member and staffer with the greatest respect. \nAdditionally, Mark has demonstrated a rather large dose of patience in \ndealing with time constraints, deadlines, and all the various \npersonalities that traverse the Halls of the Senate.\n  Although those of us who are members of the HELP Committee have \nconsumed most of Marks time during his years as legislative counsel, \nMark has always been of great assistance to every other Senate office \nthat has needed aid in drafting education-related issues. All of us, \nRepublican, Democrat, and Independent, have been lucky to have had Mark \nKoster on our side.\n  Mark, we thank you for your service and dedication. The HELP \nCommittee will always consider you both an honorary member and a part \nof our family. We and the entire Federal education lawmaking process \nwill miss you. May your next chapter in life be even more successful \nand more rewarding than the one that is coming to a conclusion. We wish \nyou, your lovely wife, Kathy, and your two children the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6872-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUCATION JOBS FUND\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as an elected representative of the \ngreat State of Texas, I swore a solemn oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution. So it is a great disappointment to discover that some \nMembers of the other body are attempting to undermine the separation of \npowers enshrined in our Constitution. I am speaking, of course, about \nthe House-passed language that was included in Senate amendment No. \n4575, which I opposed earlier today.\n  The language in the amendment unfairly requires the State of Texas to \nmaintain fiscal year 2011 levels of State funding for elementary, \nsecondary, and higher education spending for 2 additional fiscal years \nin order to receive a portion of the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund. \nThis places an undue burden on a single State that is likely an \nunconstitutional condition on funding in violation of the Supreme \nCourt's holding in South Dakota v. Dole.\n  Specifically, the language conditions Texas's receipt of Federal \neducation dollars on an event that would violate the Texas \nConstitution. The Texas Governor cannot make the required assurances \nbecause the Texas legislature, not the Governor, decides how to spend \nthe State's money. Any attempt by the Governor to bind the \nlegislature's hands would be ineffective because that office lacks the \npower, and the mere attempt could violate the Texas Constitution. Nor \ncan the Governor make an assurance regarding the actions of a future \nlegislature, as the amendment requires. Such conditions, which cannot \nbe lawfully met, can have no possible relation to the Federal interest \nin education spending.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the State's share of \nthe $10 billion is estimated to be over $830 million. By ensuring that \nthe State will not be able to access these funds, the Texas provisions \neffectively create a significant and substantial amount of \ndiscretionary funds available to the Secretary of Education. The \npractical effect of this petty, partisan gamesmanship will be to saddle \nfuture generations of Texans with a debt for which they are unlikely to \nreceive any benefit.\n  This was a shameful, irresponsible exercise in raw political power. \nTexas students deserve more than to be political pawns. Forcing the \nlegislature and Governor to choose between violating the Texas \nConstitution or accepting Federal dollars is an abuse of Federal power \nand is a clear threat to the separation of powers. A State's elected \ngovernment should not be made subjects of political appointees and \nunelected bureaucrats at the Department of Education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6872-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  REMEMBERING BISHOP DR. JERRY LOUDER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the \ncareer accomplishments and service of the late Bishop Dr. Jerry \nLouder--clergyman, educator, community leader, and author. Dr. Louder \nwas born in Riverside in 1947 and remained dedicated to his community \nthroughout his life. Dr. Louder passed away on July 2, 2010.\n  As a student at Pacific High School in San Bernardino, Jerry Louder \nexcelled in academics and athletics. He advanced his education at the \nUniversity of California, Riverside and earned a dual major bachelor's \ndegree, a master's degree, and a doctorate. Dr. Louder later completed \na second doctorate at Friends International Christian University and \nbegan his ministry in 1970.\n  Dr. Louder was an acknowledged leader among his ministerial peers. He \nserved as pastor of New Jerusalem Foursquare Church for 22 years and \nbecame founding pastor of New Jerusalem Christian Center. He was \nheavily active in a diversity of clergy groups in San Bernardino and \nRiverside counties, including the Riverside Clergy Association; the \nRiverside Area Pastors' Association; the Inland Area Ministers' \nAlliance; and the Riverside Interfaith Fellowship. He also served as \npresident of the United States Pastors' Association, a communication \nnetwork of nearly 100,000 pastors representing more than 40 \ndenominations and independent churches.\n  Riverside mayor, Ron Loveridge, described Dr. Louder as a ``community \nhealer.'' In addition to helping forge stronger relations between the \nRiverside Police Department and the communities it serves, Dr. Louder \nalso cofounded and served as executive director of the Opportunities \nIndustrialization Center, which led to his founding the Riverside \nOpportunity Center to address the needs of the poor, homeless, and \nmarginalized in his community. These and other similar efforts earned \nthe recognition of many groups and organizations throughout his life, \nincluding being named a 2010 Alumnus of the Year by the Riverside \nCommunity College District.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Dr. Louder's family, friends, \ncolleagues, and all those whose lives were influenced by Dr. Louder's \ncommitment, compassionate leadership, and personal and professional \nintegrity. He will be truly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6872-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6872-S6873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ABRAHAM WEINRIB\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, Columbus, OH, the State's \ncapital city, is home to more than 710,000 Ohioans who trace their \nheritage from a mix of races, religions, and ethnicities. Many Columbus \nresidents can trace their heritage back to Germany, Italy, and England. \nNeighborhoods like German Village, Italian Village and Victorian \nVillage are examples of places these new Americans created in the early \n20th century.\n  Recent waves of immigration have brought men and women from Somalia, \nVietnam, and Mexico to the city and our State.\n  Throughout the demographic changes to Columbus, there remains one \nsmall community that continues to draw from the strength of their \nshared experiences.\n  Mr. President, 217 Holocaust survivors reside in the city of Columbus \nand its suburbs from Bexley to New Albany. Among the unforgettable \nstories told by these heroic men and women is 97-year-old Abraham \nWeinrib, of the Berwick neighborhood, southeast of Columbus.\n  Mr. Weinrib's journey from hardship to hope began in 1939 when he and \nhis family were forced from their home in Lodz, Poland. After being \nforcefully removed from his home in Lodz, he fled\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nto Warsaw, Poland, where on September 6, 1939 at the age of 25 Mr. \nWeinrib was arrested by the Nazi's.\n  For the next 5\\1/2\\ years, he was sent to a total of nine \nconcentration camps.\n  In Hanover, Germany, he was a slave laborer at the Continental rubber \nfactory, where he made tires for Nazis to use against the Allied \ntroops.\n  At Bergen-Belsen, he was forced to drag dead prisoners to a ditch to \nbe buried in mass graves.\n  On April 14, 1945, Mr. Weinrib, weak with typhus, fell asleep on top \nof one of these mass graves. That night, he woke up from the open grave \nand stumbled into nearby barracks. There he found English troops \nliberating the camp.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Weinrib's parents, two older brothers, and most of \nhis extended family were among the more than 6 million Jews who \nperished during the war.\n  Mr. Weinrib spent the next year in a Swedish hospital recovering from \nyears of starvation, beatings, and a gunshot to his forehead.\n  After regaining his strength, Mr. Weinrib began to attend events \nthrough a Holocaust survivor's club in Sweden. There he met a young \nwoman named Anna who was freed from Auschwitz in 1945. Together, they \nspent more than a year recovering in the hospital and several more \nyears recovering at home in Sweden. By 1950, Anna and Abraham Weinrib \nmarried and had their first child, Ruth, in 1952.\n  In 1954, after living with his sister Hela who also survived the war \nMr. and Mrs. Weinrib left Stockholm and moved to Columbus where Mr. \nWeinrib's brother's Morrui and Chaim lived. In Columbus, Mr. Weinrib \nwas hired by Sam Melton to work at a Capitol Supply factory. Mr. \nWeinrib quickly rose through the ranks from line-worker to manager. \nMeanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Weinrib raised three children, sending them to \nschool and working hard to ensure they had every opportunity that was \nrobbed from their own youth.\n  Prior to Anna's passing in 1979, Mr. Weinrib rarely spoke of his \nexperiences during the war. But since then, he uses his own experience \nto ensure that future generations never forget the tragedy of the \nHolocaust.\n  Abraham Weinrib has become a fixture at the Jewish Community Center \nin Columbus and frequently speaks to students throughout the community. \nAt one recent speaking engagement, a student asked Mr. Weinrib what his \nexperiences during the Holocaust can teach younger generations. Without \nhesitation, he responded with his thick polish accent, that ``life is \nshort; you have to be nice to each other.''\n  Then, Mr. Weinrib referred to a heartbreaking experience he remembers \nduring his time at Auschwitz. The Nazi's were separating prisoners into \ntwo lines, those who were old enough and healthy enough to work, and \nthose who were not. One young mother was unwilling to be separated from \nher young daughter. Both were sent to the crematorium.\n  Abraham Weinrib has seen firsthand what intolerance, prejudice, and \nhate can do to undermine our basic humanity. He talks about how unfair \nand challenging life can be but does not attribute his survival or the \nsurvival of three of his siblings to any sort of miracle. Instead, he \nattributes his survival to the ability to persevere.\n  His own children have also used the strength of their father to \nsucceed. The three Weinrib children--Bruce, Ruth, and Irene--overcame \nmany of the hardships often faced by first-generation children: parents \nwith a limited understanding of English, low paying jobs, and the \nfeeling of being an outsider. By any measure, all three children have \nsucceeded. Ruth and Bruce are both graduates of the Ohio State \nUniversity. All three children have postsecondary degrees, and all have \nmade Abe a proud grandfather of seven grandchildren.\n  The impact Abraham Weinrib has had on his family and community is \nclear and the message he shares is powerful. Elie Wiesel said ``Not to \ntransmit an experience is to betray it.'' Abraham Weinrib is helping to \nensure that generations to come will learn his enduring lessons.\n  Thank you, Abraham Weinrib, for all that you do to make our State and \nNation live up to our highest ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6873-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM WEATHERLY\n\n   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Jim \nWeatherly of Pontotoc, MS, for his contribution to American music \nthrough prolific song writing and the attention that he has brought to \nthe many talented artists in my home State of Mississippi.\n  This weekend, Pontotoc County will celebrate Jim Weatherly's \naccomplishments at its annual Bodock Festival. Governor Haley Barbour \nhas designated a ``Jim Weatherly Day'' as part of the festival. I \nbelieve this is a fitting tribute to a man who is a source of pride for \nmany in Mississippi.\n  Jim Weatherly has not only excelled in the arts; he has also excelled \nboth academically and athletically. While I was a law school student at \nthe University of Mississippi, Weatherly was a member of the Ole Miss \nfootball team. As quarterback, Weatherly led the Ole Miss Rebels to an \nunbeaten and untied season, resulting in a national championship in \n1962 and Southeastern Conference Championships in 1962 and 1963. As a \nstar quarterback at my alma mater, Weatherly earned three letters and \nwas honored as a member of the All Southeastern Conference team in \n1964.\n  Jim Weatherly first started writing songs around the age of 12. He \nmoved to Los Angeles, CA, in 1966 to pursue a career in the music \nindustry. Weatherly has written pop, R, country, gospel and jazz \nsongs, some of which have become classics. Weatherly has authored \nnumerous hits for artists such as Gladys Knight and the Pips, Dean \nMartin, Kenny Rogers, Reba McIntire, Kenny Chesney, Hall & Oates and \nThe Temptations. Some of his well-known hits include ``Midnight Train \nto Georgia,'' ``Love Finds Its Own Way'' and ``Where Peaceful Waters \nFlow.'' He was nominated for a Grammy in the R Songwriter of the Year \ncategory and helped win numerous Grammys and awards for other artists. \nHe has released seven albums, including a Christmas album that he wrote \nand recorded.\n  The American Society of Publishers, Authors, and Composers named \nWeatherly Country Songwriter of the Year in 1974. Weatherly is also a \nmember of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Mississippi \nMusicians Hall of Fame.\n  Weatherly's ``Midnight Train to Georgia'' was inducted into the \nGrammy Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2001, The National Endowment for the \nArts and the Recording Industry Association of America ranked this song \n28th among 365 Songs of the Century.\n  Since moving back to the Southeast, Weatherly has continued to write, \npublish and record songs. Weatherly recently cowrote an album with \nVince Gill that sold over 5 million copies, and he continues to have \nNo. 1 country hits on the charts.\n  I congratulate Mr. Weatherly on being honored by his hometown of \nPontotoc, MS, and on his long, illustrious career. I wish him the best \nin his future endeavours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6873-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6873-S6875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MICHEL BAIK\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that today I \npay tribute to fire fighter Michel Baik, who sadly lost his life on \nJuly 24, 2010.\n  A lifelong resident of Bridgeport, Michel graduated from Central High \nSchool, where he played football. Throughout his life, he remained \nengaged in sports playing softball and basketball and was also an \nactive member of the St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church \ncongregation.\n  He was well known as a loving husband and father who was very engaged \nin the lives of his children, Andrew, Thomas, and Margaret. He coached \nJunior Varsity basketball, volunteered with the Boy Scouts, and was a \nconstant presence at their various school plays, sports events, and \ndance recitals.\n  For many years, Michel worked for companies like Norelco and Alcon \nData, as well as at the Connecticut Post newspaper as distribution \nmanager. He also helped teach computer skills to the unemployed as an \ninstructor at a nonprofit workforce development organization called \nCareer Resources.\n  Then, in 2007, he decided to take on a new challenge. He trained \nhard, studied hard, and ultimately became--at the age of 47--the oldest \n``probey,'' or rookie, member of the Bridgeport Fire Department. It was \na job he loved, and he\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nwas proud to have been able to serve his community as a member of the \ndepartment and the Ladder 11 team.\n  When a person becomes a firefighter, they are not simply taking a \njob; they are following a calling.\n  We have all felt our chests tighten and our pulses quicken with \nanxiety at the sound of a fire engine screaming through town. For most \nof us, this signals two important things: There is an emergency \nsomewhere nearby, and--more importantly--that help is on the way.\n  Of course, for the people riding on those rigs, all the commotion is \njust another day at the office. They are focused solely on the task at \nhand.\n  When the unthinkable happens--a devastating hurricane, industrial \naccident, terrorist attack, or three-alarm fire--these brave men and \nwomen are the first on the scene and the last to leave. In between, \nthey give all they have to make sure the emergency is contained and our \ncommunities are safe.\n  For Michel Baik and firefighters all over our Nation, the call to \nserve means facing danger every day. The commotion of an emergency \nbecomes secondary to the need to help people, and the dangers they \npersonally face must take a backseat to the task at hand.\n  That was the case on the afternoon of July 24, 2010, when Michel and \nhis colleague, fire lieutenant Steven Velasquez, were conducting a \nsearch-and-rescue mission on the third floor of a burning house in \nBridgeport. They were deepest into the blaze, looking for people in \nneed of assistance and trying to ventilate the structure. None of the \ninhabitants of the home were injured. But tragically, both of these \ncourageous men lost their lives, despite the quick action of their \ncolleagues to pull them out of danger and get them to the hospital.\n  Tragedies are inherent in this profession, and the risks are shared \nby every single person who has ever gotten the call, rushed to their \ngear, and has run headlong into danger in order to save the life of \nsomeone else. These shared risks help to bind those called to take them \ntogether in a solemn way.\n  Firefighters will do anything for one another, both on the job and \nwhen the worst happens. The more than 7,000 of their fellow \nfirefighters--from as far away as western Canada--who attended the \nmemorial services for Fire Fighter Baik and Lieutenant Velasquez were \nan impressive testament to that bond.\n  I believe that the eulogy offered in tribute to Michel Baik by \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters president Harold \nSchaitberger at his memorial service speaks well of this solemn \ncommitment. Through these difficult times, the community which Michel \nserved, and those he served with, can provide support and comfort to \nhis loved ones, and I will ask that President Schaitberger's words be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Of course, no tribute will ever be enough to ease the suffering of \ntheir families. I offer my deepest condolences to Mich's wife Laurie, \nhis children, and his entire family. Their sacrifice is unimaginable, \nand they will always be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I know that we can never make this right for them. But we must \ncelebrate the life and service of Firefighter Michel Baik and make sure \nthat his memory--as a role model and true hero--lives on and helps to \ninspire others to take up the call to serve.\n  I ask that President Schaitberge's words to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n               International Association of Fire Fighters\n\n                     President Harold Schaitberger\n\n  Eulogy for Fire Fighter Michel Baik, Bridgeport Local 834, July 30, \n                                  2010\n\n       To Fire Fighter Michel Baik's mother Mary, to his wife \n     Laurie, to his children Andrew, Thomas and Margaret, and to \n     his sister Rania--thank you for allowing me the honor of \n     taking part in this beautiful service to commemorate Mitch's \n     life, his service, and his sacrifice.\n       To Mitch's family, to his friends, to his brothers and \n     sisters in the Bridgeport Fire Department and Local 834, and \n     to his extended fire fighter family, I stand before you like \n     the man we honor today, a servant unto God, to offer the \n     thoughts and prayers on behalf of our General Secretary \n     Treasurer, our Executive Board, and the 298,000 fire fighters \n     we represent across two great nations.\n       These are the times that words are a poor substitute as we \n     try to make sense of such a profound loss and provide comfort \n     to each other in this time of great sadness. I know words can \n     do little to heal the heart-wrenching pain that we all feel. \n     But I also know that I--and that all of Mitch's brothers and \n     sisters in the fire service who traveled from across two \n     nations to be here--want you, Mitch's family, to see and feel \n     the love and the sorrow that each and every brother and \n     sister in the fire service family feels today.\n       These emotions are as strong and as heart-felt as anything \n     I can say. They are as genuine as anything I've written on \n     these pieces of paper in my hand.\n       I want you to know that all of us have come here today to \n     put our collective arms around you. Many of us are gathering \n     for a second time today. We also paid tribute to Lieutenant \n     Steven Velasquez.\n       Sadly, we are back together again and it's no easier the \n     second time to say goodbye to one of our own.\n       Many outside of our ranks will refer to Mitch and Steven as \n     heroes. But they didn't set out to be heroes and they didn't \n     think of themselves that way. No, if they were here they \n     would simply tell you they were just doing their jobs.\n       I did not have the honor of knowing Mitch personally, but I \n     do know who he was. I do know that like many who came before \n     him Mitch was drawn to ``The Job'' like countless young men \n     and women who follow their childhood dreams--who experience \n     the calling to service to become fire fighters. But for much \n     of his life Mitch pursued other dreams, and at age 47--two \n     years ago--he answered the calling.\n       He entered this close knit profession like so many of his \n     brothers and sisters in dress blues who surround us now, with \n     a humble confidence, eager to put in the hours with no \n     expectation or desire for public recognition.\n       He summoned the quiet courage that resides in all who come \n     to this work, and he decided he could do it. He was \n     determined--not only that he wanted to do it--but that he \n     needed to do it. And at age 47 he realized a life-long dream, \n     and he joined us on ``The Job.''\n       Mitch was so excited and so proud when he became a fire \n     fighter. He held up his badge to show his kids what Dad had \n     done. He was Local 834's oldest probey.\n       Though he was a rookie, Mitch approached the job like the \n     man he was--accustomed to hard work and long hours and eager \n     to sacrifice for his family and his community.\n       The journey he took to get on the job is remarkable.\n       Sadly, it takes a tragedy like this to remind us just how \n     fragile life can be and how our own journeys can end all too \n     quickly.\n       Sadly, too often it takes a tragedy for a community and its \n     citizens to recognize the courage, dedication, commitment, \n     sacrifice, and service that people like Mitch make day in and \n     day out.\n       And sadly, it takes a tragedy for the rest of the world to \n     see the sacrifice that their families make.\n       So today as we pay our respects to Mitch we also pay our \n     respects to his family--for giving more than you should ever \n     be asked to give. And we pay our respects to you for the \n     sacrifice you have made.\n       Remembering and honoring our fallen is the most solemn, \n     most revered tradition in the fire service.\n       Every year across the United States and Canada a hundred or \n     more fire fighters make the ultimate sacrifice. And when one \n     of our brothers or sisters falls, the fire service family \n     comes together.\n       We come together no matter how near or how far to make it \n     clear to you--Mitch's family--that our hearts ache.\n       We want you to know that his brothers and sisters in the \n     fire service loved him--but we understand that you loved him \n     more.\n       We want you to know that we will miss him tremendously--but \n     we know you will miss him more.\n       We have gathered to embrace you and let you know that your \n     extended family is here, standing with you--and we're not \n     going away.\n       For almost a century we've come together in times of loss \n     to show the love and respect we have for our family and to \n     stand strong for our IAFF brothers and sisters, including \n     here in Bridgeport.\n       We use the tradition-bound symbols of our profession--the \n     men and women in their crisp dress blues, the bagpipers and \n     drummers who play their mournful songs, the Honor Guard \n     standing at attention--to salute those we have lost. And then \n     the ring of the Bell sends them home.\n       This is how we cope.\n       This is how we mourn.\n       This is also how we salute YOU.\n       From all of us in this great union--this brother and \n     sisterhood called the IAFF--we want you to know that your \n     loved one may be gone--but he will never be forgotten.\n       Mitch's name will remain, forever etched in the granite \n     walls of our Fallen Fire Fighters Memorial in Colorado \n     Springs.\n       We do that to show that he left an indelible mark on our \n     lives, that he will forever be a part of our fire fighter \n     family--and so will all of you.\n       Thank you Brother Baik for the gift of your life.\n       May you rest in peace. God bless you and may God bless the \n     fire fighters on the front lines everywhere.\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6875-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THEODORE H. FOCHT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nTheodore H. Focht, a former lawyer, educator, and public servant who \npassed away on April 22, 2010, at the age of 75. I extend my deepest \ncondolences to his wife of 53 years, Joyce, his sons, David and Eric, \nand his grandson Jason.\n  Over the course of more than four decades, starting with his \ngraduation in 1959 from law school at the College of William and Mary, \nTheodore--or Ted, as he was more commonly known to his family and \nfriends--enjoyed an illustrious legal career that took him from \nacademia to the halls of Congress to senior leadership positions at the \nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC. Throughout his \ncareer, Ted earned a well-deserved reputation as an extremely \nknowledgeable and experienced voice on matters related to securities \nlaw and as a dedicated and hardworking public servant.\n  Following a stint as a legal assistant at the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in the early 1960s, Ted became a faculty member at the \nUniversity of Connecticut School of Law in my home State, where he \ntaught classes on securities regulation, administrative law, and \nproperty law. In 1969, Ted took a leave of absence from his work at \nUCONN and moved to Washington, DC, to take on a temporary assignment as \nspecial counsel to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign \nCommerce.\n  When Ted took that position on Capitol Hill, the House Commerce \nCommittee was in the middle of working to pass legislation that would \nprovide critical new protections to U.S. investors from bankrupt and \nfinancially troubled brokerage firms. As the committee's special \ncounsel on securities policy, Ted jumped right into the issue, playing \nan absolutely instrumental role in crafting the Securities Investor \nProtection Act. This legislation, which was signed into law by \nPresident Nixon, created the SIPC--a nonprofit entity that insures the \nassets of investors against brokerage firm failures--and with it, an \nimportant new layer of security and sense of confidence for Americans \nwho wanted to invest in the stock market.\n  But Ted's work on investor protection issues did not end with the \nenactment of that landmark bill. Following its creation, Ted became the \nSIPC's president and general counsel, where he successfully shepherded \nthe corporation through its first two decades of existence. Between \n1971, when he took the helm at the SIPC, until 1994, when he retired \nfrom the corporation, Ted became inextricably linked to the \norganization's work and mission. Indeed, I believe that Ted's work with \nSIPC, both in helping to build the organization as a young \ncongressional staffer and run it after establishment, are among the \nmost striking aspects of his impressive professional legacy.\n  And so I would like to take this opportunity today to thank Ted for \nhis years of dedication to the law--whether as a professor helping to \nshape the minds of young law students at UCONN, or as a senior \nexecutive at the SIPC working to build a safer environment for \nAmericans to invest.\n  And I once again extend my most heartfelt condolences to all of the \npeople who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6875-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SERGEANT ORVILLE SMITH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I honor the life of a true \nAmerican hero. Police SGT Orville Smith, a 39-year veteran of the \nShelton, CT, Police Department, died July 7, 2010, of injuries he \nsustained while in the line of duty. I express my deepest condolences \nto his family, colleagues on the Shelton Police Force, and the entire \ncommunity of Shelton for this tragic loss.\n  It goes without saying that American law enforcement officers such as \nSergeant Smith are a very rare and special breed. Every day, police \nofficers around the country go to work with a singular objective--to \nselflessly protect the communities and the people that they know and \nlove. It is an incredibly rewarding career, but one fraught with \npotential dangers and sacrifices. And unfortunately, men and women in \nlaw enforcement are all too often forced to make the ultimate \nsacrifice, giving their own lives in defense of their fellow citizens.\n  That is exactly what Orville Smith, the first Shelton police officer \nto be killed in the line of duty since 1964, did. Late in the evening \non July 3, while directing traffic outside of a local fireworks event \ncommemorating the July 4 holiday, Sergeant Smith was struck by a drunk \ndriver. He passed away 4 days later, leaving behind a loving wife, two \nchildren, four grandchildren, and a legion of fellow police officers \nwho, during his nearly four decades of service on the force, came to \nknow Sergeant Smith for his fearlessness and unflinching dedication to \nhis job.\n  Indeed, to say that Sergeant Orville Smith was committed to public \nservice and helping his fellow citizens regardless of the personal \nsacrifice required is, in my view, a bit of an understatement. From his \nservice as a U.S. marine in the Vietnam war to his work as a volunteer \nfirefighter, Sergeant Smith made protecting and defending his community \nand countrymen his life's mission.\n  While he planned to retire from the force next year, his heart truly \nbelonged to the Shelton Police Department. It is therefore fitting that \nShelton Police Chief Joel Hurliman called him ``one of the bravest guys \nI ever met'' and went on to say, ``He wasn't scared of anything, except \nretirement.''\n  It was that kind of professional dedication and unwavering commitment \nto public service that made Sergeant Smith not only an exemplary police \nofficer but a wonderful human being. He spent his entire life devoted \nto helping others and relished every minute of it. Several weeks ago, \non the eve of Independence Day, he died that way, too--loyally and \ncourageously fulfilling his duty to ``protect and serve'' until the \nvery end.\n  I express my deepest gratitude to Sergeant--Smith or ``Smitty'', as \nhe was more commonly known by his friends at the Shelton Police \nDepartment--for his tremendous record of service to the people of my \nState and the Nation. I once again extend my most heartfelt condolences \nto all those who knew and loved him. While the death of a loved one is \nnever easy to accept, it is my hope that the fact that Sergeant Smith \ndied doing what he loved will bring them some measure of comfort during \nthe months and years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6875-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6875-S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT STEVEN VELASQUEZ\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I pay \ntribute to LT Steven Velasquez, who sadly lost his life on July 24, \n2010.\n  We have all felt our chests tighten and our pulses quicken with \nanxiety at the sound of a fire engine screaming through town. For most \nof us, this signals two important things: There is an emergency \nsomewhere nearby, and--more importantly--that help is on the way.\n  Of course, for the people riding on those rigs, all the commotion is \njust another day at the office. They are focused solely on the task at \nhand.\n  When the unthinkable happens--a devastating hurricane, industrial \naccident, terrorist attack, or three-alarm fire--these brave men and \nwomen are the first on the scene and the last to leave. In between, \nthey give all they have to make sure the emergency is contained and our \ncommunities are safe.\n  They do this every day of the week, every week of the year. Being a \nfirefighter certainly isn't a job for the faint of heart. In fact, it \nis not so much a job as it is a calling.\n  At least it was for Steven Velasquez. His 20-year career took him \nfrom a position with the Fire Department of Prince Georges County, MD, \nto the rank of Lieutenant in the Bridgeport Fire Department in my home \nState of Connecticut.\n  Along the way, he built a reputation as a tremendously dedicated team \nmember and as someone whose discipline and bravery made him a leader. \nThis reputation, and the urging of many of his colleagues, helped \nsecure him a place on the department's elite Rescue Squad--despite the \nfact that there were others in line for the prestigious assignment \nbefore him.\n  In his 16 years in Bridgeport, Velasquez never took a sick day. He \nwas committed to his family, his community, and to his fellow \nfirefighters.\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\nHis attitude and work ethic led to his being awarded the Bridgeport \nFire Department's third highest honor in 2000, the Medal of Merit.\n  But awards and accolades were not why Lieutenant Velasquez became a \nfirefighter. In fact, he never displayed the many citations he had \nreceived throughout his career on his uniform. He also turned down a \njob with the New York City Fire Department.\n  The reason being?--Bridgeport has more fires.\n  For Lieutenant Velasquez, and firefighters all over our Nation, the \ncall to serve means facing danger every day. The commotion of an \nemergency becomes secondary to the need to help people, and the dangers \nthey personally face must take a backseat to the task at hand.\n  That was the case on the afternoon of July 24, 2010, when Lieutenant \nVelasquez and his colleague, Michel Baik, were conducting a search-and-\nrescue mission on the third floor of a burning house in Bridgeport. \nThey were deep into the blaze, looking for anyone who may need help, \nand trying to ventilate the structure.\n  None of the inhabitants of the home were injured. But tragically, \nboth of these courageous men lost their lives, despite the quick action \nof their colleagues to pull them out of danger and get them to the \nhospital.\n  Tragedies are inherent in this profession, and the risks are shared \nby every single person who has ever gotten the call, rushed to their \ngear, and has run headlong into danger in order to save the life of \nsomeone else. These shared risks help to bind those called to take them \ntogether in a solemn way.\n  Firefighters will do anything for one another, both on the job, and \nwhen the worst happens. The more than 7,000 of their fellow \nfirefighters--from as far away as western Canada--who attended the \nmemorial services for Steven Velasquez and Michel Baik were an \nimpressive testament to that bond.\n  I believe that the eulogy offered in tribute to Lieutenant Velasquez \nby International Association of Fire Fighters President Harold \nSchaitberger at his memorial service speaks well of this solemn \ncommitment. Through these difficult times, the community which Steven \nserved, and those he served with, can provide support and comfort to \nhis loved ones.\n  Of course, no tribute will ever be enough to ease the suffering of \ntheir families. I offer my deepest condolences to Lieutenant \nVelasquez's wife Marianne, his son Aaron, his daughter Salina, and to \nhis entire family. Their sacrifice is unimaginable, and they will \nalways be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I know that we can never make this right for them. But we must \ncelebrate the life and service of Lieutenant Velasquez and make sure \nthat his memory--as a role model and true hero--live on and help to \ninspire others to take up the call to serve.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record President Schaitberger's words to \nwhich I referred.\n  The material follows:\n\n               International Association of Fire Fighters\n\n                     President Harold Schaitberger\n\nEulogy for Lt.

2000.\n       That's why he made lieutenant five months ago.\n       Bursting at the seams with enthusiasm ready to hop on a rig \n     and respond to any call afraid of nothing, eager to \n     experience everything, and ready to give everything he had to \n     do The Job.\n       He had an efficient, studious approach.\n       He understood the importance of training and the importance \n     of being prepared.\n       Committed, duty bound, ready to serve in the hardest, most \n     rewarding job imaginable--that's who Stevie was.\n       Ready to rush to the aid of strangers, no questions asked--\n     that's who he was.\n       Ready to protect his community, ready to comfort those in \n     need, ready to lead people to safety who couldn't find their \n     way out--that's who he was.\n       A devoted family man standing vigil over his newborn \n     daughter's bedside while she gained the strength she needed \n     to persevere--that's who he was.\n       He protected his community and his family--that's who \n     ``Stevie V'' he was.\n       Like many of us he probably considered himself lucky to be \n     a fire fighter, lucky to be able to answer the call, lucky to \n     do something he loved.\n       But we were the lucky ones.\n       The Bridgeport Fire Department, Local 834, the IAFF--we \n     were the lucky ones.\n       His brothers and sisters in Prince George's County Maryland \n     where Stevie started his career in the fire service--they \n     were the lucky ones.\n       His wife, his children, his parents, his brother and \n     sister--you were the lucky ones.\n       That's what I would tell him if he were standing here \n     today.\n       We had quite a gift in Lieutenant Steven Velasquez.\n       And that's why we feel cheated that we have to give him \n     back to the Lord so soon.\n       But we will not forget him.\n       How could we?\n       A young gun . . . a rising star.\n       A shining example of courage, of professionalism.\n       Stevie's name will be etched in our Wall of Honor in \n     Colorado Springs.\n       His name will remain there forever, engraved in that \n     beautiful granite wall--to be honored every year as part of \n     our Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial service.\n       To Stevie's family, we want you to know that you aren't \n     alone.\n       You should know that long after the last word of the last \n     eulogy, the IAFF and Local 834 will be here for you. Today, \n     tomorrow, and for years to come.\n       To Lieutenant Steven Velasquez, who gave his life so others \n     could live, from your 298,000 brothers and sisters in the \n     IAFF--thank you for the gift of your life. May you rest in \n     peace. God bless you and may God bless the fire fighters on \n     the front lines everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6876-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6876-S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KEVIN M. SIMPSON\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I thank and congratulate \nKevin M. Simpson, an individual who has already enjoyed a distinguished \ncareer as a public servant and who is preparing once again to answer \nthe call to service.\n  Kevin is a skilled attorney and litigator, and early in his career he \nmade\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nthe decision to devote his formidable legal talents to public service. \nHe defended numerous Federal agencies in a variety of matters during \nhis years as a young trial attorney with the Department of Justice.\n  In 1997, he served as minority counsel to the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee during its campaign finance investigation. During \n1998, Kevin was Deputy Chief Investigative Counsel to Minority Members \nof the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of President \nClinton. In 1999, he became impeachment counsel to Senate Minority \nLeader Tom Daschle and the Minority Members of the United States \nSenate.\n  Following his service in the legislative branch, Kevin returned to \nthe executive branch as the Deputy General Counsel of Programs and \nRegulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a \nposition he held until the end of the Clinton administration. It was my \npleasure to work with Kevin Simpson at HUD. Kevin earned a reputation \nfor achieving results--all while maintaining unwavering respect for his \ncolleagues and a dedication to fairness and courtesy. He made a \ndifference, and he turned rivals into friends in the process.\n  It was this commitment to making a difference that led Kevin to join \nMax Stier, another outstanding HUD alumnus, in launching the \nnonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service.\n  Armed with the seeds of an exciting idea and a generous financial \ncommitment from the late philanthropist Samuel J. Heyman and his wife \nRonnie, Max Stier and Kevin Simpson built the Partnership for Public \nService to inspire a new generation to serve and transform the way \ngovernment works. This impressive organization works with Federal \nagencies to improve their leadership and management, conducts \ngroundbreaking research, and works closely with universities and job \nseekers, especially young people, to build new pipelines of talent into \ngovernment service. In less than a decade, the Partnership has made a \nmeasurable, positive impact on our government and the story of the \nPartnership's success cannot be told without Kevin Simpson in a leading \nrole. As the Partnership's Executive Vice President and General \nCounsel, there are few achievements in the history of the Partnership \nin which Kevin has not played a pivotal part.\n  After doing so much to improve the effectiveness of the Federal \nGovernment and inspiring a new generation to serve, Kevin is once again \nanswering the call to service--he will soon leave the Partnership for \nPublic Service for his new position as Principal Deputy General Counsel \nat the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These are \nextraordinary times for our Nation and our government, and we need \nextraordinary talent. Kevin Simpson will bring to HUD his intellectual \nheft, a keen strategic mind and his natural ability to build bridges; \nhe is a stellar addition to an already strong leadership team led by a \nmost able Secretary.\n  I thank Kevin Simpson for his years of service to and on behalf of \nour government and the Federal workforce, and I congratulate him on \nthis next chapter of his public service career. I know all of those who \nhave worked with Kevin share my optimism that our Nation will be a \nbetter place thanks to his pursuit of excellence in Federal \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6877-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING CAMDEN'S AEROJET FACILITY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate employees of \nthe Aerojet facility in Camden, AR, for recently achieving the National \nSafety Council's ``Million Work-Hours Award.''\n  Camden Aerojet received the award for reaching one million man hours \nwithout ``a day away from work injury or illness'' between July 7, \n2009, and June 14, 2010. In addition to achieving the prestigious \n``Million Work-Hours Award,'' the Camden facility also garnered \nAerojet's President Safety Award.\n  I commend each and every employee at Camden Aerojet for this \naccomplishment, which speaks volumes about their dedication and \nprofessionalism. Safety should always be a top priority, and I am proud \nof these employees for their steadfast efforts to maintain a safe, \nsecure workplace.\n  I also commend Alice Floyd, Safety Manager at the facility, for her \ndedicated efforts to maintain safety, and Paul Rich, executive \ndirector, for his leadership and commitment to safety.\n  Camden's Aerojet facility helps provide jobs and economic security \nfor countless Camden-area residents. I am proud of the entire Aerojet \nteam for this significant achievement of winning the ``Million Work-\nHours Award.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6877-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL FREY\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mr. \nMichael Frey, a disabled Missouri veteran whose courage, perseverance, \nand fortitude are remarkable and in keeping with the finest traditions \nof Missouri and American values: hard work, independence, humbleness, \nselfless sacrifice, and more.\n  As a young 19-year old soldier in Vietnam, Mr. Frey served as a squad \nleader in Alpha Company 3/21 of the 19th Infantry Brigade. On July 14, \n1969, Mr. Frey and the members of Alpha Company were ambushed near the \nChu Lai base camp. His spinal cord was shattered by enemy fire, and the \ninjuries rendered him paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on a \nventilator for assistance in breathing. Given the extent of his \ninjuries, many doctors would have given Mr. Frey a short time to live, \nbut this special Missourian was about to prove that his case and that \nhe himself was special.\n  Mr. Frey returned to the United States and began receiving full-time \ncare through St. Louis-area Veterans Administration, VA, hospitals, \nwhere he gained the respect and admiration of the hospital staff for \nhis resilience, problem-solving approach, and positivity even as he \nfaced almost unthinkable limitations. On December 7, 1984, 15 years \nafter his spine was shattered in Vietnam, more than double the time \nindividuals with his type of injuries are projected to survive, Mr. \nFrey moved out of the Spinal Cord Injury facility at Jefferson Barracks \nVeterans Hospital and into his own home--a remarkable accomplishment \nfor a person with complete tetraplegia.\n  Since then, Mr. Frey has lived on his own for over 25 years, and he \nis still going strong. Today he actively manages his daily care with \nthe help of a team of care specialists, and he continues to take full \ncharge of his health through preventative care and regular \ncollaboration with VA doctors. He has the benefit of a strong social \nnetwork and a self-confidence that has allowed him to bounce back from \nsetbacks. He also remains an avid St. Louis Cardinals fan and regularly \nattends games. In fact, Mr. Frey developed a special friendship with \nthe late, great St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck, who \nbefriended Mr. Frey in the 1970s and encouraged him along the way.\n  Having survived over 40 years since his injury, Mr. Frey is one of \nthe longest living tetraplegics in the VA system. I honor him today for \nhis wonderful example in coping with his disability. His spirited \napproach to life is emblematic of the courage, honor, and strength of \nthis country's veterans who fight for our freedom. His partnership with \nthe many great professionals in the VA healthcare system in St. Louis, \nwho at once serve him and revere him, is uplifting and embodies how our \nVA system can work best. I join the people of Missouri, and all \nAmericans, in saluting Mr. Frey's courage and to humbly thank him for \nall that he has done, and for all that he endured, for this country. \nMr. Michael Frey is a true American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6877-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6877-S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING EERO SAARINEN\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the birth of Mr. Eero Saarinen.\n  Mr. Saarinen was born in Finland on August 20, 1910, immigrated with \nhis family to the United States in 1923, and became an American citizen \nin 1940. A master of American 20th century architecture, Mr. Saarinen \npassed away on September 1, 1961.\n  In 1948, Mr. Saarinen won the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial \nCompetition with his design for the Saint Louis Gateway Arch, creating \na monument which, in his words, ``would\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nhave lasting significance and would be a landmark for our time.'' One \nof our Nation's most iconic monuments, the Gateway Arch symbolizes \nSaint Louis' role as the ``Gateway to the West'' and celebrates our \nNation's westward expansion. Famed architect Cesar Pelli commented that \nthe Arch is ``a perfect combination of a free gesture with a romantic \nview of modern technology.'' Today, the Arch remains Mr. Saarinen's \nmost widely recognized work.\n  Mr. Saarinen also designed several well known structures including \nthe Trans World Airlines Flight Center at New York's John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport and the main terminal at Washington Dulles \nInternational Airport, which is renowned for its gracefully curving \nroof, suggestive of flight. Missouri is fortunate to also host the \nFirestone Baars Chapel. Designed by Mr. Saarinen, the chapel features a \nunique four-foyer design, and is located on the campus of Stephens \nCollege in Columbia.\n  In addition to his accomplishments in the field of architecture, Mr. \nSaarinen was also a groundbreaking designer of furniture. In 1956, he \ncreated the tulip chair, featured on the original Star Trek television \nseries and considered a classic of industrial design.\n  In recognition of his many achievements, Mr. Saarinen was elected, in \n1954, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, considered \nthe highest formal recognition of artistic merit in the United States. \nIn 1962, Mr. Saarinen was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal from the \nAmerican Institute of Architects. The highest honor bestowed by the \norganization, it is conferred in recognition of a ``significant body of \nwork of lasting influence on the theory and practice of architecture.''\n  On behalf of me and the people of Missouri, it is my sincere pleasure \nto honor the life, achievements, and enduring contributions of Mr. Eero \nSaarinen to Missouri and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6878-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JOHN ``JACK'' BISCOE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a Maine champion \nfor the wilderness and a strong proponent of protecting our natural \nworld. John ``Jack'' Biscoe, who died last year on November 20, \npossessed a stirring passion for the uninterrupted forests of Maine, \nthe mighty Penobscot and Kennebec Rivers, and the White Mountains which \nextend from Maine into New Hampshire.\n  Jack's passion for the environment was not limited to Maine, and in \nfact extended to the breathtaking wilderness of Alaska. He first \ntraveled to Alaska in the 1950s tagging salmon in the Aleutian Islands \nfor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Subsequently, his involvement \nin the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill only spurred his \nengagement in wildlife conservation. At the end of his career, Jack was \none of Maine's most renowned organizers behind protecting Alaska's \nwilderness, and he frequently reminded me that Mainers care about \nprotecting the environment throughout the world.\n  Upon his return to Maine, Jack's concern for wildlife was channeled \nthrough the Sierra Club, and other groups, of which he was an avid \nmember, including the Alaska Wilderness League and the Alaska Coalition \nof Maine. Jack's zeal for environmental protection never waned and his \nvision for a better environment never faltered, and we will long \nremember him as an inspiration of what one person can contribute to the \ngreater good. Jack's life and legacy were emblematic of Maine's deep \ncommitment to retaining our quality of life, and I appreciate the \neffort that he provided on behalf of our Nation's wilderness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6878-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING COURTYARD CAFE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, small businesses are not only the \nlifeblood of our economy, they are often quite literally the heart of \nour neighborhoods and communities. One such business is the Courtyard \nCafe in the northern Maine town of Houlton, which is at the top end of \nInterstate 95 in the United States. Houlton is the county government \nseat for Aroostook County--the largest east of the Mississippi River \ngeographically--and it serves as a major border crossing with our \nState's largest trade partner, Canada.\n  Yet, despite Houlton's critical role in international commerce, it is \nat its core a prime example of small town America. And although \ndowntowns across America, including Houlton, have been suffering over \nthe past several years, people like Joyce and Henry Transue, the owners \nof Courtyard Cafe, have stepped forward to help revitalize these \nregions by opening small businesses that bring new customers and \nincreases revenues to downtown stores. In recognition of their efforts, \ntoday I honor Courtyard Cafe and its owners for the tremendous work \nthey have done to bring their world-class dining establishment to \nHoulton.\n  The Courtyard Cafe got its start over a decade ago, when Chef Joyce \nTransue and her husband Henry opened the quaint restaurant on Main \nStreet in downtown Houlton. But the restaurant's origins date back to \n1993, when Chef Transue began small catering business that she called \nthe Traveling Gourmet. This operation allowed Chef Transue to merge her \npassion for cooking with her zeal for beautiful presentation and \nexceptional hospitality. The Courtyard Cafe continues this tradition as \nChef Transue offers her catering services to local clients either at \nthe restaurant or at a location of their choosing.\n  The Courtyard Cafe has quickly earned a reputation for fresh and \nexciting meals prepared with tremendous skill and attention. Given the \nabundance of local fruits and vegetables in Aroostook County, most \nnotable potatoes, Chef Transue takes painstaking efforts to carefully \nincorporate these items into her divergent menu options, while also \nutilizing other items such as farm-fresh eggs and locally produced \nmaple syrup. All breads, salad dressings, and desserts are homemade at \nthe Courtyard Cafe, and the restaurant sells its famed Raspberry \nVinaigrette, Greek, and White Wine Vinaigrette salad dressings to \ncustomers in store or online thanks to a small manufacturing grant she \naccessed through the Northern Maine Development Center.\n  The restaurant offers delicious and affordable lunch dishes, and \nprovides fresh seafood, poultry, and meat dishes for its dinner \nentrees. Desserts made from scratch include seasonal fruit crisp, \ncheesecake, and tiramisu. In addition, guests can sit at the newly \nrenovated Garden Bar for a more casual dining option. As a truly hands-\non owner, Chef Transue takes her craft seriously, and can always be \nseen in the kitchen arranging meals for customers, starting early in \nthe morning preparing fresh sauces and soups for the day ahead. She has \ncertainly succeeded in providing clients with a small, intimate \nrestaurant tailored to producing exquisite gourmet food in a \ncomfortable setting and relaxing atmosphere.\n  The Courtyard Cafe has rightfully gained recognition as an upscale \ndining destination, with customers travelling from as far away as \nPresque Isle and beyond just to enjoy the delicious meals prepared by \nChef Joyce Transue. Her dedication and enthusiasm for culinary \nexcellence have been exemplary, and I wish her and everyone at the \nCourtyard Cafe continued success in their delectable endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6878-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDMUND CURRY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to establish, promote, and \nsupport a comprehensive prevention, education, research, and medical \nmanagement referral program for viral hepatitis infection that will \nlead to a marked reduction in the disease burden associated with \nchronic viral hepatitis and liver cancer; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a silent killer is loose in America. It \ncontributes to the deaths of 15,000 and threatens the health of 5.3 \nmillion Americans each year. It is more common than HIV/AIDS. It is the \nleading cause of liver cancer, which is on the rise and continues to be \na fatal and costly disease. Yet it remains unrecognized as a serious \nthreat to public health. This silent killer is viral hepatitis.\n  That is why I am introducing the Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer \nControl and Prevention Act of 2010, which authorizes $600 million to \ndevelop a national strategy over the next five years to prevent and \ncontrol Hepatitis B and C.\n  Most people don't even know they have it until years later when it \ncauses cancer or liver disease. We can help avoid such needless \ntragedies with prevention and surveillance programs and by educating \nAmericans on the pervasive nature of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.\n  In January, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, released a report \nentitled ``Hepatitis and Liver Cancer.'' The report concludes that the \ncurrent approach toward treating hepatitis is not working. Too many \nAmericans at-risk for hepatitis or living with it do not know it and \ntoo many health providers are not screening for it. That should come as \nno surprise because there is no Federal funding of core public health \nservices for viral hepatitis. Also, there is no federally funded \nchronic Hepatitis B and C surveillance system.\n  The IOM report calls for a national strategy to prevent and control \nHepatitis B and C.\n  Hepatitis B is 100 times more infectious than HIV and, left \nuntreated, can cause liver disease, liver cancer and premature death \ndecades after infection. About 2 billion people worldwide have been \ninfected with Hepatitis B and about 170 million people are chronically \ninfected with Hepatitis C. Tragically, \\2/3\\ of those infected, on \naverage, are unaware of their status, which increases the chance of \nspreading the disease.\n  Dr. Howard Koh, Assistant Secretary of Health, has convened a task \nforce including representatives from all Department of Health and Human \nServices agencies to develop an action plan to implement the \nrecommendations of the Institute of Medicine Report.\n  Unless action is taken to prevent chronic Hepatitis B and Hepatitis \nC, thousands more Americans will die each year from liver cancer or \nliver disease related to these preventable diseases.\n  The Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention Act \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a \nnational plan for the prevention, control and medical management of \nviral hepatitis in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC, the National Institutes for Health, the National \nCancer Institute, NCI, the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMHSA, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nand the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The national plan is required to include the following components: \neducation and awareness programs; an expansion of current vaccination \nprograms; counseling regarding the ongoing risk factors associated with \nviral hepatitis; support for medical evaluation and ongoing medical \nmanagement; increased support for adult viral hepatitis coordinators; \nand the establishment of an epidemiological surveillance program to \nidentify trends in incidence and prevalence in the disease.\n  The Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention Act of \n2010 also\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nenhances SAMHSA's role in hepatitis activities by providing the agency \nwith the authority to develop educational materials and intervention \nstrategies to reduce the risks of hepatitis among substance abusers and \nindividuals with mental illness.\n  It authorizes nearly $600 million over the next five years to fund \nthe national strategy to prevent and control viral hepatitis.\n  I believe this investment in hepatitis control and prevention could \nsave our country billions of dollars in the coming years. The baby \nboomer population is estimated to account for two out of every three \ncases of chronic Hepatitis C. As these Americans age into Medicare they \nare likely to develop complications and require expensive medical \ninterventions at great cost to taxpayers. In the next decade, the costs \nof Hepatitis C to commercial insurance and Medicare will more than \ndouble, and within 20 years Medicare costs will increase five-fold. \nProjecting further out, over the next 20 years, total medical costs for \npatients with Hepatitis C infection could increase more than 2.5 \ntimes--from $30 billion to more than $85 billion.\n  However, the costs for early detection and intervention are \ndramatically less than the costs for treatment post-infection. The \ncosts for Hepatitis B vaccinations vary but range from $75 to $165, \nwhereas treatment can cost up to $16,000 per year. Screening for \nHepatitis C is also relatively inexpensive compared to treatment that \ncan cost up to $25,000 per year. Untreated, these infections will \ndevelop into liver disease that can cost up to $110,000 per hospital \nadmission. We can do better.\n  Viral hepatitis is an increasingly significant issue for \nMassachusetts. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health reports \nover 2,000 cases of newly diagnosed chronic Hepatitis B infection and \n8,000 to 10,000 cases of newly diagnosed chronic Hepatitis C infection \neach year. Viral hepatitis infections are by far the highest volume of \nreportable infectious diseases to the state. Additionally, there has \nbeen and continues to be a striking increase of cases of Hepatitis C \ninfection among adolescents and young adults in the state. The \nDepartment of Public Health has received reports on over 1,000 cases in \npeople under the age of 25 years every year since 2007, indicating that \nthere is a new epidemic of Hepatitis C disease.\n  Resources to address these complex problems have been extremely \nlimited. Federal resources are scarce with the average award per state \nof $90,000 from the Division of Viral Hepatitis at CDC. That is less \nthan the cost of one hospital admission for liver disease.\n  The Massachusetts State Legislature has, until recently, provided \nmodest funding to support Hepatitis C initiatives in the state. At this \ntime, all of that funding, $1.4 million annually for the past several \nyears, has been eliminated due to the ongoing fiscal crisis. However, \npast funding has allowed Massachusetts to develop innovative programs \nin many areas.\n  State funds have supported disease surveillance initiatives so that \nchanges in the epidemics can be detected, such as the increase of cases \nof Hepatitis C infection among young people or to identify cases of \nviral hepatitis that are being transmitted through non-sterile \npractices in health care settings. Disease surveillance programs have \nbeen used to identify women of childbearing age that are infected with \nHepatitis B so that transmission to their babies can be prevented.\n  The Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention Act of \n2010 would provide critical assistance to Massachusetts and other \nstates by starting to provide appropriate levels of funding to address \nthese epidemics of disease.\n  In Massachusetts, funding would be used to expand disease \nsurveillance efforts so that we can better understand the impact of \nthese infections and direct services appropriately to highly impacted \ncommunities. It would help to expand screening and educational services \nto help identify the large numbers of people in the state living with \nHepatitis B and C that have not been identified. It would provide \nsupport to address the complex prevention needs of adolescents and \nyoung adults who are using drugs and at-risk for infection.\n  Increased funding for adult immunization would assist the State in \nbetter targeting and providing Hepatitis B vaccine to the adults at \nhighest risk, including those that are incarcerated and being treated \nfor drug abuse. Finally, it would also help to provide essential \nmedical management for people already infected with Hepatitis B and C \nwho are not able to access appropriate care currently.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer \nControl and Prevention Act of 2010. I am pleased that 102 hepatitis \nfocused organizations from across the Nation have endorsed the \nlegislation, including the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, \nNational Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, NASTAD, the \nHepatitis B Foundation, the Hepatitis C Association, American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Disease, and the Hepatitis Education \nProject.\n  We have no time to waste. This legislation, along with strategic \ninvestments in public health and prevention programs, can save billions \nof hard earned taxpayer dollars. It can improve the quality of life for \ntens of thousands of people all over America. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport activities that promote early detection and education and to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 3712. A bill to rescind the 3.8 percent tax on the investment \nincome of the American people and to promote job creation and small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Economic Growth \nand Jobs Protection Act of 2010. This legislation would repeal the 3.8 \npercent tax on investment income that was included in the Health Care \nReconciliation Act of 2010, P.L. 111-152, signed into law by the \nPresident earlier this year. I am pleased that Senator Roberts and \nSenator Crapo are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  We know that taxpayers already face the largest tax increase in \nhistory when the 2001 and 2003 tax relief expire at the end of the \nyear. Unless Congress acts, in less than 150 days: the highest \nindividual tax bracket will rise from 35 percent to just under 40 \npercent; people in the lowest tax bracket will see a 50 percent tax \nincrease, from 10 percent to 15 percent; the marriage penalty will \nincrease; the child credit will be cut in half; and taxes on capital \ngains and dividends will increase. In other words, every taxpayer will \npay higher taxes to Washington.\n  But while taxpayers may be concerned about the upcoming tax shock, \nmany may not be aware of another unpleasant surprise that will soon \nfollow. The Health Care Reconciliation Act that was jammed through the \nSenate along partisan lines includes a $123 billion tax on the capital \ngains, dividends, rents, and interest earned by certain taxpayers. \nEnacting this permanent tax hike was a mistake then and is a mistake \nnow. It will discourage savings and investment; it will reduce \nproductivity and will depress wages and the standard of living for \nmillions of Americans. According to the Institute for Research on the \nEconomics of Taxation--a non-profit economic policy research and \neducational organization, a 2.9 percent tax would depress economic \ngrowth by 1.3 percent and reduce capital formation by 3.4 percent. The \ndamage on job and economic growth would be even greater from a 3.8 \npercent investment tax.\n  Simply put, increasing taxes on investment income is a job killer and \nincreases uncertainty at a time that the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve has told Congress that the economic outlook is ``unusually \nuncertain.'' Taxpayers, including small businesses, are already \nscheduled to get hit with the largest tax increase in history in less \nthan 160 days if Congress fails to act. In fact, the top tax rate on \ncapital gains will eventually be 23.8 percent as the rate bounces back \nto 20 percent from 15 percent. And the top tax rate for dividends will \neventually rise to 43.4 percent.\n  Why do we want to pile on the backs of working families and job \ncreators with more taxes that do nothing to create jobs at a time that \nthe national unemployment rate remains 9.5 percent and where in some \nStates, such as Nevada, there is record unemployment? We know the key \nto job creation is to\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\ngrow the economy and allow small businesses to flourish, invest and \ncreate jobs.\n  In fact, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, we will \nneed several years of very strong growth to reach 5 percent \nunemployment. For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by the end \nof 2013, the economy would need to average 5 percent per year. To reach \n5 percent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth of 4.2 percent a \nyear. This is just one reason, that during the health care debate I \noffered a motion that would have directed the Senate Finance Committee \nto report the bill back without the 3.8 percent tax on the investment \nincome. Although my attempt to strip out this job-killing tax fell \nshort, I want to take this opportunity to note that 6 of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle supported my motion.\n  Not only will this legislation protect jobs and the investment \nsecurity of taxpayers, it will also make sure that Congress restores \none of the President's campaign promises. On September 12, 2008, then-\ncandidate Obama promised the American people that, ``Everyone in \nAmerica--everyone--will pay lower taxes than they would under the rates \nBill Clinton had in the 1990s.'' But when combined with the President's \nbudget proposal, this additional tax on investment will raise taxes on \nmany Americans higher than they were under the rates President Clinton \nhad in the 1990s.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this legislation that will repeal \nthis job-killing tax on small business investment, and thus will \nprotect economic growth, jobs, and the retirement savings of taxpayers. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve post-employment restrictions on \nrepresentation of foreign entities by senior Government officers and \nemployees; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nthat will tighten restrictions on individuals who move between the \npublic and private sector--the so-called revolving door. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today aims to better protect the \nUnited States from conflicts of interest posed by this practice, \nparticularly where it comes to senior government officials and \nemployees going on to represent foreign entities--sometimes even the \ngovernments of the very foreign countries in which they had just \nfinished representing the United States.\n  There was a time when public service was held in high esteem, but the \never expanding revolving door between public and private employment has \ngenerated cynicism and frustration. By placing meaningful restrictions \non how quickly former officials can access this door and where it will \ntake them, we can reverse the trend of government employees going off \nto lobby for foreign entities by making clear they are not ``for \nsale.'' This legislation is an important reminder that public service \nshould be treated as an honor and a privilege, and will help to ensure \nthat government officials make decisions based on the best interests of \nthe American people, and not on their future career prospects.\n  Foreign governments and businesses have come to rely on U.S. \nlobbyists to advocate for their interests and interact with key policy \nmakers. According to an article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \nearlier this year, data analyzed by watchdog groups found that ``[m]ore \nthan 340 foreign entities--from governments to separatist groups to \nfor-profit companies--spent at least $87 million on lobbying efforts in \nthe United States between July 2007 and December 2008.'' Former senior \ngovernment officials are in demand to represent or advise foreign \nentities after leaving office. Even from the limited data available, it \nappears at least four recent U.S. Ambassadors--the President's chief \nrepresentatives abroad--have done this kind of work in recent years. It \nis not just ambassadors who go on to represent foreign entities, but \nalso deputy secretaries, under secretaries, other categories of \nexecutive branch officials, and, of course, former members of Congress.\n  The bill I am introducing today will strengthen the post-employment \nrestrictions on foreign entity representation that are already in place \nby both length and scope. It will cover those officials, including in \nthe legislative branch, that are already subject to revolving door \nrestrictions, but expand the current 1-year restriction on \nrepresenting, aiding or advising a foreign entity with intent to \ninfluence to 5 years. It will also expand the definition of prohibited \nentities to include foreign businesses as well as foreign governments \nand political parties.\n  Revolving door restrictions are supposed to protect the U.S. \nGovernment and the people it serves from conflicts of interest and from \nGovernment officials appearing to cash in on their public service. They \nhelp ensure that people representing the United States at the most \nsenior levels are not being influenced by the possibility of securing \nlucrative jobs from outside entities while still in Government and they \nhelp prevent inside knowledge and personal connections to colleagues \nstill in Government from being used on behalf of private parties. These \nare clearly important and legitimate goals and the current 1-year \nprohibition on foreign entity representation is insufficient to secure \nthem.\n  Critics of tightening these restrictions may argue that former \nGovernment officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments can \nsometimes pursue very laudable aims for those governments, such as \nsecuring resources for public health needs. This is surely true. But \nfor every such positive example envisioned, another can come to mind \nthat is notably less constructive, such as lobbying on behalf of \ngovernments with reprehensible human rights records. Moreover, I \nquestion how healthy it is when a culture of lobbying becomes so \nprevalent that foreign governments seeking to advance their objectives \nin the United States may feel obliged to hire their own advocates in \nthis country.\n  We need to restore faith in government, and we can help to do that by \nensuring those who serve at the highest levels do not turn around and \nuse their influence and expertise gained during public service for \npersonal profit and foreign interests. My legislation will help \nbuttress the framework of restrictions that we as members of the \nGovernment impose on ourselves to ensure this broader good. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 \nto provide for certain disclosures under section 552 of title 5, United \nStates Code, (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce an \nimportant bipartisan bill to ensure that the Freedom of Information \nAct, FOIA, remains an effective tool to provide public access to \ncritical information about the stability of our financial markets. My \nbill would amend the Securities and Exchange Act, the Investment \nCompany Act and the Investment Advisers Act to eliminate several broad \nFOIA exemptions for Security and Exchange Commission records that were \nrecently enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act. I thank Senators Cornyn, Kaufman and Grassley \nfor cosponsoring this important open government bill.\n  I am a proud supporter of the historic Wall Street reform bill that \nhas now become law, because this legislation makes significant strides \ntoward enhancing transparency and accountability in our financial \nsystem. But, I am concerned that the FOIA exemptions in Section 929I of \nthat bill, which was originally drafted in the House of Representatives \nand included in the final law, could be interpreted and implemented by \nthe SEC in a way that undermines this very important goal.\n  The Freedom of Information Act has long been the people's window into \ntheir Government, showing where the Government is doing things right, \nbut also where Government can do better. The FOIA has also long \nrecognized the need to balance the Government's legitimate interest in \nprotecting confidential business records, trade secrets and other \nsensitive information from public disclosure and the public's right to \nknow. To accomplish this, care must always be taken to ensure that \nexemptions to FOIA's disclosure requirements are narrowly and properly \napplied.\n  When Congress enacted these exemptions, we were seeking to ensure \nthat the SEC had access to the information that the Commission needs to \ncarry-out its new enforcement powers and to protect American \ninvestors--not shielding information from the public.\n  I have been troubled by the Commission's attempts in recent weeks to \nretroactively apply these exemptions to pending FOIA matters. I am also \ntroubled by the sweeping interpretation that the Commission has \nexpressed, to date, that these exemptions would shield all information \nprovided to the Commission in connection with its broad examination and \nsurveillance activities.\n  This week, I called on the Commission to promptly issue guidelines \nthat interpret the FOIA exemptions in Section 929I in a manner that is \nboth consistent with congressional intent and with the President's \nJanuary 21, 2009, Executive Memorandum on the Freedom of Information \nAct. I look forward to the public release of those guidelines. Given \nthe overwhelming public interest in restoring stability and \naccountability to our financial system, Congress must also take steps \nto address concerns about the exemptions in Section 929I.\n  I thank the many open government organizations, including OpenThe \nGovernment.org, the Project on Government Oversight, the American \nLibrary Association and the Sunlight Foundation for their support of \nthis bill.\n  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic \nissue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value and virtue \nthat we all must uphold. It is in this bipartisan spirit that Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle have joined me in supporting this bill. I \nlook forward to working with them and others in Congress to ensure that \nthe American public has access to important information about the SEC's \noversight of our financial markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO \n                   CERTAIN STATUTES.\n\n       (a) Amendments to the Securities and Exchange Act.--Section \n     24 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78x), as \n     amended by section 929I(a) of the Dodd-Frank Consumer \n     Financial Protection and Wall Street Reform Act (Public Law \n     111-203), is amended by striking subsection (e) and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(e) Freedom of Information Act.--For purposes of section \n     552(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code, (commonly referred \n     to as the Freedom of Information Act)--\n       ``(1) the Commission is an agency responsible for the \n     regulation or supervision of financial institutions; and\n       ``(2) any entity for which the Commission is responsible \n     for regulating, supervising, or examining under this title is \n     a financial institution.''.\n       (b) Amendments to the Investment Company Act.--Section 31 \n     of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-30), as \n     amended by section 929I(b) of the Dodd-Frank Consumer \n     Financial Protection and Wall Street Reform Act (Public Law \n     111-203), is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (c); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively.\n       (c) Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act.--Section 210 \n     of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-10), as \n     amended by section 929I(c) of the Dodd-Frank Consumer \n     Financial Protection and Wall Street Reform Act (Public Law \n     111-203), is amended by striking subsection (d).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 3, 2010.\n     Senator Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Representative Barney Frank,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Dodd and Frank: We, the undersigned \n     organizations concerned with government accountability and \n     transparency, are writing to express our concerns about \n     Section 929I of the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). If \n     interpreted broadly, this provision has the potential to \n     severely hinder the public's ability to access critical \n     information related to the oversight activities of the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby undermining \n     the bill's overarching goals of more transparency and \n     accountability.\n       As you know, Section 929I states that the SEC cannot be \n     compelled to disclose records or other information obtained \n     from its registered entities--including entities such as \n     hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds \n     that will now be regulated by the SEC--if this information is \n     used for ``surveillance, risk assessments, or other \n     regulatory and oversight activities'' outlined in the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act \n     of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n       SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro wrote to you last week defending \n     this provision. She argued that registered entities need to \n     be able to provide the SEC with access to sensitive or \n     proprietary information ``without concern that the \n     information will later be made public.'' She further \n     explained that, prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, \n     ``regulated entities not infrequently refused to provide \n     Commission examiners with sensitive information due to their \n     fears that it ultimately would be disclosed publicly.'' She \n     also claimed that investment advisers routinely refuse to \n     turn over personal trading records of investment management \n     personnel, ``instead requiring staff to review hard copies of \n     the records on the adviser's premises,'' which ``materially \n     impacts the staff's ability to detect insider trading \n     activity.''\n       These arguments do not adequately describe the SEC's \n     existing regulatory authority, and they fail to acknowledge \n     that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) already provides \n     sufficient exemptions to protect against the release of \n     sensitive and proprietary information. Furthermore, the SEC \n     has a troubling history of being overly aggressive in \n     withholding records from the public. For these reasons, we \n     strongly urge you to repeal Section 929I, or to at least \n     curtail the SEC's broad authority to withhold critical \n     information from the public.\n       First, we are not convinced by Chairman Schapiro's claim \n     that ``existing FOIA exemptions were insufficient to allay \n     concerns [about public disclosure] due in part to limitations \n     in FOIA.'' For instance, Exemption 8 protects matters that \n     are ``contained in or related to examination, operating, or \n     condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use \n     of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of \n     financial institutions.'' Chairman Schapiro argues that this\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\n     exemption may not apply to all registrants, but it's worth \n     noting that the courts have broadly construed the term \n     ``financial institutions,'' holding that it is not limited to \n     depository institutions and can also include investment \n     advisers. In addition, Exemption 4 protects ``trade secrets \n     and commercial or financial information obtained from a \n     person [that is] privileged or confidential.'' The Department \n     of Justice's (DOJ) FOIA guide states that this exemption \n     ``encourages submitters to voluntarily furnish useful \n     commercial or financial information to the government and it \n     correspondingly provides the government with an assurance \n     that such information will be reliable,'' calling into \n     question Chairman Schapiro's claim that additional exemptions \n     are needed in order for the SEC to collect information from \n     its registered entities.\n       Second, the SEC's track record with FOIA raises additional \n     concerns about giving the agency even more authority to \n     withhold information from the public. Last year, an audit \n     conducted by the SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG) \n     uncovered a wide range of problems related to the SEC's FOIA \n     operations. We were particularly troubled by the OIG's \n     finding that the SEC Chief FOIA Officer was not operating in \n     compliance with Executive Order 13392 or the OPEN Government \n     Act; that few FOIA liaisons have written policies and \n     procedures for processing FOIA requests, increasing the risk \n     that the agency is unnecessarily withholding information from \n     the public; and that there is an insufficient separation \n     between the initial FOIA determination and the appeal \n     process.\n       The OIG concluded that the SEC's FOIA release rate was \n     ``significantly lower when compared to all other federal \n     agencies.''\n       The OIG put forth a number of recommendations for \n     correcting the glaring deficiencies in the SEC's FOIA \n     operations, such as ensuring that accurate searches are made \n     for responsive information, providing guidelines or written \n     policies for all FOIA-related staff that address the concerns \n     raised by the OIG, and ensuring that all FOIA-related staff \n     has access to sufficient legal expertise to process requests \n     in compliance with FOIA. But according to the OIG's most \n     recent semiannual report to Congress, the SEC has not \n     completed final action on any of these recommendations. \n     Rather than giving the SEC any more leeway to improperly \n     withhold information from the public, we urge you to hold \n     Chairman Schapiro accountable for the excessive delays in \n     implementing the OIG's recommendations.\n       Third, we notice that Chairman Schapiro is ``asking the \n     Commission to issue and publish on our website guidance to \n     our staff that ensures [Section 929I] is used only as it was \n     intended.'' The solution for addressing the uncertainty \n     surrounding this provision is not additional guidance. The \n     solution is clarification in the law that public access is \n     vital to accountability and that the existing FOIA exemptions \n     can adequately protect confidential business information \n     provided by regulated entities.\n       Fourth, Chairman Schapiro neglected to mention that the SEC \n     already has the authority to compel registered entities to \n     provide information and records. Under the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC has the authority to subpoena \n     witnesses and require the production of any records from its \n     registered entities. If these entities fail to comply, the \n     SEC has the authority to suspend these entities, impose \n     significant monetary penalties, and refer cases to DOJ for \n     possible criminal proceedings. But instead of using these \n     existing authorities, Chairman Schapiro seems to think that \n     Congress needs to provide blanket FOIA exemptions in order to \n     convince the SEC's registered entities to cooperate. We think \n     such a blanket exemption fosters an environment that defers \n     to the entities it regulates and is unadvisable.\n       Finally, it is unclear what Chairman Schapiro's plans are \n     for implementing other blanket FOIA exemptions in the Dodd-\n     Frank Act, such as Section 404, which exempts the SEC from \n     FOIA with respect to any ``report, document, record, or \n     information'' received from investment advisers to private \n     funds.\n       In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the need \n     for greater transparency in our financial system is all too \n     apparent. The SEC's ongoing effort to withhold vital records \n     from the public undermines the spirit of the transparency \n     reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act, and flies in the face of \n     President Obama's guidance instructing agencies to adopt a \n     ``presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their \n     commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher \n     in a new era of open Government.''\n       We call on you to repeal the unnecessary FOIA exemption in \n     Section 929I, examine the SEC's current record on withholding \n     information, and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure \n     that the SEC isn't given any additional authority to keep its \n     records under a veil of secrecy. We welcome an opportunity to \n     discuss this issue with you further.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that \nbeneficiaries of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance receive financial \ncounseling and disclosure information regarding life insurance \npayments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Securing \nAmerica's Veterans Insurance Needs and Goals Act of 2010 or the SAVINGS \nAct of 2010. This is similar to a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congresswoman Deborah Halvorson and House Committee \non Veterans' Affairs Chair Bob Filner.\n  This bill ensures that beneficiaries of the Servicemembers' Group \nLife Insurance, SGLI, program receive financial counseling and full \ndisclosure information regarding life insurance payments. Active duty \nmembers of the Armed Forces will be given more information as they \ndecide on disbursement options for their beneficiaries. The SAVINGS Act \noffers specific protections and alternatives to life insurance policy \nbeneficiaries. This bill requires an explanation of how the retained-\nasset accounts differ from traditional checking accounts and leaves \nflexibility for the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nadd more disclosure guidelines as he sees fit.\n  I present this bill to improve the process for our servicemembers and \ntheir families. My concern is that what has become a common industry \npractice, may not be an appropriate solution for every family. The \nSAVINGS Act addresses this challenge by requiring a greater level of \ndisclosure and financial counseling to beneficiaries. This bill helps \nfamilies make sound financial decisions during a most difficult time.\n  It will assist Marylanders and other Americans in difficult times. \nLast week National Public Radio profiled my constituent Cindy Lohman, \nof Great Mills, MD. Ms. Lohman lost her son Ryan when he was killed in \na bombing in Afghanistan in August 2008. She had no idea that the \npackage sent to her from the life insurance company would lead to more \ndifficulty, during an already unbearable time.\n  While a mother grieved, Prudential the company that administers the \nSGLI policies on behalf of the Veterans Affairs Secretary began to \nprocess her survivor's benefits. Understandably too distraught to take \nimmediate action, Ms. Lohman put away the package for 6 months. After \nlooking over the many pages of printed forms and seeing what appeared \nto be a checkbook, Ms. Lohman assumed the money was in a checking \naccount.\n  There were many details in that packet from the insurance company \ndisclaimers and other specifics about the account. It turns out that \nthis was not a standard, FDIC-insured account, but a retained-asset \naccount managed by the insurance company.\n  As we send soldiers to fight overseas, our support for our \nservicemembers and their families must remain steadfast and strong. I \nam proud to serve in this Congress that has worked to honor our \ncommitment to our nation's veterans and to the families of our fallen \nheroes. This is a good bill because it shows our commitment to do what \nis in the best interest of the families of the noble men and women who \nserve in uniform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3725. A bill to-prevent the importation of merchandise into the \nUnited States in a manner that evades antidumping and countervailing \nduty orders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enforcing \nOrders and Reducing Circumvention and Evasion Act--or the ENFORCE Act--\nof 2010.\n  We all know what a tax cheat is; well let me tell you about a trade \ncheat.\n  You see, under U.S. trade laws, when a certain import is found to be \nunfairly traded, that is, it benefits from government subsidies or is \nsold below market prices, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes \nadditional duties on these imports. These duties, we call them anti-\ndumping and countervailing duties, or AD/CVD, ensure that American \nproducers are only asked to compete on a playing field that is level.\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\n  But we have these trade cheats out there. They cheat American \ntaxpayers out of the revenue that is supposed to be collected on \nimports, and which is needed to reduce the budget deficit, and they \ncheat American producers out of business that may otherwise be theirs. \nIn short, the trade cheats steal American jobs and America's treasure.\n  The U.S.' AD/CVD laws form its industries' protective backbone \nagainst injury from illegally dumped or subsidized imports. However, \nthese trade remedy laws are only effective to the extent that they are \nenforced. We have an enforcement problem.\n  The trade cheats are increasingly--and brazenly--employing a variety \nof schemes to evade AD/CVD orders. Sometimes, they hustle their \nmerchandise through foreign ports to claim that it originates from \nsomewhere it doesn't. Other times, the trade cheats will provide \nfraudulent information to government authorities at American ports of \nentry, or engage in schemes to mislabel and misrepresent imports.\n  U.S. industry sources estimate that approximately $91 million in AD/\nCV duties that were supposed to be applied to just four steel products \nwent uncollected as a result of evasion in 2009. This is an amount \nequal to 30 percent of all AD/CV duties CBP collected that year. With \n300 current AD/CVD orders in place on countless products from over 40 \ncountries, the potential for AD/CV duty evasion is vast, and hundreds \nof millions of AD/CV duties may be unaccounted for. Every penny counts \nand we have an obligation to the American businesses, and the workers \nthey rely on, to do a better job.\n  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, is the nation's \nfrontline defense against unfair trade and is responsible for enforcing \nU.S. trade remedy laws and collecting AD/CV duties. Yet if you listen \nto the concerns of domestic producers, as I and many of my colleagues \ndo, timely and effective enforcement of AD/CVD orders remains \nproblematic and AD/CV duty evasion continues, seemingly unabated.\n  I have enormous respect for the men and women of CBP who manage U.S. \nborders, and believe its new commissioner is committed to improving the \ntrade enforcement and trade facilitation functions of CBP. When U.S. \nproducers spend the time and resources to submit to CBP evidence of AD/\nCVD evasion, CBP should be held accountable to acting on that evidence \nand communicating its actions to U.S. industry in a timely manner. It \nis not held accountable now to the degree it should be. I grow \nconcerned that U.S. producers are spending too much time and resources \ntrying to indentify unfair trade and help government agencies enforce \nthe trade laws. American industry needs to be free to do what it does \nbest, which is to innovate and produce goods that are competitive in \nfree and fair markets.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today, with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Snowe from Maine, will go a long way toward empowering the \nFederal Government to do a better job to combat the trade cheats and \nenforce U.S. trade laws. I'd like to highlight just a few of the main \nprovisions.\n  First, the ENFORCE Act will expand the U.S. Department of Commerce's \nauthority to investigate circumvention to include misrepresented \nmerchandise that might evade AD/CVD orders. As the agency tasked with \ninvestigating allegations of dumping and harmful government \nsubsidization, Commerce has the industry and product expertise to \ninvestigate this type of AD/CVD circumvention. This bill will not \ndiminish CBP's role; rather, it will bolster greater cooperation and \ninformation sharing between the two agencies to combat the unfair trade \npractices that hurt U.S. industry and its ability to create jobs.\n  Second, the bill will create a process by which U.S. industry can \nsubmit to CBP a formal petition containing allegations of AD/CVD \nevasion, and CBP must reach a conclusive determination within a set \ntime period. If it cannot, then the petition is transferred to the \nDepartment of Commerce for separate circumvention proceedings. The \nENFORCE Act will require a greater level of responsiveness and \naccountability to U.S. producers while providing for increased \ncollaboration between these two government agencies to improve \nenforcement of U.S. trade laws.\n  Third, the bill will enhance information among the federal agencies \nonce an importer is suspected of evading an AD/CVD order. Many of the \nsame schemes importers employ to evade an AD/CVD order, like \nmislabeling, often shirk other regimes put in place to ensure that \nproducts are safe for consumption by American families. Enhanced \ninformation sharing will provide greater protection against imports \nthat may cause harm to U.S. consumers.\n  This bill presents a commonsense strategy to combat trade cheating \nand the evasion of antidumping and countervailing duty collection. \nEnforcing U.S. trade laws and combating unfair trade practices must be \na central pillar of an economic and trade policy that is designed to \npromote economic growth and job expansion. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the Senate and with my friends in the House of \nRepresentatives to build support for this initiative and to take action \non behalf of American producers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to extend \nprotection to fashion design, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nInnovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act. For years I \nhave been supportive of moving this legislation forward. It not only \nunderscores the importance of the fashion design industry to our \neconomy but will ensure that new and innovative fashion designs are \nafforded proper copyright protection.\n  Throughout my service in the Senate, I have worked on a whole host of \nintellectual property-related initiatives. There is no doubt that \nlegislating in this area is difficult. It is necessary, however, to \nmaintain our position at the forefront of the world's economy and to \ncontinue our country's leadership in global innovation.\n  Make no mistake about it: piracy and counterfeiting are the new face \nof economic crime around the world, far exceeding traditional property \ncrimes. These crimes are the very antitheses of creativity--crippling \ngrowth and stifling innovation in their wake.\n  Last Congress I worked closely with my Senate Judiciary Committee \ncolleagues and others in passing the PRO-IP Act, which was signed into \nlaw by President George W. Bush on October 13, 2008. There is no doubt \nthe PRO-IP bill will ensure that resources are available to enforce \nintellectual property laws and coordinate the government's intellectual \nproperty policies.\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\n  Yet there are no laws prohibiting design piracy.\n  Currently, original designs are copied and the apparel is \nmanufactured in countries with cheap labor, typically in mainland \nChina, Hong Kong, Pakistan, and Singapore. The garments are then \nshipped into the U.S. to directly compete with the garments of the \noriginal designer, sometimes before the originals have even hit the \nmarket. As a result, the U.S. apparel industry continues to lose \nbillions of dollars to counterfeiting each year.\n  We must ensure that all property rights, including fashion designs, \nare protected both here and abroad. Counterfeiting and piracy sap our \ncountry's economic strength. Plain and simple, when a company loses \nrevenues to piracy or counterfeited goods, it does not have those \nresources to reinvest into making more of its goods. And that means \nlost jobs. This domino effect ensnares all within its reach.\n  These crimes not only affect the individual company, but they also \nadversely affect the companies that would have contributed to or \nbenefitted from the unmade goods. Suppliers of raw materials and \ncomponents as well as shippers, distributors, and retailers, all take \nthe hit.\n  In my home State of Utah, I am mindful of the designers who make a \nmeaningful contribution to the fashion industry. Utah designers like \nNappi, Modurrn, and CherellaUSA are committed to quality and original \nclothing lines. These designers, and many more across the Nation, must \nknow that after spending their time and money in developing new and \nunique fashion designs, their works are protected from infringers. They \nshould be able to secure and enforce adequate copyright protections for \ntheir hard work.\n  The Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act represents \na true compromise. The proposed legislation is the product of an \nintensive year of negotiations with interested stakeholders. Among \nother things, the compromise language provides protection to truly \nunique fashion designs. In order to be considered an infringing design, \na plaintiff must demonstrate that a design copy is ``substantially \nidentical.''\n  I am pleased with the progress that has already been made on the bill \nand look forward to working with my colleagues on further refinements \nas it moves through the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kaufman, \n        Mr. Begich, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3732. A bill to establish within the Department of Education the \nInnovation Inspiration school grant program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill, the Innovation \nInspiration school grant program. This legislation will give high \nschool students in New Hampshire and across the country access to non-\ntraditional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs \nas well as the opportunity to be mentored by professionals in those \nfields.\n  I am proud to be joined in introducing this bill today with Senators \nReid, Dorgan, Kaufman, Begich, Bingaman and Kerry and thank them for \ntheir support.\n  We hear so often about the importance of STEM fields and our future \neconomy. These fields--commonly defined as the science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics--are central to U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness and growth. In fact, projections by the U.S. Labor \nDepartment show that STEM-related fields are expected to be the fastest \ngrowing occupations of the next decade.\n  What is worrisome, though, is that too few students in the United \nStates are pursuing education in these STEM fields to keep up with the \nincreased demand in the workforce. For those students that do embark in \nSTEM education, too often they are being outperformed by international \ncompetitors.\n  Simply put, I believe that in today's global economy American \nstudents must have access to better STEM training, have the opportunity \nto be mentored by professionals in the field and be engaged in the \nstudy of these critical fields at deeper, more meaningful levels.\n  This legislation, the Innovation Inspiration School Grant Program, \ndoes that. It will bolster our student's access to quality non-\ntraditional STEM programs. It will grow the STEM pipeline and broaden \naccess to careers in science, technology, engineering and math.\n  We all recognize that community partnerships and especially mentors \nfor our young people are essential to their success. The Innovation \nInspiration School Grant Program will provide states and schools \ncritical resources to engage community members and professional mentors \nwho are working in the STEM fields. I believe that by connecting \nstudents with well-trained teachers and community mentors, we can \nfoster innovation at the high school level and inspire young people to \ngraduate high school, enter the workforce, or go onto college to major \nin science and engineering and pursue careers in these fields.\n  Students in New Hampshire have been participating in non-traditional \nSTEM opportunities, such as those provided by FIRST Robotics, for over \n20 years. And for these students, the experience has been life-\nchanging.\n  Take, for example, Aletha Evangelou, from Nashua, NH. As a result of \nher experience in the Nashua High School FIRST Robotics team, a love of \nengineering grew. She went on to major in mechanical engineering at the \nUniversity of New Hampshire and is now employed at a defense and \naerospace company in our state. She says ``I have been a full time \nmechanical engineer at BAE Systems for two and a half years now, and I \ncan honestly say that I would not be here if I hadn't joined the FIRST \nRobotics program. It completely changed my life.''\n  Aletha is just one example of many students who have benefitted from \nthe type of programs that are supported by this legislation. Every \nstudent in every school across the country should have the opportunity \nto have these sorts of experiences. This legislation does that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me to ensure that high school graduates \nhave the skills and knowledge in the STEM fields necessary to succeed \nin postsecondary education and develop the workforce of the 21st \ncentury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Chambliss:\n  S. 3735. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to improve the use of certain registered pesticides; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, our farmers, foresters, and ranchers \nprovide our Nation and the world with a safe, secure, and affordable \nsource of food and fiber. I have vigorously supported rural America \nthrough my work as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry. We must do all we can to support these \ncommunities, which are the backbone of our great Nation.\n  Unfortunately, because of aggressive litigation and federal courts \nmisinterpreting Congressional intent, our farmers, foresters, and \nranchers are facing new restrictions on their operations. Too often, \nthis results in obligations that are time-consuming, expensive, and \nplainly unnecessary.\n  A prime example of this is the Environmental Protection Agency's, \nEPA, effort to regulate the use of crop protection products under the \nClean Water Act. EPA, at the direction of the Federal courts, is \nrequiring Clean Water Act permits for pesticide applications even if an \napplication does not occur directly into the water. Congress never \nintended for agricultural chemicals to be regulated under the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Farm and forest chemical applications are already subject to another \nfederal statute that protects human health and the environment, the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, FIFRA. Farm and \nforest protection products regulated under FIFRA are subject to \nrigorous scientific testing before they can be sold and used. In \naddition, farmers and foresters must adhere to use instructions \ncontained on pesticide labels.\n  Subjecting farmers to an additional layer of bureaucracy under the \nClean Water Act is duplicative and unnecessary since human health and \nthe environment is already protected by FIFRA.\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\n  Clean Water Act permits for farm and forest chemical use will also be \nexpensive for pesticide applicators and for state regulatory agencies. \nEPA has said that these new requirements will nearly double the number \nof permittees under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination \nSystem, NPDES. This will result in tens of thousands of dollars in new \ncosts and burdens for producers and state regulatory agencies who are \nalready suffering from lack of resources.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to clarify Congress' intent. \nFarmers, foresters, and ranchers already comply with FIFRA and further \nunnecessary regulation should not be required. I am pleased to be \njoined by Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss. The \nbill is very simple: as long as a farmer is complying with FIFRA, then \nno Clean Water Act permit will be required. During the more than 35 \nyears since the enactment of the Clean Water Act, the EPA has never \nrequired a NPDES permit for the application of FIFRA-registered crop \nprotection products. My bill would extend this common sense approach \nand avoid duplicative, unnecessary burdens on our farmers, foresters, \nand ranchers.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. USE OF REGISTERED PESTICIDES.\n\n       Section 3(f) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \n     Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a(f)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(5) Use of registered pesticides.--Notwithstanding any \n     other law, no permit shall be required for--\n       ``(A) the use of a pesticide that is registered or \n     otherwise authorized for use under this Act, if that use is \n     in accordance with this Act; or\n       ``(B)(i) the use of a biological control organism (as \n     defined in section 403 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. \n     7702)) for the prevention, control, or eradication of a plant \n     pest or noxious weed, if that use is in accordance with that \n     Act (7 U.S.C. 7701 et seq.); or\n       ``(ii) the conduct of any other plant pest, noxious weed, \n     or pest control activity under that Act, if that activity is \n     conducted in accordance with that Act.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By. Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3736. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to allow States to opt out \nof the corn ethanol portions of the renewable fuel standard; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with the passage of the 2007 energy bill \n(EISA), Congress doubled the corn-based ethanol mandate despite \nmounting questions surrounding ethanol's compatibility with existing \nengines, its transportation and infrastructure needs, its economic \nsustainability, and numerous other issues. Then, as now, I argued it \nwas just too early to significantly increase the mandate and that the \nfuels industry and engine manufacturers needed more time to adapt and \ncatch up with the many developing challenges facing corn-based ethanol. \nFrom everything we have witnessed over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, I was \nright. These mandates allow no room for error in a fuels industry \nalready constrained by tight credit, dwindling capacity, environmental \nregulation, and volatile market conditions.\n  The corn ethanol mandate has also led to consumer backlash in parts \nof the country. In my home state of Oklahoma, one convenience store \nchain experienced a 30 percent drop in fuel sales once they began \nselling fuel blended at E-10 levels. The consumers didn't want it. In \n2008, the New York Times reported this growing consumer discontent from \nOklahoma City:\n\n       Why Do You Put Alcohol in Your Tank? demands a large sign \n     outside one gas station here, which reassures drivers that it \n     sells only ``100% Gas.''\n       ``No Corn in Our Gas,'' advertises another station nearby. \n     Along the highways of this sprawling prairie city, and in \n     other pockets of the country, a mutiny is growing against \n     energy policies that heavily support and subsidize the \n     blending of ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, into gasoline.\n       Many consumers complain that ethanol, which constitutes as \n     much as 10 percent of the fuel they buy in most states, hurts \n     gas mileage and chokes the engines of their boats and \n     motorcycles.\n\n  Despite this consumer backlash, corn advocates are today pushing \nWashington to require higher consumptions of ethanol. The most pressing \nissue facing corn ethanol is the so-called ``blend wall'' of 10 \npercent. EISA mandated 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol by \n2015. But here is the problem: Federal regulations require that a \ngallon of gasoline should contain no more than 10 percent ethanol. So \nthere will soon be more corn ethanol production than the amount of \nethanol allowed in gasoline.\n  So what is the solution? Corn ethanol advocates have the wrong \napproach. Rather than rethink EISA's corn mandates, they are lobbying \nfor higher, mid-level ethanol blends in gasoline--higher than E10. \nSounds like a simple solution, except its consequences would be \ndire, with potential damage to agriculture, the environment, and engine \nequipment manufacturers.\n\n  Many on-road and non-road engines, vehicles, and equipment are not \nspecifically designed to run on ethanol blends of E10, let alone blends \nas high as E15. The available evidence indicates that lawnmowers, \nchainsaws, snowmobiles, recreational boats, motorcycles, and non-flex-\nfuel cars and trucks produce higher evaporative and engine exhaust \nemissions using mid-level ethanol blends. Also, mid-level ethanol \nblends are more corrosive on certain metals and plastics used in many \nfuel systems, and cause many gasoline-powered engines to run hotter and \nat higher RPM levels. In turn, this results in adverse impacts on \nstarting, durability, operation, performance, and operator safety, due \nto the degradation of critical components and safety devices.\n  The American Lung Association has noted that degradation of catalyst \nefficiency, caused by increasing the ethanol content in gasoline, ``can \nhave a major impact on emissions.'' These higher blends of ethanol can \nalso cause NOX emissions to increase up to 25 percent. In \nshort, we need to be careful that the rapid ramp-up in ethanol use \ndoesn't result in the degradation of our country's air quality.\n  And many consumers complain about decreased fuel efficiency. Corn \nEthanol is 67 percent of the BTU content of gasoline. According to EPA, \nvehicles ``operating on E85 usually experience a 20-30 percent drop in \nmiles per gallon due to ethanol's lower energy content.'' These results \nwere seconded by a Consumer Reports study that found E85 resulted in a \n27 percent drop in fuel efficiency.\n  In my home state of Oklahoma, ethanol's blendwall has eliminated \nconsumer choice. Where consumers could once choose to purchase clear \ngas, the blendwall is now forcing motorists to buy E10. The fuel \nblenders and gas station owners have no option but to sell ethanol \nblended gasoline despite strong consumer demand for clear gas.\n  Today I am introducing a simple three-page bill that responds to the \nincreasing call for more consumer choice in the ability to purchase \nethanol-free gasoline. Simply put, my bill allows a State to opt out of \nthe corn ethanol portions of the renewable fuel standard. To do so, a \nState must pass a bill, signed by the governor, stating its election to \nexercise this option. The opt-out would be recognized by the \nadministrator of the EPA, who would then reduce the amount of the \nnational corn ethanol mandate by the percentage amount of the State \nwhich chooses to opt out. The bill also provides for the generation of \ncredits to hold harmless the refiners who would produce clear gasoline \nsold in an opt-out State.\n  This legislation would allow a State to opt out of only the corn \nethanol mandate. It would not affect other portions of the renewable \nfuel standard such as the cellulosic or advanced biofuels volumetric \nrequirements.\n  I believe Congress blundered in pushing too much corn ethanol too \nfast. This bill will merely allow for fuel producers to respond to \nmarket demands when and where consumers prefer clear gas. Right now \nthey can't do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3738. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for clean energy manufacturing to reduce emissions, to \nproduce renewable energy, to promote conservation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Energy \nTechnology Leadership Act. This legislation would provide tax \nincentives for clean energy manufacturing, renewable energy, and \nconservation. This is a critical package of incentives to drive the \ndevelopment and deployment of clean energy technology in the United \nStates. It also will expand our manufacturing base to ensure that these \nadvanced energy technologies are made here in America.\n  This bill is not intended to serve as a substitute for comprehensive \nenergy and climate legislation. However, it does provide a near-term \nopportunity to support the development and deployment of clean energy \ntechnologies.\n  Congress must continue working on legislation that will put us on a \ncourse to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the events \nof the last several weeks have made it clear that there is no \nbipartisan support for a strong energy and climate bill. In the \ninterim, we should act on areas where there is potential agreement. The \nClean Energy Technology Leadership Act is broad energy tax legislation \nthat focuses on tax incentives to encourage renewable energy and \nconservation. This legislation would extend and improve existing \nprovisions in the tax code and provides some targeted new incentives.\n  The legislation would promote clean energy manufacturing by providing \nadditional funding for the advanced energy manufacturing credit and \nuncapping the credit for solar energy property, fuel cell power \ngeneration, and advanced energy storage systems, including batteries \nfor advanced vehicles. In addition, the legislation would extend the \ncredit for domestic manufacturers of energy appliances.\n  To encourage the production of renewable energy, the Clean Energy \nTechnology Leadership Act would extend for 2 years and codify the grant \nin lieu of tax credit program created by the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009. It modifies the program to clarify that real \nestate investment trusts and public power would be eligible for the \nprogram. The legislation provides an additional $3.5 billion for clean \nrenewable energy bonds, with 60 percent allocated to public power and \nthe remaining 40 percent to cooperative electric rural companies. The \nClean Energy Technology Leadership Act extends the research and \ndevelopment tax credit retroactively through 2012. For 2011 and 2012, \nit would increase the R credit by ten percent for research \nexpenditures related to the fields of fuel cells and battery \ntechnology, renewable energy, energy conservation technology, efficient \ntransmission and distribution of electricity, and carbon capture and \nsequestration.\n  To encourage conservation, the Clean Energy Technology Leadership Act \nwould extend and modify tax incentives for new energy efficient homes, \nnonbusiness energy property improvements, and energy efficient \ncommercial buildings. The bill also would provide incentives for clean \ntransportation by providing incentives for natural gas use in heavy \nvehicles.\n  These provisions will encourage investments in developing and \ndeploying renewable energy and conservation solutions, which will \nresult in lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Clean Energy Technology \nLeadership Act is not a comprehensive energy and climate solution, but \nI believe it is an important starting point. I am hopeful that we can \nsecure bipartisan support for these and other important tax provisions \nand pass them this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Burris, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Brown, of Ohio, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Merkley, \n        Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3739.

Effect on other laws.''.\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator \nRobert Casey and eight of my colleagues in introducing the Safe Schools \nImprovement Act. This important legislation will help to address a \ncrisis going on in our schools--the bullying and harassment of our \nchildren. We know that no child can achieve the high academic standards \nset for them if they are living in fear of bullying or harassment. This \nlegislation will help change the culture in our classrooms and provide \nschools with the tools they need to promote a safe learning \nenvironment.\n  Findings from the 2007 National School Climate Survey demonstrated \nthat a significant number of students experienced harassment in our \nschools, often because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThis study also revealed that 96 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgender students in New York often heard words such as ``gay'' used \nin a negative connotation. Furthermore, 93 percent of students \nregularly heard homophobic remarks. The National School Climate Survey \nalso found that 20 percent of students in New York were physically \nassaulted in their school because of their sexual orientation, while \nanother 13 percent were assaulted because of their gender expression.\n  This environment of harassment and bullying in our schools lowers the \nacademic performance of our students. In fact, 35 percent of LGBT \nstudents reported to have skipped classes at least once in the past \nmonth because they felt unsafe in their own school. I find this to be \nunacceptable.\n  The Safe Schools Improvement Act will require schools and districts \nreceiving designated Federal funds to adopt codes of conduct \nspecifically prohibiting bullying and harassment, including conduct \nbased on a student's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, \nsex, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion. The act would \nensure that schools and school districts focus on effective prevention \nprograms in order to better prevent and respond to incidences of \nbullying and harassment, and would require that States report data on \nincidences of bullying and harassment to the Department of Education.\n  This bill has received support from a broad coalition of nearly 70 \neducation, civil rights, disability, religious, and youth service \norganizations, such as the American Association of School \nAdministrators, American Federation of Teachers, American School Health \nAssociation, National Association of School Psychologists, National \nEducation Association, National Parent Teacher Association, American \nAssociation of University Women, Asian American Justice Center, the \nGay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, Human Rights Campaign and \nthe National Council of La Raza. Additionally the National Safe Schools \nPartnership, strongly endorses the Safe Schools Improvement Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Safe Schools \nImprovement Act. I believe that we must support this legislation to \nensure that all our children can learn in a safe and productive \nenvironment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH:\n  S. 3740. A bill to supplement State jurisdiction in Alaska Native \nvillages with Federal and tribal resources to improve the quality of \nlife in rural Alaska while reducing domestic violence against Native \nwomen and children and to reduce alcohol and drug abuse and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to address \nissues of great concern to me and to all who care about public safety \nin Alaska Native villages. Last week President Obama signed the Tribal \nLaw and Order bill into law. That legislation passed because Congress \nrecognized the great need to provide more support for the criminal \njustice system and communities in Indian Country. While this law has \nsome important provisions that will benefit Alaska Native communities, \nI believe the remoteness and other unique conditions of many Native \nvillages in my State compel us to do more. That is why I am introducing \nthe Alaska Safe Families and Villages Act of 2010.\n  My bill will establish a demonstration project for Alaska Native \ntribes to allow tribes in Alaska to set up tribal courts, establish \ntribal ordinances, and to impose sanctions on those people who violate \nthe ordinances. It would enhance current tribal authority, while \nmaintaining the State's primary role and responsibility in criminal \nmatters. Additionally, those communities selected to be part of the \ndemonstration project would be eligible for an Alaska Village Peace \nOfficer grant to serve those communities in a holistic manner.\n  Unfortunately, because of the vastness of Alaska, too many of our \nAlaska Native villages lack any law enforcement. Too often, minor cases \ninvolving alcohol and domestic abuse go unreported because the nearest \nState Trooper resides in a hub community, located a long and expensive \nairplane ride away. Frequently, harsh weather prevents the Troopers \nfrom flying into a community even when the most heinous acts have \noccurred. Approximately 71 villages have a sole unarmed Village Patrol \nSafety officer, VPSO, who must be on duty 24 hours a day and 7 days a \nweek. These hard-working\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nVPSOs are underpaid, and while communities try to provide some housing \nand heating assistance, in places where fuel oil can cost as much as $8 \na gallon, it can be difficult to sustain the funding for these public \nservants.\n  As one who believes strongly in community involvement, I strongly \nbelieve tribes in Alaska should have a role in their law enforcement \nneeds. This local control not only provides security for the \ncommunities, but also encourages local acceptance of the judicial \nsystem as a whole. With the changes in place that my bill would \nrequire, residents of Alaska Native villages will see a system that \ndoes more than just fly in after a tragedy has occurred.\n  Just recently communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta have \nexperienced an alarming suicide cluster. Unfortunately Alaska Native \ncommunities have grown accustomed to alarming suicide rates, but in the \npast two months there have been at least nine self-inflicted deaths in \nthese villages. Nick Tucker, an elder in Emmonak, recently wrote a \nletter to the State of Alaska's rural affairs director to try to bring \nattention to the issue. Part of his letter begged for the Governor to \ncall the legislature in session and said it is no longer acceptable for \nthem to wait for the Troopers because ``in the villages, they take \nforever.'' Part of this continuing suicide cycle is the presence of \ndrugs and alcohol. Predators do not fear police action when they \nbootleg alcohol or sell drugs in villages, because there is no police \npresence. One can walk into a village, speak with an elder and that \nperson will tell you who is bootlegging alcohol.\n  These communities are full of rich heritage and culture, however many \nhave high unemployment due to the remoteness and lack of opportunity in \nthe village. Most economic development in Alaska happens in either the \nmetropolitan areas, or in very remote areas for resource extraction. \nMany of the villages have unemployment rates above 20 percent. Alaska \nNatives survival is highly dependent on the land. They subsist on game, \nberries, and fish. However, as hunting and fishing stocks dwindle many \npeople are feeling disconnected from their heritage and have turned to \ndrugs and alcohol. Too many people in the villages feel isolated and \nlack a connection, both figuratively and literally. Though educational \nattainment in the last 40 years has increased dramatically, the dropout \nrate in Alaska still hovers at 40 percent. Too many of our young men \nand women have lost hope and are losing a sense of community.\n  We must give our communities the tools necessary to protect \nthemselves. Too often, we pour resources into urban areas, but become \nstuck when we try to work toward solutions for our most remote \ncommunities. We should no longer allow the answer from anyone to be \n``we don't have the resources.'' Alaska Native villages are vibrant, \nstrong communities and we should do everything in our power to work \nwith these communities and answer their calls for help.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me on this legislation, and ask for \nthe full Senate to consider and pass it to provide help to some of the \nplaces in our country most in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3744. A bill to establish Pinnacles National Park in the State of \nCalifornia as a unit of the National Park System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pinnacles \nNational Park Act.\n  This legislation would elevate the Pinnacles National Monument to a \nNational Park. The legislation would also rename the current Pinnacles \nWilderness as the Hain Wilderness after Schuyler Hain, an early \nconservationist whose efforts led to the establishment of the Monument \nin 1908.\n  The Pinnacles National Monument ascends out of the beautiful Gabilan \nMountains, east of central California's Salinas Valley. Established by \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt, the monument protects the spectacular \nremains of the Neenach Volcano. Colossal monoliths, sheer-walled \ncanyons and talus caves exhibit millions of years of volcanic evolution \nand tectonic plate movement.\n  Originally 2500 acres, the monument has grown to encompass 26,000 \nacres of diverse California wildlands. These parklands represent one of \nonly 5 regions, or less than 2 percent of the world's surface area, \nsupporting a Mediterranean habitat. Less than five percent of the \nworld's Mediterranean habitat remains protected, so it is essential \nthat we preserve this special resource.\n  Mediterranean habitats provide a rare combination of cool wet \nwinters, hot dry summer days, and evening fog--supporting many plants \nand animals found nowhere else in the world. One of the animals that \ncalls the Pinnacles home is the critically endangered California \ncondor. Recently, a condor hatched in the wild just outside the \nmonument's boundary--the first to do so in this country in at least 70 \nyears.\n  The Pinnacles area, famously rendered by John Steinbach in ``Of Mice \nand Men'' and ``East of Eden,'' is also an important part of \nCalifornia's cultural heritage. The area has held significance for \nseveral Native American tribes, early Spanish settlers, and Western \nhomesteaders. Today, the Pinnacles are a global destination for \nnaturalists and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds, who are attracted by \nthe park's scenic trails, natural resources, and some of the most \nunique rock-climbing in the world. The Pinnacles National Monument is \nan important driver of the local tourist economy and jobs, and \nelevating this site to a National Park will draw even more attention to \nthis incredible destination.\n  I have worked with Congressman Sam Farr to craft legislation that \nwill further protect this recreational treasure. It has strong support \nfrom the surrounding communities and the California Wild Heritage \nCampaign, a coalition of over 500 businesses and organizations.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing this diverse natural \nand cultural resource by creating Pinnacles National Park.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 3745. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to require the Secretary of Agriculture in the case of low-income \nStates to use 95 percent of the national average nonmetropolitan median \nincome for purposes of determining the eligibility of communities in \nthe States for certain rural development funding; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Rural \nInfrastructure Improvement Act of 2010. This legislation will help \nrural communities have better access to the funding available through \nthe Rural Development programs administered by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, specifically the Rural Water and Wastewater Program and \nCommunity Facility Program.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry, I am strongly concerned that communities in low-income states \nsuch as my state of Arkansas have limited ability to qualify for grant \nfunding through certain Rural Development programs due to current non-\nmetropolitan median household income requirements. The structure we \nhave today creates barriers for many of our poorest rural communities \nthat are most in need. Some of these rural communities have median \nhousehold incomes well below the national average, yet they are \nineligible for any grant funding because USDA applies the State's non-\nmetropolitan median household income to funding formulas instead of the \nnational median household income.\n  This structure creates disparities for many low-income rural States. \nFor example, in Arkansas, a rural community with a median household \nincome greater than the State's non-metropolitan median household \nincome of $31,845 is ineligible for grant funding through the Rural \nWater and Community Facility programs. Rural communities in Arkansas \nwho meet all of the other eligibility requirements for funding through \nthese programs are ineligible for grant funding simply because of their \nlow median income level. In fact, 45 States have a higher non-\nmetropolitan median household income level. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is designed to even the playing field for low-income \nrural communities in Arkansas and several other States.\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n  Forty-eight percent of my home State's population lives in a rural \ncommunity. The programs offered through USDA Rural Development are \nvital to our efforts to meet basic needs and foster economic \ndevelopment. Without the types of key infrastructure improvements that \ncan be made through these rural development programs, it will be \ndifficult for many of these communities to reach their full potential \nand prosper.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill he \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MEDIAN INCOME REQUIREMENT ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Section 306 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \n     Act (7 U.S.C. 1926) is amended by inserting after subsection \n     (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Median Income Requirement Adjustment.--\n       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary applies a median income \n     requirement to communities for purposes of determining \n     eligibility for the community facilities programs and water, \n     waste disposal, and wastewater programs authorized under this \n     section and sections 306A, 306C, 306D, and 306E, in the case \n     of a State for which the State nonmetropolitan median income \n     is equal to or less than 90 percent of the national average \n     nonmetropolitan median income, the Secretary shall use an \n     amount equal to 95 percent of the national average \n     nonmetropolitan median income in applying the median income \n     requirement for any community in the State.\n       ``(2) Termination of authority.--The authority provided by \n     paragraph (1) terminates on September 30, 2012''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 3746. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to improve the \nloan guarantee program of the Department of Energy under title XVII of \nthat Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills, S. \n3746 and S. 3759, making improvements to the operation of the \nDepartment of Energy's loan guarantee program. The first makes a number \nof changes that will ease the administration of the program and allow \nfor quicker processing of applications within the Department. In \naddition, the bill will add a fourth category to the subsidized loan \nguarantee program created and funded in the American Reinvestment and \nRecovery Act that would allow energy efficiency projects to gain access \nto the program. This bill is substantially similar to a provision that \nthe House of Representatives passed last year as a portion of H.R. 2847 \nbut which did not receive consideration in the Senate.\n  The second bill institutes a time limit on consideration by the \nOffice of Management and Budget of loan guarantee applications \nsubmitted by the Secretary. If the Secretary submits a term sheet for \nconditional commitment to OMB for review and comment, then OMB has 30 \ndays to submit such comments. After 30 days the Secretary may issue a \nconditional commitment on the guarantee, taking into account any \ncomments received from OMB, without further authorization from OMB. \nThis provision would not affect the currently used OMB-approved subsidy \ncost model for loan guarantees or its application.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a reduction and limitation on the \ntotal number of Federal employees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reduce and \nCap the Federal Workforce Act. This is a simple straightforward bill \nthat would reduce the number of civilian federal employees--excluding \nthose serving in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security--to \nthe pre-2009 numbers in each government agency through attrition. Once \nthis reduced number is reached, then each agency would cap the number \nof employees at that level. Each hire would then have to be offset by \nanother employee leaving that agency.\n  It is not hard to locate illustrations where the Federal Government \nis growing at an exceptionally fast pace. Looking at the number of \nGovernment employees as a percentage of America's population, one \neasily sees how we have increased the size of the government.\n  In 1815, the total population in America was 8.3 million people, yet \nthere were only 4,837 Federal Government employees. That represents \nnearly \\1/20\\ of 1 percent of Americans who were Federal employees. \nFrom 1981 through 2008, the civilian work force remained at about 1.1 \nmillion to 1.2 million.\n  The Obama administration says the Government will grow to 2.15 \nmillion employees this year serving roughly 310 million Americans. That \nis nearly 1 percent of the population, or put another way, is 20 times \nthe number of government employees than there were in 1815 and almost a \n50 percent increase since 2008. The actual numbers are likely to be \nmuch higher.\n  Some have estimated the newly enacted health care bill could add many \nthousands of Federal employees--as many as 16,000 new Internal Revenue \nService employees alone. It has been reported that the recently enacted \nfinancial regulatory bill will result in the hiring of at least one \nthousand new federal government employees. It has been reported the SEC \nwill need to hire an additional 800 employees alone.\n  I am introducing this legislation in order to ensure that the size of \nour federal government is reduced to the pre-2009 size and does not \nexpand thereafter. This legislation is supported by Americans for Tax \nReform, the American Conservative Union, and Americans for Limited \nGovernment.\n  I believe we need a limited federal government and this legislation \nis one way we can limit the size of the Government while decreasing \nGovernment spending. Our Nation, children, and grandchildren cannot be \nburied in debt created by an agenda to exponentially grow the size of \nthe Government. Enough is enough.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Burr, Mr. Reed, Mr. Ensign, \nand Mr. Franken):\n  S. 3751. A bill to amend the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act \nof 2005; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Stem \nCell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 which \nreauthorizes the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, P.L. \n109-129, through the end of 2015. I am also grateful that Senators \nDodd, Burr, Reed, Ensign and Franken have joined me as sponsors of this \nbipartisan bill.\n  Over the past few months, we have worked with the National Marrow \nDonor Program, NMDP, and cord blood transplantation experts, \nspecifically Dr. Linda Kelley of the University of Utah and Dr. Joanne \nKurtzberg of Duke University. It is my strong hope that our bill is \nconsidered by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions when the Congress returns in mid-September and is signed into \nlaw before the end of the year.\n  Our legislation makes several small but important additions to the \nexisting program.\n  First, the bill reauthorizes both the C.W. Bill Young Cell \nTransplantation Program, which is commonly referred to as the Program \nand the National Cord Blood Inventory program, which is often called \nthe NCBI, for an additional 5 years through 2015.\n  The total authorization levels for both programs combined would be \n$53 million in each of the 5 years, thus staying consistent with the \nauthorization level established in the original statute. Specifically, \nthe authorization level for the program would be $30 million in fiscal \nyears 2011 through 2014 and $33 million in fiscal year 2015. The \nauthorization levels for NCBI would be $23 million for fiscal years \n2011 through 2014 and $20 million in fiscal year 2015.\n  Second, the original statute intended for cord blood banks to become \nself-sufficient in the future. Five years ago, it was our intent that \ncord blood banks would eventually be able to function and operate \nwithout federal funding. In fact, the HELP Committee's August 31, 2005 \nreport states the following on this important issue: ``The committee \nanticipated that the funding authorized for establishing and \nstrengthening the cord blood unit inventory will be devoted primarily \nto defraying the start-up expenses, including developing the expanded \ninventory in an optimal fashion. While we feel that such activities \nclearly have the potential to be self-supporting in time, we also \nrecognize that sufficient funding over an adequate period of time will \nbe necessary for these activities to realize their full potential. It \nis the committee's expectation that the Secretary will closely \nscrutinize all costs related to this legislation, so that tax dollars \nare spent judiciously to achieve the maximum effect.''\n  Almost 5 years have passed since the original statute was signed into \nlaw and cord blood banks are still dependent on Federal funding due to \nthe many obstacles surrounding cord blood collection and cord blood \nstorage. Therefore, our bill includes language to the contracting \nsection requiring qualified cord blood banks to develop an annual plan \nand demonstrate ongoing measurable progress toward achieving self-\nsufficiency. While I recognize and understand that cord blood donation \nand collection is a new, challenging field of research, this \nmodification was extremely important to me to ensure that taxpayers' \nprecious dollars are spent prudently and that public cord blood banks \nare actually doing what the drafters of the original law intended.\n  The contracting provisions of our bill also require cord blood banks \nto provide a plan on how to increase cord blood collection, assist with \nthe establishment of new collection sites or contract with new \ncollection sites. Both the self-sufficiency requirements and the cord \nblood collection requirements would apply to both new cord blood bank \napplicants and existing cord blood banks extending their contracts.\n  Third, our bill also calls for the collection and maintenance of at \nleast 150,000 new units of high-quality cord blood to be made available \nfor transplantation through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation \nProgram. The original statute called for the collection of 150,000 new \nunits, and we believed that there needed to be some flexibility on the \ntotal number of units collected.\n  Fourth, in order to ensure that the appropriate science is reflected \nin this bill, the legislation modifies the definition of a first degree \nrelative as the sibling of an individual in need of a transplant. \nAccording to scientists and researchers who specialize in cord blood \ntransplantation, the only immediate family members able to donate cord \nblood are the siblings of a person in need of a transplant. The \noriginal statute defined first degree relatives as parents and \nsiblings.\n  Fifth, the Program would support studies and demonstration projects \nthat would study increasing cord blood donation and collection from a \ngenetically diverse population, including exploring novel approaches or \nincentives to expand the number of cord blood collection sites \npartnering with federal cord blood banks.\n  Sixth, our bill extends the privacy protections included in the \noriginal statute for cord blood transplant patients and donors to bone \nmarrow transplant patients and donors.\n  Finally, the legislation includes a study on cord blood donation and \ncollection by the General Accountability Office. The final report would \nbe submitted to the appropriate House and Senate Committees one year \nafter enactment of our bill.\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\n  I am proud of this legislation because it proves that bipartisanship \nstill exists in the United States Senate. This subject is near and dear \nto my heart. When this legislation was signed into law in 2005, it \noffered us a rare opportunity to make a difference in the lives of \nthose suffering from a serious illness or those who have family members \nwith illnesses requiring cord blood or bone marrow transplants. Back \nthen, our goal was to increase the number of bone marrow and cord blood \ndonors. Today, our goal continues to be increasing the number of bone \nmarrow and cord blood donations and passage of this legislation will \nmake it easier to do just that.\n  I will continue to do everything possible to provide transplant \npatients with the best possible options by ensuring a strong future for \nbone marrow and cord blood transplantation in this country. Patients in \nneed of a transplant deserve nothing less and passing this legislation \nis the pathway to being successful in that endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, Senator \nReed, Senator Burr, Senator Ensign and Senator Franken in introducing \nthe Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010, a \nbill that will benefit some of the most gravely ill patients--those in \nneed of a\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nblood stem cell transplant. The bill we are introducing today \nreauthorizes the vital work being done for patients as a result of the \nStem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005.\n  I first joined Senator Hatch more than seven years ago on legislation \nto create a national network of cord blood banks and a cord blood \nregistry. Five years ago, when the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee took up cord blood legislation, Senator Hatch and I, \nworking with many of our colleagues on and off the committee, expanded \nthe scope of our legislation to include a reauthorization of the \nnational bone marrow program and updated the cord blood provisions to \nbe consistent with the recommendations made by the Institute of \nMedicine's report, ``Cord Blood: Establishing a National Hematopoietic \nStem Cell Bank Program.'' In the end, that legislation, the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act of 2005, passed the senate unanimously.\n  Since then we have learned a lot of about adult stem cell \ntransplantation. There are currently twelve public cord blood banks \nacross the U.S. and cord blood cells account for 22 percent of all \ntransplants as of 2009. Among minorities, transplants using cord blood \nas the cell source are even higher. As of 2005, survival rates for \ntransplants involving an unrelated donor are almost identical to those \nof a related donor which represents a near doubling of the survival \nrates for unrelated donor recipients over the past 15 years.\n  The bill we are introducing today builds on the success of the \nNational Cord Blood Inventory and the national bone marrow \ntransplantation program, making minor improvements to both. Among the \nmost critical changes to the law is the prioritization of the creation \nof new cord blood collection sites so that we can increase the National \nCord Blood Inventory. The 2005 law set a goal of collecting and \nmaintaining 150,000 new units of high-quality cord blood. \nUnfortunately, the inventory is well below that goal and the \ntransplantation needs of patients. In part, that is because the funding \nhas not kept pace with what was authorized by the 2005 law. While I \napplaud President Obama for including additional funding for the \nNational Cord Blood Inventory and the national bone marrow \ntransplantation program in his fiscal year 2011 budget, I find it \nregrettable that President Bush did not provide full funding for these \nprograms in any of his budgets, despite his vocal support for these \nprograms and adult stem cells generally.\n  In my own state of Connecticut, there are more than 128,000 donors \nparticipating in the National Marrow Donor Program. There is some very \nexciting work going on at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital \ninvolving marrow or cord blood transplantation. In fact, last May, I \nhad the privilege of meeting Ms. Teena Conquest, a bone marrow donor \nfrom Middletown, Connecticut, and the recipient of her bone marrow, \nRebecca Christy, from Iowa. It was truly inspiring to hear their story \nand how one woman's generosity saved another woman's life.\n  I am deeply disappointed that there are currently no cord blood \ncollection sites in the state of Connecticut through the National Cord \nBlood Inventory program. Currently, more than 160 hospitals in the U.S. \nhave an agreement with a public cord blood bank through the National \nCord Blood Inventory program to perform collections for banks within \nthe National Marrow Donor Program network. While none of those \nhospitals are in Connecticut, it is my strong hope that with this \nreauthorization, we will be prioritizing the establishment of new cord \nblood collection sites for the public program. I strongly encourage \nhospitals in Connecticut who meet the criteria to become a cord blood \ncollection site and help increase the inventory of cord blood so that \npatients in need can find a match.\n  As was the case for Ms. Conquest and Ms. Christy, the therapeutic \nbenefits of bone marrow are tremendous and well established. Bone \nmarrow transplants have been used for nearly half a century to treat \npatients suffering from diseases such as leukemia, Hodgkin's Disease, \nsickle cell anemia, and others. The National Marrow Donor Program, \nNMDP, provides a single point of access, the National Registry, to \nnearly 8 million volunteer bone marrow donors and 160,000 cord blood \nunits, including more than 28,000 federally funded units in the \nNational Cord Blood Inventory. The NMDP has helped countless patients \nand families understand their disease and treatment options with \neducational resources and one-on-one case management support.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and my \ncolleagues in support of this important legislation. It is my strong \nhope that we can move quickly to mark up this legislation in September \nand shortly thereafter pass this bill in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3753.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide \npublic safety providers an additional 10 megahertz of spectrum to \nsupport a national, interoperable wireless broadband network and \nauthorize the Federal Communications Commission to hold incentive \nauctions to provide funding to support such a network, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nSafety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act.\n  Radio spectrum is a very valuable resource. It can grow our economy \nand put new and innovative wireless services in the hands of consumers \nand businesses. It can enhance our public safety by fostering \ncommunications between first responders when the unthinkable occurs. \nBut it is also scarce. That is why we need a forward-thinking spectrum \npolicy that promotes smart use of our airwaves--and provides public \nsafety officials with the wireless resources they need to keep us safe.\n  The Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act will do just \nthat.\n  First, this legislation will provide the Federal Communications \nCommission with the authority to hold incentive auctions. This will \nhelp put valuable spectrum resources into the hands of companies that \ncan create innovative new services for American consumers and \nbusinesses. This proposal will not require the return of spectrum from \nexisting commercial users, but will instead provide them with a \nvoluntary opportunity to realize a portion of auction revenues if they \nwish to facilitate putting spectrum to new and productive uses.\n  Second, this legislation will provide public safety officials with an \nadditional 10 megahertz of spectrum known as the ``D-block.'' This \nspectrum will support a national, interoperable wireless broadband \nnetwork that will help first responders protect us and keep us from \nharm. I believe this is the right thing to do, because we owe those \ncourageous individuals who wear the shield the resources they need to \ndo their job. But more than that, by providing authority for incentive \nauctions, this legislation will offer a revenue stream to assist public \nsafety with construction and maintenance of their network.\n  The American people deserve to have the best and most innovative uses \nof wireless networks anywhere. They deserve to know our first \nresponders have access to the airwaves they need when tragedy strikes. \nSo I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3759. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize \nthe Secretary of Energy to issue conditional commitments for loan \nguarantees under certain circumstances; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FOR LOAN GUARANTEES.\n\n       Section 1702 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n     16512) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Deadline for OMB Review.--If the Secretary submits to \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a loan \n     guarantee for review and comment, the Secretary may, taking \n     into consideration comments made by the Director, issue a \n     conditional commitment to enter into the loan guarantee at \n     least 30 days subsequent to the submittal, without further \n     approval from the Director.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3760. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \npersonal savings and retirement savings coverage by allowing employees \nnot covered by qualified retirement plans to save for retirement \nthrough automatic IRAs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Automatic \nIRA Act of 2010. When fully phased in, this bill will give nearly 42 \nmillion Americans nationwide an easy, effective way to take \nresponsibility for their financial futures and plan for a secure \nretirement. The act incorporates the President's call, in his proposed \nfiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 budgets, for Congress to enact \nautomatic IRA legislation.\n  Currently, about half of American workers have no opportunity to save \nfor retirement at work. In my home State of New Mexico, that share is \nnearly 60 percent. Among those lacking coverage at work, only 1 in 10 \ncontributes annually to an individual retirement account, IRA; the rest \ngenerally make no dedicated savings for retirement. The result? An \nalarming number of American workers are woefully unprepared for a \nfinancially secure retirement. According to Boston College's Center for \nRetirement Research, ``in 2009 half of today's households will not have \nenough retirement income to maintain their pre-retirement standard of \nliving, even if they work to age 65, which is above the current average \nretirement age.'' Especially in this period of economic uncertainty, it \nis imperative that Congress focus on this retirement savings crisis. My \nbill takes a commonsense approach to doing so.\n  Under this bill, most private sector employees working in \nestablishments of 10 or more employees who are not currently covered by \na workplace retirement plan would be given the opportunity to save \nthrough regular payroll deposits that continue automatically, unless \nthey elect out. The savings will be deposited into the worker's\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nown IRA, which will be subject to the laws already in place governing \nIRA accounts. Employers' administrative functions will be minimal. And \nthe arrangement is market oriented; other than the smallest of \naccounts, automatic IRAs will be provided by the same banks, mutual \nfunds, insurance carriers, and other institutions that currently \nprovide them.\n  The automatic IRA approach is intended to help these households \novercome the barrier of inertia. It builds on the successful use--\nencouraged by reforms I strongly supported the Pension Protection Act \nof 2006--of automatic features in 401(k) plans that encourage employees \ntoward sensible decisions (while allowing them to make alternative \nchoices). We have already seen evidence that automatic 401(k) \nenrollment can dramatically boost employee participation rates, from \nseven in ten eligible workers to nine in ten. And in the 401(k) \ncontext, the gains are even more striking for population groups least \nlikely to save, including women, Latino, and low-income workers.\n  Of the 75 million American workers who now are not covered by \nemployment-based retirement plans, an estimated 42 million would be \neligible to save and enroll under automatic IRA legislation. This \nincludes more than 250,000 in my home State of New Mexico. Many of \nthese individuals are familiar with IRAs. But when asked why they have \nnot used the existing program, about half point to issues relating to \nsetup and decisionmaking as the key barriers. The automatic IRA would \neliminate these barriers, and the Retirement Security Project estimates \nthat automatic IRA legislation could increase net national saving by \nnearly $15 billion annually.\n  This is the third consecutive Congress in which I have introduced \nautomatic IRA legislation. The concept was initially developed by \nscholars at the Brookings Institution and Heritage Foundation. Indeed, \nthe automatic IRA concept has long enjoyed broad support across the \npolitical spectrum. For instance, Martin Feldstein, chief economic \nadvisor to President Reagan, has described himself as ``a great \nenthusiast of automatic enrollment IRAs'' who thinks ``as a policy, \nit's a no-brainer'' and ``can't imagine why there would be any \nsignificant opposition from political players on either side of the \naisle.''\n  Finally, this bill seeks to send a strong signal of preference for \nemployers to offer qualified retirement plans, like 401(k)s. Among \nother features, it doubles the credit for employers that newly \nestablish qualified plans and it directs the Secretaries of the \nTreasury and Labor to implement final regulations and establish a model \nplan for Multiple Employer Plans.\n  I am grateful that my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Kerry, is joining me in introducing this bill. I am also \npleased to note the broad range of stakeholders supporting the \nautomatic IRA concept, including AARP; the American Society of Pension \nProfessionals & Actuaries; Aspen Institute's Initiative on Financial \nSecurity; the Business and Professional Women's Foundation; CFED; \nConsumers Union; FINRA; the Minority Business Roundtable; New Economics \nfor Women; the United States Black Chamber; the United States Women's \nChamber of Commerce; Women Impacting Public Policy; and the Women's \nInstitute for a Secure Retirement.\n  Ensuring easy access to a retirement account and the ability to have \npart of their wages go directly from their paycheck into this account \nare proven strategies to encourage retirement savings. I call on the \nSenate to take up this bill in the fall and to include it in \nlegislation extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 3762.

Mr. President, today, I join Senators \nBingaman, Bennet of Colorado, and Udall, in submitting a resolution to \nrecognize the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad on its 40th \nanniversary this August. Representative Lujan, a member of the New \nMexico delegation, is introducing a companion resolution in the house.\n  The Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad has been an integral part of \nthe Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado economies since its \nconstruction in 1880 as part of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad's \nSan Juan Extension.\n  From its construction until it was abandoned in 1969, the railroad \nprovided a critical passenger and freight link serving communities \nthroughout New Mexico and Colorado.\n  In 1970, recognizing the economic impact abandonment of the line \nwould have on communities served by the railroad and appreciating the \nrailroad's historic significance, New Mexico and Colorado came together \nto purchase the facilities, locomotives, cars and line between Chama, \nNM and Antonito, CO. To acknowledge the sheer beauty of the route, they \nrenamed it the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n  Since that time the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad has been \nrecognized as a national historic site and, by the American Society of \nCivil Engineers, as a civil engineering landmark acknowledging the \nchallenging terrain the railroad crosses.\n  Today, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic railroad continues to be \ncritical to the local communities. The railroad offers tourists trips \ndaily between May and October and serves to showcase the history and \nbeauty of this region of the country.\n  These trips offer a glimpse into railroad travel of the past and \nprovide the visionary tourist a taste of what could be with future \nexpansion of passenger rail in the West.\n  In August, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad will celebrate 40 \nyears of co-ownership and this resolution honors its efforts in \npreserving the history of and building a future for railroad in \nAmerica.\n  I ask all my Senate colleagues to join Senators Bingaman, Bennet, of \nColorado, Udall of Colorado and me in recognizing the Cumbres and \nToltec Scenic Railroad days by agreeing to this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6907-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 611--CONGRATULATING THE CUMBERLAND VALLEY ATHLETIC \n CLUB ON THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RUNNING OF THE JFK 50-MILE ULTRA-\n                                MARATHON\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Kennedy set as a national goal \n     the improvement of the health of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas President Kennedy, in 1963, issued an Executive \n     order challenging United States Marine officers to finish a \n     50-mile race in 20 hours, matching a similar challenge issued \n     in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt;\n       Whereas, since that Executive order, thousands of \n     Americans, not just servicemen and women, have taken up the \n     challenge of the JFK 50-Mile Ultra-Marathon;\n       Whereas, since the inception of the JFK 50-Mile Ultra-\n     Marathon, all members of the Armed Services have been invited \n     to meet the challenge set by Presidents Kennedy and Roosevelt \n     over an historic race course;\n       Whereas between 30 and 40 percent of participants in the \n     JFK 50-Mile Ultra-Marathon each year are active duty military \n     or veterans;\n       Whereas each of the branches of the United States Armed \n     Forces fields at least 1 team each year in the JFK 50-Mile \n     Ultra-Marathon, and the Navy typically fields several teams;\n       Whereas much of the course of the JFK 50-Mile Ultra-\n     Marathon is located on Federal land, including the historic \n     C Canal, the Appalachian Trail, and Antietam Battlefield;\n       Whereas the JFK 50-Mile Ultra-Marathon includes the War \n     Correspondents Memorial Arch, a national monument located in \n     Gathland State Park in the State of Maryland; and\n       Whereas following the assassination of President Kennedy, \n     the first JFK 50-Mile Ultra-Marathon was organized as a way \n     to honor President Kennedy, and has been held annually, rain \n     or shine, ever since: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends and congratulates the past, present, and \n     future participants and organizers of the JFK 50-Mile Ultra-\n     Marathon; and\n       (2) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Cumberland Valley \n     Athletic Club as an expression of the best wishes of the \n     Senate for a glorious year of celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6907-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6907-S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 612--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 9, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL \n            FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Specter, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Hatch, and Mrs. Murray) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 612\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions than the term ``fetal \n     alcohol syndrome'' and therefore has replaced the term \n     ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term describing \n     the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose \n     mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $6,000,000,000 in 2007, and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $860,000 and $4,000,000 during the \n     lifetime of each such individual;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if ... a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol ... would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2010, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2010, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6908-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 613--RECOGNIZING THE 63RD ANNIVERSARY OF INDIA'S \n INDEPENDENCE, EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO AMERICANS OF INDIAN DESCENT \nFOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND OPTIMISM \nFOR THE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES \n                        AND INDIA IN THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       Whereas these positive developments and trends are evidence \n     of the success of the United States civil-military strategy \n     in Iraq and are essential to the ongoing reduction of United \n     States military forces from the current troop levels of \n     approximately 64,000 to approximately 50,000 combat and \n     combat support troops by September 1, 2010, further signaling \n     a robust and ongoing commitment to advise and assist Iraqi \n     Security Forces, while retaining the ability to respond in \n     direct support of Iraqi Security Forces when necessary and to \n     conduct counterterrorism operations against insurgent and \n     terrorist elements: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies \n     of the United States initiated in 2006 and sustained from \n     2007 until the present day have successfully enabled the \n     Government of Iraq to reach major milestones in the critical \n     areas of security, governance, and rule of law and have set \n     the conditions for the responsible and gradual reduction of \n     United States combat and combat support units from Iraq and \n     the change of their mission to advising and assisting the \n     Iraqi Security Forces;\n       (2) United States Forces-Iraq was instrumental in effecting \n     the recruitment, training, retention, and employment of \n     approximately 700,000 Iraqi Security Forces who have assumed \n     and maintained the lead for security operations within the 18 \n     provinces of Iraq;

Res. 70\n\n       Whereas on August 14, 1945, the people of the United States \n     received word of the end of World War II;\n       Whereas on that day, people in the United States and around \n     the world greeted the news of the Allies' noble victory with \n     joyous celebration, humility, and spiritual reflection;\n       Whereas the victory marked the culmination of an \n     unprecedented national effort that defeated the forces of \n     aggression, brought freedom to subjugated nations, and ended \n     the horrors of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas these historic accomplishments were achieved \n     through the collective service and personal sacrifice of the \n     people of the United States, both those who served in uniform \n     and those who supported them on the home front;\n       Whereas more than 400,000 Americans gave their lives in \n     service to their country during World War II;\n       Whereas August 14, 1945, marked not only the end of the \n     war, but also the beginning of an unprecedented era of \n     rebuilding in which the United States led the effort to \n     restore the shattered nations of the Allies and their enemies \n     alike and to create institutions to work towards a more \n     peaceful global community;\n       Whereas the men and women of the World War II generation \n     created an array of organizations and institutions during the \n     postwar era which helped to strengthen American democracy by \n     promoting civic engagement, volunteerism, and service to \n     community and country;\n       Whereas the courage, dedication, self-sacrifice, and \n     compassion of the World War II generation have inspired \n     subsequent generations in the United States Armed Forces, \n     including the men and women currently in service in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and around the world;\n       Whereas the entire World War II generation, military and \n     civilian alike, has provided a model of unity and community \n     that serves as a source of inspiration for current and future \n     generations of Americans to come together to work for the \n     continued betterment of the United States and the world; and\n       Whereas the second Sunday in August has been proposed as \n     ``Spirit of '45 Day'' to commemorate the anniversary of the \n     end of World War II on August 14, 1945: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress supports the observance of \n     ``Spirit of '45 Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6909-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6909-S6910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 71--RECOGNIZING THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL \nINTEREST IN HELPING TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE ACTS OF GENOCIDE AND OTHER \n   MASS ATROCITIES AGAINST CIVILIANS, AND SUPPORTING AND ENCOURAGING \n   EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO PREVENT AND \n                           MITIGATE SUCH ACTS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 71\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the \n     international community vowed ``never again'' to allow \n     systematic killings on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, \n     race, or religion;\n       Whereas a number of other genocides and mass atrocities \n     have occurred, both prior to and since that time;\n       Whereas the United States Government has undertaken many \n     initiatives to ensure that victims of genocide and mass \n     atrocities are not forgotten, and as a leader in the \n     international community, the United States has committed to \n     work with international partners to prevent genocide and mass \n     atrocities and to help protect civilian populations at risk \n     of such;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly adopted the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide in 1948, which declares genocide, whether committed \n     in a time of peace or in a time of war, a crime under \n     international law, and declares that the parties to the \n     Convention will undertake to prevent and to punish that \n     crime;\n       Whereas the United States was the first nation to sign the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, and the Senate voted to ratify the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 11, 1986;\n       Whereas the Act entitled, ``An Act to establish the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Council'', approved October 7, 1980 \n     (Public Law 96-388) established the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Council to commemorate the Holocaust, establish a \n     memorial museum to the victims, and develop a committee to \n     stimulate worldwide action to prevent or stop future \n     genocides;\n       Whereas the passage of the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-606), also known \n     as the Proxmire Act, made genocide a crime under United \n     States law;\n       Whereas, in response to lessons learned from Rwanda and \n     Bosnia, President William J. Clinton established a genocide \n     and mass atrocities early warning system by establishing an \n     Atrocities Prevention Interagency\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n     Working Group, chaired by an Ambassador-at-Large for War \n     Crimes Issues from 1998 to 2000;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the United States and all other members \n     of the United Nations agreed that the international community \n     has ``a responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, \n     humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with \n     Chapter VI and VIII of the United Nations Charter, to help \n     protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \n     cleansing and crimes against humanity,'' and to take direct \n     action if national authorities are unwilling or unable to \n     protect their populations;\n       Whereas the 2006 National Security Strategy of the United \n     States stated, ``The world needs to start honoring a \n     principle that many believe has lost its force in parts of \n     the international community in recent years: genocide must \n     not be tolerated. It is a moral imperative that states take \n     action to prevent and punish genocide. . . . We must refine \n     United States Government efforts--economic, diplomatic, and \n     law-enforcement--so that they target those individuals \n     responsible for genocide and not the innocent citizens they \n     rule.'';\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the \n     American Academy of Diplomacy, and the United States \n     Institute of Peace convened a Genocide Prevention Task Force, \n     co-chaired by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \n     and former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, to explore how \n     the United States Government could better respond to threats \n     of genocide and mass atrocities;\n       Whereas the final report of the Genocide Prevention Task \n     Force, released in December 2008, concluded that the lack of \n     an overarching policy framework or a standing interagency \n     process, as well as insufficient and uncoordinated \n     institutional capacities, undermines the ability of the \n     United States Government to help prevent genocide or mass \n     killings and offered recommendations for creating a \n     government wide strategy;\n       Whereas the former Director of National Intelligence, in \n     his annual threat assessment to Congress in February 2010, \n     highlighted countries at risk of genocide and mass atrocities \n     and stated, ``Within the past 3 years, the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo and Sudan all suffered mass killing \n     episodes through violence starvation, or death in prison \n     camps . . . Looking ahead over the next 5 years, a number of \n     countries in Africa and Asia are at significant risk for a \n     new outbreak of mass killing.'';\n       Whereas the Quadrennial Defense Review, released in \n     February 2010, states that the Defense Department should be \n     prepared to provide the President with options for \n     ``preventing human suffering due to mass atrocities or large-\n     scale natural disasters abroad'';\n       Whereas the 2010 National Security Strategy notes, ``The \n     United States is committed to working with our allies, and to \n     strengthening our own internal capabilities, in order to \n     ensure that the United States and the international community \n     are proactively engaged in a strategic effort to prevent mass \n     atrocities and genocide. In the event that prevention fails, \n     the United States will work both multilaterally and \n     bilaterally to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, \n     and--in certain instances--military means to prevent and \n     respond to genocide and mass atrocities.'';\n       Whereas genocide and mass atrocities often result from and \n     contribute to instability and conflict, which can cross \n     borders and exacerbate threats to international security and \n     the national security of the United States;\n       Whereas the failure to prevent genocide and mass atrocities \n     can lead to significant costs resulting from regional \n     instability, refugee flows, peacekeeping, economic loss, and \n     the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and \n     reconciliation; and\n       Whereas United States leadership and actions toward \n     preventing and mitigating future genocides and mass \n     atrocities can save human lives and help foster beneficial \n     global partnerships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) recommits to honor the memory of the victims of the \n     Holocaust as well as the victims of all past genocides and \n     mass atrocities;\n       (2) affirms that it is in the national interest and aligned \n     with the values of the United States to work vigorously with \n     international partners to prevent and mitigate future \n     genocides and mass atrocities;\n       (3) supports efforts made thus far by the President, the \n     Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence to improve \n     the capacity of the United States Government to anticipate, \n     prevent, and address genocide and mass atrocities, including \n     the establishment of an interagency policy committee and a \n     National Security Council position dedicated to the \n     prevention of genocide and other mass atrocities;\n       (4) urges the President--\n       (A) to direct relevant departments and agencies of the \n     United States Government to review and evaluate existing \n     capacities for anticipating, preventing, and responding to \n     genocide and other mass atrocities, and to determine specific \n     steps to coordinate and enhance those capacities; and\n       (B) to develop and communicate a whole of government \n     approach and policy to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate acts \n     of genocide and other mass atrocities;\n       (5) urges the Secretary of State, working closely with the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development--\n       (A) to ensure that all relevant officers of the Foreign \n     Service and particularly those deploying to areas undergoing \n     significant conflict or considered to be at risk of \n     significant conflict, genocide, and other mass atrocities \n     receive appropriate advanced training in early warning and \n     conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution;\n       (B) to determine appropriate leadership, structure, \n     programs, and mechanisms within the Department of State and \n     the United States Agency for International Development that \n     can enhance efforts to prevent genocide and other mass \n     atrocities; and\n       (C) to include relevant recommendations for enhancing \n     civilian capacities to help prevent and mitigate genocide and \n     mass atrocities in the upcoming Quadrennial Diplomacy and \n     Development Review;\n       (6) urges the Secretary of the Treasury, working in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, to review how \n     sanctions and other financial tools could be used against \n     state and commercial actors found to be directly supporting \n     or enabling genocides and mass atrocities;\n       (7) recognizes the importance of flexible contingency \n     crisis funding to enable United States civilian agencies to \n     respond quickly to help prevent and mitigate crises that \n     could lead to significant armed conflict, genocide, and other \n     mass atrocities;\n       (8) urges the Secretary of Defense to conduct an analysis \n     of the doctrine, organization, training, material, \n     leadership, personnel, and facilities required to prevent and \n     respond to genocide and mass atrocities;\n       (9) encourages the Secretary of State and Secretary of \n     Defense to work with the relevant congressional committees to \n     ensure that a priority goal of all United States security \n     assistance and training is to support legitimate, accountable \n     security forces committed to upholding the sovereign \n     responsibility to protect civilian populations from violence, \n     especially genocide and other mass atrocities;\n       (10) supports efforts by the United States Government to \n     provide logistical, communications, and intelligence support, \n     as appropriate, to assist multilateral diplomatic efforts and \n     peace operations in preventing mass atrocities and protecting \n     civilians;\n       (11) calls on other members of the international community \n     to increase their support for multilateral diplomatic efforts \n     and peace operations to more effectively prevent mass \n     atrocities and protect civilians;\n       (12) encourages the Secretary of State to work closely with \n     regional and international organizations, the United Nations \n     Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, and civil \n     society experts to develop and expand multilateral mechanisms \n     for early warning, information sharing, and rapid response \n     diplomacy for the prevention of genocide and other mass \n     atrocities; and\n       (13) commits to calling attention to areas at risk of \n     genocide and other mass atrocities and ensuring that the \n     United States Government has the tools and resources to \n     enable its efforts to prevent genocide and mass atrocities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6910-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6910-S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4588.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Levin (for himself and Mr. Lugar)) \nproposed an amendment to the resolution S. Res. 322, expressing the \nsense of the Senate on religious minorities in Iraq; as follows:\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas the territory of Iraq, the land of Mesopotamia, has \n     millennia of rich cultural and religious history;\n       Whereas the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians thrived \n     within what are now the borders of Iraq;\n       Whereas the biblical patriarch Abraham was born in Ur, King \n     Hammurabi ruled from Babylon, and Imam Ali, the founder of \n     Shiite Islam, died in Kufa;\n       Whereas during the 35-year rule of the Baath Party and \n     Saddam Hussein, and despite the Provisional Constitution of \n     1968 that provided for individual religious freedom in Iraq, \n     the Government of Iraq severely limited freedom of religion, \n     especially for religious minorities, and sought to exploit \n     religious differences for political purposes, leading the \n     United States Government to designate Iraq as a ``country of \n     particular concern'' under the International Religious \n     Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292) because of \n     systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious \n     freedom;\n       Whereas members of religious minority communities of Iraq, \n     both those who have been forced to flee the homeland in which \n     their ancestors have lived for thousands of years and those \n     who remain in Iraq, are committed to maintaining their \n     presence in Iraq and keeping alive their communities' \n     cultures, heritage, and religions, but threats against them \n     jeopardize the future of Iraq as a diverse, pluralistic, and \n     free society;\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\n       Whereas despite the reduction in violence in Iraq in recent \n     years, serious threats to religious freedom remain, including \n     religiously motivated violence directed at vulnerable \n     religious minorities, their leaders, and their holy sites, \n     including Chaldeans, Syriacs, Assyrians, Armenians and other \n     Christians, Sabean Mandeans, Yeazidis, Baha'is, Kaka'is, \n     Jews, and Shi'a Shabak;\n       Whereas the March 2010 Report on Human Rights issued by the \n     Department of State identifies ``insurgent and extremist \n     violence, coupled with weak government performance in \n     upholding the rule of law'' resulting in ``widespread and \n     severe human rights abuses'' as among the significant and \n     continuing human rights problems in Iraq;\n       Whereas although violence has impacted all aspects of \n     society in Iraq, there have been alarming levels of \n     religiously motivated violence in Iraq in recent years;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom continues to recommend that the Secretary \n     of State designate Iraq as a ``country of particular \n     concern'' under the International Religious Freedom Act of \n     1998, because of the systematic, ongoing, egregious \n     violations of religious freedom in Iraq;\n       Whereas scores of holy sites in Iraq have been bombed since \n     2004;\n       Whereas members of small religious minority communities in \n     Iraq do not have militia or tribal structures to defend them, \n     often receive inadequate official protection, and are \n     legally, politically, and economically marginalized;\n       Whereas in the Nineveh and Kirkuk governorates, where \n     control is disputed between the Government of Iraq and the \n     Kurdistan regional government, religious minorities have been \n     targeted for abuse, violence, and discrimination;\n       Whereas before 1951, non-Muslims comprised some 6 percent \n     of the population of Iraq, with Jews as the oldest and \n     largest of these communities, tracing back to the Babylonian \n     captivity of the sixth century BCE, but today the Jewish \n     community in Iraq numbers in the single digits and \n     essentially lives in hiding;\n       Whereas religious minorities in Iraq, who made up about 3 \n     percent of the population of Iraq in 2003, make up a \n     disproportionately high percentage of registered Iraqi \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the number of Christians in Iraq was approximately \n     1,400,000 according to the 1987 Iraqi census but, according \n     to the 2009 Report on International Religious Freedom issued \n     by the Department of State, may now number only 500,000 to \n     600,000;\n       Whereas the United States is gravely concerned about the \n     viability of the indigenous Christian communities of Iraq and \n     other religious minority communities, and the possible \n     disappearance of their ancient languages, culture, and \n     heritage;\n       Whereas the Sabean Mandean community in Iraq reports that \n     almost 90 percent of its members have fled Iraq, leaving only \n     about 3,500 to 5,000 Mandeans in Iraq as of 2009;\n       Whereas the Baha'i faith, estimated to have fewer than \n     2,000 adherents in Iraq, remains prohibited in Iraq under a \n     1970 law;\n       Whereas although hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees \n     and internally displaced persons have returned to their areas \n     of origin, the numbers of religious minority returnees to \n     Iraq are disproportionately low; and\n       Whereas members of religious minority communities of Iraq \n     in diaspora have organized to support their communities in \n     Iraq in ways that also benefit the whole of Iraq society by \n     encouraging the rule of law, enhanced security, employment, \n     education and health services: Now therefore be it\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nPresident's nominee to be the next Director of National Intelligence, \nDNI--GEN James Clapper, U.S. Air Force, Lieutenant General retired.\n  I am pleased his confirmation will be approved by unanimous consent.\n  General Clapper is well qualified to be the Director of National \nIntelligence. He has as much experience in the intelligence profession \nas anyone serving in the government today.\n  He has held a wide range of positions that have prepared him for this \nposition, in the U.S. military, as the head of two intelligence \nagencies, and in the private sector. General Clapper is currently the \nhighest ranking intelligence official in the Department of Defense, \nserving as the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.\n  He has clearly expressed his views on the position of the DNI and \ndescribed how he intends to carry out those views.\n  Last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee reported out his \nnomination on a rollcall vote of 15-0.\n  Not a single objection that was raised in the Senate following the \ncommittee's unanimous vote was related to the nominee, his background, \nhis views, or how he intends to serve.\n  And now I am pleased to report that those objections have been worked \nout and General Clapper will be approved by unanimous consent.\n  Let me take a few minutes and describe the position to which General \nClapper has been nominated, the Director of National Intelligence, or \nDNI.\n  The DNI position was first seriously considered by the so-called \n``Joint Inquiry'' into the attacks of September 11, 2001--a joint panel \nof the Senate and House Intelligence Committees that studied the events \nleading to the attacks of 9/11 and the structural problems in the U.S. \nGovernment that led to our failure to prevent them.\n  The Joint Inquiry concluded that the Intelligence Community--the \ncollection of intelligence agencies and offices across the Federal \nGovernment--could not be led by the same person who was simultaneously \nserving as the Director of the CIA.\n  This congressional panel recommended, in December 2002, that the \nNational Security Act be amended ``to create and sufficiently staff a \nstatutory Director of National Intelligence who shall be the \nPresident's principal advisor on intelligence and shall have the full \nrange of management, budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to \nmake the entire U.S. Intelligence Community operate as a coherent \nwhole.''\n  Two years later, the 9/11 Commission, led by former Governor Tom Kean \nand former Congressman Lee Hamilton, came to the same conclusion and \nrecommended the creation of a National Intelligence Director to \n``manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies \nthat contribute to it.''\n  A few months later, in December 2004, the Congress passed the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, IRTPA, that created \nthe position of DNI.\n  By statute, the position of the Director of National Intelligence is \nthe senior-most intelligence position in the U.S. Government. The DNI \nis, under the law:\n\n       The head of the 16 different offices and agencies that make \n     up the U.S. intelligence community;\n       The principal advisor to the President on intelligence \n     matters; and\n       The official in charge of developing the intelligence \n     budget.\n\n  Despite that expansive charge, the first 5 years with a Director of \nNational Intelligence at the helm of the intelligence community have \nbeen unsteady times. There have been three Directors in 5 years: \nAmbassador John Negroponte, ADM Mike McConnell, and ADM Dennis Blair.\n  It is the strong hope of the Senate Intelligence Committee that \nGeneral Clapper will provide some stability to the office and set it on \na more stable path.\n  He was asked about this in the committee's confirmation hearing. \nSenator Whitehouse asked General Clapper if he intended to stick \naround. General Clapper responded ``Yes, sir, I will. I wouldn't take \nthis on without thinking about that. And I do think my experience has \nbeen, it does take time to bring these changes about.''\n  And certainly changes are needed. I have discussed with General \nClapper my concern that the position of DNI could be considered the job \nof a coordinator someone--who makes sure the 16 agencies are carrying \nout their roles and working harmoniously.\n  But that was not what the job was designed to be, and that isn't \ngoing to be sufficient to put in place the changes we need. The \nDirector needs to set priorities, develop the budget accordingly, \noversee agencies' implementation, and make changes when problems or \ngaps arise. These include:\n\n       Making sure the systems and personnel are in place to make \n     sure the dots are connected before a terrorist attack;\n       Ensuring there is sufficient intelligence collected by \n     human and technical means so that decisionmakers have an \n     accurate and full set of facts before setting policies--for \n     example, on sending troops to war;\n       Reviewing intelligence programs and activities to make sure \n     they fit squarely within the Constitution and the law, and \n     that Congress is provided with the information it requires to \n     conduct independent oversight; and\n       Managing the intelligence budget to make sure it is spent \n     without waste, abuse, or inappropriate duplication.\n\n  These are not the jobs of a coordinator; they are the jobs of a \nDirector. General Clapper recognizes these as the obligations of the \nDNI.\n  The last thing I would like to note on the position of the DNI is its \nstatutory authorities, and the limits placed on them.\n  In particular, the DNI is constrained from directing 15 of the 16 \nagencies and offices of the intelligence community, because they reside \nin various Federal departments. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, IRTPA, states that in carrying out his \nresponsibilities, the DNI may not ``abrogate'' the statutory \nresponsibilities\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\nof Cabinet Secretaries. This is often interpreted to prevent \ncentralized direction.\n  The 16th agency, the CIA, is not housed within a department, but it, \ntoo, has demonstrated its ability to thwart the DNI's directives it \ndislikes by importuning the White House.\n  We understand from former officials in the DNI's office that both \nproblems have greatly frustrated past DNIs' ability to lead.\n  General Clapper has served on the DNI's executive committee under \nDirectors McConnell and Blair. He has seen firsthand how this tension \nbetween the DNI's direction and the views of a Cabinet Secretary has \nplayed out.\n  Indeed, General Clapper has been very forthright that as the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence since 2007, part of his \nresponsibility has been to uphold and support the interests of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  But he has also assured the Intelligence Committee that, if \nconfirmed, this would change. During his confirmation hearing, General \nClapper said, ``I have been, for the last three years, the \nUndersecretary of Defense for Intelligence. And I considered it my \nresponsibility and my obligation to defend and protect the secretary's \nauthorities and prerogatives to the maximum extent I could. If I were \nconfirmed as the DNI, I will be equally assiduous in ensuring that the \nDNI's prerogatives and authorities are protected and advanced.''\n  Even so, General Clapper has a track record of taking concrete steps \nto ensure that the interests of the Department of Defense and the \nintelligence community are synchronized, and both are enhanced to \nimprove our national security.\n  What is more, General Clapper is perhaps unique in that he has strong \nrelationships with the President and the national security team at the \nWhite House, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director--the three \nmost important relationships for a DNI to be successful.\n  So in short, I believe that General Clapper will bring to the \nposition of the DNI the right approach, skills, and gravitas to make \nthis work.\n  I will continue to work with him, like the committee has worked with \npast Directors, to make changes in the law to give him the authorities \nand flexibility that he needs.\n  The Senate has just passed unanimously a revised version of the \nfiscal year 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act. That bill includes 10 \nprovisions to strengthen the DNI's ability to run his office and direct \nthe intelligence community. Eight of those ten provisions were \nrequested by this administration or the last one, and I will continue \nto push to get this important bill signed into law soon.\n  Let me say a few words now about General Clapper himself.\n  General Clapper has served in the intelligence field for 46 years, \nalmost all of which was in military and government service.\n  His 32 years of military service in the U.S. Air Force included \nwartime operations, flying 72 combat support missions over Laos and \nCambodia and being a wing commander.\n  He has served as the Director of Intelligence, the J-2, for three \nwarfighting commands--at U.S. Forces Korea, the Pacific Command, and \nthe Strategic Air Command.\n  In the 1990s, Lieutenant General Clapper led the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, DIA, one of the biggest and most complex of the agencies in the \nintelligence community.\n  He retired from active duty in 1995 after this position and worked in \nthe private sector until he was asked to return to government service \nand lead the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, NIMA--since renamed \nthe National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, NGA. He led NGA for 5 \nyears--an unusually long tenure heading an intelligence agency--until a \ndifference of opinion with Secretary Rumsfeld cost him his job in \n2006--and provided a notable example of General Clapper's willingness \nto ``speak truth to power.''\n  In 2007, General Clapper once again put aside the benefits of a \nprivate life and agreed to serve under Secretary Gates as the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence.\n  As he said in his confirmation hearing, the nomination to be DNI \n``was an unexpected turn of events. I'm in my third tour back in the \ngovernment, and my plan was to walk out of the Pentagon about a \nmillisecond after Secretary Gates. I had no plan or inkling to take on \nanother position.''\n  Nonetheless, he has agreed to take on this challenging and somewhat \nthankless position.\n  General Clapper was nominated by the President on June 7, 2010. He \nanswered more than 150 tailored pre-hearing questions in addition to \nour standard questionnaire and appeared before a lengthy confirmation \nhearing on July 20.\n  After the hearing, he answered another 79 questions for the record \nand appeared in a subsequent closed session meeting with four members \nof the committee who had additional questions.\n  If there were questions or doubts about his nomination, they have \nbeen answered. In fact, when General Clapper was nominated, I had my \ndoubts about having another person in this position with a military \nbackground and whether he viewed the position of DNI as a coordinator \nor a director.\n  My concerns have been allayed. I am confident that he will be mindful \nof the important intelligence needs of the military and the Department \nof Defense, but he will be independent of Pentagon interests. He \nunderstands that the responsibility of the DNI is to provide strategic \nintelligence to policymakers and that the job requires more than simple \ncoordination.\n  On July 29, the Intelligence Committee voted out General Clapper's \nnomination on a roll call vote of 15 to 0.\n  The committee has expressed its full support of General Clapper. He \nhas excellent credentials, support from the White House and other key \nintelligence officials, and will be a strong Director of the \nIntelligence Community.\n  I congratulate General Clapper on his confirmation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I voted in support of the confirmation of \nGeneral Clapper to be Director of National Intelligence. He is clearly \nqualified for the position and his extensive experience at various \nintelligence agencies and at the Pentagon should give him a clear sense \nof the challenges ahead.\n  Over the course of the confirmation process, General Clapper provided \nencouraging responses on a number of issues. He expressed clear support \nfor the declassification of the top-line intelligence budget, which \nwould allow for the establishment of a separate intelligence budget. \nThis reform, which was recommended by the 9/11 Commission and passed by \nthe Senate, would improve transparency, accountability and oversight. \nHe also agreed with the principle that the public should be made aware \nof secret interpretations of law. Finally, in a welcome shift from the \nprevious DNI, General Clapper expressed openness to recommendations \nprovided by an independent commission related to the integration of the \nintelligence community and those in the U.S. Government who collect \ninformation openly. Legislation to create this commission has also \npassed the Senate.\n  On other issues, General Clapper's responses were less encouraging. \nHe indicated that he would be a ``zealous advocate'' for full \nnotification of the committee, and I have no reason to doubt that. But, \nwhen asked about statutory reporting requirements under the National \nSecurity Act, he cited an incorrect interpretation of the law, \nspecifically the assertion that the ``Gang of Eight'' provision that \nappears only in the covert action section could apply to other \nintelligence activities. As DNI, General Clapper will be responsible \nfor adhering to the law, regardless of the views of counsel.\n  I am also concerned about his responses to questions on the PATRIOT \nAct, in which he described proposed safeguards on National Security \nLetter authorities as ``crippling.'' As he becomes familiar with these \nand other surveillance authorities, and the abuses associated with \nthem, I hope that he will become more open to efforts to protect the \nprivacy and civil liberties of Americans.\n  General Clapper has testified that the DNI already has sufficient \nauthorities, and I agree that the ODNI should not be expanded for its \nown sake. But there are specific, identifiable problems with how the \nintelligence community spends taxpayer dollars which are\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\naddressed in provisions of the intelligence authorization bill and my \nControl Spending Now legislation. While I will continue to fight for \nthose provisions, I have asked General Clapper to tackle these issues \nwith or without new statutory authorities. I will also continue to seek \ngreater access by the GAO to the intelligence community, an issue on \nwhich General Clapper has expressed some flexibility.\n  Finally, General Clapper is in a unique position to address one of \nthe great failings of intelligence reform thus far--the extent to which \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities are conducted by the \nmilitary, away from the oversight of the congressional intelligence \ncommittees. In some cases, such as cybersecurity operations, I remain \nconcerned about the division of authorities but have been kept \nreasonably informed. In other cases, specifically the Department of \nDefense's use of ``Section 1208'' authorities to assist foreign forces \nand irregular groups supporting counterterrorism operations around the \nworld, I have generally been stonewalled. General Clapper has stated \nthat, as DNI, these activities will not be his responsibility. But the \nDNI, particularly one with General Clapper's background, should be \nassertive in ensuring that the intelligence community and the military \nare operating in a coordinated fashion under coherent and consistent \npolicies, and that the congressional intelligence committees are kept \nfully informed of all relevant programs and operations.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session and consider \nCalendar No. 886, Kimberly Mueller to be a United States District Judge \nfor the Eastern District of California; that there be 1 hour of debate \nwith respect to the nomination, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we just confirmed 47 nominations plus 3 \ndistrict court judges, a circuit court judge, and we will continue to \nwork on the balance of these when we return.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I understand there has just been an \nagreement reached and entered into the Record regarding a number of \nappointments that were on the Executive Calendar. I understand further \nthat--in fact, I discovered just recently--there is a rule anybody who \nis pending on the Executive Calendar when there is a recess of longer \nthan 30 days needs to be resubmitted.\n  There are a number of judges who, applying that rule and the order, \nwould need to be resubmitted by the President. Two of them, as I \nunderstand it, are district judges. What I would like to do is ask \nunanimous consent regarding those two. I know there is nobody from the \nminority party on the floor of the Senate right now, so I am not going \nto ask that unanimous consent and take advantage of the lack of their \npresence on the floor. But I would like to ask that someone come to the \nfloor so I may ask unanimous consent, as to district court judges who \nare pending on the Executive Calendar, that the application of that \nrule be waived for this recess.\n  These are names that are going to be resubmitted anyway. It adds \nnothing to the process other than just an extra, sort of deliberate and \nunnecessary hassle to require those submission and committee procedures \nto be replayed.\n  It is also my understanding there has been a tradition in this body \nthat while circuit court nominees are considered what one might call, \nfor better or worse, political fair game, there has been a tradition of \ncourtesy and comity regarding district court judges who sit in the \nSenator's home State when both of the home State Senators have agreed \nto and accepted the President's recommendations and supported it, given \ntheir blue slip to the committee and so forth.\n  So I guess I will put the Senate back into a quorum call so that I \ncan discuss this with my colleagues on the other side. But I hope very \nmuch that as a personal courtesy they would accept that amendment to \nthe order that was just entered, which I believe is consistent with the \ntraditions and practices of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\n  For now I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am in an interesting predicament. I \nam informed there is no one from the minority party in town; this being \nthe end of session, everybody has headed home. Therefore, there is no \none around to respond to my unanimous consent request.\n  I will confess, I am inclined to take advantage of this moment by \npropounding the unanimous consent, which I would obviously win. The \nPresiding Officer would grant the order, since there would be no \nobjection.\n  But I also believe that to do so would be inconsistent with the \ncourtesies and the traditions of the Senate, and so I will not take \nthat step at this time. But it is frustrating to be in this position of \nholding myself back out of respect for the traditions and courtesies of \nthe Senate, when I feel that, at the moment, I am on the losing end of \na violation of the courtesies and the traditions of the Senate.\n  So by the rule of what is good for the goose, my inclination to take \nadvantage of this moment is reinforced. But I have great respect for \nthis body, and I think the tradition that one does not propound \nunanimous consent requests without a member of the minority party \npresent to object or otherwise respond or vice versa is one that merits \nrespect.\n  Notwithstanding the predicament I find myself in, let me just say, in \nthat absence of courtesy that has brought me here, I will yield the \nfloor and we can return to this question when the Senate resumes. But \nfor any who are listening, I think we are taking a step that some may \nregret, when the tradition of respect for the judgment of the home \nState Senators regarding a district court judge in their home State is \ndisregarded in this way.\n  I will say no more. I will follow up when we return to session.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to speak about \nthe passage of a bill that is a top priority for the disability \ncommunity--Rosa's Law. As always, I have greatly appreciated the \nopportunity to work with Senator Mikulski on this bill. I would like to \nthank her for her leadership and her commitment to this issue.\n  The bill is simple in nature but profound in what it will do when it \nis enacted. Rosa's Law will change the phrase ``mentally retarded'' to \n``an individual with an intellectual disability'' in all of the laws \nthat fall\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\nunder the jurisdiction of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions, HELP, without negatively impinging or expanding upon the \nrights, services, benefits, or educational opportunities that people \nwith this diagnosis are entitled to. It will make a greatly needed \nchange that should have been made well before today.\n  Some people will ask why this bill is so important and why it is \nneeded. They will wonder if Congress has more important work to do than \nto change a few words in our laws for the sake of being politically \ncorrect. In response, I would share what Rosa's brother Nick said to \nthe Maryland General Assembly. ``What you call people is how you treat \nthem. What you call my sister is how you will treat her. If you believe \nshe's `retarded' it invites taunting, stigma. It invites bullying and \nit also invites the slammed doors of being treated with respect and \ndignity.''\n  For far too long we have used hurtful words like ``mental \nretardation'' or ``MR'' in our Federal statutes to refer to those who \nare living with intellectual disabilities. While the way people feel is \nimportant, the way people are treated is equally important. When words \nsuch as ``MR'' are used to describe a person, it dehumanizes them, and \nas Nick said, it leads to a situation in which some people are not \ntreated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n  This is not the first time Congress has taken similar action. Our \nlaws once referred to people with intellectual disabilities with terms \nlike ``feeble minded'' and other language that I cannot bear to say. \nBack then we thought that was the appropriate language to use until we \nswitched to using the term ``MR.'' Forty years later, we are taking \nanother big step and replacing ``MR'' with ``intellectual disability.''\n  This change is already taking place across the country with \norganizations like the American Association on Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities which dropped the term ``MR'' from its name. \nLikewise, The Arc of the United States has stopped using this archaic \nterminology and dropped the term from their agency name. The American \nPsychiatric Association, which publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, has already voted to use the term \n``Intellectual Disability'' in the next publication of their manual. \nInternationally, the World Health Organization uses the term \n``intellectual disability.''\n  This bill will start the process of change in the Federal Government \nand make such terminology consistent. The President's Committee on \nMental Retardation was changed by executive order so it is now the \nCommittee on Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention also uses the term ``intellectual \ndisability.'' After the House passes this bill it will become law and \nbegin a chain of events that I hope will lead to the Finance \nCommittee's action on this matter so we can see similar changes in \nMedicaid and Social Security programs.\n  In 1963, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ``I have a \ndream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they \nwill not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of \ntheir character.'' That same concept rings true for people with \nintellectual disabilities--that they will also be judged by who they \nare and not by a label that has been forced upon them. That's the \nbeauty and simplicity of this bill--and why it is so important.\n  Finally, there are a number of people I would like to thank for their \nassistance with passing this bill out of the Senate. First, on my staff \nI would like to thank Frank Macchiarola, HELP Committee staff director, \nGreg Dean, HELP Committee general counsel, Beth Buehlmann, education \noffice staff director, and Aaron Bishop, professional staff member on \ndisability policy for their determination and hard work on this bill. I \nalways say that I have the best staff in Congress and I couldn't have \ndone it without them. I would also like to thank Mario Cardona with \nSenator Mikulski's office and Lee Perselay and Michael Gamel-McCormick, \nwith Senator Harkin's office, for their leadership and effort to get \nthis bill through the Senate, and for working with us in a true \nbipartisan fashion. I would also like to thank Pattie DeLoatche and \nKaren LaMontagne from Senator Hatch's office, Karen McCarthy from \nSenator Murkowski's office, and David Cleary from Senator Alexander's \noffice for their assistance with putting this bill together, Liz King \nwith Legislative Counsel for drafting the bill, and Cassandra Foley \nfrom the Congressional Research Service for her work.\n  Next, the bill would not have been a success without the work of so \nmany families and groups. We all need to thank Rosa Marcellino, her \nbrother Nick and the entire Marcellino family for their strength, \ndetermination, and willingness to lead, teach and for not being afraid \nto voice their opinion and say that this just hasn't been right.\n  While this bill may not change the whole world, it will make the \nworld a little better, more hospitable place for us and for the entire \ndisability community.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to Clinical \n     Trials Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Advances in medicine depend on clinical trial research \n     conducted at public and private research institutions across \n     the United States.\n       (2) The challenges associated with enrolling participants \n     in clinical research studies are especially difficult for \n     studies that evaluate treatments for rare diseases and \n     conditions (defined by the Orphan Drug Act as a disease or \n     condition affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans), where the \n     available number of willing and able research participants \n     may be very small.\n       (3) In accordance with ethical standards established by the \n     National Institutes of Health, sponsors of clinical research \n     may provide payments to trial participants for out-of-pocket \n     costs associated with trial enrollment and for the time and \n     commitment demanded by those who participate in a study. When \n     offering compensation, clinical trial sponsors are required \n     to provide such payments to all participants.\n       (4) The offer of payment for research participation may \n     pose a barrier to trial enrollment when such payments \n     threaten the eligibility of clinical trial participants for \n     Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits.\n       (5) With a small number of potential trial participants and \n     the possible loss of Supplemental Security Income and \n     Medicaid benefits for many who wish to participate, clinical \n     trial research for rare diseases and conditions becomes \n     exceptionally difficult and may hinder research on new \n     treatments and potential cures for these rare diseases and \n     conditions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 612\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions than the term ``fetal \n     alcohol syndrome'' and therefore has replaced the term \n     ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term describing \n     the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose \n     mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $6,000,000,000 in 2007, and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $860,000 and $4,000,000 during the \n     lifetime of each such individual;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2010, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2010, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Levin \nsubstitute amendment to the resolution, which is at the desk, be agreed \nto; the resolution, as amended, be agreed to; that a Levin substitute \namendment to the preamble, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to; the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate and any statements \nrelating to this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4604) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4604\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute to the resolution)\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following: That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States remains deeply concerned about the \n     plight of vulnerable religious minorities of Iraq;\n       (2) the United States Government and the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Iraq should urge the Government of \n     Iraq to enhance security at places of worship in Iraq, \n     particularly where religious minorities are known to be at \n     risk;\n       (3) the United States Government should continue to work \n     with the Government of Iraq to ensure that members of ethnic \n     and religious minorities communities in Iraq--\n       (A) suffer no discrimination in recruitment, employment, or \n     advancement in the Iraqi police and security forces; and\n       (B) while employed in the Iraqi police and security forces, \n     where appropriate, be assigned to their locations of origin, \n     rather than being transferred to other areas;\n       (4) the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan regional \n     government should work towards a peaceful and timely \n     resolution of disputes over territories, particularly those \n     where many religious communities reside;\n       (5) the United States Government and the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Iraq should urge the Government of \n     Iraq to--\n       (A) implement in full those provisions of the Constitution \n     of Iraq that provide protections for the individual rights to \n     freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief and \n     protections for religious minorities to enjoy their culture \n     and language and practice their religion; and\n       (B) reduce onerous registration requirements so that \n     smaller religious groups are not disadvantaged in \n     registering;\n       (6) the Government of Iraq should take affirmative measures \n     to reverse the legal, political, and economic marginalization \n     of religious minorities in Iraq;\n       (7) the United States Government should assist, consistent \n     with local aspirations and developmental needs, ethnic and \n     religious minorities in Iraq to organize themselves civically \n     and politically to effectively convey their concerns to \n     government;\n       (8) the United States Government should continue to fund \n     capacity-building programs for the Iraqi Ministry of Human \n     Rights and the independent national Human Rights Commission, \n     and should continue to help reconstitute the minorities \n     committee to make it an effective voice for Iraqi minorities;\n       (9) the Government of Iraq should direct the Iraqi Ministry \n     of Human Rights to investigate and issue a public report on \n     abuses against and the marginalization of minority \n     communities in Iraq and make recommendations to address such \n     abuses; and\n       (10) the United States Government should encourage the \n     Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to \n     protect the linguistic and cultural heritage, religious \n     beliefs, and ethnic and religious identities of minority \n     groups, in particular those living in the Nineveh Plain.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4605) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4605\n\n        (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute to the preamble)\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas the territory of Iraq, the land of Mesopotamia, has \n     millennia of rich cultural and religious history;\n       Whereas the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians thrived \n     within what are now the borders of Iraq;\n       Whereas the biblical patriarch Abraham was born in Ur, King \n     Hammurabi ruled from Babylon, and Imam Ali, the founder of \n     Shiite Islam, died in Kufa;\n       Whereas during the 35-year rule of the Baath Party and \n     Saddam Hussein, and despite the Provisional Constitution of \n     1968 that provided for individual religious freedom in Iraq, \n     the Government of Iraq severely limited freedom of religion, \n     especially for religious minorities, and sought to exploit \n     religious differences for political purposes, leading the \n     United States Government to designate Iraq as a ``country of \n     particular concern'' under the International Religious \n     Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292) because of \n     systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious \n     freedom;\n       Whereas members of religious minority communities of Iraq, \n     both those who have been forced to flee the homeland in which \n     their ancestors have lived for thousands of years and those \n     who remain in Iraq, are committed to maintaining their \n     presence in Iraq and keeping alive their communities' \n     cultures, heritage, and religions, but threats against them \n     jeopardize the future of Iraq as a diverse, pluralistic, and \n     free society;\n       Whereas despite the reduction in violence in Iraq in recent \n     years, serious threats to religious freedom remain, including \n     religiously motivated violence directed at vulnerable \n     religious minorities, their leaders, and their holy sites, \n     including Chaldeans, Syriacs, Assyrians, Armenians and other \n     Christians, Sabean Mandeans, Yeazidis, Baha'is, Kaka'is, \n     Jews, and Shi'a Shabak;\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\n       Whereas the March 2010 Report on Human Rights issued by the \n     Department of State identifies ``insurgent and extremist \n     violence, coupled with weak government performance in \n     upholding the rule of law'' resulting in ``widespread and \n     severe human rights abuses'' as among the significant and \n     continuing human rights problems in Iraq;\n       Whereas although violence has impacted all aspects of \n     society in Iraq, there have been alarming levels of \n     religiously motivated violence in Iraq in recent years;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom continues to recommend that the Secretary \n     of State designate Iraq as a ``country of particular \n     concern'' under the International Religious Freedom Act of \n     1998, because of the systematic, ongoing, egregious \n     violations of religious freedom in Iraq;\n       Whereas scores of holy sites in Iraq have been bombed since \n     2004;\n       Whereas members of small religious minority communities in \n     Iraq do not have militia or tribal structures to defend them, \n     often receive inadequate official protection, and are \n     legally, politically, and economically marginalized;\n       Whereas in the Nineveh and Kirkuk governorates, where \n     control is disputed between the Government of Iraq and the \n     Kurdistan regional government, religious minorities have been \n     targeted for abuse, violence, and discrimination;\n       Whereas before 1951, non-Muslims comprised some 6 percent \n     of the population of Iraq, with Jews as the oldest and \n     largest of these communities, tracing back to the Babylonian \n     captivity of the sixth century BCE, but today the Jewish \n     community in Iraq numbers in the single digits and \n     essentially lives in hiding;\n       Whereas religious minorities in Iraq, who made up about 3 \n     percent of the population of Iraq in 2003, make up a \n     disproportionately high percentage of registered Iraqi \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the number of Christians in Iraq was approximately \n     1,400,000 according to the 1987 Iraqi census but, according \n     to the 2009 Report on International Religious Freedom issued \n     by the Department of State, may now number only 500,000 to \n     600,000;\n       Whereas the United States is gravely concerned about the \n     viability of the indigenous Christian communities of Iraq and \n     other religious minority communities, and the possible \n     disappearance of their ancient languages, culture, and \n     heritage;\n       Whereas the Sabean Mandean community in Iraq reports that \n     almost 90 percent of its members have fled Iraq, leaving only \n     about 3,500 to 5,000 Mandeans in Iraq as of 2009;\n       Whereas the Baha'i faith, estimated to have fewer than \n     2,000 adherents in Iraq, remains prohibited in Iraq under a \n     1970 law;\n       Whereas although hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees \n     and internally displaced persons have returned to their areas \n     of origin, the numbers of religious minority returnees to \n     Iraq are disproportionately low; and\n       Whereas members of religious minority communities of Iraq \n     in diaspora have organized to support their communities in \n     Iraq in ways that also benefit the whole of Iraq society by \n     encouraging the rule of law, enhanced security, employment, \n     education and health services: Now therefore be it\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 322), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "05", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/05/senate-section/article/S6990-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2010\n\n  Mr. REID.
