DONALD BERWICK\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise to discuss a recess appointment \nmade last week when many of us were traveling to visit with \nconstituents to talk about the issues of the day.\n  During that time, I was in Wyoming, and one of the main issues \nbrought up at senior centers was the appointment by the President of \nDr. Donald Berwick to be the head of Medicare and Medicaid. I heard the \nconcerns of these folks because of statements Dr. Berwick had made \nabout the British health care system and his love of the National \nHealth Service in England. They are concerned as to how this gentleman, \nwho has taken positions and made a number of statements, would run \nMedicare and Medicaid. Specifically, they had concerns because they had \nheard his statement:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration. The \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\n\n  Seniors around the State were concerned about what this means. Then \nto hear that the President made a decision to do a recess appointment \nof this very individual, without hearings in the Congress, without an \nopportunity for the American people to hear specifically his response \nto questions we might have--is this what the American people want? \nAbsolutely not. We have a President who campaigned on a pledge of \naccountability and transparency. To me, this makes a mockery of that \npledge because this nominee will not have to answer questions about \nstatements he has made.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona, a State where people on Medicare are \nconcerned, where we have many seniors, a State with a Medicaid \npopulation that will be impacted. Yet we now have a director of \nMedicaid and Medicare, finally named by the President after a full year \nof debate on a health care law that cut $500 billion from seniors on \nMedicare and crammed 16 million more Americans onto Medicaid, a program \nthat is currently very broken. I say to my colleague from Arizona, my \ngoodness, the impact on the folks in Arizona is astonishing.\n  There was an article today in one of the papers that talks about a \nMedicaid stalemate. They talk about his home State of Arizona. They say \nArizona has had to cut about a dozen benefits from its Medicaid \nProgram, including hearing aids, podiatrist services, capped physical \ntherapy visits. Yet there was nobody in charge of Medicaid when the \nPresident and the Democrats in this body said: Hey, don't worry. We are \ngoing the cram another 16 million more Americans onto Medicaid--a \nsystem we know is broken.\n\n  So I turn to my colleague from Arizona and ask him his thoughts on \nthis recess appointment at a time when seniors and folks around the \ncountry are concerned about the debt, the deficit, the economy, and now \nwe are seeing the President making a mockery of his previous comments \nabout accountability and transparency.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say to my friend, I think this issue is an \nalarming and disturbing one--perhaps one of the most disturbing, for \ntwo reasons: One is that this nomination had not even gone through the \nearliest stages of scrutiny by the relevant committee, not to mention \nthe entire Senate; and the other, of course, is the individual himself \nwho was being nominated, who could only be viewed as extreme, \nespecially concerning many of his comments. One of his greatest \nrhetorical hits is: ``any health-care funding plan that is just, \nequitable, civilized and humane must--must--redistribute wealth from \nthe richer among us to the poorer and less fortunate.'' That in itself \nis a remarkable statement.\n  But I wish to, for a second, with my friend, Dr. Barrasso, go back to \nthis process. The fact is, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle blocked for over 2 years the nomination for this position by \nPresident Bush, and this nomination was barely 3 months old. He had not \neven filled out the questionnaire, much less attend a hearing. So the \nrationale used by the administration was: Well, the Republicans are \ngoing to block it. Well, we may have. And given the comments and record \nof Sir Donald--he is a knight, I understand, knighted by Queen \nElizabeth--well, the comments by Sir Donald certainly do give one \nextreme pause. But shouldn't we at least go through the process of the \nhearing?\n  I have been around here a long time, and I have not paid attention to \nevery nominee and the process they have been through, but I cannot \nremember a time where blocking the nomination took place--or \nannouncement of preventing the nomination from moving forward was done \nbefore a hearing took place, or even the questionnaire.\n  In fact, I was very interested to see the comment of the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, under whose supervision in his committee this \nnomination would go through. I quote Senator Baucus:\n\n       I'm troubled that, rather than going through the standard \n     nomination process, Dr. Berwick was recess appointed. Senate \n     confirmation of presidential appointees is an essential \n     process prescribed by the Constitution that serves as a check \n     on executive power and protects Montanans and all Americans \n     by ensuring that crucial questions are asked of the nominee--\n     and answered.\n\n  So not a single question was asked of the nominee, much less \nanswered. And, of course, I understand. Having been a committee \nchairman myself, I will take great umbrage of my party, the President, \nor the other party that the process was completely bypassed. Because \nthe Senate has the responsibility of advice and consent. And over time, \nI must admit that both Republican and Democrat administrations have \nabused the recess appointment process. Yes, they have abused it. But I \nmust say, this takes it to a new high or low depending on which way you \nview it.\n  We have now seen in this administration the appointment of various \n``czars,'' people given responsibilities over vast areas of government \nas ``czars.'' They have got more czars than the Romanoffs. So this is \nanother step, in my view, of incursion and encroachment by the \nexecutive branch on the legislative branch, a coequal branch of \ngovernment. So that in itself is extremely disturbing.\n  Are we going to have nominations made--an announcement of those \nnominations, and then automatically are we going to have ``recess'' \nappointments made? What was the hurry? There is going to be another \nrecess in August. There is going to be another recess in October, \nunless we go out for elections. But yet in their zeal and haste, they \nhad to do it over the Fourth of July recess.\n  I tell you, my friends, this is more than just one individual. This \nis a gradual and steady erosion of the responsibilities of the Senate \nof the United States called advice and consent, which can set dangerous \nprecedence for the future. I say to this administration, and my friends \non the other side of the aisle--and I appreciate the comments of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee--if we allow this to go on, it will \nhurt the Senate as an institution, not just Republicans, not just \nDemocrats, but it will hurt this institution, if we allow, unresponded \nto, a situation where a nominee--his name comes over, and not even a \nhearing, not even a question is asked--and immediately that nominee is \nrecess appointed, which means they are in a position of enormous power \nand authority for a long period of time. And this appointment--this \nappointment--has enormous consequences in light of the passage of the \nmost sweeping overhaul of\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nthe health care system in America, having just taken place over our \nobviously strenuous objections.\n  But it happened. Now the individual in charge, the individual who \nwill bear great responsibilities, has not answered a single question \nposed by Members of this body on either side.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is a dangerous precedent and one that \nshould not go unresponded to by either Democrat or Republican because \nof our responsibilities as a coequal branch of government. I see my \ncolleague, the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my colleague from Arizona, I just came on to \nthe floor and am not quite certain what happened earlier in this \ncolloquy, but there is no doubt about it that they did not want Dr. \nBerwick's name to surface during the health care debate. They did not \nwant any questions asked of him in public. We have had recess \nappointments, of course, by Presidents of both parties. Typically, they \nhave gone through a hearing, a committee vote, and end up out here on \nthe calendar so that at least there was some exposure to the nominee's \nviews.\n  What we do know about this nominee is what he has said in the past \nabout the British health care system. It is stunning that anybody in \nthis country could look at the national health service in England and \ndecide they were in love with it. So I would say to my friend from \nArizona, and my friends from Wyoming and South Dakota, there is \nno question what they were up to here. They wanted to sneak this guy \nthrough with a minimum amount of exposure.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I mention to my friend that even one of our not so \nstrong allies from the Washington Post, Ruth Marcus, wrote a column \nsaying:\n\n       There are legitimate explanations for Berwick's more \n     incendiary comments on health care. It's too bad he didn't \n     get to offer them. A cynic--who, me?--might think that the \n     administration simply preferred not to suffer the political \n     downside of a public airing.\n       A cynic might wonder, with Arkansas Democrat Blanche \n     Lincoln facing a tough re-election fight, whether Berwick \n     could even get through committee on a party-line vote. A \n     cynic might think that the last thing Senate Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid wanted before the election was a floor fight about \n     rationing health care.\n       A cynic might look at the White House explanation--that it \n     was urgent for CMS, without a confirmed administrator since \n     2006, to have a leader--and ask: Then why did you dither for \n     15 months before nominating someone?\n       In announcing the appointment, the president complained \n     that ``many in Congress have decided to delay critical \n     nominations for political purposes.'' True, but where's the \n     evidence of delay in Berwick's case? You can't fairly accuse \n     the other side of political gamesmanship when you short-\n     circuit the process and storm off the court before the first \n     set.\n       ``To some degree, he's damaged goods,'' then-Sen. Barack \n     Obama said in 2005 about John Bolton's recess appointment as \n     United Nations ambassador.\n       Would the president say the same about Berwick?\n\n  An excellent column.\n  Mr. McCONNELL And that was Ruth Marcus.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it puts it pretty well. But none of us, of \ncourse, being cynics, would accept such an explanation by a columnist \nfrom the Washington Post.\n  I see my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to my friend from Arizona and to the leader \nthat a cynic might also raise the issue of why it took the President \n454 days to nominate Donald Berwick and then have a lot of his \nsurrogates go on in front of the media and say: We had to do this \nbecause we needed to get this position filled. Madam President, 454 \ndays--if this position was so critical and so important to this \ncountry, you would think they would have moved in a more expeditious \nfashion to get a nominee out there. They did not even have a hearing in \nfront of the committee.\n  They could have had a hearing. They could have had a vote at the \ncommittee level. They could have brought him to the floor. They did not \ndo any of those things that would be called for in the regular order \nbecause, as I think the Senator from Kentucky has pointed out, they did \nnot want to take a tough political vote.\n  When you look at this man's record and the things he has said about \nthe British health care system and some of the other comments he has \nmade--I want to point out something here too which I thought was sort \nof interesting because he is going to be called upon to implement a \n2,700-page bill, which, when the regulations are written, is going to \nbe thousands and thousands of pages, not to mention the fact that as we \ndebated this on the floor of the Senate, it ended up being about $1 \ntrillion, and when fully implemented $2.5 trillion. So he has trillions \nof dollars under his jurisdiction. He has a 2,700-page bill that he is \ngoing to implement. And he came out and said:\n\n       I don't feel like a leader, so it's very hard for me to \n     project myself into that situation. But inattention to detail \n     is my biggest defect. I'm always leaning forward into \n     something new. I can create a mess. Luckily, I have people \n     who are willing to create the detail around the idea or, if \n     they're really smart, know which ideas to ignore.\n\n  He is basically saying he is not a detail guy, and yet this massive \nnew health care program, which is literally going to be thousands of \npages, including regulations--and 2,700 pages, as I mentioned, in terms \nof the legislation itself--he will be called upon to implement it. And \nhe has a vision clearly that the model he supports is the British \nhealth care system, the national health care system, which, as we all \nknow, countries in Europe are moving away from. Why we would be moving \nin that direction, and why they would appoint somebody like this to \nthis important position defies explanation.\n  But, more importantly, I think, as well, is they could have done this \nin the regular way. He could have come before the Senate and answered \nquestions as any other nominee would. He should have had a hearing \nwhere he was able to respond to some of these statements he has made in \nthe past. Yet they chose to do it in this way, with a recess \nappointment, notwithstanding the fact that it was 454 days before they \nput his name forward for nomination, and since that time 79 days, and \nthey are blaming the Congress, and they are blaming the Republicans \nspecifically for not moving this nomination, when, in fact, it was the \nPresident and his administration who waited that long to put somebody \nin this position.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Republican leader a question. He has been \naround here a fair amount of time, as I have. I ask the Republican \nleader, has he ever heard of or recalled of a nominee who was recess \nappointed without even the questionnaire from the relevant committee of \noversight being responded to or a hearing before that committee? For \nthe life of me, I cannot recall that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, I do not know the \nanswer to that. But we do know it was a curious, maybe not totally \nunprecedented but certainly unusual situation where a nominee is \nsubjected to so little scrutiny and oversight--no questions, no \nopportunity to testify. This is a truly unusual situation. I think we \nknow the answer as to why. This guy is in favor of rationing health \ncare--openly, unabashedly, an advocate of rationing health care. I do \nnot think they wanted to have him have to answer the questions. He may \nnot have been very good at details, I say to my friend from South \nDakota, but he got the big picture. And the big picture in his mind is:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration care--the \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes [wide] open.\n\n  That is what he intends to do.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So a nominee whose clear philosophy of record indicates \nredistribution of wealth, as he describes it, and a use of health care \nin a way that includes greater and greater ``leveling of the small \ndistribution of income in America''--does that give us some indication \nof the real intentions of the administration when they proposed health \ncare reform in this package, despite the statements made by the \nPresident that if you like the health insurance policy you have, you \ncan keep it; there will be no tax increases for people below $250,000, \net cetera? Does this appointment of an individual with a clear-cut \nphilosophy that this is a way to redistribute wealth in America \nindicate that maybe the real--again, not being a cynic, but would give \nus some idea of a real intent of this ``health care reform'' we \nresisted so strenuously for more than a year?\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think my friend from Arizona has it exactly right. \nEvery single Member of the Democratic Party in the Senate voted for a \nbill that is going to impose $500 billion of Medicare cuts over the \nnext 10 years.\n  We have a physician, fortunately, in the Senate: Dr. Barrasso. He \nintends to reach that target, does he not, I would inquire of my friend \nfrom Wyoming, by rationing health care?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I believe the President of the United \nStates, I say to my colleague and friend, now has what he wants: his \nhealth care rationing czar--not someone approved by the Senate but \nsomeone he has appointed and put into place without an open hearing.\n  It is so interesting, as my colleagues from Arizona and South Dakota \ntalk about, that the failings of the British health care system--a \nsystem that Dr. Berwick says, ``I am romantic about; I love it; it is a \nnational treasure, a global treasure,'' but then the headline today is: \n``U.K. Will Revamp Its Health Service.'' It says: Health care experts \ncalled the plan one of the biggest shakeups in the national health \nservice's 62-year history. Its new coalition government in Britain, \ngrappling with weak public finances and rising health care costs, \nannounced an overhaul of the state-funded health system that it said \nwould put more power in the hands of the doctors and involves cutting \nhuge swaths of bureaucracy.\n  This is at a time when we have just in this country passed not what \nwe voted for but what the Democrats and the President voted for: a bill \nthat increases the bureaucracy, including $10 billion for Internal \nRevenue Service agents and higher and higher numbers of government \nworkers and bureaucrats taking power away from the doctors, away from \nthe patients. Now it is government-centered health care at a time when \nBritain is moving away from it, and the person the President of the \nUnited States has put in as his health care rationing czar is someone \nwho calls that approach a national treasure; cutting $500 billion from \nour seniors depending on that for Medicare, not to save Medicare but to \nstart a whole new government program.\n  Britain is trying to revamp because they know that someone with \ncancer in the United States has a much better chance of survival than \nsomebody in Britain. It is not because our doctors are better in the \nUnited States--and I have practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years--\nit is because people get care in the United States that is delayed and \ntherefore denied in Britain. But Dr. Berwick is romantic. He has fallen \nin love with that national health service, a service that is not good \nfor patients, and it is not good for providers.\n  I see my friend from South Dakota, another rural community and State. \nI am sure he is seeing and hearing the same things from his seniors \nthere, their concerns about what is going to happen to the cost of \ntheir care, the quality of their care, and the availability of the \ncare, especially with Dr. Berwick now in charge.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Wyoming knows full well how difficult it \nis to deliver health care in rural areas. Being a physician himself, he \nknows the challenges we face.\n  It seems to me that notwithstanding the comments to the contrary, we \nhave to look at what people do. In this case, what the administration \nhas done is appointed somebody to run this massive new health care \nprogram who clearly is on the record by his previous statements in \nfavor of redistribution of wealth, in favor of rationing of health \ncare, in favor of government-run health care. He is romantic about the \nBritish national health system, which, as the Senator from Wyoming \nmentioned, is having all kinds of complications and problems, including \nrunaway costs, and now they are trying to figure out how to move away \nfrom it. The problem they have is that 1.6 million people are employed \nby the British national health system, a huge employer in their \ncountry, so the economic impact, the political impact of making changes \nin that system is very difficult. That being said, it doesn't seem as \nthough they have any choice because they are facing such difficult \nfiscal circumstances in their country and they are seeing these runaway \nhealth care costs contributing in a very significant way to that.\n  So it seems to me, at least, that what we have done here with this \nmassive health care bill passing in the U.S. Congress--$2.5 trillion \nwhen it is fully implemented over a 10-year period--what we are already \nseeing now is the Actuary at CMS coming out and saying it is going to \nbend the cost curve up and it is going to cost considerably more above \nand beyond the normal year-over-year inflationary increases in health \ncare Americans have already been seeing. Then we also have the CBO now \ncoming out and saying it is not going to achieve the deficit savings \nthat were advertised here on the floor when we had the debate. There is \nall this information coming out which validates the argument we were \nmaking at the time, and that is that we don't want to move toward the \ngovernment-run health care system that rations care. Then they put \nsomebody in charge who believes in redistribution of wealth, rationing \nof health care, government-run health care--all things we argue this \nwould lead us toward. Clearly, the administration really shows their \nhand when they appoint someone such as this to run this important, \ncomprehensive, wide-reaching, and expensive bureaucratic program that \nvery much will resemble, in terms of the model, what they are doing in \nBritain, which Britain is moving away from.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the Wall Street Journal editorial of July 12, 2010, \nentitled ``Who Pays for ObamaCare? What Donald Berwick and Joe the \nPlumber both understand.''\n  I have some relationship to Joe the Plumber, not to Donald Berwick.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Wall Street Journal, Editorial July 12, 2010]\n\n                        Who Pays for ObamaCare?\n\n\n        What Donald Berwick and Joe the Plumber both understand\n\n       Among Donald Berwick's greatest rhetorical hits is this \n     one: ``any health-care funding plan that is just, equitable, \n     civilized and humane must--must--redistribute wealth from the \n     richer among us to the poorer and less fortunate.'' Count \n     that as one more reason that President Obama made Dr. Berwick \n     a recess appointee to run Medicare and Medicaid rather than \n     have this philosophy debated in the Senate.\n       We are also learning that ``spreading the wealth,'' as Mr. \n     Obama famously told Joe the Plumber in 2008, is the silent \n     intellectual and political foundation of ObamaCare. We say \n     silent because Democrats never admitted this while the bill \n     was moving through Congress.\n       But only days after the bill passed, Senate Finance \n     Chairman Max Baucus exulted that it would result in ``a \n     leveling'' of the ``maldistribution of income in America,'' \n     adding that ``The wealthy are getting way, way too wealthy, \n     and the middle-income class is left behind.'' David Leonhardt \n     of the New York Times, who channels White House budget \n     director Peter Orszag, also cheered after the bill passed \n     that ObamaCare is ``the federal government's biggest attack \n     on economic inequality'' in generations.\n       An April analysis by Patrick Fleenor and Gerald Prante of \n     the Tax Foundation reveals how right they are. ObamaCare's \n     new ``health-care funding plan'' will shift some $104 billion \n     in 2016 to Americans in the bottom half of the income \n     distribution from those in the top half. The wealth transfer \n     will be even larger in future years. While every income group \n     sees a direct or indirect tax increase, everyone below the \n     50th income percentile comes out a net beneficiary.\n       At least at the start, Americans in the 50th through 80th \n     income percentiles--or those earning between $99,000 to \n     $158,000--are nearly beneficiaries too, if not for the taxes \n     on insurers, drug makers and other businesses that will be \n     passed on to everyone as higher health costs. This group will \n     eventually get soaked even more--probably through a value-\n     added tax--once ObamaCare's costs explode. But at the \n     beginning the biggest losers are the upper middle class, \n     especially the top 10% of income earners, mainly because a \n     3.8% Medicare ``payroll'' tax surcharge will now apply to \n     investment income. ObamaCare, in short, is almost certainly \n     the largest wealth transfer in American history.\n       Distributional analyses like the Tax Foundation's are \n     usually staples in any Beltway policy debate, especially when \n     Republicans want to cut taxes. Yet aside from this or that \n     provision, none of the outfits that usually report for this \n     duty--the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and \n     Urban Institute, the Center for Budget and Policy \n     Priorities--have attempted to estimate the full incidence of \n     ObamaCare's taxes and subsidies.\n       In part this may be because ObamaCare is such a complex \n     rewrite of health, tax, welfare and labor laws. But it's also \n     embarrassing to liberals that much of ObamaCare's \n     redistribution will merely move income to\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\n     the lower middle class from the upper middle class, and the \n     President habitually promises that people earning under \n     $200,000 will be exempt from his tax increases. We now know \n     they won't be.\n       With his vast new powers over what government spends, Dr. \n     Berwick will be well situated to equalize outcomes even more, \n     and he certainly seems inclined to do so. The most charitable \n     reading of his redistribution remarks, delivered in a 2008 \n     London speech, is that any health insurance system will \n     involve some degree of redistribution to the ``less \n     fortunate,'' that is, to the sick from the healthy.\n       Yet Dr. Berwick made those comments in the context of a \n     larger, and bitter, indictment of the U.S. health system, \n     even though the huge public programs he will run already \n     account for about half of all national health spending. From \n     his point of view this isn't enough. And his main stance was \n     that individual clinical choices must be subordinated to \n     government central planning to serve his view of social \n     justice and health care guaranteed by the state.\n       The great irony is that this sort of enforced \n     egalitarianism imposes higher taxes and other policies that \n     reduce the total stock of wealth and leave less for Dr. \n     Berwick to redistribute. Economic growth has been by far the \n     most important factor in improving health and longevity, \n     especially for those whom Dr. Berwick calls ``the poorer and \n     less fortunate.''\n       Americans have learned the hard way over the past two years \n     that this Administration believes in wealth redistribution \n     first, economic growth second. Or as Dr. Berwick also put it \n     in his wealth-redistribution speech, it is crucial not to \n     have to rely on ``the darkness of private enterprise.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will quote the important part of the \nWall Street Journal editorial, speaking of Dr. Berwick, Sir Donald:\n\n       With his vast new powers over what government spends, Dr. \n     Berwick will be well situated to equalize outcomes even more, \n     and he certainly seems inclined to do so. The most charitable \n     reading of his redistribution remarks, delivered in a 2008 \n     London speech, is that any health insurance system will \n     involve some degree of redistribution to the ``less \n     fortunate,'' that is, to the sick from the healthy.\n       Yet Dr. Berwick made those comments in the context of a \n     larger, and bitter, indictment of the U.S. health system, \n     even though the huge public programs he will run already \n     account for about half of all national health spending. From \n     his point of view this isn't enough. His main stance was that \n     individual clinical choices must be subordinated to \n     government central planning to serve his view of social \n     justice and health care guaranteed by the state.\n       The great irony is that this sort of enforced \n     egalitarianism imposes higher taxes and other policies that \n     reduce the total stock of wealth and leave less for Dr. \n     Berwick to redistribute. Economic growth has been by far the \n     most important factor for improving health and longevity, \n     especially for those whom Dr. Berwick calls ``the poorer and \n     less fortunate.''\n       Americans have learned the hard way over the past two years \n     that this administration believes in wealth redistribution \n     first, economic growth second. Or as Dr. Berwick also put it \n     in his wealth-redistribution speech, it is crucial not to \n     have to rely on ``the darkness of private enterprise.''\n\n  That is an individual who is now going to oversee over half the \nhealth care provided in America who believes that ``the darkness of \nprivate enterprise'' should not be relied on.\n  So I wish to say to my friends again, there are two issues here of \ngreat concern: the individual himself, his record, and what he clearly \nintends for the finest health care system in America--not on \nrestraining costs but obviously a redistribution of wealth; second, \nthis entire process of an individual not even filling out a \nquestionnaire--a nominee--or any semblance of a hearing before the \nrelevant committee before a ``recess'' appointment is made. This is an \nerosion of the constitutional responsibilities of advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield, \njust to put a final point on that, again, 454 days before the \nadministration put forward this nominee, there have been 79 days since, \nand they are blaming Republicans for holding up this nominee--again, \nnotwithstanding the fact that it was 454 days before they ever put it \nforward. If we don't have a hearing and he doesn't have to come in and \nanswer questions about these at least what I would characterize as \noutlandish statements, again, it is an abrogation of the responsibility \nthe administration has of working with the Senate, the Senate's power \nof advise and consent, to at least have a hearing, to at least have a \nvote, to at least have some public discussion about this gentleman's \nqualifications and his attributes with regard to this important \nposition to which they are going to appoint him.\n  I wish to point out as well that there is one other example of this. \nThe TSA Administrator, which is another very important job, by the time \nthey actually got somebody submitted who could be acted upon here in \nthe Senate, 482 days had lapsed. It was 521 days when the new TSA \nAdministrator was finally approved, but we went 240 days when the post \nwas vacant, from the time the post was vacated in January of 2009 until \nthey appointed their first nominee, who then had to withdraw because of \nproblems. Then they appointed somebody else who withdrew because of \nproblems. They finally submitted somebody who was actually approved, \nbut it took 521 days. That is not us. That is not the Republicans in \nthe Senate holding things up, nor is it the case with Berwick's \nnomination where 454 days lapsed before the administration put his name \nforward. Then they just quickly, without giving us an opportunity--the \nSenate an opportunity--to do our job recess-appointed him to a position \nwhere he is going to be responsible for thousands of employees, \nobviously billions and trillions of dollars when it comes to the health \ncare delivery in this country, and that is very unfortunate.\n  So, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, it is partly about \nthis gentleman and what he stands for and what he intends to do with \nthis position, but it is also the process by which he was actually put \ninto this position and how it completely short-circuited and bypassed \nwhat is regular order and what should be under our Constitution the \nresponsibility of the Senate to provide advice and consent.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, if I could just ask my colleague, \ntalking about the Constitution and how we as Americans see ourselves, \nSenator McCain just quoted a comment made by Dr. Berwick about the \ndarkness of private enterprise. Dr. Berwick coauthored a book called \n``New Rules.'' In it, he argues that one of the primary functions of \nhealth regulation is to constrain decentralized, individual \ndecisionmaking--constrain individual decisionmaking--and to weigh \npublic welfare against the choices of private consumers. I mean, could \nanything fly further in the face of what Americans believe? The \ndecisions, the choices of private consumers--that is how we make \ndecisions in America. That is what I recommend for patients: Make your \nindividual choice. What is best for you? How to help keep down the cost \nof your care; prevention, coordinating care; working and making smart \nchoices for you as an individual. Who knows better? Who knows better \nhow to spend your money? You do. Who knows better how to make choices \nfor your life? You do.\n  That is not what Dr. Berwick is saying in this book, ``New Rules.'' \nIt is to weigh public welfare against the choices of private consumers.\n  So I inquire of my colleague from South Dakota, what would people \nfrom South Dakota think about that? This is somebody who is saying: \nGovernment knows better than you do. People of Wyoming have never felt \nthat way, and I would imagine the people from South Dakota have never \nfelt that way either.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my neighbor from Wyoming, he understands his \nconstituents very well, and we share a border, but we also share a lot \nof other things, including a common set of values and a sense of \nindividual responsibility and belief in freedom.\n  I think what this gentleman represents in terms of his view is \ncompletely contradictory to what the majority of my constituents and I \nam sure the majority of the constituents of the Senator from Wyoming \nwould say with regard to how you ought to approach issues. The American \nindividual, the American consumer is in a much better position to make \ndecisions about their own health care than some government bureaucracy \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  Essentially what Mr. Berwick has concluded over time--and he has had \na long career analyzing and studying many of these issues--is that a \ngovernment-run system where some government bureaucrat is in a position \nof making these decisions that are important to an individual--in this \ncase, his health care or her health care--that is clearly a model he \nendorses and supports.\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\n  It is very contradictory, I would say, to what I think is the view of \na majority of Americans. Frankly, one of the reasons I think many of us \nopposed the health care bill when it was under consideration in the \nSenate--and the Senator from Wyoming made some excellent comments \nduring the course of that debate about his experience with health care \nas a practicing physician--is that clearly the American model is one \nthat is very different from the European model.\n  What we have with Mr. Berwick is somebody who wants to remake the \nAmerican health care system in the image of the model that we see in \nplaces such as Europe. His example of the British health care system, \nabout which he is romantic, is a good example of how he intends to \nimplement the health care bill passed in the Senate.\n  We have argued all along that the intention of those behind it is to \nmove us in the direction of a more single-payer, European-type system \nas opposed to what we have experienced in this country and have enjoyed \nfor such a long time, and that is one that has its basis at least in \nthe market where we have individuals who are in charge of making many \nof the decisions, as opposed to some government bureaucrat.\n  This is very unfortunate in terms of the fact that this was an \nappointment that was made in the recess without the normal process \nbeing adhered to, with this gentleman coming in front of the Senate to \nanswer questions and actually having a vote in the Senate.\n  For our colleagues on the other side to argue that the reason they \nhad to do this was because Republicans were slowing or somehow delaying \nthis process is completely inconsistent with any of the facts. As I \nsaid before, 454 days before the President put his nomination forward. \nCertainly, it is not the Republicans' fault they did not have a nominee \nup here. Then the fact that they did not have a hearing and there has \nnot been a vote in the committee and now not a vote on the floor of the \nSenate is unfortunate, given the consequences and the impact the person \nwho occupies this position is going to have with regard to delivery of \nthis new health care reform legislation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It was interesting, on this floor someone on the other \nside of the aisle stood and said: If you are against Dr. Berwick, then \nwhose side are you on? As I see my colleague from South Dakota, I can \nanswer that question, and he can answer that question. If you are \nagainst Dr. Berwick, then whose side are you on? I am on the side of \nthe American people--the American people who are concerned about $500 \nbillion in cuts to their Medicare, not to help Medicare, not to \nstrengthen Medicare, but to start a whole new government program.\n  I am on the side of the people who believe we should not redistribute \nwealth in this country. I am on the side of my patients and friends in \nWyoming who do not want the rationing of care. I am on the side of my \nfriends and patients in Wyoming who do not want government-run health \ncare. But that is what we have now.\n  We have a President-appointed czar, essentially--a czar--to ration \nhealth care. That is not what the American people want. It may be what \nthe Democrats in Congress want. It may be what the President of the \nUnited States wants. I view this as an arrogant use of Presidential \npower at a time when I think the American people were intentionally \nmisled all during the fall because the President refused to appoint \nsomebody, would not name anybody to be in charge of Medicare and \nMedicaid when the whole debate was going on. Only after the bill was \nsigned into law--only then--would he announce to the country his choice \nwas somebody way outside the mainstream of how we in America deliver \nhealth care, want our health care, how we care as patients, how we care \nas physicians--way out of that mainstream, someone whose approach is a \nvery different one, who loves a system where we know people with \ndiseases are denied care, where care is delayed, and where today the \nwhole country is saying: I think we got it wrong. We need to relook at \nthis. They see what is happening, and I think the American people will \nknow what will happen to us as a nation if we go down the path of a \nnationalized health system where we redistribute wealth, ration care, \nand government runs the health care system of our Nation.\n  It is the wrong decision by the President. It is the wrong direction \nto go. The American people know it, and they do not like it.\n  Once again, the American people are not going to have their voices \nheard because the American people are going to be denied an opportunity \nto voice their opposition to this nominee to their elected \nrepresentatives because the President decided he knew better than this \nCongress and made a decision to appoint someone at a time when the \nAmerican people wanted their voices heard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

EDDIE BERNARD\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise once again to recognize one of \nour Nation's great Federal employees. Here are all the employees we \nhave recognized to date.\n  Madam President, we in Washington are in the midst of a summer heat \nwave. I know it is the same for millions of Americans across the \ncountry. This comes on the heels of a harsh winter where the Capital \nCity endured heavy snowfall that shut down businesses and even certain \ngovernment offices. The powerful forces of nature continue to challenge \nus.\n  Many Americans only notice weather in its extremes. The hard-working \nmen and women of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nor NOAA, spend their careers making it easier for us to address \nnature's challenges. This year is NOAA's 40th anniversary. It was \ncreated in 1970 from three former agencies, and since that time NOAA \nemployees have been at the forefront of weather prediction, \noceanography, and fishery management.\n  Whenever anyone turns on the television and sees an alert from the \nNational Weather Service, that is NOAA at work. If you go to the \nPacific coast and enjoy the beaches, you can feel safe knowing that \nNOAA's tsunami warning system stands at the ready. NOAA personnel are \nalso leading the way to ensure the long-term sustainability of our \ncoastal fisheries so those who make their living from the sea can \ncontinue to do so for generations to come.\n  The great Federal employee I am recognizing today won the 2008 \nService to America Medal for Homeland Security for his work at NOAA \nhelping to detect and warn against destructive tsunamis. Dr. Eddie \nBernard has served as Director of NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental \nLaboratory in Seattle, WA, since 1982. One of the leading experts on \ntsunamis, he has published over 80 scientific articles and edited books \non the phenomenon.\n  For 3 years Eddie directed the National Tsunami Warning Center in \nHawaii, and he was the founding chairman of the National Tsunami Hazard \nMitigation Steering Committee, a joint Federal-State effort.\n  In addition to his work on tsunamis, as Director of the Pacific \nMarine Environmental Laboratory Eddie oversees a number of important \noceanographic research programs such as El Nino forecasts and studies \nof underwater volcanoes.\n  Eddie received his bachelor's degree in physics from Lamar \nUniversity, and he holds master's and doctoral degrees in physical \noceanography from Texas A\n  In order to protect our coastlines against damage from Pacific \ntsunamis such as the one that devastated the coasts of South Asia in \n2004, Eddie led the development of the innovative DART system. As a \ntsunami wave moves under the ocean, DART--which stands for deep ocean \nassessment of tsunamis--uses buoys to report data back to the Tsunami \nWarning Centers.\n  It took years to perfect, and Eddie and his team had hoped to get \nclose to a 60-percent accuracy rate in predicting the scope and \nintensity of incoming tsunamis. As it turns out, they\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\nwere able to achieve over 90 percent accuracy with DART. Their system \nbecame the basis for the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, which \npassed the Congress in 2006. Eddie was instrumental in helping to draft \nthat legislation which strengthened tsunami detection, warning, and \nmitigation programs to ensure that we are prepared for even the worst-\ncase scenarios.\n  The work of NOAA employees is often not glamorous, but it saves \nlives, protects property, and helps to prepare our coastal communities \nto meet the challenges of nature. My home State of Delaware is filled \nwith coastal communities, and the work NOAA performs in a range of \nareas to help coastal States such as Delaware in so many ways.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr. Eddie Bernard and \nall those at NOAA who continue to monitor the seas and skies on our \nbehalf. They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5759-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5759-S5760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INCREASED PAPERWORK BURDEN\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about something I \nthink is enormously important in terms of our businesses and job \ncreation. There are many unintended consequences contained in the \nhealth care bill that was recently passed, but I think one of the most \negregious is the effect on small businesses that are, by all agreement, \nthe engine of our economic growth. In fact, various analyses have been \ndone, and they conclude that 65 percent of the new jobs created come \nfrom the small business engine in our Nation.\n  Section 9006 of the new health care law will have a profound impact \non small businesses in Nebraska--but not just Nebraska, across this \ngreat Nation. Beginning in 2012, if a business purchases more than $600 \nof goods from another business, it will be required to provide the \nbusiness and the Internal Revenue Service a 1099 tax form. Previously, \nsuch disclosures were only required for the purchase of services. Now \nroutine business expenses will be subject to an increased paperwork \nburden at tax time.\n  Let me give some examples of the impact that is going to have. Think \nabout the phone costs for that small business, Internet, simple office \nproducts, even the cost of shipping goods from point A to point B now \nare going to generate this requirement of a 1099 tax form.\n  Back in my State what that means is, if a rancher buys $100 worth of \nfeed every month, then that rancher is going to have to submit a 1099 \nto the feed store and then file it with the IRS. If the restaurant \nowner up the street buys $600 worth of napkins or ketchup or menus or \ngarbage bags over the course of a year, guess what. They start building \nthat stack of 1099s.\n  Think about how that paperwork is going to burden that small \nbusiness. This includes transactions with corporate as well as \nnoncorporate entities. It also applies to government entities at the \nlocal, State, and Federal levels.\n  Businesses in my State, but I am confident across the country, are \nabsolutely up in arms about this provision, and they should be. Last \nweek, the National Taxpayer Advocate, an Internal Revenue Service \nombudsman, issued a report with some very startling admissions. This \nprovision, they say, will affect 40 million businesses, including about \n26 million sole proprietorships not counting farms. That is 10 times \nthe number of job creators than the administration asserts will benefit \nfrom the small business tax credits.\n  We need to look for ways to help small businesses, not hammer them. A \nNebraska small business owner wrote to me recently. This business owner \npointed out that he owns three small town lumber yards and wanted to \nweigh in on this provision. I am quoting from that letter:\n\n       As you know, it is difficult to survive as a small business \n     in rural communities. . . . Putting on additional burdens \n     involving time, paperwork and money does not help.\n\n  That small business owner went on to say this:\n\n       The building supply industry is struggling to survive the \n     housing and economic crisis and employers like myself would \n     be severely impacted by the additional costs and paperwork \n     burdens of the 1099 proposal.\n\n  I could not agree with this businessman more. This new provision is a \none-two punch for our small businesses. It will require them to spend \nmore money and time on paperwork and reporting. It does nothing to \ncreate jobs other than maybe at the Internal Revenue Service. This \nincreases the overhead costs of staying in business. It will require \nthem to spend more time and more money on paperwork and, no doubt about \nit, it is going to be tough for them to comply with the standards set \nso low at $600.\n  Expenses to comply with Federal tax compliance regulations are \nalready astounding. According to the Small Business Administration, \nsmall businesses that employ fewer than 20 people spend on average \n$1,304 per year per employee. In contrast large companies spend on \naverage $780 average per year per employee. So we can see the IRS tax \ncompliance regulations already disproportionately disadvantage small \nbusinesses compared to large companies. Why are we adding insult to \ninjury with this new requirement? We should be doing all we can to \nreduce overhead costs, help them to be more competitive not increasing \ntheir burdens. Why on Earth are we slapping Americans with more \nmandates that are counterproductive? Congress should be reducing \nbusinesses' overhead, helping them stay competitive.\n  Section 9006 creates a perverse incentive for companies to \nconsolidate suppliers. Think about that. Guess who loses in those \ncircumstances. Our small businesses, the same small businesses that we \nare counting on to create the new jobs and lift us out of this \nrecession. Larger, more diversified suppliers will be more attractive \nas a way for the purchaser to reduce the paperwork. The fewer different \ntransactions that total $600 or more, the less paperwork. So the little \nguy loses.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate said recently they are ``concerned \nthat the new reporting burden, particularly as it falls on small \nbusinesses, may turn out to be disproportionate as compared with any \nresulting improvement in tax compliance.''\n  The Advocate report lays out several reasons this new provision of \nthe law is causing so much concern. The report questions whether the \nnew data will lead to better tax compliance. ``The IRS will face \nchallenges making productive use of this new volume of information \nreports.''\n  For example, the new 1099's will not match tax returns due to \nreturned goods or other technical reasons. The report predicts the IRS \nwill improperly assess penalties for not filing forms. Again, I am \nquoting:\n\n       It must abate later, after great expenditure of taxpayer \n     and IRS time and effort.\n\n  Finally, a chilling prediction in the report says:\n\n       Small businesses that lack the capacity to track customer \n     purchases . . . may lose customers, leaving the economy with \n     more large national vendors and less local competition.\n\n  It is clear that section 9006 attacks small businesses across this \ncountry. That is why I am introducing legislation to eliminate this \nbarrier. My effort, which I call the Small Business Paperwork Mandate \nElimination Act, would fully repeal section 9006 of the health care law \nand eliminate this ridiculous paperwork burden. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport me in this effort. Overburdening our job creators is not good \npolicy, especially in this time in our economic recovery.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I heard that some of my colleagues on \nthe other side were here earlier engaged in a colloquy of condemnation \nof the appointment of Dr. Berwick to run CMS. I wanted to come back and \nrespond because I think this body is making a mistake and is taking a \nvery wrong path by attacking and criticizing this particular nominee.\n  To provide just a moment of context to his appointment, when I was \nhere yesterday I had a graph that showed that in 1955, the year that I \nwas born, we spent about $12 billion on health care as a nation. Last \nyear we spent $2.5 trillion, 200 times as much. The graph showed not \nonly the steep curve that took us from $12 billion to $2.5 trillion a \nyear, but also the fact that curve was accelerating. It was getting \nsteeper. In the last year the year-to-year increase was $134 billion in \nhealth care expenditures.\n  That is the biggest year-to-year increase in the history of the \nRepublic. If we kept at it, by 2016 a family of four in Rhode Island \nwould be paying $26,000 in premiums for a basic health care policy. \nMedicare Advantage plans jumped 14 percent last year nationally, on \naverage. We are in both an unsustainable and an accelerating health \ncare cost increase environment. Something absolutely has to be done \nabout it. I suspect almost everybody in this Chamber would agree with \nthat.\n  That is the backdrop--unsustainable, accelerating health care costs \nthat now gobble up more than 17 percent of our gross domestic product. \nThere is a huge discrepancy between us and every other nation in terms \nof the amount of our economy that we burn on health care. I believe the \nclosest to us is now at 12 percent of GDP, and we are at 17 percent, \nand it climbs every year along with that accelerated, unsustainable \nrate of health care cost increase.\n  The question is, What are we going to do about it? This is a terrific \nburden on our economy. It is uncompetitive against other nations, it \nhugely depresses our manufacturing sector, and it clobbers families who \nhave to pay for health care that is so expensive. It simply has to be \naddressed.\n  There are two ways we can do it. We could preserve the status quo and \nsimply cut benefits that people receive. We could make Social Security \nhealth care benefits knocked down. We could make Medicare benefits \nknocked down--disability health care benefits for Social Security. We \ncould make Medicaid benefits knocked down. We could spend less, I \nsuppose, on TRICARE in the Veterans' Administration and provide fewer \nservices, pay for less, or require more copays. That is one way to go \nabout doing it, but it is not a very smart way and it is not a very \nhumane way.\n  A lot of the costs in our health care system is waste; it is waste \nand inefficiency. If we look at the report of the President's Council \nof Economic Advisers, they come at it in two ways, and both ways come \nto the same number, about $700 billion a year--a year--in waste and \nexcess costs.\n  The New England Healthcare Institute did a study--$850 billion a year \nin waste and excess cost.\n  The Lewin Group and former Bush Treasury Secretary O'Neill have both \narrived at a different number, but they agree the number is $1 trillion \na year in waste and excess cost.\n  So if we have a huge cost problem, and if we have waste and excess \ncosts as high as $1 trillion a year--to give us an idea of the scale, \nremember it was about $2.5 trillion last year. It is supposed to be \n$2.7 trillion this year. If the Lewin Group and Secretary O'Neill's \nnumber is right, that means one-third of the cost, more than one-third \nof the cost is waste in excess care, unnecessary cost. So going after \nthat waste and excess cost should be a priority to deal with the cost \nburden that our health care system puts on the country.\n  How would we go about doing that? Well, we are actually fortunate in \none respect. In all of the mess of our health care system we are \nfortunate in one respect; that is, there is a proven correlation in \nmany areas between improving the quality of care and lowering the cost \nof care.\n  Probably the most famous example is dealing with hospital-acquired \ninfections. A hospital-acquired infection costs maybe $60,000 on \naverage to treat, and it is avoidable. It is completely preventable. So \nif we crack down on hospital-acquired infections, if we fix the process \nfailures that permit hospital-acquired infections to occur, we improve \nthe quality of care, we save people's lives, we get them out of the \nhospital sooner and healthier, and we save money, all together. But \nbecause of the bizarre economics of our health care system, it is not \nin anybody's financial interest to do that who is also in a position to \ndo that. So over and over, we have these failures where we could have \nhuge win-win situations in which we improve the quality of care for the \nAmerican people while reducing the cost of the health care system.\n  It happens with hospital-acquired infections. It happens with \nadministrative overhead. Medicare runs about 3 to 5 percent of \noverhead. The private insurance market runs at about 20 to 27 percent \noverhead. It has more than doubled in the last 6 years, from 2000 to \n2006. In 6 years it has more than doubled, just the administrative \noverhead, not health care itself, the administrative overhead of the \nprivate insurance industry. That is part of the waste and excess costs.\n  We can tackle those things. We can drive them down. We can improve, \nfor instance, maternal mortality rates in this country. Believe it or \nnot, America is 39th in maternal mortality. Maternal mortality is a \ncold, statistical way of describing a mother dying in childbirth, \ngiving birth to her baby, and we are 39th in the world; 38 countries do \nbetter at protecting moms while they are giving birth to their children \nthan we do.\n  If we can improve that rate, we can save money because the same \nprocess failures that lead to those deaths lead to expensive \ncomplications, additional days in the hospital, sometimes lead to \nlifelong injuries to the baby as it is being delivered, which create \nhuge cost. So, again, it is a win-win when we improve the quality of \ncare to lower the cost of medicine.\n  Now, why do I say all of that? Why do I talk about the importance--\nfirst of all, the urgency of the cost problem and the importance of \npursuing this win-win strategy to reduce the cost of care by improving \nthe quality of care for Americans? I mention that because Don Berwick \nis probably the leading pioneer in this area.\n  The bible of the quality of improvement movement was a book called \n``To Err is Human,'' written, I believe, by the National Institutes of \nHealth. Dr. Berwick was one of the lead authors of that report. It was \nfollowed by another report called ``Crossing the Quality Chasm.'' Those \ntwo reports have been the foundation for the quality reform movement.\n  I am very familiar with the quality reform movement because I founded \nsomething in Rhode Island called the Rhode Island Quality Institute \nwhich has led in this area. The legislation we passed, the health care \nlegislation, contains an immense number of reforms of the delivery \nsystem that are designed to capture this win-win, that are designed to \nimprove the quality of care in ways that lower the cost of care.\n  One economist has called it the most significant action on medical \nspending ever proposed in the United States. A Noble Prize-winning \neconomist has noted that official estimates don't give the plan much \ncredit for the cost-saving efforts in the proposed reform, but \nrealistically the reform is likely to do much better at controlling \ncosts than any of the official projections suggest.\n  An MIT professor, who is a leading health economist, said: I cannot \nthink of a thing to try that they did not try. They make the best \neffort anyone has ever made. Everything is in here. You could not have \ndone better than they are doing.\n  So the bill created an array, a portfolio of tools for beginning to \nchange our broken, dysfunctional health care delivery system and move \nit more in the direction of better patient care that costs less money.\n  The lead practitioner of that, the lead advocate of that, the person \nwho has thought about this the most and done the most work on it is Dr. \nDon Berwick. So it makes perfect sense he would be the person brought \nover by President Obama to lead CMS and to apply these principles of \nimproving the quality of care, to reduce the cost for America. He is an \nexpert at it. I think\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nwe wrote good legislation on the delivery system reform. I think it was \nactually very good legislation. But it does not matter how good the \nlegislation is that we write if the executive branch does not get out \nthere and implement it in a dynamic, thoughtful, iterative way. We \nlearn something, we move on.\n  We have to be creative and continue the pressure on this. We have to \ntake what we learn in different projects and bring them together and \ntry something now and constantly be in a process of innovation and \nimprovement in order to be effective. Nobody will do that better than \nProfessor Berwick. That is why both President Bush, H.W. Bush, and \nPresident Bush, W. Bush, their CMS directors have applauded this \nnomination.\n  Gail Wilensky, the Administrator of CMS under President George H.W. \nBush, said: Berwick has longstanding recognition for expertise and for \nnot being a partisan individual.\n  George W. Bush's CMS director, Tom Scully, said: You are not going to \ndo any better than Don Berwick.\n  So from the other side of the aisle, from the partisan side of \nexecutive management of this, the previous CMS directors know how \nqualified this man is. I know my Republican colleagues want to talk \nabout rationing. They would love to paint rationing and socialized \nmedicine and death panels all over the health care bill. Obviously they \ncannot resist the opportunity to do that using Dr. Berwick.\n  But, frankly, it is not fair, and I think it puts them on the wrong \nside of history. It puts them on the wrong side of reform. It raises \nthe question, Whose side are they on? When we have somewhere between \n$700 billion and $1 trillion of waste every year and the person who \nGeorge Bush's CMS director says we are not going to find any better to \ncome in and fix that program than the nominee, and they are against the \nsolution to that, whose side are they on?\n  Well, it is pretty clear they are on the side of the $700 billion to \n$1 trillion a year in waste. That is a choice they can make. But I do \nnot think it is a wise choice. When we are dealing with doing things \nsuch as eliminating hospital-acquired infections in order to save \nmoney, and they are against the person who is the leading proponent of \nthis and who is going to lead us in that direction, who are they for? \nAre they for the families who lose a loved one to a hospital-acquired \ninfection? It does not seem that way. It seems like a vote in favor of \nthe status quo. It seems like a vote in favor of the status quo and the \ncontinuing unbelievable number of deaths and casualties from hospital-\nacquired infections.\n  One of the findings of the ``To Err is Human'' report is that 100,000 \nAmericans die every year, 100,000 Americans die every year because of \navoidable medical errors. When we clean up the medical errors, when we \nclean up the process failures that lead to those medical errors, we \nsave money. That is Don Berwick's expertise. When they oppose him, \nwhose side are they on? Are they on the side of 100,000 Americans who \nlose their lives every year because of avoidable medical errors? I do \nnot think so. It sounds as if they are on the side of the 100,000 \nmedical errors.\n  Let this guy have a chance. He has bipartisan support. He is an \nexpert in this area. The area he is expert in is the best path to lead \nus to cost savings in health care because it is a win-win path. We do \nnot have to take something away from somebody to create the savings; we \ncan earn the savings by reforming the delivery system so it provides \nbetter health care.\n  He has founded the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. He has \nworked as a board member on the American Hospital Association on \nQuality Initiatives. He chaired the Advisory Council for the Agency for \nHealth Research and Quality. He goes back to the Clinton era, where he \nwas on President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection \nand Quality. He is the real deal.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as I did yesterday, to step back from the \npartisanship, to step back from the posturing. We have heard enough \nabout rationing. There is not rationing in this; this is quality \nreform. We have heard enough about death panels and socialized medicine \nand all of that nonsense.\n  We have a serious problem in our health care system. We need to \naddress it seriously. There is a path to address it that is a win-win \nfor our country, for our people, for our society that reduces costs and \nprovides Americans better care. To me, it is embarrassing that we \nshould be 39th in maternal mortality. There are 38 countries that \nkeep mothers alive through childbirth better than we do. That is the \nkind of thing we should be fixing. That is the kind of quality reform \nwe need. That is the kind of quality reform Don Berwick gets behind.\n\n  This should be an area where we can all get behind this. Some of the \nwork he has done has been in Republican States, in States with \nRepublican Senators. I just know, off the top of my head, that Utah is \na leading State in the quality reform area. The North Carolina Medicaid \neffort on Medical Home is one of the leading early studies on this \nissue. These people have Republican Senators who can report on how \nsuccessful those have been. Yet they have made the choice not to look \nat Berwick for the person he is, for the expert he is, for the purpose \nhe brings to this job, but just as an excuse to try to go back to the \nslogans and try to sloganeer their way through what is a real and \nsignificant problem for our country.\n  So unless you want to wish failure on America in this task, unless \nyou want to wish failure on America in reducing the 100,000 deaths \nevery year from avoidable medical errors, unless you want to wish \nfailure on America in improving our status so we are the best in the \nworld on maternal mortality rather than 39th, unless you want to wish \nfailure on America in the only win-win path to reducing the terrible \nburden of health care costs, the accelerating burden, unsustainable \nburden of health care costs on our country, unless you want to wish \nAmerica failure in that, you ought to support Don Berwick because he \nknows how to follow this path, this win-win path, toward health care \nsavings that come from improving quality. That is a path we should be \non.\n  There is no one better suited to lead CMS down that path than Dr. \nBerwick. So I hope we can find a way in this body to be better than \nthat. I think Dr. Berwick gives us the occasion to be better than that. \nAt long last, I hope that soon we become better than that.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me begin by making a few points about \nwhich there is not a whole lot of disagreement.\n  First, the United States today is in the midst of the worst economic \ndownturn since the 1930s. Over 16 percent of working age Americans are \nunemployed or underemployed, working 20 hours a week when they want to \nbe working 40 hours. Long-term unemployment is the highest on record. \nIn other words, when people are losing their jobs now, it is not a \nquestion of weeks to gain a new job but, in some cases, 6 or 8 months \nor perhaps not at all. In the midst of this economic crisis, millions \nof Americans have lost their homes, savings, and pensions.\n  Second point: The United States today has a $13 trillion national \ndebt and a record-breaking $1.6 trillion deficit. Last year alone, the \nFederal Government spent over $186 billion paying interest on that \ndebt. We are leaving our children and grandchildren a huge financial \nobligation which not only will impact them personally but will affect \nthe well-being of the entire country in the midst of a strong and \ncompetitive global economy.\n  Third point: The United States today has the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country. Today, as this \nchart indicates, the top 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent earns more income than \nthe bottom 50 percent. And the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. The top, 1 percent; bottom, 90 percent. What we have \nis a nation in which in many ways we are moving toward an oligarchic\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nform of society, with a small number of people on the top seeing a huge \nincrease in their wealth and income while the middle class lapses and \npoverty increases.\n  During the Bush years, when the middle class saw a $2,200 decline in \nmedian family income, the 400 wealthiest families saw their income more \nthan double. Meanwhile, while the very rich became much richer, their \neffective income tax rates were slashed almost in half over the past 15 \nyears. The rich get richer. Their effective income tax rate goes down. \nThe wealthiest 400 Americans have now accumulated $1.27 trillion in \nwealth, while the highest paid 400 Americans had an average income of \n$345 million in 2007 alone. As a result of Bush's tax policy, these \nvery high-income people pay an effective tax rate of 16.6 percent, the \nlowest on record. The rich get richer. Their effective tax rates go \ndown--lowest on record.\n  Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people on the planet, has often \nmade the point that he, a multibillionaire, pays a lower effective tax \nrate than his secretary.\n  Last point I wish to make: Last month a gentleman named Dan Duncan, \nwho happened to be the wealthiest person in Houston, TX, passed away. \nHe left his family some $9 billion. For the first time since 1916, \nalmost 100 years, somebody in the top echelon bracket like a Mr. Duncan \nwill have a situation where his heirs will pay zero inheritance tax, \nnot a nickel. That is the first time that a multimillionaire or \nbillionaire has died in 100 years and their family has not paid one \npenny in inheritance taxes. This occurred as a result of President \nBush's $1.35 trillion tax break enacted into law in 2001. In other \nwords, at a time when this country has a devastatingly high rate of \nunemployment, at a time when the Senate refused to extend unemployment \nbenefits to desperate people who, through no fault of their own, have \nlost their jobs and have no income, at a time when we have a huge \nnational debt, at a time when we have massive unmet needs, including a \ncrumbling infrastructure and the need to transform our energy system, \nat a time when we have a growing gap between the very rich and everyone \nelse, we have a situation now where the very wealthiest people are \nseeing, when one in their family dies, their estate tax is zero.\n  A century ago, President Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, called \nfor a graduated inheritance tax on wealthy estates. In 1916, Congress \npassed that law. Interestingly enough, here is what Republican Teddy \nRoosevelt said in 1910:\n\n       The absence of effective state, and, especially, national, \n     restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a \n     small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful \n     men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. \n     The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these \n     men to accumulate power which is not for the general welfare \n     that they should hold or exercise . . . No man should receive \n     a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned.\n\n  Let me repeat: No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has \nbeen fairly earned.\n\n       Every dollar received should represent a dollar's worth of \n     service rendered, not gambling in stocks but service \n     rendered. The really big fortune, the swollen fortune, by the \n     mere fact of its size, acquires qualities which differentiate \n     it in kind as well as in degree from what is passed by men of \n     relatively small means. Therefore, I believe in a graduated \n     income tax on big fortunes and in another tax which is far \n     more easily collected and far more effective--a graduated \n     inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against \n     evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the \n     estate.\n\n  Teddy Roosevelt, 1910.\n  There are not many Republicans I agree with today, but I do agree \nwith what Teddy Roosevelt said 100 years ago. That is exactly what the \nresponsible estate tax act I have introduced, along with Senators \nHarkin, Whitehouse, Franken, and Sherrod Brown, will do. Specifically, \nthis legislation exempts the first $3.5 million of an inheritance from \npaying any Federal estate tax whatsoever. Doing this means that 99.7 \npercent of Americans who receive an inheritance will not pay one penny \nin Federal estate taxes. This legislation would impact only the very \nwealthy, the top three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Under my legislation, the value of estates above $3.5 million and \nbelow $10 million would be taxed at 45 percent; the value of estates \nabove $10 million and below $50 million would be taxed at 50 percent; \nand the value of estates above $50 million would be taxed at 55 \npercent, the same as the 2001 level before the Bush tax cuts. Further, \nthis legislation includes a 10-percent surtax on the value of estates \nabove $500 million or $1 billion for couples.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this legislation, over \na 10-year period, would bring in $315 billion--a significant step \nforward in addressing our national debt. But this legislation would do \nsomething even more important. In the midst of these enormously \ndifficult times, this legislation makes clear we are one country and \nall Americans must accept shared responsibility. In my view, it is \nimmoral, it is unfair that while the middle class struggles to survive, \nmillionaires and billionaires get tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our \nmilitary construction program and some concerns I have about an \napparent shift in strategy, what this means for our American soldiers \nand their families and for the growing debt and deficits we are seeing \non the taxpayers of this country.\n  Without question, our military construction program should be \nfiscally responsible and driven by the future security posture of the \nU.S. forces. Dating back to the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military \ndetermined that our Armed Forces would be best trained and equipped for \nservice when stationed at installations on U.S. soil.\n  Our military adopted a force projection strategy that allows our \nU.S.-stationed service men and women to deploy from home rather than \nbeing based primarily overseas.\n  This Congress has been very supportive of the Army's transformation \nto a more modular and expeditionary force structure, allowing more \ntroops to be stationed in the United States.\n  In 2005, the Overseas Basing Commission reaffirmed the force \nprojection strategy. It applauded the vision behind the Pentagon's \nefforts to transform the military and restation tens of thousands of \nmilitary personnel back on U.S. soil.\n  So the Pentagon's strategy, endorsed by the Overseas Basing \nCommission, has guided the way Congress directs resources and funding \nfor military construction facilities. We have invested more than $14 \nbillion to build housing, stationing, training, and deployment \ncapabilities at major military installations in the United States. We \nhave proven we can best train and deploy from the United States and do \nit more cost-effectively.\n\n  Despite these taxpayer-backed investments, the Pentagon's current \nMILCON program is shifting military construction projects, military \nforces, and taxpayer dollars overseas. Strategically, this would set in \nmotion a worldwide transformation of U.S. basing that would actually \nexpand our overseas presence, and this at a time when the aid given to \nAmerican efforts in the war on terror is, with a few exceptions, not \nimpressive.\n  Fiscally, the Department of Defense is pursuing expensive and, in \nsome cases, duplicative military construction projects in Europe, \nKorea, and Guam without demonstrating adequate cost efficiencies or \nprojected future costs. This shift in global posture fundamentally \ndisconnects with stateside basing capabilities and reverses the \nOverseas Basing Commission's recommendations.\n  Europe: In Germany massive plans are underway to move U.S. Army \nheadquarters from Heidelberg to Wiesbaden. I question this move because \nEuropean and African Commands already have substantial infrastructure \nin Stuttgart where efficiencies would be available. The Government \nAccountability Office does not believe the Army will achieve any cost \nsavings. Not only would these\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nhuge and costly projects create thousands of foreign jobs, but they \nwould require continuous taxpayer funding to maintain facilities and \ntraining capabilities. The United States has averaged spending $278 \nmillion per year in Germany in the last 5 years, but the Department of \nDefense now plans to raise that spending to $750 million per year. It \ncosts nearly 15 percent less to build in the United States than to \nbuild in Germany, and while American taxpayers have invested $1.4 \nbillion in German infrastructure from 2006 to 2010, Germany's \ncontribution has averaged $20 million per year, or less than 10 \npercent.\n  This is a poor taxpayer investment considering the serious \nlimitations to U.S. military training and deployment capabilities \noverseas. It would also create duplicative headquarters at several \nlocations in Germany. Our troops must have access to training areas \nwhere they can maneuver freely, conduct live-fire exercises, and work \nwith night vision devices. Many overseas locations prohibit such \nintensive training. Others allow only certain aspects of the training \nto be done under closely monitored circumstances. These limitations \nhinder the readiness of our troops while taxing our citizens more.\n  Deployment impediments also exist in Europe. During times of peace \nand war, our troops face restrictions traveling through many countries. \nIn 2003, deploying American forces from Germany into Iraq was \ncomplicated when several European countries denied U.S. troops access \nto air and ground routes. Merely having our troops forward-deployed is \nno guarantee they will be available when and where we need them.\n  Korea: The Department of Defense is also planning to spend millions \nto build deployment facilities in Korea. The Pentagon is proposing to \nshift 1-year deployments for troops alone to 3-year tours that include \ntheir families. This change would expand U.S. presence in Korea from \n30,000 service personnel to approximately 84,000, counting dependents. \nSubstantial taxpayer funding would be required to build adequate \nhousing, schools, hospitals, fitness centers, childcare facilities, \ncommissaries, and more. We have asked for the numbers that would be \nprojected for this. The Department has not given us any numbers nor any \nprojections on the costs of adding 50,000 more people into Korea than \nwe now have. Investing these resources into Korea makes no sense when \nwe are already building up infrastructure and deployment capabilities \nat U.S. bases where amenities support military families and are well \nestablished.\n  Guam: Plans to shift Marines currently stationed in Japan to the tiny \nisland of Guam are also problematic. There are significant \nenvironmental concerns with trying to accommodate such a large number \nof military personnel in such a small space, and the island lacks \nsufficient existing infrastructure. In addition to that, the timeline \nfor transitioning marines stationed in Japan is implausible and the \ncosts are staggering. They are now estimated at $16 billion. With these \nconsiderable barriers, better basing alternatives should be explored. \nAgain, we have asked the Department to look into this, to give \nalternatives. We have suggested alternatives, but we have received no \nfeedback from the Department.\n  The Department of Defense has indicated this new military \nconstruction program is intended to build partnership capacity. Some \nargue that U.S. presence overseas provides assurance to our allies and \ndeterrence to our adversaries. History has shown this is not always the \ncase. Basing American military personnel at key locations in Europe did \nnot deter the Russians from conducting military operations against \nGeorgia in 2008. Even with our 30,000 troops in Korea, North Korea did \nnot hesitate to attack a South Korean naval vessel in May of this year.\n  Let's look at what the partnership agreements we are seeking have \ngiven us so far. We are in a war on terror in which the United States \nnow has more than 78,000 troops. Germany has 4,350. The United Kingdom \nhas double what Germany has. So the United Kingdom, which has a smaller \npopulation, has more troops by double than Germany. Yet we are looking \nat all of this buildup in Germany for building partnership capacity. \nGermany contributes 4 percent of NATO troops to Afghanistan, but they \nhave strict rules of engagement that include not going on offense and \nrestrictions on night operations. So if we are going to do so much \nourselves, does it make sense for the American taxpayer to be building \nwhat would be about a billion and a half more in Germany, in facilities \nthat we already have in the United States? Or if there needs to be more \nArmy building in Germany, at least do it in Stuttgart where the Army \nalready has a headquarters, instead of a whole new operation in \nWiesbaden.\n  If the United States wants to make sure our assure our allies and \ndeter our enemies, we should do it with strong military capabilities \nand sound policy, not by keeping troops stationed overseas, siphoning \nfunds from equipment and arms, and putting it into duplicative military \nconstruction.\n  Instead of breaking ground on military projects abroad and advancing \nthe Department's new goal of building partnership capacity, we should \nbe building American infrastructure. We are carrying the heaviest load \nby far in the war on terror, and we are carrying it for freedom-loving \npeople throughout the world. We need to build up bases in our country \nwhich we have already done to accommodate the strategy since the Cold \nWar. Yet now we appear to be reversing that strategy, and I am asking \nwhy. I have asked the Department of Defense. I have asked the Secretary \nof Defense for answers and have not yet been able to receive anything \nthat would show why we would make such a huge investment in these \nforeign bases, with training constraints and deployment constraints, \nwhen we could do the same thing at home and deploy our troops at will.\n  Following World War II, the United States constructed bases in Europe \nto establish a strong presence as nations rebuilt. We stayed in Europe \nand placed bases in Korea to protect the interests of America and its \nallies during the Cold War. The world has changed, and with it our \nNation's military priorities must also change. Our military \nconstruction investment should reflect our strategic principles. It \nshould meet the needs of military families. It should maximize the \nforce flexibility of our modern military, and it should demonstrate the \nfiscal discipline that taxpayers rightly expect.\n  Secretary Gates has made fiscal discipline a priority at the \nDepartment of Defense. He has said we are going to cut defense \nspending. So this military construction plan is puzzling. I am not sure \nthe military and the Department heads are on the same wavelength \nbecause we are looking at $1 billion of foreign construction we do not \nneed with capacity we have already built in America.\n  So I am asking the Department of Defense to look at this and to make \nsure we are in every way having respect for the taxpayers and making \nsure our military and our families have the security and support they \nneed, and I believe that can be done with bases at home.\n  I will offer amendments to reduce the level of spending in overseas \nconstruction and possibly in administrative costs at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs that do not affect veterans health care or benefits. \nThere is more at stake for our future, for our economy, and for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Out-of-control spending is putting the short- and long-term fiscal \nhealth of the United States at risk. The national public debt hit an \nhistoric $13 trillion in May. This year, the Federal Government is \nborrowing 40 cents out of every dollar it spends, and it is spending 67 \npercent more than it brings in. In pursuit of its costly and damaging \nbig government agenda, the Obama administration has increased the total \npublic debt by $2 trillion in less than 2 years, an increase of 23 \npercent in 16 months. If the spending continues at this rate, at the \nend of President Obama's first term he will have added an additional $6 \ntrillion to the public debt. If we go along with the requests of the \nWhite House, $6 trillion more will be added to our debt in this term. \nThis is irresponsible and unsustainable.\n  As the appropriations process moves forward, I will offer amendments \nto bring military construction back down to levels that are consistent \nwith the Secretary of Defense's own stated objective, which is to cut \nmilitary spending. I am going to offer amendments I\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\nbelieve will be responsible, will protect our forces, and will be \nbetter for our military families, and it will achieve the spending cuts \nthe Secretary has said he believes are necessary.\n  We need to make the tough decisions. I am offering a way forward. I \nam offering commonsense cuts that will assure we will be able to meet \nthe needs of our military, the security of our military, the security \nof the American people, and a respect for this enormous deficit. We can \ncut back on this deficit with responsible spending.\n  I have outlined some of these concerns in today's Politico magazine, \nand I ask unanimous consent that my op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, July 13, 2010]\n\n                   (By Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison)\n\n              Military's Foundation Must Be Made in U.S.A.\n\n       For the future security posture of U.S. military forces and \n     for the fiscal health of our nation, our military \n     construction agenda should be guided by these words: build in \n     America.\n       At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military determined \n     that our armed forces would be best trained and equipped for \n     service when stationed on U.S. soil. Thus, our military \n     adopted a ``force projection'' strategy that allows service \n     members to deploy from home, rather than being based \n     primarily overseas.\n       The Overseas Basing Commission reaffirmed the force \n     projection strategy in 2005. It lauded the insights and \n     vision behind Defense Department initiatives to transform the \n     military and re-station tens of thousands of military \n     personnel back on U.S. soil. Congress has legislated and \n     appropriated accordingly.\n       We've now invested more than $14 billion to build housing, \n     stationing, training and deployment capacities at major \n     military installations. Deployment of U.S. forces from \n     Germany to Iraq, for example, was complicated by denials of \n     air and ground routes through several European countries. We \n     have proved we can best deploy from the United States--and we \n     can do it more cost effectively.\n       However, the DoD's current military construction proposal \n     would set in motion a worldwide transformation of U.S. basing \n     that would expand our overseas presence. DoD is pursuing \n     expensive, and in some cases duplicative, military \n     construction projects in Europe, South Korea and Guam, \n     without demonstrating adequate cost efficiencies, projected \n     costs or a broader basing strategy.\n       This shift in global posture fundamentally disconnects with \n     stateside basing capabilities and reverses the Overseas \n     Basing Commission's recommendations.\n       In Germany, massive plans are under way to move U.S. Army \n     headquarters from Heidelberg to Wiesbaden--though European \n     and African commands already have substantial infrastructure \n     in Stuttgart, where more efficiencies would be available.\n       Not only would the projects create thousands of foreign \n     jobs; they would also require continuous taxpayer funding to \n     maintain facilities and training capabilities. This is a poor \n     investment given the serious limitations to U.S. military \n     training and deployment capabilities overseas. And it would \n     create duplicate headquarters at several locations.\n       It costs nearly 15 percent less to build in the United \n     States than in Germany. In addition, the U.S. military has \n     invested $1.4 billion in German infrastructure from 2006 to \n     2010, while Germany's contribution has averaged $20 million \n     per year--or less than 10 percent.\n       Our troops must have access to training areas where they \n     can maneuver freely, conduct live-fire exercises and work \n     with night-vision devices. Many overseas locations prohibit \n     such intensive training. Others allow only certain aspects of \n     the training to be done under closely circumscribed \n     conditions.\n       These limitations hinder the readiness of our troops, while \n     taxing our citizens.\n       Deployment impediments also exist in Europe. During times \n     of peace and war, our troops face restrictions traveling \n     through many countries.\n       In 2003, for example, our NATO ally Turkey refused to let \n     U.S. troops travel through its territory, even in its \n     airspace, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       Merely having troops forward-deployed is no guarantee that \n     they will be available when and where we need them.\n       DoD is also planning to spend millions to build deployment \n     facilities in South Korea. The Pentagon proposes shifting \n     deployments from one year to three years, including troops' \n     families. This expands the U.S. presence from 30,000 service \n     personnel to approximately 84,000, counting dependents. It \n     will require substantial taxpayer funding to build adequate, \n     housing, schools, hospitals, fitness centers, child care \n     facilities and commissaries.\n       Investing these resources in South Korea makes no sense \n     when we are already building up infrastructure and deployment \n     capabilities at U.S. bases, where amenities for military \n     families are well-established.\n       Similarly, plans to shift Marines now stationed in Japan to \n     the tiny island of Guam are problematic. This proposal is \n     fraught with significant environmental concerns, insufficient \n     infrastructure, an implausible timeline--and staggering \n     costs, now estimated at $16 billion. With these considerable \n     barriers, better basing alternatives should be explored.\n       Some argue that the U.S. overseas presence provides \n     assurance to our allies and deterrence to our adversaries. \n     History has shown otherwise.\n       Having U.S. troops in Europe did not deter the Russians \n     from-conducting military operations against Georgia in 2008. \n     More recently, the U.S. military in South Korea did not deter \n     North Korean aggression against a South Korean naval vessel.\n       We should assure our allies and deter our enemies with \n     strong military capabilities and sound policy, not merely by \n     keeping our troops stationed overseas.\n       Instead of breaking ground on military projects abroad--and \n     advancing DoD's new goal of building ``partnership \n     capacity''--we should be building American infrastructure.\n       After World War II, the U.S. constructed bases in Europe to \n     establish a strong presence as nations rebuilt. We stayed in \n     Europe and placed bases in South Korea to protect the \n     interests of America and its allies during the Cold War.\n       The world has changed--and with it, our nation's military \n     priorities. Our military construction investment should \n     reflect our strategic principles, meet the needs of military \n     families, maximize the force flexibility of our modern \n     military and demonstrate the fiscal discipline that taxpayers \n     rightly expect.\n       I hope the Defense Department will continue to build the \n     foundation of our military right here on American soil.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the opportunity \nto lay out the strategy I am offering to the administration. I hope we \ncan come back to the strategy adopted by Congress over the last 10 \nyears that would have American troops in America, would create American \njobs in military construction, will save taxpayer dollars, and will \nassure that when our troops go into harm's way, they will not be \nblocked by European countries that do not allow us to use airspace or \ntrain troops on the ground. We cannot afford that kind of luxury in \nthis kind of environment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today America heard the sad news that \nGeorge Steinbrenner, one of Major League Baseball's most influential \nteam owners, died at the age of 80. I rise today to express my \ncondolences to George's family and share my intention of offering a \nresolution today, along with Senators Gillibrand, Bill Nelson, and \nLeMieux to honor his memory.\n  He is survived by his beloved wife Joan, his sisters Susan and Judy, \nhis children Hank, Jennifer, Jessica, and Hal, and his 13 \ngrandchildren.\n  Like New York and like the Yankees, George Steinbrenner was a \nchampion. He was someone about whom you can truly say there will never \nbe another one like him.\n  Before we even get into baseball, George Steinbrenner was a very \naccomplished man. He served his country for 2 years in the Air Force. \nHe was the owner of the American Ship Building Company, the dominant \nshipbuilding company in the Great Lakes region during its existence. He \ndonated his time and money to countless charitable causes and was a \ndriving force in the U.S. Olympic Committee, where he made sure \nAmerica's athletes could reach their full potential, bringing home gold \nmedals and making sports fans around this great country proud of our \nathletes.\n  Many of us know George as being a giant in Major League Baseball. \nThere is no denying he changed the face of baseball forever.\n  Before George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees were in shambles. \nThe once great franchise had become moribund.\n  I have always been a Yankees fan, even though I am from Brooklyn. By \nthe time I was old enough to appreciate baseball, the Dodgers had just \nleft for Los Angeles, and it would be several years before the Mets \nwere created. So the Yankees were the only team in town, and like most \nof my friends on the streets of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, I became a \nrabid Yankee fan.\n  Those were the glory years of Mantle, Maris, Ford, Howard, and Berra. \nBut by the midsixties, my heroes began\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nto retire, and the once great Yankees began to slide.\n  Those were not easy years to root for the Yankees. People forget. \nThroughout the late sixties and early seventies, the Yankees were \nconsistently one of the worst performing teams in Major League \nBaseball.\n  But all that changed when George Steinbrenner bought the team in \n1973. He brought to the Yankees a new hope that turned around this \nperiod of decline. By 1976, the Yankees were back in the World Series, \nand in 1977 and 1978, we brought the championship back home to New \nYork.\n  Since then, the Yankees have once again become a household name in \nNew York and around the country. They have won 11 American League \npennants and 7 World Championships. The Yankees went, the day George \nSteinbrenner took them over, from being a mediocre team to the \npreeminent sports franchise in the world.\n  George Steinbrenner did that. He turned a scrappy group of baseball \nplayers into a team New Yorkers are proud to support.\n  The Yankees of his day are reminiscent of the Yankees of the \ntwenties, thirties, forties, fifties, and the early sixties. All New \nYorkers and baseball fans owe George Steinbrenner a huge thank you for \nchanging the face of American baseball.\n  He was even beloved in Florida. Legends Field, the Yankees' spring \ntraining facility in Tampa, was renamed Steinbrenner Field in March \n2008 in his honor by the Hillsborough County Commission and the Tampa \nCity Council.\n  He was a giant in baseball innovation, making baseball a truly global \ngame.\n  I, along with millions of Yankee fans--many not even in the State of \nNew York--are thankful for the countless hours of joy we have \nexperienced watching his team at the stadium or following them on \ntelevision or radio. George Steinbrenner was truly a New York icon.\n  My thoughts and my condolences go out to his loved ones, to the whole \nYankee family, and to the millions of New York baseball fans. We have \nlost our giant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5765-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a statement that I would like to \nmake, first on a letter and announcement that all the Republican \nmembers of the Senate Appropriations Committee have sent to the \nchairman of the committee today.\n  Because Federal spending and debt are at crisis levels, Republican \nSenators on the Senate Appropriations Committee are asking our \nDemocratic colleagues to join us in supporting the Sessions-McCaskill \nfreeze on discretionary Federal spending. Every Republican--every one \nof us--and 17 Democratic Senators already have voted for the Sessions-\nMcCaskill amendment this session several times.\n  The amendment would basically freeze Federal discretionary \nappropriations--both military and nonmilitary--which constitute about \n38 percent of the Federal budget. This action by the Senate members of \nthe Appropriations Committee is especially important this year because \nthe Democratic Congress has refused to produce a budget.\n  Here we are, at a time when almost every American is deeply worried \nabout the level of Federal debt and the level of Federal spending, and \nthe first thing we would expect the Congress to do before it plans for \nnext year is to produce a budget that would be able to restrain this \nspending--both the discretionary part of it, the kind we appropriate \nyear after year--and begin to deal with the entitlements--the mandatory \nspending that is on automatic pilot. The Democratic Congress has not \nproduced that budget for next year, and it indicates it will not. So \nit, therefore, is the first job of the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee to decide how much we can spend.\n  Year in and year out we decide where and how we spend the money. That \nis the constitutional responsibility of Congress under article I, and \nthat is the job we do. Perhaps we haven't paid as much attention to the \nfirst responsibility as we should. Perhaps we have relied too much on \nthe Budget Committee. Well, not this year. What we are saying is, if we \nare going to be members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and if \nour responsibility is to deal with Federal spending, then the first \nquestion we should decide is how much Federal spending.\n  At a time when Federal spending and debt is at crisis levels, when \nthe President's 10-year budget, up through the year 2018, would double \nthe debt and triple the debt, it is our responsibility to get this \nunder control.\n  So our recommendation--and it is a serious recommendation, and one we \nhope and believe our colleagues who are Democrats on the Appropriations \nCommittee will be able to accept because it is a bipartisan proposal \nthat has already, as I mentioned, received between 16 and 18 Democratic \nvotes on the floor of the Senate, and every single one of the 41 \nRepublican Senators--is that we essentially freeze spending in the \ndiscretionary accounts, both military and nonmilitary, between this \nyear and next year.\n  The Federal debt is a crisis that is imposing a burden on our \nchildren and our grandchildren that they will not be able to pay. It is \nour responsibility to deal with it and to begin to deal with it now. A \nSessions-McCaskill freeze on Federal discretionary spending for next \nyear is an important first step. The next step would then be getting \nentitlement spending under control, which we should move on as rapidly \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the letter from Republican members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee which I referred to earlier in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2010.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Republican members of the \n     Appropriations Committee, we are writing to express our views \n     regarding the Fiscal Year 2011 appropriations process.\n       The Committee is operating in a particularly difficult \n     environment during this Congress. The enormity of the Federal \n     debt poses a direct threat to our national security and \n     demands restraint of Federal spending. Developing a consensus \n     approach to funding the operations of the Federal government \n     in such an environment is a significant challenge.\n       Despite the clear need for a long term plan that would \n     bring our nation's debt under control, it is apparent that \n     Congress will be denied the opportunity to debate a Federal \n     budget this year. Our Committee will instead be compelled to \n     choose a discretionary top-line number outside the context of \n     a comprehensive budget resolution.\n       Over the last two years discretionary spending has \n     increased by 17%, not including stimulus spending. With \n     stimulus spending included the increase soars to 84%. We note \n     that a bipartisan majority of the Senate has voted several \n     times in recent months on the Sessions-McCaskill proposal to \n     impose a discretionary top-line for Fiscal Year 2011 that \n     essentially freezes non-defense spending, and which would \n     result in significant reductions in spending from the \n     President's budget proposal.

Mr. President, 40 years ago, at the time of the first\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nEarth Day, Americans became deeply worried about air and water \npollution and a population explosion that threatened to overrun the \nplanet's resources.\n  Nuclear power was seen as a savior to these environmental dilemmas. \nIt could produce large amounts of low-cost, reliable clean energy. \nUnlike oil, nuclear power did not need to be hauled in leaking tankers \nfrom countries that did not like us. Unlike coal, it did not spew tons \nof pollution out of smokestacks.\n  Then Three Mile Island and Chernobyl happened. The world pulled back, \nfearful of nuclear technology--even though no one was hurt at Three \nMile Island. In fact, no one has ever died as a result of a nuclear \naccident at an American commercial nuclear reactor or on a U.S. navy \nship powered by reactors. Chernobyl was the tragic result of a flawed \ntechnology never used in the United States. Still, the United States \nhas not licensed a new reactor since 1978.\n  Now the rest of the world is returning to nuclear energy. France is \n80 percent nuclear and has among the lowest per capita carbon emissions \nand cheapest electricity costs in Western Europe. Italy, Britain, \nFinland and Eastern Europe all are exploring new reactors. Russia, \nIndia, China and Japan are moving ahead. South Korea is selling \nreactors to the United Arab Emirates.\n  These countries realize that exploding populations demand large \namounts of cheap, reliable electricity to help create jobs and lift \npeople out of poverty. And nuclear power provides just that. The \nNational Academy of Sciences in a 2009 report said that the cost of \nnuclear power is equal to or lower than natural gas, wind, solar, or \ncoal with carbon capture. Reactors can operate for 80 years while wind \nand solar last about 25 years. And nuclear reactors operate 90 percent \nof the time while wind and solar are only available about a third of \nthe time. Remember: wind and solar power can't be stored today in \nsignificant amounts. Most people do not want their lights and computers \nworking only when the wind blows.\n  Nuclear plants occupy a fraction of the land required for wind or \nsolar. For example, 20 percent of U.S. electricity comes from 104 \nnuclear reactors on about 100 square miles. Producing the same amount \nof power from wind would require covering an area the size of West \nVirginia with 183,000 50-story turbines as well as building 19,000 \nmiles of new transmission lines through scenic areas and suburban \nbackyards.\n  Nuclear fuel is available in the U.S. and is virtually unlimited. We \ndo not have to drill for it. We do not have to mine it nearly as much \nas we do for coal. And thanks to technology, we can safely recycle \n``nuclear waste'' and turn most of it into more fuel. After recycling, \nthe French are able to store all of their final waste from producing 80 \npercent of their electricity for 30 years in one room in La Hague.\n  A more recently realized benefit of nuclear power is its ability to \ncombat climate change. Nuclear power emits zero greenhouse gases. Today \nit produces 20 percent of our Nation's electricity but 70 percent of \nour carbon-free electricity. Wind and solar provide less than 2 percent \nof our electricity and 6 percent of our carbon-free electricity today.\n  The United States uses 25 percent of all the energy in the world. At \na time when we need to produce large amounts of clean power at home at \na cost that will not chase jobs overseas looking for cheap energy, \nAmericans can't afford to ignore nuclear power.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion which was \nraised by the Senator from Tennessee relative to the letter which has \nbeen signed by all the Republican members of the Appropriations \nCommittee. This is a unique event, in my experience. I have had the \ngreat honor and privilege of serving on this committee now for 14 \nyears, and I have never participated in this type of an undertaking, \nwhich is basically the Appropriations Committee Republicans, at least, \nstepping up and doing the responsible thing in the area of trying to \ncontrol the fiscal policy of this country when the Budget Committee has \nleft the field.\n  The Budget Committee didn't leave the field arbitrarily; it is just \nthat the other side of the aisle decided they did not want to do a \nbudget for some reason. Actually, I know the reason. The reason we are \nnot doing a budget of the country as we are supposed to do is that the \nbudget shows we are in dire straits. We are going to have a $1.4 to \n$1.6 trillion deficit this year. It looks as if next year we are going \nto have a deficit in the range of $1.4 trillion. And for the next 10 \nyears, every year under the Obama budget and under the spending plans \nof the Democratic leadership of this Congress, we are talking an \naverage of $1 trillion a year of deficits. That adds up to a doubling \nof the debt in 5 years and a tripling of the debt in 10 years. The \nAmerican people understand that we cannot do this, we cannot continue \nthat type of profligate spending, that type of out-of-control spending.\n  But, unfortunately, the other party, which now controls with \nsignificant majorities both the House and the Senate, is unwilling to \nstep up and produce a budget which brings those numbers down, which \nmakes us more responsible in the area of spending and reduces the debt \nburden on our children. So the Republican members of the Appropriations \nCommittee have said: Enough. We want to stop this out-of-control \nspending. We want to have a spending proposal in place that makes \nsense. And we picked a number that is very reasonable. It is \nessentially a freeze at last year's levels. It is a number which has \nbeen supported, interestingly enough, on this floor when it was offered \nas the Senator Sessions-Senator McCaskill amendment on four different \noccasions, by a majority of the Senate, with all of the Republican \nMembers of the Senate voting for this type of essential freeze and with \na number--I think between 16 and 18--of Democratic Senators voting for \nthis. That is because there is a full understanding, at least on our \nside of the aisle and by some Members on the other side of the aisle \nwho did vote for this, that we have to do something about controlling \nspending around here.\n  This letter essentially says that before we start marking up any \nbills in the Appropriations Committee, we have to have an understanding \nas to how much we are going to spend. Is that an unusual idea? Is it a \nterribly radical idea, that we should reach a number, an overall \nagreement on an overall number as to what we are going to spend around \nhere before we start producing spending bills? No, it is not. It is \nexactly what the budget is supposed to do. But we do not have a budget \nfor the reason I mentioned earlier--people do not want to talk about \nhow big the deficit is around here because they are afraid the American \npeople have already figured this out and will just get more outraged \nabout it.\n  What we are doing and what we are suggesting in this letter and what \nwe are saying in this letter is that we as Republican members of the \nAppropriations Committee expect there to be a budget for the \nAppropriations Committee even though there was not one passed here, \nwith the top-line number being essentially the number in the Sessions-\nMcCaskill, what amounts to a freeze proposal--freezing at 2010 levels, \nessentially--and that we will test every committee appropriations bill \nthat comes forward on the basis of that number, and we hope our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, those on the Appropriations \nCommittee and those who are not on the Appropriations Committee, will \njoin us in this effort because it is a sincere effort and a reasonable \neffort since it was already voted on here with all of our side voting \nfor it and a majority of the Senate voting for it. It is a reasonable \nnumber to set forward as the goal.\n  Yes, it does mean a significant reduction. We have to be forthright \nabout this, and this is what we need to do, quite honestly. It does \nmean a significant reduction from what the President requested. It \nmeans a significant reduction from what the Senate Budget\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nCommittee passed in committee, which budget was never brought to the \nfloor of the Senate because they did not want to shine lights even on \nthat budget. There is no question it is a reduction and a fairly \nsignificant reduction from those numbers. But it is a reasonable number \nand it is an important number because it says we are willing to be \ndisciplined about our spending around here and that is what we are \ngoing to have to do. We are going to have to make these types of tough \nchoices. This is an effort by the Republican members of the \nAppropriations Committee to make clear that we are willing to make \nthose types of difficult choices.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New \nHampshire would accept a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I would accept a question from the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, who served as \nchairman of the Budget Committee of the Senate and is now its ranking \nmember--and there is no one in the Senate more familiar with the \nnumbers in the Senate budget--is it not true that this request by \nRepublican members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, since it \ncomes at a time when many Americans and most Senators believe the level \nof the Federal debt is at crisis levels and threatens the security of \nour country and since it comes at a time when the Congress has not \nproduced a budget and it comes at a time when there have been \nsubstantial increases over the last year and a half in the 38 percent \nof the budget that is discretionary spending, would the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, who has long served on the Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees, not agree that the first job of Senate appropriators is not \nto decide where to spend the money but to decide how much money there \nis to spend, especially this year when there is no budget?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Tennessee is absolutely right. \nHow can we run a country and a government of a country if we are not \nwilling to decide on how much we are going to spend and then stick to \nit? The reason we are so out of control around here in spending is \nbecause every week for the last 8 to 10 weeks we have seen a new bill \nbrought to the floor of the Senate which has added to the debt and the \ndeficit of this country.\n  Interestingly enough, 8 weeks ago we passed a bill on this floor, \nwith great fanfare from the other side of the aisle, called pay-go.\n  That bill said all the bills that came to the floor of the Senate \nwere going to be subject to a test, which essentially said that before \nyou spent any money, you paid for what you are spending.\n  Since we passed that bill, over $200 billion--billion--has been \nproposed or passed by the Senate which violated the very rule we \nallegedly passed to try to discipline the Senate. So it is very clear \nthat unless you set out some hard parameters, unless you set out some \nvery specific spending limits--and that is what the letter from the \nAppropriations Republicans does--you are not going to get any \ndiscipline around here. We will just bring bill after bill out of \ncommittee and we will spend money we do not have.\n  Where does it all go? Well, it all goes to our children as debt, and \nwe have to borrow it from the Chinese or we have to borrow it from \nsomebody else. Then we have to pay the interest on that. That interest \ndoes not do us any good as a nation.\n  In fact, under the President's own projections, his own budget, the \ninterest on the Federal debt will exceed any other item of spending in \nthe Federal budget on the discretionary side within 7 years. We will \nspend more on interest, because we are adding all of this deficit and \ndebt, than we spend on national defense. What a waste of money that is. \nSo unless we get some discipline around here on the spending side, this \ndeficit is going to grow, the debt is going to grow.\n  I saw a most interesting figure. I think the Senator from Tennessee \nhas seen it too. Since President Obama has been President, for every \nsecond since he has become President, $56,000 has been added to the \ndebt of the United States--$56,000. That is the mean income of \nAmericans today. So every second he has been in office he has wiped out \nthe income of some American who is working, because that income is all \ngoing to have to be spent to pay off that debt.\n  Granted, not all that debt was his fault. But interestingly enough, \nas we go further into his administration, a large amount of it is his \ndecisions and the decisions of this Congress, such as the $200 billion \nin debt that we have been adding or about to add that violates pay-go.\n  This week we are going to take up another supplemental bill. Does the \nSenator know how much deficit and debt that bill will add if it is \npassed in the form the administration and the Democratic leadership \nhave asked, just this week? I think it is somewhere in the vicinity of \n$20 billion to $30 billion of new deficit and debt.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask the Senator \nanother question. The Senator was talking about the increasing debt. Am \nI correct that it took the first 43 Presidents of the United States and \nthe Congresses they served with about 230 years to run up $5.8 trillion \nin debt, but President Obama's 10-year proposal, through 2018, would \nadd another $11.8 trillion?\n  In other words, am I right that the first 43 Presidents piled up $5.8 \ntrillion in debt, and this President's 10-year budget, through 2018, \nwould double that?\n  Mr. GREGG. Triple it. The Senator was off by 100 percent but close. \nIn the next 5 years, the President will double the national debt under \nthe deficits which he is projecting under his budget. And in the next \n10 years he will triple the national debt. As you say, if you take all \nof the Presidents from George Washington through George W. Bush, put \nall of the debt they have added on the books of the United States \nthrough all of those administrations, cumulatively, add every one \ntogether, President Obama will have added more debt than all of the \nprior Presidents added, the first 43 Presidents of this country, in the \nfirst 4\\1/2\\ years of his administration.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have one other question, if I may, \nfor the Senator from New Hampshire. I know we sometimes hear the \nAmerican people say, or commentators say: Well, why don't those \nSenators work across party lines and get a result?\n  My question to the Senator from New Hampshire, who has years of \nexperience on Appropriations and Budget, is, in the present \ncircumstances where we have a debt crisis, and where we have no budget, \nno budget for next year, and we will not have, would he not agree that \nat the beginning of the process, taking a number that has been voted on \nby a majority of the Senate and has widespread bipartisan support, is a \nconstructive bipartisan approach that ought to be able to gain the \nrespect of Democratic appropriators and Democratic Senators, and that \nwe could work together this year to essentially freeze discretionary \nspending as a first step toward reining in Federal spending?\n  In other words, sometimes we see amendments around here that are \ncalled message amendments, each side trying to score a point. Is this \nnot a proposal that deserves respect as a serious attempt to restrain \nthe debt and that should earn bipartisan support?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his point. That is \nabsolutely valid. This is a bipartisan proposal for all intents and \npurposes. It has been voted on. I think it got 57 votes once. I think \nthat was the most it got; maybe it got 58. There are only 41 \nRepublicans, so clearly it had a large number of Democratic votes from \nthe other side of the aisle, because the number is reasonable.\n  ``Freeze'' is a reasonable number on the nondefense discretionary \nside, at a time when we are running deficits that are over $1.4 \ntrillion. You have got to start somewhere. You know, all great journeys \nbegin with a step. So this is the place we should start, right here, by \nfreezing nondefense discretionary spending. We, as Republican \nappropriators, have said we are willing to do it. I certainly think the \nSenator from Tennessee is absolutely right; this is an attempt to reach \nacross the aisle and bring in a bipartisan coalition to accomplish \nthis, using a number which has already received significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Last month, the Judiciary Committee held 4 days of hearings on \nGeneral Kagan's nomination, including 2 very full days of testimony \nfrom the nominee herself.\n  I came away from the hearings deeply impressed with General Kagan's \nintellect, thoughtfulness, demeanor, and integrity. These \ncharacteristics, already plainly evident in her lifetime of \naccomplishment, were on full display during her testimony.\n  Last year, when Justice Souter announced his retirement, and again \nwhen Justice Stevens announced his retirement this April, I suggested \nthat the Court would benefit from a broader range of experience among \nits members.\n  My concern was not just the relative lack of women or racial or \nethnic minorities on our Federal courts, though that deficit remains \nglaring.\n  I was noting the fact that the current Justices all share very \nsimilar professional backgrounds. Every one of them served as a Federal \ncircuit court judge before being appointed to the Supreme Court.\n  Not one of them has ever run for political office, like Sandra Day \nO'Connor or Earl Warren or Hugo Black.\n  I am heartened by what this nominee would bring to the Court based on \nher experience working in and with all three branches of government, \nthe skills she developed running a complex institution like Harvard Law \nSchool, and yes, the prospect of her being the fourth woman to serve on \nour Nation's highest court.\n  Some pundits, and some Senators, have suggested her lack of judicial \nexperience is somehow a liability. I could not disagree more.\n  While prior judicial experience can be valuable, the Court should \nhave a broader range of perspectives than can be gleaned from the \nappellate bench.\n  In the history of the U.S. Supreme Court, more than one-third of the \nJustices have had no prior judicial experience before being nominated. \nAnd a nominee's lack of judicial experience has certainly been no \nbarrier to success.\n  When Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis in 1916, many objected \non the ground that he had never served on the bench.\n  Over his 23-year career, however, Justice Brandeis proved to be one \nof the Court's greatest members. His opinions exemplify judicial \nrestraint and his approach still resonates in our judicial thinking \nmore than 70 years after his retirement.\n  Felix Frankfurter, William Douglas, Robert Jackson, Byron White, \nLewis Powell, Harlan Fiske Stone, Earl Warren and William Rehnquist all \nbecame Justices without having previously been judges. They certainly \nall had distinguished careers on the Supreme Court.\n  As Justice Frankfurter wrote about judicial experience in 1957:\n\n       One is entitled to say without qualification that the \n     correlation between prior judicial experience and fitness for \n     the functions of the Supreme Court is zero.\n\n  We have all now had the opportunity to review General Kagan's \nextensive record as a lawyer, a policy adviser, and administrator, and \nto listen to her thoughtful and candid answers to a wide range of \nprobing questions.\n\n  Throughout her career, she has consistently demonstrated the all-too-\nrare combination of a first-rate intellect and an intensely pragmatic \napproach to identifying and solving problems.\n  Last summer, during then-Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearing, and \nagain during General Kagan's hearing, I focused on the current Court's \nhandling of business cases.\n  I am convinced, by education, experience, and inclination, that the \nintegrity of our capital markets, along with our democratic traditions, \nis what makes America great.\n  Today, however, while we have a real need for significant financial \nregulatory reform, we also face a Supreme Court too prone to disregard \ncongressional policy choices.\n  My concern is that a Court resistant to Federal Government \ninvolvement in and regulation of markets could undermine those efforts. \nI am not suggesting that we face a return to ``a New-Deal-era Court--a \nCourt determined to strike down regulatory reform as beyond the \nauthority of Congress.\n  But a Court predisposed against government regulation might chip away \nat the edges of reform, materially reducing its effectiveness.\n  That is why my questioning of Solicitor General Kagan focused on \nbusiness cases and on her philosophy concerning deference to \ncongressional judgment.\n  During the hearing, she emphasized the importance of ``judicial \ndeference to the legislative process.'' She also acknowledged \nCongress's ``broad authority'' under the commerce clause to regulate \nthe financial markets.\n  Finally, she stated emphatically her views on results-oriented \njudging. I really liked what she said on this point, so I'm going to \nquote it in full:\n\n       I think results-oriented judging is pretty much the worst \n     kind of judging there is. I mean the worst thing that you can \n     say about a judge is that he or she is results-oriented. It \n     suggests that a judge is kind of picking sides irrespective \n     of what the law requires, and that's the absolute antithesis \n     of what a judge should be doing, that the judge should be \n     trying to figure out as best she can what the law does \n     require, and not going in and saying, ``You know, I don't \n     really care about the law, you know, this side should win.'' \n     So to be a results-oriented judge is the worst kind of judge \n     you can be.\n\n  Based on General Kagan's ability to communicate her thoughts and \nideas during the committee hearings last month, I am confident that \nother Justices and, by extension, the entire Court, will benefit by the \naddition of her voice to their deliberations.\n  One of the aspirations of the American judicial system is that it \nrender justice equally to ordinary citizens and to the most powerful.\n  We need Justices on the Supreme Court who not only understand that \naspiration but also are committed to making it a reality. I believe \nElena Kagan, through her truly impressive record of accomplishment, and \nthrough the entire confirmation process, has demonstrated that \ncommitment.\n  In short, this nominee has all the qualities necessary to serve well \nall Americans, and the rule of law, on our Nation's highest court.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm her without delay.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor earlier \ntoday to speak about the nomination of Don Berwick to run the CMS and \ntalked a little bit this morning about the area in which he \nspecializes, which is how to lower the cost of the American health care \nsystem by improving the quality of care; that it is a win-win and to \ncall it rationing is incredibly misleading and raises a legitimate \nquestion about whose side somebody is on who wants to attack this kind \nof reform of the health care system.\n  I went back to my office and found an article in the Washington Post \ntoday, which is entitled ``Hospital infection deaths caused by \nignorance and neglect, survey finds.'' So if I could just read a few \npieces from it, then I will ask unanimous consent to have this article \nprinted in the Record.\n\n       An estimated 80,000 patients per year develop catheter-\n     related bloodstream infections, or CRBSIs. . . . About 30,000 \n     patients die as a result, according to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for nearly a third \n     of annual deaths from hospital-acquired infections in the \n     United States.\n\n  So 80,000 people get hospital-acquired infections in their blood from \nthe catheters that go into them when they are\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nin a hospital. Of those 80,000, 30,000 die, and that is about one-third \nof the annual deaths from all hospital-acquired infections, which means \nabout 90,000 Americans die every year from hospital-acquired \ninfections.\n  This article goes on to say those deaths are preventable. We have \nknown this for a long time. This article is confirming something that \nhas been studied for a long time.\n\n     . . . evidence suggests hospital workers could all but \n     eliminate [catheter-related bloodstream infections] by \n     following a five-step checklist that is stunningly basic: (1) \n     Wash hands with soap; (2) clean patient's skin with an \n     effective antiseptic; (3) put sterile drapes over the entire \n     patient; (4) wear a sterile mask, hat, gown and gloves; (5) \n     put a sterile dressing over the catheter site.\n\n  A lot of this came out of original work that was done in Michigan, \nthe so-called Keystone Project. We have taken that in Rhode Island and \nadapted it to try to reduce these hospital-acquired intensive care unit \ninfections. But this is preventable. The point is, when we prevent it, \nwe save money because those 80,000 patients per year developing \ncatheter-related bloodstream infections--as to the last information I \nsaw, I believe it costs about $60,000 to treat hospital-acquired \ninfections. So I cannot do the math in my head, but multiply $60,000 \ntimes 80,000 patients per year getting these catheter-related \nbloodstream infections and we get into very big money very quickly.\n  Don Berwick is the leader of the health care reform effort that tries \nto take exactly that kind of problem and solve it so this process, this \nstunningly basic process that can prevent these infections, actually \ngets implemented over and over and over, every time, so we can \neliminate these infections. When we eliminate them, we eliminate the \ncost of treating it; we eliminate the excess days that had to be spent \nin the hospital while the patient was treated for the infection; and, \nof course, most importantly, we eliminate 30,000 people dying from a \nhospital-acquired, catheter-related bloodstream infection every year.\n  What is not to like about that? That is the theory of health care \nreform that Don Berwick is the lead proponent of. So I came back to the \nfloor because this story is so clearly on point as to exactly the kind \nof reform he has been a proponent of--from his years on the Clinton \nConsumer Quality and Protection Commission--I do not have its exact \nname right now, but it was a Clinton-era quality reform initiative--\nfrom his leadership writing ``To Err Is Human,'' the initial report \nthat kicked off the health care quality reform movement, and the \nfollow-on report, ``Crossing the Quality Chasm.''\n  This is what this guy specializes in and this ability to go into the \nAmerican health care system and find these ways where, by improving the \nquality of care, we lower the cost. Again, whatever 80,000 patients is \ntimes--I may have the number wrong, but my recollection is about \n$60,000 per infection--we get into pretty big money in a pretty big \nhurry. It is preventible, and it is that kind of savings that is going \nto help turn the corner for American health care.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post article entitled \n``Hospital infection deaths caused by ignorance and neglect, survey \nfinds'' by N.C. Aizenman, dated Tuesday, July 13, 2010, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 13, 2010]\n\nHospital Infection Deaths Caused by Ignorance and Neglect, Survey Finds\n\n                           (By N.C. Aizenman)\n\n       Deadly yet easily preventable bloodstream infections \n     continue to plague American hospitals because facility \n     administrators fail to commit resources and attention to the \n     problem, according to a survey of medical professionals \n     released Monday.\n       An estimated 80,000 patients per year develop catheter-\n     related bloodstream infections, or CRBSIs--which can occur \n     when tubes that are inserted into a vein to monitor blood \n     flow or deliver medication and nutrients are improperly \n     prepared or left in longer than necessary. About 30,000 \n     patients die as a result, according to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for nearly a third \n     of annual deaths from hospital-acquired infections in the \n     United States.\n       Yet evidence suggests hospital workers could all but \n     eliminate CRBSIs by following a five-step checklist that is \n     stunningly basic: (1) Wash hands with soap; (2) clean \n     patient's skin with an effective antiseptic; (3) put sterile \n     drapes over the entire patient; (4) wear a sterile mask, hat, \n     gown and gloves; (5) put a sterile dressing over the catheter \n     site.\n       The approach also calls for clinicians to continually \n     reconsider whether the benefits of keeping the catheter in \n     for another day outweigh the risks and to use electronic \n     monitoring systems that allow them to spot infections quickly \n     and assemble a rapid response team to treat them.\n       A federally funded program implementing these measures in \n     intensive-care units in Michigan hospitals reduced the \n     incidence of CRBSIs by two-thirds, saving more than 1,500 \n     lives and $200 million in the first 18 months. Similar \n     initiatives across the country helped bring the overall \n     national rate of these and related bloodstream infections \n     down by 18 percent in the first six months of 2010, according \n     to the CDC.\n       ``Our research shows that the cost of implementing [such \n     programs] is about $3,000 per infection, while an infection \n     costs between $30,000 to $36,000,'' said Peter Pronovost, a \n     professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who \n     led the program. ``That means an average hospital saves $1 \n     million.''\n       So why aren't hospitals leaping to adopt these best \n     practices?\n       The survey released Monday, which was conducted by the \n     Association for Professionals in Infection Control and \n     Epidemiology and funded by Bard Access Systems, a maker of \n     catheters, pointed to ignorance and neglect at the top.\n       More than half of the 2,075 respondents, most of whom were \n     infection control nurses employed by hospitals, reported that \n     they use a cumbersome paper-based system for tracking \n     patients' conditions that makes it harder to spot infections \n     in real time. Seven in 10 said they are not given enough time \n     to train other hospital workers on proper procedures. Nearly \n     a third said enforcing best practice guidelines was their \n     greatest challenge, and one in five said administrators were \n     not willing to spend the necessary money to prevent CRBSIs.\n       Pronovost said part of the problem was that many hospital \n     chief executives aren't even aware of their institution's \n     bloodstream infection rates, let alone how easily they could \n     bring them down.\n       When hospital leaders decide to create a culture in which \n     preventing infections is a priority, he added, nurses feel \n     empowered to remind physicians to follow the checklist when \n     inserting catheters, physicians are provided antiseptic soaps \n     as part of their catheter kits and infection control \n     personnel have the best tools to monitor patients.\n       ``If anyone in that chain of accountability doesn't work, \n     you won't get your [infection] rates down,'' he said. ``But \n     it's the hospital's senior leadership that is ultimately \n     responsible.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just want to take a moment to ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record, at the conclusion of my remarks, \nan editorial dated today from the Arizona Republic. That is my hometown \nnewspaper in Phoenix, AZ.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The editorial is entitled ``End run denies public a debate \non health care.'' The point of the editorial is that while we had a \nvery long debate over the so-called health care legislation--I think \nthe name of the act was the Patient Protection and Affordable Health \nCare Act--we never had the kind of debate that would have edified the \nAmerican public on the general question of a government-run health care \nsystem versus one that was more amenable to the doctor-patient \nrelationship and the privacy that Republicans were suggesting was a \nbetter way to go.\n  What the editorial says is that the President's recess appointment of \nDr. Berwick obviated the kind of debate that could have occurred had he \ngone through the regular nomination process and had a hearing at which \nhis views could be elicited, and we could have then debated whether he, \nwith his views, was the right person to head the CMS, which is the \nentity that will be running the program.\n  The editorial concludes with these comments, after noting that even \nDemocratic leaders in the Senate were perplexed by the recess \nappointment, noting Senate Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus, \nsaying he was ``troubled'' by the move. The editorial concludes:\n\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\n\n       Considering how dubious the public remains about Obamacare, \n     there is every reason to believe the Republicans really did \n     want an exchange with the candid, erudite Berwick. The recess \n     appointment strongly suggests the White House simply did not \n     want to have another fight over the contentious health care \n     issue.\n       Political parties can be devious. History is littered with \n     appointments delayed to death out of little more than spite.\n       This wasn't one of those appointments. Dr. Berwick will \n     head a federal agency that spends $800 billion a year. The \n     public deserves to know what he thinks.\n\n  The point is, we would have had an opportunity to know what Dr. \nBerwick thinks and for the American people to express themselves on \nthat issue through their representatives in the Senate had we gone \nthrough the regular nomination process. But because the President \ndecided to short-circuit that while we were off and back home on our \nJuly 4th recess, and made the recess appointment, we will never have \nthat opportunity. As the editorial notes, that is lamentable. It denies \nthe public an opportunity they would have had to understand better what \nhis point of view was and perhaps to have a debate about the general \nunderlying nature of the health care bill that was passed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, July 13, 2010]\n\n             End Run Denies Public a Debate on Health Care\n\n       Crazy as it sounds, we did not have a real ``debate'' over \n     health care lo those many months prior to the passage of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March.\n       Basically, the warring factions had an 18-month fight over \n     interpretations.\n       President Barack Obama and Democrats interpreted the new \n     law as one that would, affirmatively, lower costs, preserve \n     existing options, extend coverage near-universally and \n     improve care overall.\n       On defense against the interpretations of mostly Republican \n     critics, they argued the plan did not constitute socialized \n     medicine, was not a Washington power grab, would not explode \n     costs, would not create ``death panels,'' would not reduce \n     insurance options, would not foist new burdens on the states, \n     and wouldn't increase federal deficit spending.\n       It was a debate over the meaning of a constantly evolving \n     bill, not one of competing philosophies.\n       But a debate over the efficacy of a centralized, govemment-\n     led health-care system vs. a decentralized, mostly private \n     system? Rarely was the epic struggle ever that \n     straightforward.\n       Senate hearings on the appointment of Obama's nominee to \n     head the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald \n     Berwick, would have been a great opportunity to hear those \n     debates, at long last.\n       Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen. The president \n     short-circuited those hearings by using his power to make \n     appointments during congressional recesses. According to a \n     White House spokesman, the president anticipated Republican \n     obstructionism, and so performed the end run. That \n     explanation is debatable. There was no discernable \n     ``impasse'' on the Berwick appointment.\n       Republicans claim they greatly anticipated the Berwick \n     hearings, given the Harvard-educated pediatrician's candid \n     commentary over the years about his enthusiasm for a single-\n     payer health-care system similar to that of Great Britain. \n     Likewise, Democratic leaders in the Senate also were \n     perplexed at the recess appointment. Senate Finance Committee \n     Chairman Max Baucus of Montana said he was ``troubled'' by \n     the move.\n       Considering how dubious the public remains about Obamacare, \n     there is every reason to believe the Republicans really did \n     want an exchange with the candid, erudite Berwick.

Madam President, it is, I believe, day 42 since 41 \nMembers of the Senate have blocked us through filibuster, through \nobstructionism, through threat of tying up the Senate and shutting it \ndown basically so that we have not been able to extend unemployment \nbenefits to workers in Charlotte, in Ashville, NC, and Columbus and \nCleveland, OH. It is unconscionable. It is unfair to those workers who \nhave worked for 20 years and lost their jobs through no doing of their \nown. It is bad economics.\n  Presidential candidate McCain's economic adviser, Mark Zandi, during \nthe Presidential campaign said every dollar of unemployment benefits \ngenerates $1.60 in economic growth. He examined various kinds of \nexpenditures--everything from tax cuts to a whole bunch of other \ngovernment programs--and what would stimulate the economy best, from \nroad construction to small business tax breaks, all the kinds of things \nthat we could do for job growth.\n  He said--this is Republican John McCain who voted against \nunemployment extension--his economic adviser in the Presidential race \nsaid the best stimulus for the economy is unemployment benefits because \nevery dollar that goes into the pocket of an unemployed worker in Lima, \nGallipolis, Steubenville, or Miamisburg, OH, generates $1.60 in \neconomic activity. That means they spend that dollar quickly because \nthey need that money to pay their rent, to pay for utilities, to buy \ngroceries, to go to the drugstore--to do all the things that are \nnecessities of life that are obviously so important.\n  As the Akron Beacon Journal analyzed, Summit County emergency cash \nassistance cases rose 27 percent from May 2009 to May 2010. Food stamp \ncases climbed 22 percent over the same period.\n  It is an economic equation, to be sure, that extending unemployment \nbenefits is the best thing for our economy. It is also a human \nequation, for all the problems people face in our country of not being \nable to simply provide for their families.\n  We can talk about the statistics; 90,000 Ohioans have seen their \nunemployment benefits expire. Forty-one Members of this body--40 of \nthem Republicans--have said no to extending these benefits. We know \nthese numbers. We see them all the time. We are blinded sometimes by \nall the statistics.\n  I would like to, as I do many days, put a human face on this issue \nand share what people in my State write to me telling me what these \nunemployment benefits mean to them.\n  Lisa from Cuyahoga County, the Cleveland area:\n\n       Please do not strand us here on the sea of uncertainty and \n     washed up on the shore of ruin. That statement may be \n     dramatic, but that is how it feels out here.\n       In my case, if I was guaranteed a 40 hour a week job \n     working at a fast food restaurant, I would take it in a \n     heartbeat.\n       I am currently taking care of my elderly mother college age \n     daughter on $213 a week after taxes. Do you know how far that \n     goes? I have to pay rent, electric bills, and put food on the \n     table. I am a single mother. How am I supposed to live?\n       I sit in a bedroom away from my mother and daughter and cry \n     because I feel I have failed by family and we are headed for \n     ruin. We already lost the family home due to unscrupulous \n     lenders. Now I am one rent check away from being homeless.\n       Please, I am begging you to be my voice and the voice of \n     the unemployed in Washington.\n\n  Again, these are people who want to work. Some of my colleagues, some \nof the 41 who vote no consistently--we have tried week after week to \nbring this legislation to a vote--seem to think unemployment is \nwelfare. It is not welfare. Many of the letters I get are from people \nwho worked in the same job 20 and 30 years and lost that job and are \ntrying to find work, as they are required to under the law. If you draw \nunemployment benefits, you are required to continue to look for work. \nYou send out resumes, make visits to the plant, the office, or \nrestaurant to try to get a job.\n  Every one of these workers paid in. This is not welfare; this is \ninsurance. Every one of these workers paid into the unemployment \ninsurance fund, and now when they are unemployed, they are deserving of \ncollecting on their insurance, if you will.\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\n  Rebecca from Lorain County--that is the county in which I live in \nwest Cleveland--works for Catholic Charities helping the unemployed:\n\n       My job is trying to find resources for the people in need. \n     Every day I am deluged with requests for rental and mortgage \n     assistance by many who have exhausted their unemployment \n     benefits and have not been able to find other employment.\n       One gentleman in particular is an unemployed steelworker of \n     over 25 years who is raising a 2-year-old son by himself. His \n     home is about to be foreclosed on and his employment benefits \n     have run out. What else can he do? What can I do to assist \n     him?\n\n  I look across the aisle when we are all in this Chamber and I think: \n41 people voted against the extension of unemployment benefits. I think \nall of us are a bit too isolated in this job. We are paid well. We get \na lot of attention. We all have good staffs, fairly large staffs of 40, \n50, 60 people both in Washington and our States, in Columbus, \nCleveland, Cincinnati, and Lorain. I don't know that we talk with \nenough people who have been in a situation that she writes about the \nsteelworker--25 years and raising a 2-year-old son by himself.\n  Lisa from Cuyahoga County is taking care of her elderly mother and \ncollege-age daughter and already lost her home. I know empathy is in \nshort supply in this world and particularly in the Senate. I wish each \nof us would read these letters and sit down and talk with somebody such \nas Lisa who first lost her job. Then she lost her health care. Then she \nhas to explain to her daughter: Honey, we are not going to be able to \nstay in this house much longer because we cannot afford the rent--or \ngot foreclosed.\n  Mom, where are we going to live?\n  I don't know yet.\n  Am I going to be able to go to the same grade school I go to now?\n  I don't know yet, honey, if that is going to happen.\n  How are we going to move? How are we going to move our stuff?\n  I don't know. We have to figure that out.\n  These are questions people such as us do not have to answer very \noften, are not faced with. If my 41 colleagues would sit down and \nlisten to people who deal with these problems, who experience these \nproblems, it might be a different situation.\n  The last letter I will read is from Marjorie from Summit County. That \nis in the Akron area:\n\n       I have been unemployed since January. My husband lost his \n     job shortly before that. We are both college graduates. My \n     husband has a master's degree.\n       Since we are both 61 years of age, employers are not hiring \n     us because we are not the right fit for the position because \n     we are either overqualified and/or too old.\n       Our house is on the market because we are reaching a point \n     where we will be unable to make mortgage payments.\n       We have always done the right thing raising our children \n     and being responsible citizens. But now we can't even keep a \n     roof over our heads.\n       Something is not right when people make generalizations--as \n     they are doing now--about people like us who want to work, \n     who want to take care of themselves, and who are tired of \n     being shunned because we are ``one of those people.''\n       We do not like the deficit growth, but we paid our taxes, \n     and we did not create this recession.\n       Please share our story with those who are in a position to, \n     at least, help us with something.\n\n  I don't know Marjorie, but I received this letter from her. I know \nfrom every indication that she and her husband have worked their whole \nlives. They are highly educated. Both have college degrees. One has a \nmaster's degree. They are not people who are unmotivated. They have \nlived in this house a long time. They do not want to sell their house, \nbut they do not have much choice.\n  Why can't 60 of us, with these sometimes dysfunctional Senate rules, \nwith just one person from the other side of the aisle, one Republican, \njoin in voting, or a couple of them come over here and vote for this \nextension so we can get the 60 votes we need? They are only going to \nget $300 a week in unemployment benefits. Most of these people have \npaid into these funds for 10, 20, 30 years, never collecting anything. \nBut they are only going to get $300 a week.\n  They are not going to be rich. It is not so much money that they will \nthink: I don't want to bother going to work. I don't want to keep \nlooking for a job. They have to keep looking for a job.\n  It is the right thing to do morally. It is the right thing to do \nbecause of the values we hold dear in this country. It is the right \nthing to do for economic reasons. As Senator McCain's chief economic \nadviser in his Presidential race said: Nothing stimulates the economy \nmore than putting this money into the community in Ravenna or Mansfield \nor Warren or Findlay and getting this generation of economic activity \nwhich will help to create more jobs and help to get us out of this \nrecession.\n  I implore again my colleagues to support the extension of \nunemployment benefits.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  For the past 2 years, this country has been held in the grip of an \nunprecedented economic crisis. The housing market collapsed, the bottom \ndropped out of Wall Street, and for the first time in generations many \nAmericans felt their hard-earned economic security begin to slip away.\n  Here in Washington, Members of the House and Senate were faced with a \nharsh reality: For decades, regulators and policymakers alike had \nfallen short of their responsibilities. A divisive political process \ndrove them to duck the tough issues and kick the can down the road time \nand time again.\n  This failure of regulation and the absence of political will allowed \nWall Street fat cats to let their greed get the better of them. They \ngambled with our economic future. They designed complicated financial \nproducts and placed high-stake bets against them. In short, they built \na house of cards, and when it finally came crashing down, the American \neconomy lay in ruins.\n  There can be no quick fixes after a disaster of this magnitude. But \nunder President Obama's leadership, our elected leaders finally took \nthe bull by the horns and did what was necessary to stop the bleeding \nand set our country back on the road to recovery. I was proud to join \nmany of my colleagues in supporting the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act--a landmark stimulus bill that helped reverse the \nrising tide of economic misfortune. Thanks to this legislation, we have \nmade some significant progress, though we still have a very long way to \ngo. But this is an election year, and that means partisan bickering is \nin the air and it is on the rise. So I believe my colleagues and I have \na decision to make: We can focus on winning the next news cycle--\npitting Republicans against Democrats, and falling into the same tired \npolitical battles that usually consume election years in Washington--or \nwe can reach for something better. We can tune out the partisan fights, \nreject the failed policies that got us into this mess, and prove to the \nAmerican people that we have the will to make tough decisions.\n  Our recovery is far from complete. I believe if we fail to continue \nthe bold policies that pulled us back from the brink of disaster, if we \nshrink away from difficult decisions that will move this recovery \nforward, then we place our economy at grave risk of slipping back into \na recession. This is a time for bold action, not pointless ideological \nbattles. This is a time to move forward, not backward.\n  I call upon my colleagues to seize this opportunity. Let us keep \nAmerica on the road to recovery, and restore the hard-earned security \nof ordinary folks who have suffered because of bad decisions on Wall \nStreet. It won't be easy, but it is our responsibility, and it is the \nright thing to do.\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\n  We should start by increasing our support for small businesses, \nespecially those disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. These \ncompanies foster progress and innovation. They have the power to create \njobs and direct investment to local communities, where it can have the \ngreatest impact. Small businesses form the backbone of our economy, but \nin many ways they have suffered the most as a result of this economic \ncrisis.\n  That is why I have filed an amendment that will improve and expand \nthe Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program. This measure would \nincrease the continued eligibility amount from the current $750,000 net \nworth to $2.5 million so more small businesses could benefit from this \nassistance.\n  It is no secret that minority-owned businesses, particularly those in \npoor or urban areas, have been hit hardest by the current economic \ndownturn. That is why these are the areas we should target for our \nstrongest support. By expanding the existing 8(a) program, we can \nincrease its economic impact without having to reinvent the wheel. We \ncan rely on a proven initiative to inject new life into disadvantaged \nareas.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment when it comes up for a \nvote, as well as the underlying Small Business Lending Act as a whole, \nwhich we will be debating shortly on the floor. I ask them to reject \nthe tired politics that got us into this mess and embrace the spirit of \nbipartisanship that can lead us out.\n  On behalf of small and minority-owned businesses, I call upon this \nbody to take action in that regard. Our economic future may be \nuncertain, but with my proposal, the Small Business Lending Act, we \nhave the rare opportunity to influence that future. So let's pass these \nmeasures to guarantee some degree of relief for the people who continue \nto suffer the most. Let's renew our investment in America's small \nbusinesses and rely on them to drive our economic recovery. Let's do it \nnow. We need no more rhetoric, no more politics. Let's move forward and \nhelp small businesses in general, minority- and women-owned businesses \nin particular.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, we are working here on the \nfloor of the Senate to encourage a strong economic recovery, but it \nstill remains clear that too many Americans are unable to find work. We \nknow small businesses are the real job engines in our economy, so I am \nparticularly pleased that the Senate is right now debating a small \nbusiness lending bill.\n  I rise today because I would like to further improve the bill through \nan amendment that would take a simple step to safely increase lending \nto small businesses. We do that mainly by getting government out of the \nway so that credit unions can increase their small business loan \nportfolios.\n  Today, in every single State of the United States, there are credit \nunions that have cash on their balance sheets, and they are ready to \nrespond with loans for more money. There are many worthy small \nbusinesses in communities across our country, in Colorado and Illinois, \nthat need the loans, but Federal law currently prohibits Federal credit \nunions from fully helping our entrepreneurs. Especially in this \neconomy, we need to change that. We know small business expansion is \nwhat is going to pull us out of this recession.\n  Small businesses have always been the job engine of our economy. In \nthe last 15 years, small businesses have generated nearly two-thirds of \nall new jobs created in our country, and they currently employ more \nthan half of all Americans.\n  I traveled across Colorado this year and last year, as you have in \nyour State, Mr. President. I constantly visited with scores of small \nbusiness owners, and they continually ask me: Where is the lending? I \nthought the banks were supposed to start lending again.\n  I heard this. I think every Senator in the Chamber has heard this. \nBut despite remaining profitable, small businesses have been unable to \nsecure the loans they need to make investments in inventory, expand, \nand ultimately hire new workers. That is why I am introducing this \namendment to allow credit unions to ramp up their small business \nlending without costing taxpayers a single dime.\n  Back in December of last year, I was joined by Senators Snowe, \nSchumer, Lieberman, Boxer, Collins, Bennet of Colorado, our Majority \nLeader Reid of Nevada, Specter, Bill Nelson, Sanders, and Gillibrand in \nintroducing the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act.\n  The bill would have increased lending for small business by lifting \nthe arbitrary cap on credit union small business loans. Why is that a \nproblem and why is that a cause of concern? Right now credit unions are \nrequired to limit small business lending to 12.25 percent of their \ntotal assets. But many credit unions have run up against that cap and \nthe only thing keeping them from jump-starting their local economies is \nan outmoded law I acknowledged.\n  After introducing our bill last year, we heard from scores of banks \nthat were concerned about the safety and soundness of allowing credit \nunions to increase their small business loan portfolios. I realize that \ndealing with banking credit unions can be like injecting yourself \nbetween the Hatfields and the McCoys, but I feel so strongly about \nhelping small businesses and unlocking the credit markets that I am \nwilling to take some lumps in the process.\n  I have gone back to the banks, listened to their concerns, and we \nwent to the drawing board. I spoke to the Senate Banking Committee, \nTreasury Department, and even the credit unions' own regulator, the \nNational Credit Union Administration, to see if there was something we \ncould all agree on.\n  That work has paid off, which is why I am proud to introduce a new \ncompromise that will safely and soundly increase small business lending \nby credit unions without costing Americans a dime. Best of all, this \nlegislation could lead to large-scale job creation in my home State of \nColorado and all around our great country.\n  If the Members would indulge me, I wish to explain what is in the \ncompromise. In response to questions about the safety and soundness of \nallowing credit unions to expand their small business lending all at \nonce, our new proposal institutes strict eligibility criteria. Under \nthis amendment, the credit union must first be well capitalized. \nSecond, they must have offered small business loans for at least the \nlast 5 years; third, proof they have sound underwriting and strong \nhistorical management practices; and, fourth, it must show they have \nbeen running up against their previous loan cap. Credit unions that \nmeet all of those strict criteria then go to the NCUA, their regulator, \nand apply to increase their small business lending. Then when they are \napproved, that cap would increase slowly from the current 12.25 percent \nto a maximum of 27.5 percent, and even that transition would be \noverseen by regulators to ensure it is done in a measured and prudent \nfashion.\n  Nobody can argue that this is irresponsible. I would challenge \nanybody to tell me this is not a sound and sure-fire way to grow our \neconomy by increasing credit unions' capacity to lend to small \nbusinesses. The Credit Union National Association estimates that these \nsensible reforms would increase small business lending by over $10 \nbillion a year, including--and let me talk about Colorado--an increase \nof $200 million in my home State of Colorado.\n  This new access to credit is also predicted conservatively to produce \nmore than 100,000 new jobs nationwide. I think everybody would agree \nthis is the sort of pro-business, pro-jobs policy we need.\n  The small business community, led by the National Small Business \nAssociation, the National Association of Realtors, and even chambers of \ncommerce such as those in Texas have even gotten behind our effort and \nare now asking the Congress to pass this important provision.\n  We all know what shape our economy is in today. Small businesses \ncontinue to struggle to access credit, as large\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nbanks have significantly cut back on Main Street lending.\n  Mr. President, you been here the last 18 months and you have noted, I \nknow, that the 22 banks that received the most funding through the \nTroubled Assets Relief Program, TARP, actually have cut their \ncollective small business loan balance, and then America's community \nbanks which, by and large, did not receive any Federal bailout funds, \nare still struggling to fill that Main Street credit vacuum that was \ncreated by these large financial institutions.\n  We need to do better. Small businesses are counting on us all across \nour country. I mentioned earlier we have all met business owners. One \nColoradan I was particularly compelled by is Stacy Hamon. Stacy is a \nsmall business owner in Thornton, CO, who started her own business, the \n1st Street Salon. Initially she went to a bank only to be turned away \nbecause credit was in short supply, not because of any problem with her \ncredit history. So Stacy turned to make her dream come true to her \nlocal credit union, and that credit union granted her a loan through a \nsecond mortgage on her home. Since that time her salon has become even \nmore successful. I visited her business. I was impressed. She hired \nmore workers. She created real American jobs. Her story is a shining \nexample of the economic expansion that awaits us if we will increase \nthe amount of lending that credit unions can undertake.\n  Another Coloradan, because this is about real people who are eager to \nbuild their business, is Lisa Herman. She e-mailed me a story about a \nloan she secured from a credit union to expand her business, called \nHappy Cakes Bakeshop. It is in the Highland Square area of Denver. She \nhas been in business since 2007. Despite a tough economy, her revenue \nhas been up by about 25 percent since the summer of 2008. She has \nbooked over 20 weddings a month, and her retail operation has expanded \nto the point that she needed to build and move into a new shop.\n  Her traditional bank lender could not expand her credit, but her \nlocal credit union could. She went on and expanded her business. This \nmeant more jobs and more business for her community. That is the \nAmerican way, is it not?\n  As I begin to close, some would have you believe that this is about \nbanks or credit unions. I mentioned the Hatfields and the McCoys \nearlier. But it is about small business; not about the banks, not about \nthe credit unions, it is about small business.\n  In this kind of a climate, we cannot turn away entrepreneurs such as \nStacy and Lisa. I doubt there is a single Member of this Senate who \nwants to look a small business owner in the eye who could not get a \nloan because of an arbitrary government cap on small business lending. \nWe all have an enormous responsibility to do all we can to unlock \ncredit markets for small businesses in Colorado and across our country.\n  This amendment is an important part of that effort. I look forward to \nworking with all 98 of my colleagues to move this amendment, to add it \nto this important small business lending package and allow our Nation's \nsmall businesses to again set our country on a path toward job growth \nand future prosperity.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5773-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5773-S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              UNEMPLOYMENT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have on a \nnumber of occasions, to urge colleagues to extend unemployment benefits \nfor now well over 1 million people who have lost their benefits because \nof the stalling, the filibustering, unfortunately, by colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I am very appreciative of the fact that we have two Republican \ncolleagues joining with us to stop a filibuster, but as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, that is not enough. We need one more Member to come \nforward to join us, not to get a majority to pass unemployment \nbenefits--we have a majority--but we do not have a supermajority. That \nhas now been required on every single issue that has come before the \nSenate in order to try to get things done for the American people.\n  When I was home last week--of course I jump on a plane every Friday \nand come back on Monday; I view this as a long distance commute to \nwork--I heard over and over concerns from families who have been \nemployed all their life, had good middle-class lifestyles, have had the \nability to take care of their families, have had not only the ability \nto have a home but maybe a cottage or a mobile home to be able to enjoy \nbeautiful northern Michigan and the Great Lakes in the summertime, and \nfolks who have felt confident they could send their kids to college, \nwho literally had the rug pulled out from under them through no fault \nof their own.\n\n  We can go through all that brought us to this point: a decade of \npolicies under the previous administration that created huge deficits, \npolicies that did not work, making sure that those doing very well in \nthis country received tax cuts, but middle-class families were left out \nthere on their own; not enforcing trade laws so that more and more of \nour jobs were being shipped overseas.\n  That needs to change. And, in fact, it is changing. Despite what this \nPresident inherited, what we inherited 18 months ago when President \nObama came into office, 750,000 jobs a month being lost, we have begun \nto turn that around. We are now gaining jobs every month rather than \nlosing jobs. But we know there is so much more to do.\n  While we are doing that, while we are focused on creating jobs, \npartnering with small businesses and manufacturers to create jobs, we \nhave millions of people, over 15 million people, who have been caught \nin this economic tsunami, through no fault of their own. They are \nsimply asking that something called unemployment insurance--and, by the \nway, it is insurance. You pay into it when you are working, you receive \nassistance when you are not, But they are asking that we do what every \nother Congress has done, Democratic President, Republican President. \nAnytime we have seen unemployment numbers such as we are seeing today, \nthe Congress of the United States has understood and stepped up to \nextend unemployment benefits--except now. In the midst of every other \ninitiative being stalled, the folks on the other side of the aisle who \nhave been dubbed the party of no have, in fact, been saying no to \neverything, including no to families who are in situations now where it \nis literally about whether they will have a home, whether they can pay \ntheir bills and put food on the table, whether they can go to school--\nas we have all said, we will go back to school and get retraining. \nPeople are doing that.\n  But they are taking that small amount, that $250 or $300 a week, that \nis the difference between their being able to stay in school with a \nroof over their head or having to drop out and not be able to start a \nnew career.\n  I wish to share a few letters of thousands of letters I have \nreceived. I am sure the Presiding Officer receives them as well. But \nthey represent people who are asking us to stop the politics for 5 \nminutes and understand what is happening to people in this country, and \nstep up and do the right thing.\n  Kim from Bellmont, MI, wrote me:\n\n       Thank you for trying your best to extend unemployment \n     benefits. My husband worked 24 years in a factory and then he \n     was laid off. I have a hair salon I run from my home. We were \n     a happy middle-class family. But now life has been turned \n     upside down, to put it mildly. I now work three jobs. Two are \n     very low paying. I never see my kids or my husband. So darn \n     tired. But I knew with the help of unemployment and my \n     husband applying for a job, and his going to back to school, \n     we could sustain ourselves until something came along.\n       Only 6 months have gone by. Now along with his job loss, we \n     will lose our home, which means my business also. I do know \n     you have tried. Please keep trying.\n\n  I will. But what needs to happen is, we need to find at least one \nmore Member who will join with us to get beyond this roadblock of a \nfilibuster so that Kim doesn't have to lose her home. She can keep her \nbusiness she runs out of her home, her hair salon, and keep things \ngoing while her husband goes back to school so he can get another job.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  Judith from Taylor wrote me:\n\n       We did not do anything to have this horrible circumstance \n     come our way. Both my husband and I appreciate the work you \n     are doing but please don't give up on us. This week we \n     received notice that our mortgage bank has started \n     foreclosure proceedings on our home. The frustrating thing \n     about this is, we have been trying to sell our house since \n     February of 2009. We have had buyers who were interested [but \n     the] bank stopped proceedings saying they wanted more money \n     out of us. We have been waiting since April for the bank's \n     decision on the present purchase agreement. And the only \n     thing we have gotten from this bank is a letter of \n     foreclosure proceedings this week. Not like we didn't have \n     enough to contend with, our youngest son left from Ft. \n     Campbell, KY to the war in Afghanistan on June 9th. This is a \n     very scary and emotional time for our family. We are \n     definitely on overload but we are just one family of millions \n     who are experiencing how life has changed in this world. We \n     have strong faith in the Lord and a strong belief that life \n     will get better. I love this country but grow weary as to the \n     direction the country is heading. Politics should not play \n     games with the American people's lives.\n\n  That is what is happening right now. I should mention that one of the \nleaders in the Republican caucus has indicated that when it comes to \nextending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we should not worry \nabout the debt. We should not worry about paying for those. But when it \ncomes to helping people who are out of work, then the rules ought to be \ndifferent. When it comes to helping people out of work, then we should \nchange the rules that have been in place calling it emergency spending \nand require something different. If 15 million people out of work isn't \nan emergency, I don't know.\n  Dawn from Hudsonville writes:\n\n       I listen daily to the radio and I have heard the lack of \n     progress regarding unemployment. I am blessed to have a \n     loving and generous family so my son and I won't be homeless \n     but there will be significant upheaval. My son will graduate \n     from high school next year (if I'm not forced to move) . . . \n     I have done everything I can think of to continue living \n     here; cut expenses to the bone, free lunches for my son, \n     visits to the food pantry--so many things I never thought I \n     would have to do. I realize the scarcity of jobs, my age (51) \n     is a definite factor, but I honestly never imagined the depth \n     of this recession.\n\n  Melvin from Auburn Hills:\n\n       I urge you to please encourage your peers to reconsider \n     their vote. Personally, I am 41 years old, had a job since I \n     was 16, and have never collected unemployment until 2009. \n     During the past 16 months, I returned to school and I am \n     about to take another course. I have taken any opportunity \n     possible to work which has included three jobs that were low \n     paying, part time, or short term, and I don't know what I \n     will do if these extensions stop. I have already moved to \n     Michigan to live with family because I couldn't afford rent \n     in Illinois anymore. However, I will be forced to live under \n     an overpass if I can't even contribute to household expenses \n     during this difficult time in my life. It saddens me that a \n     hardworking person like myself is lumped into a category of \n     ``losers and mooches'' by the attitude of some elected \n     officials, when my lifetime of hard work without ever \n     receiving any unemployment (or any other government \n     assistance) should clearly identify me as a victim of what is \n     the worst economic time in my entire adult life. I want to \n     work and return to a job, and that is why I am doing \n     additional schooling to make myself stand out to potential \n     employers. In the meantime, please help folks like me sustain \n     our modest existence. Please encourage another vote in the \n     Senate to extend unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n  I thank Melvin for working hard and for hanging in there. That is \nwhat we do in Michigan, we work hard. If we are knocked down, we get \nback up, and we go back to work. The people whose letters I have shared \nthis evening are people who are working one or two or three part-time \njobs trying to hold it together. But mom and dad may have both lost \ntheir jobs. They are trying to hold it together for their families. As \nMelvin said:\n\n       I don't like being lumped into a category of ``losers and \n     mooches'' by the attitude of some elected officials.\n\n  People in Michigan are not losers. They are not mooches. They are \npeople who have been caught in the middle of an economic tsunami. They \ndidn't cause it. They weren't the ones who were reckless on Wall Street \nwho caused us to lose jobs and lose credit availability and home \nmortgages and pensions and 401(k)s. They were not the ones who made the \ndecisions that got us to this point. It is critically important they \nnot continue to pay the price.\n  I see our distinguished leader on the Senate floor. I thank him for \nhis passion and commitment for people who have lost their jobs and his \ncommitment as soon as possible to bring this up for a vote one more \ntime. But it is very sad that we have had to get to this point where \nover 1 million people have already been hurt losing their unemployment \nbenefits and others are just holding their breath about what is going \nto happen. We are committed to continuing to do everything we can until \nwe can get this done--extending unemployment benefits and remaining \nlaser focused on jobs for the American people. We will continue to do \nthat.\n  But it would be very nice if somehow one more person from the other \nside of the aisle would step up tonight or tomorrow and we could end \nwhat has been a nightmare for millions of Americans wondering what is \ngoing to happen to themselves and their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, because the hour is late and \nwe will have a longer time to engage in a debate about the conference \nreport, I wish to begin this evening, as I will try to repeat during \nthe next 2 days, with my deep appreciation to the majority leader, \nHarry Reid. While there were a lot of people involved in this process \nover the last several years who have brought us to this moment for us \nto consider this very important landmark piece of legislation regarding \nreform of our financial services, none of this ever happens unless you \nhave a leader who makes it possible to happen.\n  While that is a simple enough sentence to say, there is so much that\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\ngoes into that sentence--the organization, bringing people together, \nseeing to it that the time is available, making sure the procedures \nthat we will work under allow us to have a full-throated debate, as we \nwere able to on this bill.\n  This bill went through almost a month of consideration on the Senate \nfloor. We considered almost 60 different amendments offered by both \nparties, many of which were adopted to change the bill, added value to \nit. It then proceeded to a conference with the other body in which we \nspent another 2 weeks, well into the all-night session until June 25 in \nwhich another 60 or 70 amendments were considered, and then came back \nto this Chamber where we are now in the position of adopting the \nconference report. None of that happens without having leadership in a \nbody that makes it possible for those events to unfold.\n  While there will be a lot of talk over the coming days about how this \nhappened and what is in the bill, it is important that as we begin the \nconversation over the next several days, before we vote whether to \naccept this conference report, that I begin by expressing my gratitude \nto the majority leader and his staff and others who made it possible \nfor us to arrive at this historic moment as to whether we will change \nthe status quo and set up a regulatory structure that makes it possible \nfor us to address future economic crises, as certain as they will \noccur, with the ability to deal with them early on, to avoid them \nbecoming larger problems as this one did because we failed to have the \nregulatory process in place, we failed to have the kind of oversight, \nwe failed to have the kind of protections for consumers that this bill \ndrafts and provides for.\n  I thank the majority leader for his leadership. While he was not \ndirectly involved day to day, there wasn't a single occasion when I \ncould not pick up that phone or walk into his office, cite a problem I \nhad on how to get from point A to point B in which he didn't stop \neverything he was doing to make sure we could work our way through \nthose difficulties. A lot goes on unseen on how we operate in this \nChamber. But, again, when this bill is adopted, as I hope it will be, \nthere are many people who deserve gratitude and expressions of thanks. \nWe ought to begin by thanking the majority leader for making it \npossible. To him and to his staff and others, I say thank you. I look \nforward over the next 2 days to the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and I have an opportunity, which we will, to sit down and \ntalk about what we have been through the last 2 years. We had a \ndifficult situation with the banks, financial institutions going \nbankrupt, going to close, and we worked our way through that. We had \ncredit card legislation that was so very difficult. We had the housing \nlegislation that was so extremely difficult. And, of course, we have \nhad this.\n\n  This piece of legislation is really a masterpiece. To think that we \nhave been able to get as for as we have--for example, in today's \nnewspaper, it did not go unnoticed by me that Secretary Paulson said \nsome extremely nice things about this piece of legislation. He did not \nhave to do that. He did it because he thought it was the right thing to \ndo. Here is a man who came to Washington inexperienced in government in \nany way and was given this plate of a really bad situation that \ndeveloped. So we have the present Secretary of Treasury and the past \nSecretary of Treasury saying this is an extremely fine piece of \nlegislation, which it is.\n  I have been around not as long as my friend from Connecticut in the \nCongress of the United States, but I have been around a long time and \nthis really, I repeat, is a masterpiece. I think it is appropriate to \nacknowledge the work he has done in this legislation. He was saying \nnice things about me--I appreciate that--but that is really not very \nmeaningful for someone who was watching him work his way through this \nlegislation.\n  The vote is not complete yet, and we hope it will all turn out well. \nBut there are a number of people who have been very courageous in \nallowing us to move forward. We will talk more about them later. They \nare three or four in number and we will talk about them later. But my \nfriend and I have developed a forever friendship based on the crisis we \nhave gone through together, and I so admire him. There will be another \ntime for talking about his more complete service, but I can say this \nwithout any hesitation or reservation, I will so miss this man who has \ndone such a remarkably good job for the State of Connecticut and our \ncountry in his long service. He has been an exemplary Senator to me, \nand I am so fortunate I have gotten to know him as well as I have.\n\n\n                    Small Business Lending Fund Act\n\n  Mr. President, we have been on the small business jobs bill trying to \nwork our way through, and there are a lot of issues we could work our \nway through, but my friends on the other side of the aisle made a \ndecision today--maybe not tomorrow but today--to not let us move \nforward. I had a conversation with the Republican leader an hour or so \nago and he said he wants to do some legislating on the bill tomorrow. I \nhope that, in fact, is the case because we are ready to do that.\n  This small business jobs bill is extremely important. It is a \nbipartisan bill and I hope we can get it completed. Having said that, I \nsadly report there will be no votes tonight.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Regulatory Capture\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the majority leader indicated today \nthat he would be preparing legislation on energy to deal with a number \nof different issues, among them the response we should make to the \nterrible spill, geyser of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico and all \nthe damage that has ensued in the gulf States as a result.\n  I come to the floor this evening to say a few words about a problem I \nbelieve we need to address in the context of this catastrophe. That \nproblem is the problem of regulatory capture of the captive regulator. \nAlthough it comes up in the context of the failure of the Minerals \nManagement Service to do its job to see that the private sector \ndeepwater drilling in the gulf was done properly, it is a problem that \nis not limited just to the geyser of oil gushing into the Gulf of \nMexico and the failure of MMS to have taken adequate steps to prevent \nit. It occurs in other areas as well.\n  One that leaps to mind is the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nso-called securities watchdog which was sound asleep at the switch as \nthe economy careened towards the huge financial meltdown with \nrepercussions we are still seeing today.\n  The Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, was just talking about the \ncatastrophes in her State and the pain that the lack of unemployment \ninsurance is creating. That goes back to the original Wall Street \nmeltdown, and that launched a tsunami of misery across the country that \nwe are still dealing with today.\n  So if you take a look at those two catastrophes--the giant financial \nmeltdown catastrophe, the consequences of which we are still living, \nthat families in Rhode Island, families in Illinois, families in \nMichigan are still dealing with; and the disaster in the gulf that has \ncreated a catastrophe throughout Louisiana, Alabama, Florida--they have \na common theme. The common theme is this issue of regulatory capture.\n  My hometown paper editorialized pretty trenchantly about the gulf \nproblem. They said:\n\n       The Deepwater Horizon accident has made it painfully clear \n     that, in its current form, MMS is a pathetic public guardian. \n     Neither it nor BP was prepared for a disaster of this \n     magnitude, and MMS' cozy relationship with industry is a big \n     reason why.\n\n  The issue of regulatory capture has been written about for a long \ntime. In 1913, Woodrow Wilson wrote:\n\n       If the government is to tell big business men how to run \n     their business, then don't you see that big business men have \n     to get closer to the government even than they are now? Don't \n     you see that they must capture the government, in order not \n     to be restrained too much by it?\n\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n\n  `` . . . they must capture the government, in order not to be \nrestrained too much by it.''\n  The first dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, Marver Bernstein, wrote, \n55 years ago, that regulators tend over time to ``become more concerned \nwith the general health of the industry'' and that they try ``to \nprevent changes which will adversely affect'' the industry. He said, it \n``is a problem of ethics and morality as well as administrative \nmethod.'' He called it ``a blow to democratic government and \nresponsible political institutions.'' And ultimately he said it leads \nto what he called ``surrender.'' He said, ``The commission finally \nbecomes a captive of the regulated groups.''\n  Even recently, the Wall Street Journal editorial page contained an \narticle by a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, saying:\n\n       By all accounts, MMS operated as a rubber stamp for BP. It \n     is a striking example of regulatory capture: Agencies tasked \n     with protecting the public interest come to identify with the \n     regulated industry and protect its interests against that of \n     the public. The result: Government fails to protect the \n     public.\n\n  So from Woodrow Wilson, in 1913, through Marver Bernstein, 55 years \nago, to the Wall Street Journal editorial page just this month, the \nidentification of the problem at MMS with the doctrine of regulatory \ncapture I think is clear.\n  So the question is, What are we going to do about that? It has been a \nrecurring problem, and the difficulty is that for the regulatory \nagency, they are constantly engaged with the regulated industry. The \nindustry is there all the time. The industry is pushing on them all the \ntime. The industry is on the other side of the revolving door of jobs, \noften. The industry has lawyers and lobbyists working the agency. The \nindustry threatens lawsuits if it gets regulations it does not like, \nand is accommodating and friendly when it gets regulations it does \nlike. In some cases, such as MMS, the relationship gets completely \ntoxic and you get social events with industry representatives, \nincluding illegal drug use and sex. You get staff failing to collect \nmillions of dollars in royalties owed to the American people. You get \nsenior executives steering contracts to an outside company created by \nthose executives. You get district managers telling investigators: Hey, \nobviously we are all oil industry. You get employees accepting gifts \nfrom the companies regulated by MMS, trips to the Peach Bowl on a \nprivate airplane, skeet shooting contests, hunting and fishing trips, \ngolf tournaments.\n  You get an MMS inspector inspecting the oil drilling platforms of a \ncompany that he has a job application in with. While they are \nconsidering whether to hire him, he is inspecting their oil drilling \nrigs. I guess it comes as no surprise that in those oil rig inspections \nhe found no violations. But that is an environment in which the \nregulatory agency has yielded to this long recognized problem of \nregulatory capture. So I think it is time we did something about it.\n  It is a doctrine that has been known for many years, and clearly both \nat the Securities and Exchange Commission and at MMS it has been \nrealized, and it has been realized in ways that are extraordinarily \npainful and damaging for America. It has been realized in ways that are \ntruly catastrophic--in one case, for our economy, in another case, for \nthe environment of the gulf area.\n  What I have proposed is that we authorize the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, at the direction of the President or upon the invitation \nof a Cabinet official who senses a concern about that agency, to make a \ndetermination whether that agency is still truly independent of the \nindustry it is supposed to regulate. If the President or the Cabinet \nofficial deemed that component no longer credibly independent of the \ncorporation or the industry it is supposed to regulate, then the \nAttorney General is allowed to step in and clean up.\n  It is as simple as that. They would be charged to hire and fire and \ntake personnel actions; to ensure the integrity of the personnel within \nthe component; to establish interim regulations and procedures; to \nensure the integrity of a process in the component of government. They \nwould be charged to audit the permits and the contracts and ensure that \nthe component of government has signed off on them legitimately, and if \nit appears that the permits or contracts have been affected by improper \ncorporate influence, to recall them and renegotiate them so that they \nare done fairly and squarely and not a friendly negotiation in which \nboth sides of the negotiation are, in effect, working for the industry \nand no one is representing the public interest. They would be charged \nto establish an integrity plan for that component and then to clear out \nonce his or her job is done.\n  We have known about regulatory capture now for a century. We have \nseen it in action throughout that period. We have had two of the most \ncatastrophic examples of regulatory capture happen just now on our \nwatch, and in all this time we have never really come up with a \nmechanism for addressing it, because the pressure on these regulatory \nagencies is systemic, because it is constant and persistent, because it \nis done quietly. The industry doesn't come in and say: We are taking \nover. News flash to the world: This isn't going to be an independent \nagency any longer.\n  No. Quietly, as quietly as they can, they slip their tentacles deeper \nand deeper and deeper into the agency until they quietly control it--\nsurreptitiously, stealthily, but they own it--and the interest that \nagency wants to serve is now the corporate interest and not the public \ninterest.\n  So if we are going to face up to a problem that is that persistent, \nthat constant, which has been recognized for a century and has recently \nyielded the two biggest disasters, economic and environmental, this \ncountry has recently seen, we have to create a persistent \ncounterpressure. I think the threat of the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, our top law enforcement officer, coming in and cleaning \nhouse is that kind of persistent counterpressure we need.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as we discuss the different provisions we \nare going to bring to bear that are going to be our lessons learned \nfrom the gulf catastrophe, that we not overlook what is probably the \nbiggest lesson of all: the lesson we have known for a long time about \nthe problem of regulatory capture and the incidence of regulatory \ncapture in these particular cases bearing such painful, damaging fruit, \nsuch bitter harvest for the American people.\n  I will continue to push. If colleagues have ideas they think would \nimprove it, I would be delighted to discuss those ideas. I think we \nwill have failed in our duty to the public if we do not take away from \nthe financial disaster caused by the deliberately blind eye of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the catastrophe caused by the \ncomplete co-opt of MMS--if we don't take away from those the lesson \nthat this can't be tolerated anymore.\n  Regulatory capture is no longer a theory; it has been proven to be a \ndisastrous practice in at least those two agencies, and we don't know \nhow many more agencies are in a similar position. The disaster may not \nyet have happened, but they may be just as captive. When you think of \nthe billions and billions of dollars of taxpayer value in Federal land, \nin timber leases, in mining leases within the continental United \nStates, in contrast with giant corporations; when you think of that \nhuge pile of public wealth from which the giant corporations feed, it \nis hard to imagine they are not working just as hard to co-opt the \nregulators who protect that wealth as they work to successfully co-opt \nthe regulators who are supposed to be watching the Wall Street \nfinanciers and who are supposed to be watching big oil as it drilled in \nthe gulf.\n  So let's not overlook this lesson. I am willing to consider a lot of \nideas that will help get us there. I put this out because it is the \nbest one I have come up with yet, and I look forward to working with \nfolks. It is too important that we don't go away from this having \nfailed in our duty to protect the American public from the next \ndisaster.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my dear friend Marca \nBristo and recognize her work as a disability rights activist and the \ncommunity-based disability agency, Access Living, that she founded 30 \nyears ago in my home State of Illinois.\n  Access Living opened its doors in 1980 to ensure that people with \ndisabilities had equal rights.\n  Three decades ago, people with disabilities faced a world of \ndependency. Even though Congress had enacted important legislation such \nas the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prevent discrimination and the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 to expand learning \nopportunities for those with disabilities, people with disabilities \nstill lacked equal rights. Social prejudice fueled discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities in housing, employment and basic \npublic accommodations. The concepts of independent living, wheelchair \naccessible public transportation and quality jobs were not yet part of \neveryday life.\n  Access Living was founded to insist on independent living options and \nhigher quality of life for people with disabilities. The agency is \ngoverned and staffed by people with disabilities and operates under a \nfundamental belief that people with disabilities must become a \npolitical force if they are to effect social change. Marca Bristo, \nAccess Living's president and CEO, knows that pride and commitment to \nsocial change is the most effective way to ensure that civil rights are \nenforced.\n  This passion stems from a personal experience. A diving accident at \nthe Pratt Boulevard Beach pier left Marca partially paralyzed in 1977. \nThrough this tragedy, she re-imagined her capabilities to work and \nthrive from a wheelchair. However, the adjustment was not always easy, \nbecause cultural and even physical barriers stood in her way.\n  Early in Marca's disability, the city of Chicago lacked curb cuts on \npublic streets, which made it hard for her to travel up and down city \nblocks in her wheelchair. This restriction prevented Marca from \naccomplishing basic errands such as a trip to the grocery store or a \npick-up from the dry cleaners and from using public transportation to \ncommute to work.\n  Marca and Access Living's vision of equality led to architectural and \nattitudinal changes in the city of Chicago and throughout the country. \nYears of litigation led the Chicago Transit Authority to add wheelchair \nlifts to their mainline buses. The city has also incorporated scrolling \nmarquees, audible street announcements and thousands of curb cuts to \nmake transportation feasible for people with disabilities.\n  Beyond these physical changes, Marca has also worked tirelessly to \nbreak down cultural barriers and integrate people with disabilities \ninto community life. Access Living's work fosters dignity, pride, and \nself-esteem in people with disabilities. With that in place, they can \nchoose individualized, satisfying lives.\n  It turns out, I am not the only person who has been impressed by \nMarca's leadership and vision for change. She was appointed by \nPresident Clinton to chair the Nation Council on Disability. She was \nhere, fully engaged in the fight, when Congress wrote the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990. She has also served as president of the \nNational Council on Independent Living and is currently president of \nthe U.S. International Council on Disabilities--USICD.\n  But the ADA means only as much as its implementation. We have work to \ndo eliminating discrimination in employment, public services and public \naccommodations in the United States. As the ADA turns 20 in this month, \nwe recognize the law's and Access Living's work to increase the \nvisibility of people with disabilities in our country.\n  We as a Nation should also look to be global leaders in this arena. \nThrough her work with USICD, I am confident that Marca will continue to \nfocus the energy, expertise and resources of the U.S. Government and \ndisability community to improve the lives of people with disabilities \nworldwide.\n  Fair and equal treatment is a cornerstone of our society and \npolitical system. Access Living and Marca Bristo's dedication to ending \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities have improved the lives \nof families in Chicago and nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5777-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY HONOR FLIGHT MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize 35 Kentucky \nveterans who recently came to Washington, DC to visit the memorial they \nhelped to inspire. A few weeks ago, this group of distinguished men and \nwomen were able to visit our Nation's Capital, some for the first time, \nbecause of the Honor Flight Program.\n  The Bluegrass Honor Flight chapter has brought over 600 veterans from \nKentucky to Washington, DC, providing these brave patriots the \nopportunity to see firsthand the memorial built in their honor. The \nprogram provides transportation, lodging and food for these veterans, \nwho otherwise may not have been able to visit the Capital or the \nmonuments they inspired.\n  These brave individuals answered the call to duty by stepping up when \ntheir Nation needed them most. The sacrifices they made were \nextraordinary. With unyielding commitment to our great Nation, these \nmen and women bravely served and defended the freedom and rights that \nwe cherish. The courage shown by America's veterans will be long \nappreciated and never forgotten. And after their years of service, I am \nproud to be able to honor them today.\n  I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring these Kentucky \nveterans:\n  Dewey Abrams, Charles Adams, Geneva Andress, Algernon Rowland, Jim \nBooher, Ralph Brewer, George Capito, Paul Chandler, Donald Cooper, \nRoland Davis, Miram Dewart, Cecil Dunn, Charles Wilson, Harris \nGibboney, George Hauck, Joe Hutchins, Gerald Kincaid, Robert Koegel, \nAnne Laing, John Fultz, William Malcolm, Edward Martin, Cecil McGee, \nFrank Milburn, Howell Moore, Kenneth Oster, Obie Owens, Reverend Thomas \nPittman, John Krabbenhoft, Dewitt Rowland, Elmer Susemichel, Donald \nThom, Roger Tyler, William Warde and Richard Zapp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5777-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5777-S5778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE URSULINE SISTERS OF LOUISVILLE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the work of the Ursuline Sisters of Louisville, which will \nsoon receive a special recognition from the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nfor their decades of service.\n  The Ursuline Sisters began their ministry in Kentucky in 1858 when \nthree Sisters from Germany, led by Mother Salesia Reitmeier, answered a \ncall to teach at St. Martin School in Louisville. Within 2 weeks of \ntheir arrival, the Sisters were teaching 50 students and had plans to \nconstruct a convent and boarding school on the corner of Chestnut and \nShelby streets in Louisville, KY. The building was completed in 1859 \nand became the home of the Ursuline Academy. The new boarding school \nfor girls offered classes from elementary through high school.\n  Soon the Ursuline Sisters were asked to operate and staff other \nschools. They established Sacred Heart Academy in 1877. Within 100 \nyears of their establishment in Kentucky, the Ursuline Sisters had \nstaffed or were staffing 23 parochial schools in the Louisville area, \nas well as schools in other States. They owned and operated Ursuline \nCollege, Ursuline Academy, Sacred Heart Academy, Sacred Heart Model \nSchool and the Ursuline Speech Clinic. The original Motherhouse and \nConvent for the Ursuline Sisters is located near the original school in \ndowntown Louisville that was established by those three German \nimmigrants 152 years ago and is listed in the National Park Service's \nNational Register of Historic Places.\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\n  These Sisters serve as educators, spiritual ministers, health care \nprofessionals, and administrators. They operate programs for the poor \nand disenfranchised and continue to search for ways to assist others to \ngrow personally and spiritually.\n  On July 25, 2010, the Ursuline Sisters' history of ministry and \nservice will be recognized by the Commonwealth of Kentucky with the \nplacement of a historical marker outside that original location on \nChestnut Street. This marker will note the founding and mission of the \nUrsuline Sisters and inform people of the contributions these Sisters \nhave made to the community.\n  While the true record of their good deeds will continue to be \nchronicled in a place not of this Earth, it is entirely appropriate for \nthe Commonwealth to take note of the good work the Ursuline Sisters \nhave done for my hometown. And I hope my colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating the Ursuline Sisters for all their hard work of \nministering to mind, body and spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5778-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5778-S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today to express \nmy profound and heartfelt sadness on the passing of Senator Robert C. \nByrd, as the U.S. Senate, the people of West Virginia, and our entire \nNation mourn the loss of a giant of public service--a distinguished, \niconic legislator whose life and legacy will forever be synonymous with \nthe greatest deliberative body the world has ever known.\n  Senator Byrd's counsel, wisdom, and knowledge of the Senate was \nunmatched and awe-inspiring. As the longest-serving Member of Congress \nand a former majority and minority leader of the Senate, Senator Byrd \nwas time and again the conscience and champion of Congress and a \nvigorous and stalwart sentinel of the first branch of our government. \nProtector, steward, advocate, and guardian these descriptions only \nbegin to convey Senator Byrd's lifelong commitment to the Senate in \nwhich he served for a record 51 years and an unprecedented nine terms.\n  No one fought more to ensure the preservation of the U.S. Senate and \nits constitutional prerogatives than Senator Byrd. No one was more \nmasterful in comprehending and harnessing the powers of parliamentary \nprocedure in the upper Chamber. No one was fiercer in battling against \nany encroachments that would dilute or diminish the role of Congress as \na coequal branch of government. And no one possessed greater command of \nSenate history and used it to better effect than Senator Byrd, who \nhimself authored a four-volume history of the Senate.\n  The same zeal with which Senator Byrd demonstrated his allegiance to \nthe legislative branch was every bit as evident in his unshakable \ndedication to the U.S. Constitution itself--a pocket-sized copy of \nwhich he carried at all times. In fact, like many of my colleagues, I \nwill never forget as a member of the ``Gang of 14,'' which was forged \nat a time when the very institution of the Senate was caught in the \ncrosshairs of a struggle over judicial nominations, how each of us \nreceived a copy of the Constitution from Senator Byrd. With one \nsymbolic gesture as only he could, Senator Byrd spoke volumes about the \nhistoric imperative that was ours to seize if we were to jettison the \npartisanship that threatened our Chamber.\n  Senator Byrd's reverence for history stemmed of course from the \npremium he placed on education, and as much as anyone who ever occupied \na seat in the Senate, Senator Byrd exemplified the American story of \nthe self-made individual. During his remarkable trajectory from humble \nbeginnings in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, Senator Byrd \nwas an ardent believer in learning not only as the great equalizer in \nAmerican life, but as a catalyst for personal and professional success. \nA self-educated man, Senator Byrd's knowledge of Shakespeare, the Holy \nBible, and the pillars of thought from Ancient Greece and Rome formed \nthe basis of an eloquence and service that will reverberate not only in \nthe hallowed Halls of Congress, but also throughout his beloved home \nState--which he served so passionately--for generations to come.\n  Indeed, his roots in West Virginia were ever-present and the \nindispensable lifeblood that spurred him to political and legislative \nheights that were the capstone of his landmark tenure in public \nservice. Indisputably, he never forgot where he came from, and in fact, \nalways remembered he stood on the shoulders of every West Virginian who \nsent him back to the U.S. Senate term after term. And as much as \nSenator Byrd revered Congress, the Constitution, and his fellow West \nVirginians, nowhere was his devotion greater than with his beloved \nErma, his wife of nearly 69 years, and they now are finally together in \ntheir eternal resting place.\n  As a Senator from Maine, it is only fitting that I pay tribute to \nSenator Byrd by citing the opening lines by the immortal American poet \nand Son of Maine, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, that I so often heard him \nquote from memory on the Senate floor . . . ``Thou, too, sail on, O \nShip of State!/ Sail on, O Union, strong and great!/Humanity with all \nits fears, /With all the hopes of future years . . .'' Our Ship of \nState sails better for Senator Byrd's having lived, served, and led. \nBut today, our Ship of State sails at a slower pace as we pause to pay \nour respects and mourn the loss of a man whose like we will never see \nagain. The Senate will not be the same without the Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert C. Byrd.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend and dear colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, who left us on \nMonday, June 28, 2010 at the age of 92. Senator Byrd was the longest \nserving member of the Senate. It is noteworthy that he was sworn in as \na U.S. Senator on January 3, 1959, the same day Alaska was admitted as \nthe 49th State.\n  How does one do justice to a life as full, as human, as authentic, as \nuniquely American as that of Senator Byrd's in just a few minutes? Born \nin poverty, a self-described foster son of an impoverished coal miner, \na product of a two-room schoolhouse, he went on to walk with kings, to \nmeet with prime ministers, and to debate with Presidents. Only in \nAmerica could one come so far from so little. His is a textbook case of \nAmerican exceptionalism.\n  Robert C. Byrd was a man of principle who was unwavering in his \npriorities. The Lord came first, his family second, and then the \nbusiness of West Virginia and Nation. Senator Byrd was remarkable in \nthat he could juggle all of these obligations with apparent ease.\n  He was a man who carried the Constitution in his breast pocket, \nclosest to his heart. A fierce protector of the prerogatives of the \nSenate, he frequently recalled that the Congress is mentioned in the \nConstitution before the Executive. He once remarked, ``I am not the \nPresident's man. I am a Senate man.''\n  So many of our colleagues take delight in this quote from The Almanac \nof American Politics and it bears repeating. The Almanac described \nSenator Byrd as the one among us who ``may come closest to the kind of \nsenator the Founding Fathers had in mind than any other.''\n  On the occasion of his 90th birthday, Senator Ted Stevens referred to \nSenator Byrd as a ``symbol of the Senate,'' adding that, ``No man has \ntaught the Senate more than Robert C. Byrd.''\n  Senator Byrd made it his personal responsibility to educate new \nSenators in the history and traditions of the Senate and to mentor us \nalong. He made a real difference in my orientation to the Senate. His \nstatesmanship was an inspiration to me. It was an inspiration to all of \nus.\n  As contentious as our debates may seem, as partisan as we often seem \nto the American public, the Senate prefers to regard itself as a \nfamily. Yes, a family that fights, but a family nonetheless.\n  Senator Stevens once observed, ``As part of the Senate family, \nSenator Byrd is not only a gentleman, he has been a person who has \nreached out to us in personal times as well.''\n  I came to know that well after I injured my leg in a skiing accident \nlast year. For a period of time I had to navigate the Senate floor in a \nwheelchair. The Senate floor is not exactly wheelchair friendly, but \nSenator Byrd had adapted to the challenge. One day, as we were going to \nthe floor to vote, our wheelchairs met and we reached\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nout to hold hands as we wheeled our chairs to the well of the Senate.\n  Like Ted, I loved Robert C. Byrd. Yet I regret that I never had the \nopportunity to enjoy the close friendship that my colleague Ted Stevens \ndid.\n  Yes, they had their spats, but Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd \nregarded each other as family. Senator Stevens' daughter Lily referred \nto Senator Byrd as an uncle. Senator Byrd published in the \nCongressional Record excerpts from Lily's senior thesis from Stanford, \n``The Message of the Dome: The United States Capitol in the Popular \nMedia.''\n  Senator Stevens began working with Senator Byrd in 1968. In 1972, \nthey joined each other on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Both \nserved as President pro tempore of the Senate, a position reserved for \nthe most senior Member of the Senate in the majority party. Yet as \nSenator Byrd liked to note, Ted was a relative youngster.\n  Working together on a bipartisan basis, Ted Stevens helped Robert \nByrd lift West Virginia out of poverty. And Senator Byrd demonstrated \ngreat empathy for Senator Stevens' crusade to end the third-world \nconditions that plague Alaska's Native people in the more than more \nthan 230 traditional villages of rural Alaska. Like the West Virginia \nof Robert Byrd's childhood, rural Alaska lacked the sorts of \ninfrastructure that the rest of America takes for granted--lack of road \ninfrastructure, a lack of basic sanitation facilities, unreliable \nelectricity, and unemployment.\n  This may explain why Senator Byrd was greatly sympathetic to Senator \nStevens' crusade to bring indoor plumbing to rural Alaska, to eliminate \nthe honeybucket. Alaska's Denali Commission was modeled closely after \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, which Senator Byrd championed for \ndecades.\n  Ted Stevens and Robert Byrd worked together to make things better for \nthe people of rural Alaska. Our Native people deeply appreciate the \nAlaska legacy of Robert C. Byrd.\n  On the occasion of Senator Stevens' farewell from the Senate in 2008, \na tearful Robert C. Byrd came to the Senate floor and said this \n``Politics is a rough business, with lots of highs and lots of lows. \nAfter a long time in politics, I come to understand that the point of \nit all is helping people. Thank God we will be judged in the next world \nby the good we do in this world.''\n  On Monday, our dear friend, Senator Byrd, joined his beloved wife \nErma in Heaven, where he will be judged by all of the good he has done \nfor his Lord, his family, the people of West Virginia, and the Nation. \nI will miss him greatly.\n  On behalf of Alaska's people, I extend my condolences to Senator \nByrd's daughters Mona and Marjorie, his five grandchildren and seven \ngreat-grandchildren, to the people of West Virginia, and to all who \nknew and loved this great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5779-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5779-S5781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Wood\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Private \nFirst Class Edwin C. Wood of Omaha, NE.\n  Private First Class Wood was an ``All-American kid,'' who dreamed of \none day serving his country. That opportunity came in October 2009 when \nhe enlisted in the U.S. Army and became a cavalry scout for the 1st \nSquadron, 71st Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 10th \nMountain Division, based in Fort Drum, NY.\n  A graduate of Omaha North High School, Private First Class Wood, \nbetter known as Eddie or Freckles, spent his time growing up as a \nmember of the Boy Scouts and Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps a \nmilitary re-enactor and a junior counselor at YMCA Camp Pokamoke in \nCrescent, IA. He was a role model to all who knew him.\n  Private First Class Wood had just gotten back to Afghanistan, after \nbeing home on leave in June, when the truck he was driving on July 5, \n2010, was hit by an improvised explosive device. The explosion took \nthis brave young man's life, along with that of another soldier, SSG \nChristopher F. Cabacoy.\n  Although he was only in the service for a short time, Private First \nClass Wood's awards and decorations include the Army Good Conduct \nMedal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, and Combat Action Badge.\n  PFC Edwin C. Wood served his country honorably and made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his fellow Americans. His courageous choice to protect \nhis country and help the people of Afghanistan achieve peace and \nsecurity represents all that we can be proud of in our armed forces. I \nknow I join all Nebraskans in grieving the loss of Private Wood; he \nwill be remembered for the selfless hero he was. Private First Class \nWood's family and friends remain in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                          Corporal Todd Nicely\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Marine Cpl Todd \nNicely, of Arnold, MO--a true American hero.\n  Corporal Nicely is greatly admired by his fellow marines--and when \nyou hear his story you will admire him too.\n  As a marine, Corporal Nicely brought the fight to the terrorists in \nAfghanistan, so our families in Missouri and across the Nation could \nlive in peace and security.\n  But what makes Corporal Nicely an American hero is not only his \nleadership on the battlefield but also his leadership here at home.\n  On March 26, 2010, Corporal Nicely and his fellow marines were on a \nfoot patrol in Helmand province--one of the most dangerous regions in \nAfghanistan--when he stepped on an improvised explosive device, \ntriggering a devastating explosion. When Corporal Nicely woke up, he \nrealized that all four of his limbs were lost in the blast.\n  Instead of defeat, however, Corporal Nicely faced his injuries with \nthe same warrior spirit he showed on the battlefield. This brave marine \nhas astounded many with his swift progress--evidence of his unwavering \nspirit and courage\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\namong overwhelming odds. Corporal Nicely remains one of the few \nsurviving quadruple amputees from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  At Bethesda Naval Hospital and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, \nCorporal Nicely has endured--and surpassed--these odds with the love \nand support of his lovely wife Crystal, who also served her country as \na marine. His story, courage and unwavering service make me proud to be \nan American.

McGarrah\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor SPC Clayton D. McGarrah, \n20, of Harrison, who died July 4, 2010, in Arghandab, Afghanistan, in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom. According to initial reports, \nSpecialist McGarrah died of injuries sustained when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol, followed by \nsmall arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire.\n  As Arkansans and Americans gathered together to celebrate our \nfreedom, SPC Clayton D. McGarrah made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf \nof our Nation. My heart goes out to his family for their loss. Along \nwith all Arkansans, I am grateful for Specialist McGarrah's service and \nfor the service and sacrifice of all of our military servicemembers and \ntheir families. I am committed to ensuring they have the full support \nthey need and deserve. Our grateful Nation will not forget them when \ntheir military service is complete.\n  Specialist McGarrah was assigned to C Company, 2nd Battalion, 508th \nParachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC. \nHis wife and parents reside in Harrison.\n  More than 11,000 Arkansans on Active Duty and more than 10,000 \nArkansas Reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September \n11, 2001. These men and women have shown tremendous courage and \nperseverance through the most difficult of times.As neighbors, as \nArkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent upon us to do everything \nwe can to honor their service and to provide for them and their \nfamilies, not only when they are in harm's way but also when they \nreturn home. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5781-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Over 100 flags are \ndisplayed on holidays to commemorate veterans and individuals from the \narea.\n  Named after Viborg, Denmark, this South Dakota town has maintained \nits ties to its Danish past. Following the notable feature of their \nDanish counterpart, the people of Viborg built Our Savior's Lutheran \nChurch on the town's highest point in 1911. When a post office and \nstore were first established in this area, it was known as Daneville. \nWith the coming of the railroad, Viborg was constructed half a mile \naway, and Daneville slowly ceased. Regardless of the town name, the \nDanish traditions remained in the area.\n  Originally, Danish Days were celebrated to coincide with Denmark's \nIndependence Day on June 5 but has now been moved to the third weekend \nin July. This year's events are July 16 to 18. It will include a \npresentation by Joy Ibsen on her new book of stories from Viborg, a \nparade, a golf tournament, an all-school reunion, and plenty of food. \nThere will also be the 17th annual Leadership Luncheon, which starts \nthe festival. The luncheon honors accomplishments in Viborg. Since \n2003, this has included the Friends of Viborg Award. This year, the \nhonor goes to the Viborg Public School's past and current teachers, \nadministrators, employees, and board members to recognize their notable \ncontributions to the community.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of Big Stone City. This picturesque town has made it 125 \nyears, and I am proud to represent them.\n  Big Stone City is bordered by Big Stone Lake in South Dakota and the \nState of Minnesota. Originally the site of an Indian village called \nInkpa, the first settlers arrived in 1871. In 1875, this new town, then \ncalled Inkpa City, was chosen for a post office. Another small town, \nGeneva, was also formed during that time, located to the northeast of \nInkpa City. In 1885, the two\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\ntowns were consolidated and Big Stone City was incorporated.\n  Religion was an integral part of the founding of Big Stone City. The \nfirst sermon was preached in 1879, before the town had even been \nincorporated. The German Evangelical Church was built in 1880, with at \nleast three additional churches following in the next 3 years. The \nfirst mass in the territory was celebrated in Big Stone City. The first \nschool was opened in 1880, with a charge of $1 per student for each \nmonth. In 1900, the school was upgraded from a small prairie school to \na much larger brick building. In 1913, plans were made to run the \nMilwaukee Railroad through Big Stone City. With industries of brick \nmanufacturing, limestone, food canning, and a creamery, Big Stone City \nhas a unique and varied past.\n  Residents of Big Stone City joined together July 9 to 11, 2010, to \nhonor their historic milestone with a weekend full of festivities. The \ntown celebrated with dances, a chili cookoff, an all-school reunion, a \nparade, and more. I am proud to recognize Big Stone City on this \nachievement, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for \nthis great South Dakota community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5782-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DUPREE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Dupree, SD, one of many communities on \nthe Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. This hearty town is the county \nseat of Ziebach County and has withstood recent tornadoes to come out \nstronger.\n  Named after a young Canadian fur trader named Fred Dupris, the \nspelling changed to conform to the people's preference. With two train \nstations, Dupree became a popular area to homestead. Dupree's vision \nstatement nicely sums up the town. ``Dupree is the front door to the \nWest. It has a rich heritage; is full of wide open spaces, and home for \nfamily and friends--the kind of place people want to hang their hat.'' \nSmall towns like Dupree are the backbone of South Dakota, embodying the \nvalues our State hold dear.\n  Dupree will celebrate with a 3 day wagon and trail ride, a parade, a \npowwow, a demolition derby, and more. They are also selling tickets to \na raffle for a Limited Edition Dupree Centennial Rifle. A rodeo will \nconclude the weekend celebration. I would like to recognize Dupree on \nthis historic milestone, and I wish its citizens the best on their \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5782-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY HIRSCHBERG AND JOAQUIN BLAYA\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, today, I wish to express my \nappreciation to two members of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, \nwhose terms have come to an end. During their 8 years of exceptional \nservice on the BBG, Jeff Hirschberg and Joaquin Blaya have contributed \nto ensuring the relevance and timeliness of international broadcasting. \nBoth Jeff and Joaquin have served the nation's international \nbroadcasting mission with great honor and commitment. Their unique \ncontributions have resulted in a robust enhancement of U.S. \ninternational broadcasting in critical regions at crucial times.\n  Jeffrey Hirschberg, who served on the board since 2002, brought his \ndeep experience in government and the private sector to bear during his \ntenure on the board. Previously, he served in the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral's Office as special counsel and assistant U.S. attorney, and \nlater, as an attorney in private practice. While on the BBG, he applied \nhis vast knowledge and understanding of the Soviet Union and Russia he \nacquired during his tenure as Director of the U.S.-Russian Investment \nFund, a member of the U.S.-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, and \nDirector of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, to greatly improve \nprogramming in Russia and former Soviet states.\n  Joaquin Blaya, who also joined the board in 2002, brought to the BBG \nhis vast experience in broadcasting as former chairman of Radio Unica, \nas CEO of Telemundo, and as president of Univision. In fact, Joaquin \nfounded Radio Unica and oversaw its operations as it became the first \n24-hour Spanish language radio network, reaching approximately 80 \npercent of the Spanish-speaking population in the United States. His \nvision and conviction as a member of the BBG resulted in improved \nprogramming on Radio Marti, and a ground-breaking television \nprogramming in the Middle East via Al Hurrah, which is the most widely \nviewed channel in Iraq today.\n  As U.S. international broadcasting begins this new chapter in its \nhistory, I want to convey my utmost respect and appreciation to Jeff \nHirschberg and Joaquin Blaya for their honorable service and vision as \nmembers of the BBG.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5782-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING EDWARD COLEMAN LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE GRADUATES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

A bill to improve hydropower, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation aimed at increasing the production of our hardest working \nrenewable resource, one that often gets overlooked in the clean energy \ndebate--hydropower. The first bill I would like to\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nintroduce today is the Hydropower Improvement Act of 2010, co-sponsored \nby my colleagues Senators Murray, Cantwell, and Crapo, true hydropower \nadvocates. The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2010 seeks to \nsubstantially increase the capacity and generation of our clean, \nrenewable hydropower resources that will improve environmental quality \nand support hundreds of thousands of green energy jobs.\n  There is no question that hydropower is, and must continue to be, \npart of our energy solution. It is the largest source of renewable \nelectricity in the United States. The 96,000 megawatts of hydroelectric \ncapacity we now have today provide about 7 percent of the Nation's \nelectricity needs. Hydroelectric generation is carbon-free baseload \npower that allows us to avoid 225 million metric tons of carbon \nemissions each year. Hydropower is clean efficient, and inexpensive. \nYet, despite its tremendous benefits, I am constantly amazed at how \nsome undervalue this important resource.\n  Perhaps it is because conventional wisdom dismisses our Nation's \nhydropower capacity as tapped out. That is simply not the case. If \nanything, hydropower is really an under-developed resource--something \nwe certainly understand in my home state of Alaska where hydro already \nsupplies 24 percent of the state's electricity needs and over 200 \npromising sites for further hydropower development have been \nidentified. There is great potential for additional hydropower \ndevelopment in every State, not just Alaska.\n  According to the Obama administration, conventional hydropower \nfacilities have the capacity to generate an additional 75,000 megawatts \nof power--a staggering amount of clean, inexpensive power. Now that \ndoesn't seem possible until you realize that only 3 percent of the \ncountry's 80,000 existing dams are even electrified. Significant \namounts of new capacity--anywhere between 20,000 and 60,000 megawatts--\ncan be derived from simple efficiency improvements or capacity \nadditions at existing facilities.\n  Additional hydropower can be captured in existing man-made conduits \nand hydroelectric pumped storage projects can help reliably integrate \nother renewable resources that are intermittent, such as wind, onto our \ngrid.\n  The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2010 seeks to increase \nsubstantially our nation's hydropower capacity in an effort to expand \nrenewable power generation and create much needed American jobs. The \nlegislation establishes a competitive grants program to support further \nhydropower development and directs the Energy Department to produce and \nimplement a plan for the research, development and demonstration of \nincreased hydropower capacity. The bill provides the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission with additional authority to extend preliminary \npermit terms; to work with Federal resource agencies to streamline the \nreview process for conduit hydropower projects; and to conduct a Notice \nof Inquiry into a possible two-year licensing process for certain \nminimal impact projects. The Act also calls for studies on pumped \nstorage sites and the potential for nonfederal development at Bureau of \nReclamation facilities, and authorizes training for hydroelectric power \ntechnology at community colleges.\n  It is my hope that as the Senate turns to energy legislation, we can \nfinally recognize the important contribution the renewable resource of \nhydropower makes, and will continue to make, to our clean energy goals. \nThis legislation is supported by the National Hydropower Association, \nthe American Public Power Association, the Family Farm Alliance, the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the Edison Electric \nInstitute, and the National Water Resources Association. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Hydropower Improvement Act of \n2010 to promote the further development of our most cost-effective, \nclean energy option while creating hundreds of thousands of new green \njobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend certain Federal benefits and income tax \nprovisions to energy generated by hydropower resources; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hydropower \nRenewable Energy Development Act of 2010. This is legislation to extend \ncertain benefits and income tax provisions to energy generated by \nhydropower resources.\n  We have an incredible amount of hydropower potential in my home State \nof Alaska. To date, we have almost 50 hydropower projects--in a range \nof sizes from the 126-megawatt Bradley Lake project to the 7-kilowatt \nWalsh Creek project--that produce about 24 percent of the State's \nelectricity needs. Alaska is proof that the hydropower resource is not \ntapped out--not even close. Currently, there are 32 additional \nhydropower projects, just in Southeast, that are either under \nconstruction or on the drawing boards. Statewide there are another 200 \nareas that have been identified as promising sites for lake taps, run \nof river, pumped storage and even new hydroelectric reservoirs. With \nthe proper financing, we could keep a dozen hydro construction \ncompanies fully employed in the State for a decade or even longer. That \nis just in Alaska. There are tremendous opportunities in each and every \nState to further develop this clean energy alternative.\n  Hydropower, by definition, is a renewable resource. It produces no \ncarbon emissions and through rainfall and melting snowpacks it is able \nto be replenished. Yet there are some who would deny this important \nclassification to the hydropower resource. The Hydropower Renewable \nEnergy Development Act of 2010 directs that the generation of \nhydroelectric power be treated as a ``renewable'' resource for purposes \nof any Federal program or standard. This reclassification of \nhydroelectric generation should help to incent the further production \nof this important and often undervalued resource.\n  Next, the bill provides parity treatment for hydropower resources in \nthe Production Tax Credit, PTC. Currently, companies that generate \nwind, solar, geothermal, and ``closed-loop'' biomass systems are \neligible for the PTC which provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour, kWh, \nbenefit for the first 10 years of a renewable energy facility's \noperation. Other technologies, such as incremental hydropower, certain \ngeneration at non-power facilities, and wave and tidal receive a lesser \nvalue tax credit of 1.0 cent per kWh. The Hydropower Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Act of 2010 eliminates the distinction between the two \ncategories so that all qualified hydropower resources receive the full \nPTC credit. The bill further expands upon the types of hydropower \nresources that can qualify for the PTC, allowing new hydro generation, \nsmall hydropower under 50 megawatts, lake taps, and pumped storage to \nqualify as well.\n  The Hydropower Renewable Energy Development Act of 2010 also carries \nthis expanded qualification of hydropower to the Clean Renewable Energy \nBonds, CREBS, program. Because non-profits like rural electric \ncooperatives and public power providers are not eligible for the PTC \ndue to their tax-exempt status, CREBS was created to encourage these \nentities to undertake renewable energy development as well. This \nprogram has been wildly popular and has been oversubscribed since its \ninception. There are endless possibilities for increased hydropower \nproduction by electric cooperatives and public power providers and they \nshould be given the proper financial incentive to do so.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this hydropower tax legislation. The \nfurther development of this untapped renewable resource will help us \nmeet our clean energy goals through the generation of carbon-free, \nbaseload power. At a time of record unemployment, the addition of \nhydropower capacity throughout the Nation will lead to hundreds of \nthousands of good paying, domestic jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hydropower Renewable Energy \n     Development Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. HYDROELECTRIC ENERGY TREATED AS RENEWABLE ENERGY.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, \n     for purposes of any Federal program or standard, the term \n     ``renewable energy'' shall include hydroelectric energy \n     generated in the United States by a hydroelectric facility, \n     including electric power produced by efficiency improvements \n     and capacity additions, generation added to nonpower dams, \n     conduits, pumped storage facilities, marine and hydrokinetic \n     resources, and conventional hydropower.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend and reauthorize the controlled substance \nmonitoring program under section 3990 of the Public Health Service Act \nand to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to share information \nabout the use of controlled substances by veterans with State \nprescription monitoring programs to prevent misuse and diversion of \nprescription medicines; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the nonmedical use and abuse of \nprescription drugs is a serious and growing public health problem in \nthis country. The 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed \nthat more than 15 million Americans had used prescription \npsychotherapeutic drugs non-medically in the past year. That is more \nthan 6 percent of the U.S. population. More than 20 percent of \nAmericans had abused these drugs during their lifetime. The Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Agency, SAMHSA, estimates that half a \nmillion residents in my home State of Illinois are using prescription \ndrugs illegally and in ways that can lead to dependence and even death.\n  Since 1999, abuse, misuse, and overdose of prescription drugs has \nincreased, and the health consequences are significant. Each year, more \nthan 20,000 people in the United States die from drug overdose. \nIllinois hospitals report an increase in patients visiting Emergency \nDepartments because of prescription drug misuse. From 2003 to 2007, \nChicago area hospitals saw the number of visits for pain medication \nmisuse more than double and visits for sedative misuse quadruple.\n  The trends among teens are especially worrisome. Prescription pain \nrelievers are the second most common drugs used as gateway drugs among \nteens. Over the past decade, there has been a 300 percent increase in \nthe number of teens seeking treatment for addiction to prescription \npainkillers.\n  To address this threat to public health, my colleague Senator \nSessions and I worked together to enact Public Law 109-60, the National \nAll Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005, NASPER. \nThis program provides grants through the Department of Health and Human \nServices to establish or improve State-based prescription drug \nmonitoring programs, PDMPs. The first grants were awarded through \nNASPER beginning in fiscal year 09, and currently over 40 States are \noperating PDMPs or have enacted legislation to establish them.\n  While each State's program is unique, in general they require that \npharmacies, physicians or both submit information to a central office \nwithin the State on prescriptions dispensed for certain controlled \nsubstances--narcotics, stimulants, sedatives, depressants, etc. By \ncreating these systems, States can ensure that health care providers, \nlaw enforcement officials and other regulatory and licensing bodies \nhave access to accurate, timely prescription history information as \npermitted by law.\n  The data in these systems can be used for many purposes: to assist in \nthe early identification of patients at risk for addiction, prevent \npatients from doctor shopping, and help with investigations of drug \ndiversion and errant prescribing or dispensing practices by pharmacists \nor medical providers.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the State PDMP is called Prescription \nInformation Library, PIL. The State was awarded a NASPER grant in \nfiscal year 09, which allowed it to expand and improve its program. In \nthe month of June 2010 alone, the PIL website was used by over 3,600 \ndoctors, pharmacists and other registered users who made over 24,000 \nvisits to the site. In addition, the number of law enforcement requests \nfor information from PIL increased from 16 in 2007 to 321 in 2009. Use \nof the program continues to grow--in the first 6 months of 2010, law \nenforcement officials have already made 271 requests for information \nfrom the database. The growth of the Illinois program demonstrates that \nit is valuable tool for protecting public health and safety by \nidentifying people at risk for prescription drug abuse and doctors who \nbetray the high ethical standards of their profession by over or \nincorrectly prescribing prescription drugs.\n  Today, along with Senator Sessions and several other colleagues, I am \nintroducing the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reposing \nReauthorization Act of 2010. This bill reauthorizes and extends this \nvital program for 5 more years at $15 million for fiscal year 2011 and \n$10 million each year thereafter. It also makes small changes to \nimprove and strengthen the program, including allowing grants to be \nmade available to States to plan or maintain a PDMP in addition to \nestablishing or improving a program; requiring States to help educate \nmedical providers about the benefits of the systems and facilitate \ntheir use of them; requiring, States to report aggregate data to the \nSecretary to allow for evaluation of the success of the program; \nallowing participation by the territories; and permitting the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to share information about the use of \ncontrolled substance by veterans with State PDMPs.\n  Reauthorizing the NASPER program for another 5 years with these \nchanges to improve its operation will assist States in combating abuse \nand misuse of prescription drugs. This common-sense legislation has \nbipartisan support, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact it into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of reauthorization \nof the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Drug Reporting \nAct, NASPER, program critical to combating the abuse of prescription \ndrugs in our Nation. I am proud to once again join my colleagues \nSenators Dick Durbin, Jeff Sessions, and Sherrod Brown on this \nimportant legislation which would reauthorize the NASPER program.\n  In 2008, over 15 million Americans abused prescription drugs and \nnearly 2 million of those Americans were between the ages of 12 and 17. \nFurther, the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National \nInstitutes of Health found that last year more than 1 in 10 high school \nseniors used a narcotic for nonmedical purposes. These statistics are \nsimply unacceptable. We must do more to address the issue of \nprescription drug abuse in this country.\n  When used under the supervision of a medical professional \nprescription drugs can be life saving but when they are abused they can \nbecome life-threatening. NASPER will help prevent unnecessary deaths by \nallowing credentialed professionals access to key information regarding \nprescriptions for many controlled substances. This access will help \nprevent doctor shopping and will help health professionals to more \nclosely monitor the prescriptions being issued to their patients.\n  NASPER is a valuable tool available to states to help detect and \nprevent abuse of prescription drugs. Reauthorization of this program \nwill allow states to establish, maintain, and grow their own electronic \nprescription drug monitoring programs. Beyond this it will help states \nestablish linkages to surrounding states so that information can be \nmore easily shared, making doctor shopping across state lines more \ndifficult.\n  I am proud of the work that is going on in my own state of \nConnecticut around this issue. Our Drug Control Division within the \nDepartment of Consumer Protection has worked tirelessly to build a \nsuccessful prescription drug monitoring program. This program has \nhelped to not only prevent abuse of prescription drugs but it has \nhelped to detect and prevent abuse of critical programs such as \nMedicare and Medicaid. In one case, an investigation of a pharmacist \nfraudulently billing Medicaid and Medicare resulted in a settlement \nwith the government for $340,000.\n  As you can see NASPER is an important tool we cannot afford to lose \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/13/senate-section/article/S5792-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5792-S5793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 579--HONORING THE LIFE OF MANUTE BOL AND EXPRESSING \n              THE CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE ON HIS PASSING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
