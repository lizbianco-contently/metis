Mr. President, following any leader remarks, the Senate \nwill turn to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  As a reminder to my colleagues, last night we were able to reach an \nagreement to limit action on the FDA Food Safety and Modernization Act. \nI filed a cloture motion with respect to the bill. The cloture vote on \nthe substitute amendment will occur at 6:30 p.m. Monday, November 29. \nSenators should expect up to five additional votes Monday night so we \ncan complete action on that bill on Monday. Basically what we have is \nwe have the bill, and we will complete action on that, and we have a \nnumber of amendments offered by Senator Coburn. As I recall, there is \nonly one side-by-side to the work we have done. So we should be able to \ncomplete that very important bill, which will be such a relief to the \npeople of our country. This will be the first modernization of our food \nsafety programs in more than 100 years--something long overdue.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today. We have a number of matters we \nare working on, trying to have cleared today, and we hope we can do \nthat. We will have to wait and see what the outcome of the day is.\n  But I appreciated everyone's cooperation late yesterday. It was very \ndifficult to work through that. We had, of\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\ncourse, the Jack Lew nomination that was a problem that we were able to \nget cleared. We had to get that cleared because statutorily the \nPresident has a budget he has to submit to us. Without a leader at the \nOffice of Management and Budget, it could not be done. So we got that \ndone. We were able to arrive at an agreement on the food safety bill so \nwe would not have to have multiple votes over the weekend. So I think \nwe accomplished a lot this week.\n  For me personally, I had three caucuses, which were all extremely \nimportant for me and the caucus. We spent about 10 or 11 hours over the \nlast few days discussing the lameduck and what we have next Congress.\n  The floor is now open.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8112-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about a \nwonderful opportunity we had on October 20 in the Senate to host \nheroes, five young West Point graduates, who are currently recuperating \nat Walter Reed Army Medical Center. They came for a tour of the Capitol \nand for a lesson in history, and I want to thank the Senate Historian \nwho came to the floor.\n  They had the opportunity to be in the Chamber and to see where the \nlaws are created, which they, through their service and sacrifice, give \nus the chance to improve and defend and preserve the Constitution and \nmake the laws of this country.\n  We were able, more importantly, to thank them, to thank them for \ntheir service to the Nation, and I am particularly pleased and proud \nbecause they carry on a tradition of selfless service to the Nation \nexemplified in the best moments of the graduates of the U.S. Military \nAcademy. Each one was wounded while leading his troops out front, \nexposed to the dangers and hardships of warfare.\n  We had previously hosted a group of soldiers from the 82nd Airborne \nDivision--again, I have a very proud association as a former company \ncommander in that division. We hope periodically to host other wounded \nwarriors from Walter Reed.\n  But among our guests was CPT Dan Berschinski. Dan is a graduate from \nthe class of 2007 from the Military Academy. He hails from Peachtree \nCity, GA. He served with the 5/2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team. He was \ninjured in Afghanistan. They were operating around the Arghandab River \nValley near Kandahar. He was on patrol, dismounted, when he was hit by \nan IED and suffered the loss of both of his legs but not the diminution \nof his spirit or his commitment of service to the Nation.\n  We were also joined by 1LT Chris Nichols, from the class of 2008. \nChris is from Myersville, MD. He served with the 1st Heavy Brigade \nCombat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division. He was injured in Iraq, \nnortheast of Baghdad, by an explosively formed penetrator IED, a very \nsophisticated weapons system. It injured both of his legs. He was \njoined by his friend, Stacey Aleksejus. We were pleased that Chris and \nStacey were here. Chris is, hopefully, going to return to Active Duty.\n  We were also joined by 1LT Rahul Harpalani from the class of 2008. \nRahul is from Carbondale, IL. He served with the 4th Brigade Combat \nTeam of the 4th Infantry Division. He was wounded in Konar Province in \nAfghanistan. An IED exploded against the vehicle he was driving. Both \nlegs were injured. We hope, again, that he will be recuperating well.\n\n  We were also joined by 1LT Josh Linvill, USMA class of 2008 from \nWayne, PA. He served with the 3/2 Stryker Cavalry Regiment. He was \nwounded in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He stepped on a land mine, injuring \nhis right leg.\n  We were joined also by 1LT Zach Osborne, class of 2008, from Roanoke, \nVA. He served with the 5/2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, once again in \nthe Arghandab River Valley of Afghanistan. An IED hit the vehicle he \nwas riding in. Both of his legs were injured. We were pleased he was \njoined by his non-medical attendant, Daniel Key.\n  These young men have served, but their families have served also, and \nwe wish to thank them as well. They, too, have sacrificed. In fact, all \nof us have been up to Walter Reed and as we have gone through the \ncorridors, we have seen mothers and fathers in the rooms with their \nsons, as well as wives and husbands and children and grandparents and \nuncles and aunts, because the sacrifice of these young men and women \nhas been borne by their families as well as themselves.\n  I also wish to thank COL Jim Wartski. Jim is from the class of 1982. \nHe serves as a mobilized reservist at Walter Reed; he, as well as Mr. \nFred Larson, the director of Care and Service Transformation. These two \ngentlemen escorted the wounded warriors. They also represent some of \nthe improvements not just to the physical infrastructure of Walter Reed \nbut to the management of Walter Reed, from the patient-centered care to \nthe continued engagement and involvement of these young men and women, \nnot only while they are in acute care, but also as they recuperate and \nrehabilitate, and that is an improvement that has been made and is so \nnecessary.\n  These young men--in this case, all young combat officers--men, but \nyoung men and women who are serving and sacrificing and sustaining the \nwounds and, in some cases, giving their lives to this Nation are the \nfabric of our defense. They are what has sustained us through not just \nthis moment but throughout our history. They continue to inspire us \nwith their service, and they continue to represent to the world the \ncontinued promise that wherever we are challenged, we will meet that \nchallenge.\n  We cannot repay them enough. We cannot thank them enough. But last \nmonth this Senate had the opportunity to say to five of these warriors: \nThank you very much. Come here, see the Senate of the United States \nwhere great debates have taken place, where the rights and the \nresponsibilities have been fashioned over more than 200 years. This is \nwhat you defend. But, more importantly, you give us the opportunity and \nthe obligation to ensure that your sacrifice is not in vain; that we \nwork here, as you do, as committed Americans to improve the lives of \nour fellow Americans, to defend their security, but also to provide \nopportunity, to do what is difficult and sometimes unpopular but what \nis necessary for the success of freedom and the success of the families \nof this country.\n  At moments in this body, we have, a sense of frustration, a sense \nof--let me stop at frustration. At those moments when we are divided by \npolitical issues, by policy debates, I ask us all to think for a moment \nof these young men and women. I think that will help immensely in our \nresponse to the challenges we face as a Senate and as a nation.\n  I also wish to say something else because this week in Rhode Island, \nwe had to bury a warrior, SGT Michael Paranzino of the 10th Mountain \nDivision. Michael left his wife and two small children, his parents, \nhis family, his friends, and the whole community of Rhode Island. He \nwas an extraordinary young man.\n  The cost of this great experiment in democracy is high indeed. We \nhave to recognize that cost, not just in speeches on the floor of the \nSenate but going forward: how we conduct ourselves as Senators; what we \ndo to make this country stronger and better; what we do to make it more \na place of opportunity for all of our citizens. Particularly, it is \nabout what we will do not in the next 2 months or the next 10 months \nbut in the next 20 years to ensure that the veterans we honor on this\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nfloor today will still be honored 20 years hence. We need to ensure \nthat, not just with an annual parade and flag waving, but with the \ncare, the support, the assistance to the VA and the Department of \nDefense as well as in their communities, not just these individuals but \ntheir families.\n  I hope years from now, and I will pray, that others will stand up and \nsay they paid the price and we have kept our promise to them.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). In my capacity as a \nSenator from the State of Colorado, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8113-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WILLISON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of Andrew B. ``Drew'' Willison who has served with great \ndistinction since 2007 as U.S. Senate Deputy Sergeant at Arms. Mr. \nWillison, who is leaving his position to pursue new adventures in the \nprivate sector, has lead a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate that \nelevated him to the highest levels of decisionmaking. His work greatly \nenhanced the safety and security of the U.S. Senate, staff, and \nvisitors.\n  Mr. Willison was born in Mount Vernon, OH, and was raised in Ohio, \nMissouri, Alabama, Connecticut, and Virginia. He earned a B.A. with \nHonors in government from the College of William and Mary in 1988. He \nalso holds a masters' degree in public administration from the Ohio \nState University, 1990, and a law degree from the George Washington \nUniversity, 2001.\n  Mr. Willison started his government career as a presidential \nmanagement intern at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \nNASA, and later worked for the Environmental Protection Agency's acid \nrain division.\n  In 1997 he joined my staff to work on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, including the $200 billion 1998 highway bill. In 1999, \nI selected Mr. Willison to become his Appropriations Committee staff \ndirector for the Energy and Water Subcommittee. In this capacity, Drew \nrepresented the minority leader and the other Senate Democratic member \ninterests on the $35 billion per year bill that funds the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Bureau \nof Reclamation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and other smaller agencies.\n  In 2007, Mr. Willison was appointed Deputy Senate Sergeant at Arms \nwhere he served as the chief operating officer of the Senate's largest \norganization, with over 850 employees and an annual budget exceeding \n$200 million. Mr. Willison directly supervised senior managers \nresponsible for all operations, including the chief information \nofficer, the chief financial officer, security and emergency \npreparedness, police operations, general counsel, human resources, the \nmedia and public galleries, the Employee Assistance Program, the \nProtocol Office, the Doorkeepers, the Page Program, printing, the photo \nstudio, the Senate Post Office, parking, and education and training.\n  Around the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Willison was \nbest known not just for his accomplished and distinguished work in the \nSenate but for his love of animals, music, the latest technology and \nhis extensive Amazon on-line gift list.\n  Congratulations! We wish Mr. Willison all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8113-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8113-S8114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MEREDITH EVANS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work of my \nfriend, Dr. Meredith Evans. A native of Little Clear Creek in Bell \nCounty, Ky., Meredith knew what career path he wanted to follow at a \nvery young age. Influenced by his family members who were in the \nmedical field, he decided by age six that he wanted to be a doctor.\n  Through diligence and perseverance he graduated high school early and \nwent on to earn degrees from the University of Kentucky and the \nUniversity of Louisville Medical School. After 6 years in surgical \nresidency, he became a certified general surgeon, and throughout his \ncareer he has heavily valued the doctor-patient relationship.\n  Not only was my good friend a great doctor, but he also gave back to \nhis community and our Commonwealth through his involvement in the \nChamber of Commerce and in ROHO, a charitable organization aimed to \nfurther the success of young people, which he founded. His compassion \nworked toward building new schools, immunizing citizens against polio, \nand raising money to give Christmas presents to underprivileged \nchildren. His community and our Commonwealth have benefited greatly \nbecause of his work. The Middlesboro Daily News recently published a \nstory about Dr. Evans and his involvement in the community. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                    Local Folks: Dr. Meredith Evans\n\n       Middlesboro.--``I decided I was going to be a doctor when I \n     was six years old,'' recalled longtime Middlesboro doctor \n     Meredith Evans.\n       One of his brothers, 18 years his senior, went to medical \n     school, inspiring Meredith to do the same. His first cousin \n     also owned Evans Hospital in Middlesboro and his uncle was a \n     physician in Pineville and Straight Creek.\n       Evans was born and raised in the Bell County community of \n     Little Clear Creek with his parents, Rose-Ota Fuson Evans and \n     father Marion F. Evans, a hillside farmer, and his three \n     sisters and two brothers.\n       The family lived off of the land, growing and hunting all \n     their own food. Evans remembers hunting and eating game like \n     squirrels and rabbits.\n       All six children went to college; the three girls became \n     school teachers and the boys went into the medical field.\n       Walking was the primary means of transportation in Little \n     Clear Creek at the time, and was supplemented by horses and \n     mules.\n       ``My dad never owned a car,'' he said.\n       Meredith walked to elementary school, where he was taught \n     mostly by his school-teaching sister, and later, by his \n     brother who was putting himself through dental school.\n       He walked four and a half miles to a bus stop to go to Bell \n     County High School, from which he graduated at the age of 16.\n       ``I doubled-up on a couple of subjects when I was under my \n     sister,'' he explained.\n       Meredith went to the University of Kentucky to get his \n     Bachelor's degree and the University of Louisville Medical \n     School. Going from Little Clear Creek to the city required \n     some adjustment.\n       ``It was quite a change. But I adapted rather quickly,'' \n     Evans said. ``I was spending most of my time going to school, \n     going to classes.''\n       Evans was in college during World War II, and was set to \n     head overseas when the war ended.\n       ``I had already had my physical examination, and was ready \n     to go in the war. And they dropped the atomic bomb and that \n     ended the war,'' Meredith remembered.\n       Evans was told by his college roommate, Wendell Demarcus, \n     that the war was nearly over. Demarcus, it turned out, had \n     some inside information. The physics major had been working \n     on the development of the atomic bomb.\n       ``He kept telling me, he said Something will happen that's \n     going to end the war,' but he never would tell me what and I \n     didn't push him for it. But when they dropped the bomb, he \n     said That's what I've been telling you about.'''\n       When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Evans joined the \n     service, to avoid being drafted. He spent eight months in \n     Fort Campbell learning about reconstructive plastic surgery.\n       ``We did a lot of reconstructive surgeries on soldiers that \n     were returning home. I learned a lot about plastic surgery \n     there,'' Evans said.\n       After training at Fort Campbell, Evans and his three \n     friends shipped out. Evans ended up in Europe, thanks to the \n     luck of the draw.\n       ``They put our names in a hat and they said the first one \n     drawn out of the hat would go to Europe and the other two to \n     Korea. So\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n     my two friends went to Korea,'' Evans explained.\n       He was stationed in England, but was able to travel around \n     Europe during his service. Italy, where he toured ancient \n     churches and saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa, was his favorite \n     destination.\n       ``I enjoyed their food and enjoyed the people,'' he \n     remarked.\n       After medical school, Evans spent six years in surgical \n     residency at three locations--Florida, West Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania. He emerged a certified general surgeon with the \n     American Board of Surgery, with whom he later became a \n     diplomat.\n       The first operation Evans completed was an appendectomy at \n     a hospital in West Virginia, and he recalls the butterflies \n     that filled his stomach that day.\n       ``I was doing an appendectomy. The main reason I was \n     nervous, was that my wife was in the operating room as a \n     nurse,'' he recalled.\n       His wife, Helen, continued to work as a nurse, helping \n     support the couple while Meredith completed his residency. \n     After finishing his training, he set up shop in Middlesboro, \n     and felt fortunate to be able to return home.\n       ``I really enjoy being with country people. I think we have \n     the cream of the crop in the mountains,'' Evans declared.\n       Helen worked as a nurse in the practice until the couple \n     started a family. They had five children, Marilyn, Deborah, \n     Carobeth, Michelle, and Meredith II. Evans enjoyed \n     fatherhood.\n       ``I had four cheerleaders and a football player,'' he said. \n     ``I loved athletics. Of course, I was always interested in \n     their scholastics. My children always did well in school, \n     which made us happy.''\n       The couple now has ten grandchildren and the family is \n     always together for the holidays.\n       During his medical career, Meredith Evans witnessed \n     tremendous changes in medicine. Post-graduate education was a \n     consistent part of his career as technology and diagnostics \n     advanced.\n       Evans says that diagnostic advancements changed the face of \n     medicine, and that the invention of ultrasound machines, and \n     laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery made it possible for \n     doctors to save more lives than ever before.\n       Acquiring the ability to control circulation during \n     surgery, he says, may be the biggest advantage in medicine.\n       ``You have machines that breathe and act as a heart, \n     pumping blood through the system while you're working on \n     it,'' said Evans. ``That's one of the biggest advances . . . \n     ''\n       For Evans though, who has always had an intense interest in \n     medical ethics, spending time with patients to offer full \n     explanations of procedures and conditions was also a vital \n     part of the occupation.\n       \"The doctor-patient relationship is the most important part \n     of medicine,'' he asserted.\n       In addition to working as a doctor, Evans took on many \n     roles in Middlesboro. He is the director of Community Trust \n     Bank, previously Commercial Bank, a post he has held since \n     1962.\n       Evans served as the president of the Junior Chamber of \n     Commerce and later the Senior Chamber of Commerce.\n       The Junior Chamber, under Evans, passed a bond issue to \n     provide the funding to build new schools in Middlesboro.\n       ``It was a very difficult thing to do,'' Evans said. \n     ``People opposed the taxes that were necessary to do it.''\n       In the early 1960s, the group confronted other city issues, \n     including immunizing the town against polio and defeating a \n     resolution to eliminate the citizen-elected City Council in \n     favor of an appointed commission.\n       Evans is a founding member of ROHO, an organization that \n     worked toward improving the community, and is named after the \n     song ``The Cockfight'' recorded by Archie Campbell in 1966.\n       The organization provides Christmas gifts for \n     underprivileged children in Bell, Lee and Claiborne counties. \n     Last year, the group spent around $30,000 on the program.\n       Additionally, Evans served for 12 years on the Middlesboro \n     School Board, was a city councilman for 20 years and served \n     as vice mayor.\n       Although Evans has retired from medicine, he continues to \n     keep up with advancements in the field. He stays healthy and \n     sharp with regular exercise and fresh produce from his \n     garden.\n       He still hunts and fishes as he did as a child, but no \n     longer brings home squirrel. He is enjoying retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8114-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8114-S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CENTRE COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in 1819, a group of citizens petitioned \nthe Kentucky General Assembly for a charter to create a new liberal \narts college. The result was Centre College--a remarkable institution \nnamed for its proximate location in the geographic center of the \nCommonwealth. So committed was the legislature to the success of this \nschool that it placed some of the State's most important citizens in \ncharge of its board of trustees. Kentucky's first Governor, Isaac \nShelby, served as its chair, and Dr. Ephraim McDowell--a pioneer in \nabdominal surgical techniques whose statue is on permanent display here \nin the Capitol--also served on the board.\n  From this august beginning, Centre College matured into a nationally \nrecognized educational institution that focuses its mission on the \nsuccess of its students. As their motto indicates, every student can \nexpect a personal education and extraordinary success. It is not \nsurprising, then, that Centre alumni include two Vice Presidents, one \nChief Justice and one Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, 13 \nU.S. Senators, 43 U.S. Representatives, 11 Governors--as well as 3 \nalumni currently serving on my staff. Indeed, Centre College has been a \nproving ground for generations of men and women whom have gone on to \nbecome leaders in a variety of fields.\n  More recently, under the steady hand of its president, Dr. John \nRoush, Centre College broke onto the national stage in 2000 when it \nhosted the Vice-Presidential debate between Dick Cheney and our \ncolleague Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.\n  When you consider the fact that it also holds a national record in \nannual alumni contributions, it is little wonder that Forbes magazine \nrecently named Centre College as the top college in the South for a \nsecond year in a row. As the article begins, ``If you're accepted to be \na student at the best college in the South, you are guaranteed an \ninternship, the opportunity to study abroad and graduation within four \nyears--or the school will pay for an additional year of tuition-free \nstudy.''\n  So it is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the students, faculty, staff, and alumni of Centre College \nin Danville, KY.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the relevant portion of \nthe Forbes article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From Forbes Magazine, Nov. 12, 2010]\n\n                     The Best Colleges in the South\n\n                          (By Jacquelyn Smith)\n\n       If you're accepted to be a student at the best college in \n     the South, you are guaranteed an internship, the opportunity \n     to study abroad and graduation within four years--or the \n     school will pay for an additional year of tuition-free study.\n       The benefits of attending the best college in the South \n     don't even stop when you receive your diploma. Within 10 \n     months of graduation, 98% of the college's students, on \n     average, are employed or engaged in advanced study. Upon \n     graduating you become part of the nation's most loyal and \n     generous group of alumni.\n       Located in the heart of Kentucky, Centre College has 1,197 \n     undergraduate students and more than 100 faculty members, 98% \n     of whom hold the highest degrees in their fields.\n       ``My time at Centre has been highlighted by the professors \n     and mentors who have guided me and the unique experiences \n     I've taken part in,'' says Paul Adams, a 21-year-old senior \n     from Chicago.\n       In the last decade alone, Centre produced 17 Fulbright \n     scholars, five Goldwater scholars, two Rhodes scholars and a \n     Truman scholar. Its alumni include two U.S. vice presidents, \n     a chief justice of the United States, 13 U.S. senators and 43 \n     U.S. representatives.\n       ``The education is intense and challenging, but also \n     supportive,'' says the college's communications director, \n     Mike Norris. ``We have students saying, `I've found myself \n     doing things at Centre that I would have never even aspired \n     to do.' Our students achieve beyond what they ever thought \n     possible.''\n       More than 85 percent of Centre's students study abroad, and \n     to emphasize its commitment to global citizenship, the \n     college recently implemented a program that provides a free \n     passport to all first-year students who don't already have \n     one.\n       ``Even though we're just a small college in Kentucky, \n     Centre students are doing great things--studying abroad in \n     Mexico, China, England, France, Spain, Vietnam, Israel, \n     Africa, the Bahamas and many more places worldwide, taking on \n     the challenges of society in our classrooms and across \n     campus, and generally making a difference,'' says Elizabeth \n     Trollinger, a 21-year-old senior from Kentucky. ``Centre is a \n     place where we are given countless chances to become active \n     members of our society and community, and we know we'll be \n     able to effectively use the knowledge and skills we acquire \n     in our four years here, no matter what comes after Centre.''\n       Over the last 25 years, Centre alumni have led the nation \n     in loyalty, in terms of the percentage of graduates who make \n     financial donations each year. ``The entire Centre community \n     seems to be knit together by two strands,'' Adams says, ``a \n     firm commitment to a meaningful education and an unwavering \n     passion for Centre herself. And for the\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n     past three years, I've found myself happily woven into her \n     fabric.''\n       Centre is also the 24th best college in America overall, \n     according to Forbes and the Center for College Affordability \n     and Productivity's ranking of America's Best Colleges, which \n     was published in August. The list ranks U.S. undergraduate \n     institutions by the quality of the education they provide, \n     the experiences of their students, the amount of debt \n     students graduate with and how much they achieve. To \n     determine the best schools in the South, we narrowed that \n     list according to the regional divisions used by the U.S. \n     Census Bureau; that means schools in the South are located in \n     Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, \n     Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, \n     North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, \n     Virginia and West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8115-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MRS. JAN CRASE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of Mrs. Jan Crase, who passed away on September 28, 2010, in \nLexington, KY. As a resident of Somerset, KY, Jan was a prime example \nof a woman who gave back to her community. She valued education, faith \nand family, and was one of the hardest workers I have ever had the \nprivilege of knowing. She attended Berea College for 3 years, and then \ntransferred to the University of Louisville where she graduated with a \ndegree in home economics. Even after leaving Berea College, she stayed \nconnected to the college community throughout the years, serving on the \nBerea College Board of Trustees and the College President's Club. Jan \nwas a caring friend who wanted college students to have the same \npositive experience she did in higher education. She helped raise \nmillions of dollars for student scholarships, study-abroad programs, \nand computer funding at Berea College. As a member of Somerset's First \nPresbyterian Church, she saw a need to educate children not yet old \nenough to attend grade school, so she helped start the first preschool \nin Pulaski County in 1970. Since then, many families have benefited not \nonly from the preschool but also from the youth groups and 4-H programs \nthat Jan helped establish.\n  Starting youth programs and bringing the community together to raise \nmoney for a great cause were not the only things Jan excelled in; she \nwas a determined entrepreneur and businesswoman. She had her hand in a \nvariety of different careers, as a real-estate broker, an insurance \nagency owner, a home agent for Kentucky 4-H programs, as well as a \ndietician at Baptist Hospital in Louisville. Jan inspired everyone she \ncame into contact with because of her positive outlook and \ndetermination in everything that she did. She was truly an upstanding \nwoman, who spent much of her life giving her time and talents to better \nher community and our Commonwealth. There is no doubt the Commonwealth \nis poorer for her loss. My thoughts go out to her husband, James; her \nson, Karl' her two daughters Kim and Katherine; and her four \ngrandchildren. The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article \nabout Jan and the legacy she left behind. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       Somerset.--Jan Crase, 72, of Somerset, Ky., passed away \n     Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2010 in Lexington, Ky.\n       She was born in Summer Shade, Ky., on July 11, 1938, \n     daughter of the late Seymore and Ruby Smith Hunley. She was a \n     member of Somerset First Presbyterian Church. She attended \n     Berea College and graduated from University of Louisville \n     with a degree in Home Economics with emphasis in Dietetics.\n       Jan was the first female in Kentucky to pass Series I \n     examination for the Member of Appraisal Institute \n     designation. She became a licensed Real Estate Broker in \n     Kentucky where she did appraisals and feasibility studies in \n     15 Kentucky counties. She owned and operated a Somerset \n     insurance agency successfully for ten years.\n       She was a home agent with the University of Kentucky \n     Extension Service where she worked in Louisville and \n     Jefferson County with both 4-H and homemaker programs. She \n     developed the first 4-H clubs in inner city schools in the \n     nation.

Kridlo\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of Specialist Dale J. Kridlo. \nSpecialist Kridlo, assigned to the 27th Engineer Battalion, based in \nFort Bragg, NC, died on November 7, 2010, of injuries sustained when \nhis dismounted patrol encountered small arms fire. Specialist Kridlo \nwas serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Kunar Province, \nAfghanistan. He was 33 years old.\n  A native of Pittston, PA, Specialist Kridlo graduated from Pittston \nArea High School. After managing his own painting business for several \nyears, Specialist Kridlo enlisted in the Army and served a tour of duty \nin Afghanistan with decoration. He followed in the footsteps of his \nfather and grandfather, both of whom served in the Armed Forces.\n  During almost 2 years of service, Specialist Kridlo distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and the high standards \nto which he held his fellow soldiers. Family members recall his \noverwhelming pride when he used to describe the accomplishments of his \ncombat unit in Afghanistan. Commanders recognized Specialist Kridlo's \nextraordinary bravery and talent, promoting him one week before his \npassing.\n  Specialist Kridlo worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those who knew \nhim as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to \nexcellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son, husband, and \nloving father to two young daughters. In his free time, Specialist \nKridlo enjoyed fishing. He was also an avid Philadelphia sports fan.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' \nSpecialist Kridlo's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nfirst, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a sense of the \nhighest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Specialist Kridlo will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Specialist Kridlo's entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you \nmust be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be \neased by your pride in Dale's service and by your knowledge that his \ncountry will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his \nsacrifice.\n\n\n                   Second Lieutenant Robert M. Kelly\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I recognize Second Lieutenant Robert \nM. Kelly of Tallahassee, FL, who was killed November 9, 2010, from an \nimprovised explosive device while on a foot patrol in Helmand Province, \nAfghanistan. Lieutenant Kelly is survived by his wife Heather, his \nsister Kathleen, and his brother John Kelly, who is also a marine. LT \nRobert Kelly was the son of Lieutenant General Kelly and Mrs. John \nKelly. Lieutenant General Kelly is the commander of the Marine Forces \nReserve in New Orleans.\n  Lieutenant Kelly was engaged in his third combat deployment and was \nassigned to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division \nout of Camp Pendleton, CA. Following in his father's footsteps, \nLieutenant Robert Kelly rose through the ranks during his service. He \nwas commissioned as an officer in the Marine Corps on December 12, \n2008, where he continued to honorably serve with distinction.\n  A decorated marine, LT Robert Kelly's bravery is a testament to true \nAmerican heroism. Having received multiple awards that include the \nPurple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Lt. Kelly \ndeserves to be recognized. He also received the Marine Corps Good \nConduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Humanitarian \nService Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.\n  There is no doubt that this tragic loss will not only be felt within \nthe Kelly family but also the Marine Corps and this Nation. Our \nthoughts and prayers will continue to be with his family and friends. \nToday I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and remembering 2LT \nRobert M. Kelly, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8116-S8121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the November election \nreturns, there was talk on all sides about working together. We can do \nso right now, without further delay, and in the interests of the \nAmerican people. As of today there are more than 100 vacancies on the \nFederal courts around the country, 50 of them for vacancies deemed \njudicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nThe Senate has ready for consideration and confirmation 23 judicial \nnominees of the President, all of whom have had hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee and have been reported favorably to the Senate by a \nmajority of that committee. Sixteen of these judicial nominees were \nreported unanimously. The Senate can confirm those 16 nominees today, \nand we can then schedule such debate as needed on the remaining seven. \nOur working together to do so would send the right message to the \nAmerican people. Let's work together and approve these nominations \nwithout additional delay. Let's end the gridlock. Let's move forward.\n  As the Senate recessed for the elections, we were not allowed to \nconsider and confirm any of the 23 judicial nominations pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar--this despite the judicial vacancies crisis \nin our Federal courts. As of today there are 108 current judicial \nvacancies. We already know of 20 future vacancies. In addition, the \nSenate has not acted on the request by the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States to authorize 56 additional judges, which will allow the \nFederal judiciary to do its work. Accordingly, the Federal judiciary is \ncurrently more than 180 judges short of those needed.\n  At the end of September, the President of the United States sent a \nletter to Senate leaders expressing his justifiable concern with the \npace of judicial confirmations. The President wrote that the American \npeople and the Federal judiciary suffer from this inaction and that a \nminority of Senators has, in his words ``systematically and \nirresponsibly used procedural maneuvers to block or delay confirmation \nvotes on judicial nominees--including nominees that have strong \nbipartisan support and the most distinguished records.''\n  All of these nominees have the backing of their home State Senators. \nIndeed, President Obama has worked hard with home State Senators \nregardless of party affiliation, and by so doing has done his part to \nrestore comity to the process.\n  Sixteen judicial nominees have been delayed despite the fact that \nthey were reported without a single vote in opposition from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Regrettably, despite the President's efforts and \nhis selection of outstanding nominees the Senate has not reciprocated \nby promptly considering his consensus nominees. To the contrary, as the \nPresident has pointed out, nominees are being stalled who, if allowed \nto be considered, would receive unanimous or near unanimous support, be \nconfirmed, and be serving in the administration of justice throughout \nthe country. This is counterproductive.\n  Like the President, I welcome debate and a vote on those few nominees \nthat some Republican Senators would oppose. Nominees like Benita \nPearson of Ohio, William Martinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of \nWisconsin, Edward Chen of California, John McConnell of Rhode Island, \nGoodwin Liu of California and Robert Chatigny of Connecticut. I have \nreviewed their records and considered their character, background and \nqualifications. I have heard the criticisms of the Republican Senators \non the Judiciary Committee as they have voted against this handful of \nnominees. I disagree, and believe the Senate would vote, as I have, to \nconfirm them. That they will not be conservative activist judges should \nnot disqualify them from serving.\n  But that is not what is happening. We are not debating the merits of \nthose nominations, as Democratic Senators did when we opposed the most \nextreme handful of nominees of President Bush. What is happening is \nthat judicial confirmations are being stalled virtually across the \nboard. What is new and particularly damaging is that 16 judicial \nnominees who were all reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, without Republican opposition, are still being delayed. \nThese nominees include Albert Diaz and Catherine Eagles of North \nCarolina. They are both supported by Senator Hagan and Senator Burr. \nSadly, Senator Burr's support has not freed them from the across the \nboard Republican hold on all judicial nominees. Judge Diaz was reported \nunanimously in January, almost 11 months ago, and still waits for \nagreement from the minority in order for the Senate to consider his \nnomination so that he may be confirmed.\n  Also being delayed for no good reason from joining the bench of the \nmost overloaded Federal district in the country in the Eastern District \nof California is Kimberly Mueller, whose nomination was reported last \nMay, more than 6 months ago, without any opposition. Her nomination is \none of four circuit and district nominations to positions in the Ninth \nCircuit currently on the Executive Calendar that Republicans are \nblocking from Senate consideration. In addition to the Liu and Chen \nnominations, the nomination of Mary Murguia from Arizona to the Ninth \nCircuit has been stalled since August despite the strong support of \nSenator Kyl, the assistant Republican leader.\n  I want to put into the Record a letter we received this week from \nNinth Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, a President Reagan appointee, \nand the other members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit \nwriting ``to emphasize our desperate need for judges'' in the Nation's \nlargest Federal circuit. They write that ``[c]ourts cannot do their \nwork if authorized judicial positions remain vacant'' and urge ``that \nthe Senate act on judicial nominees\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nwithout delay.'' This letter echoes the serious warning I have \npreviously spoken about issued by Justice Anthony Kennedy at the Ninth \nCircuit Conference about skyrocketing judicial vacancies in California \nand throughout the country. He said: ``It's important for the public to \nunderstand that the excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.'' \nHe noted that ``if judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of \ncongressional indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.''\n  The District of Columbia suffers from four vacancies on its Federal \nDistrict Court. Two nominees could help that court, but they are now \nbeing delayed from final consideration. Beryl Howell was reported by \nthe committee unanimously. She is well known to many of us from her 10 \nyears of service as a counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is \na decorated former Federal prosecutor and the child of a military \nfamily. Robert Wilkins was also reported without opposition. The \ndistinguished Chief Judge of the District Court, Chief Judge Royce \nLamberth sent a recent letter to Senate leaders urging prompt action on \nthese nominations.\n  John Gibney of Virginia, James Bredar and Ellen Hollander of \nMaryland, Susan Nelson of Minnesota, Edmond Chang of Illinois, Leslie \nKobayashi of Hawaii, and Denise Casper of Massachusetts are the other \ndistrict court nominees reported unanimously from the Judiciary \nCommittee and could have been confirmed as consensus nominees long ago.\n  Another district court nominee is Carlton Reeves of Mississippi, who \nis supported by Senator Cochran and is a former president of the \nMagnolia Bar Association. Only Senator Coburn asked to be recorded as \nopposing his nomination. I believe Mr. Reeves would receive a strong \nbipartisan majority vote for confirmation.\n  Counting Judge Diaz, there are five consensus nominees to the circuit \ncourts who are being stalled. Judge Ray Lohier of New York would fill \none of the four current vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. He is another former prosecutor with support \nfrom both sides of the aisle. His confirmation has been stalled for no \ngood reason for more than 6 months, as well. Scott Matheson is a Utah \nnominee with the support of Senator Hatch who was reported without \nopposition. Mary Murgaia is from Arizona and is supported by Senator \nKyl and was reported without opposition. Finally, Judge Kathleen \nO'Malley of Ohio, nominated to the Federal circuit, was reported \nwithout opposition.\n  Many of these nominees could have been considered and confirmed \nbefore the August recess. All of them could have been considered and \nconfirmed before the October recess. They were not. They were not \nbecause of Republican objections that, I suspect, have nothing to do \nwith the qualifications or quality of these nominees. These are not \njudicial nominations whose judicial philosophy Republicans question.\n  The President noted in his September letter to Senate leaders that \nthe ``real harm of this political game-playing falls on the American \npeople, who turn to the courts for justice'' and that the unnecessary \ndelay in considering these noncontroversial nominations ``is \nundermining the ability of our courts to deliver justice to those in \nneed . . . from working mothers seeking timely compensation for their \nemployment discrimination claims to communities hoping for swift \npunishment for perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking \nprotection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.''\n  President Obama has reached out to Republican home State Senators \nregarding his judicial nominations. They should reciprocate. As the \nPresident said in his inaugural address calling for a new era of \nresponsibility, he called for ``an end to the petty grievances . . . \nrecriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled \nour politics.'' The President recalled the words of Scripture as he \nurged ``the time has come to set aside childish things.'' Let the \nSenate end this across the board blockade against confirming \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees. Democrats did not engage in such a \npractice with President Bush and Republicans should not continue their \npractice any longer. With more than 100 vacancies plaguing the Federal \ncourts, we do not have the luxury of indulging in such games.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace set by a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate considering President Bush's nominations during his first 2 \nyears in office. By this date in President Bush's second year in \noffice, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, had confirmed 100 of \nhis Federal circuit and district court nominations. They were all \nconsidered and confirmed during the 17 months I chaired the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Not a single nominee reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee remained pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar at the \nend of the Congress.\n  In sharp contrast, during President Obama's first 2 years in office, \nthe minority has allowed only 41 Federal circuit and district court \nnominees to be considered by the Senate. In 2002, we proceeded in the \nlame duck session after the election to confirm 20 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees. This year there are 23 judicial nominations ready \nfor Senate consideration and another 11 noncontroversial nominations on \nthe committee's business agenda that could have been reported out \nyesterday. Those 11 nominations were needlessly held over another two \nweeks by Republican Senators but could be reported to the Senate at our \nnext business meeting. That is more than 30 additional confirmations \nthat could be easily achieved with a little cooperation from the \nminority. That would increase the confirmations from the historically \nlow level of 41, where it currently stands, to between 70 and 75. That \nwould be in the range of judicial confirmations during President George \nH.W. Bush's first 2 years, 70, while resting far below President \nReagan's first 2 years, 87, and pale in comparison to the 100 confirmed \nin the first 2 years of the George W. Bush administration or those \nconfirmed during President Clinton's first 2 years, 127.\n  I come before the Senate today to make a proposal to end this \nimpasse. This is a proposal the American people will understand and, I \nbelieve, support. It, too, has scriptural roots. I ask the Republican \nleadership to follow the Golden Rule with respect to these judicial \nnominations. This is not complicated. It is something we teach our \nchildren from a young age. It is a basic rule of good behavior. Do unto \nthese nominations as you would have done to the nominations of a \nRepublican President. Following this basic precept would lead to the \nconfirmation without further delay of the nominations reported without \nopposition. They can be confirmed today. If someone wishes to ask for \nrollcall votes on these nominations, tell the majority leader so that \nhe can schedule that vote without further delay. End this across the \nboard stall on judicial nominations by allowing the many \nnoncontroversial nominations to proceed without further objection, \nobstruction or delay.\n  The new tactic of objecting to consideration of noncontroversial \nnominations is an escalation of the so-called ``judge wars.'' The \nattempted justification as some kind of tit-for-tat is wrong. But my \nproposal does not depend on whether you agree with me or side with \npartisans from across the aisle. While seeking to justify ``an eye for \nan eye'' would require a look back and a factual accounting, the Golden \nRule is a rule of current and prospective behavior. I hope those on the \nother side will remember our shared values and adopt the Golden Rule \ngoing forward from this day. That would be a step toward returning to \nour Senate traditions and allow the Senate better to fulfill its \nresponsibilities to the American people and the Federal judiciary.\n  During these 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years, I scheduled 26 hearings for the \njudicial nominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee \nworked diligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama \nadministration, I have tried to maintain that same approach. The \ncommittee held its 25th hearing for President Obama's Federal circuit \nand district court nominees this week. I have not altered my approach \nand neither have Senate Democrats.\n  One thing that has changed is that we now receive the paperwork on \nthe nominations, the nominee's completed questionnaire, the \nconfidential background investigation and the American\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\nBar Association, ABA, peer review almost immediately after a nomination \nis made, allowing us to proceed to hearings more quickly. During 2001 \nand 2002, President Bush abandoned the procedure that President \nEisenhower had adopted and that had been used by President George H.W. \nBush, President Reagan and all Presidents for more than 50 years. \nInstead, President George W. Bush delayed the start of the ABA peer \nreview process until after the nomination was sent to the Senate. That \nadded weeks and months to the timeline in which hearings were able to \nbe scheduled on nominations.\n  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee midway through \nPresident Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked very hard to \nmake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the ``judge wars'' as \ntit-for-tat. Despite the fact that Senate Republicans pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nand refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed \nduring the Clinton administration, in 2001 and 2002, during the 17 \nmonths I chaired the committee during President Bush's first two years \nin office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial \nnominees.\n  By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations while \njudicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled the \npace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed vacancies to rise to \nmore than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of \ntheir strategy, Federal circuit court vacancies doubled. When Democrats \nregained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year \nin office, we turned away from these bad practices. As a result, \noverall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more \nthan 10 percent to less than four percent. During the Bush years, the \nFederal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit \ncourt vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.\n  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in \noffice. Instead, Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy they \nused during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a \nDemocratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last \nyear the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court \njudges, the lowest total in 50 years. This year we have yet to confirm \n30 Federal circuit and district judges. We are not even keeping up with \nretirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies are, again, \nover 100 and, again, more than 10 percent.\n  Regrettably, the Senate is not being allowed to consider the \nconsensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the \nJudiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President \nBush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of \nthe Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by \nthe Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 \ndays. By contrast, the average time for the 41 Federal circuit and \ndistrict and circuit court judges confirmed since President Obama took \noffice is 90 days and the average time for circuit nominees is 148 \ndays--and that disparity is increasing.\n  This vacancies crisis alarms the President of the United States. It \nalarms Supreme Court Justices. It alarms the Federal Bar Association. \nIt alarms the American Bar Association. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe President's September 30 letter, Chief Judge Lamberth's November 4 \nletter, and statements by the Federal Bar Association and American Bar \nAssociation be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is no good reason to hold up consideration for weeks \nand months of nominees reported without opposition from the Judiciary \nCommittee. I have been urging since last year that these consensus \nnominees be considered promptly and confirmed. If Senators would follow \nthe Golden Rule, that would happen without further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Council letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was orderd to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                November 15, 2010.\n     Hon.

Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: We write on behalf of the courts of the Ninth \n     Circuit. As you know, the Ninth Circuit is by far the largest \n     federal circuit in the country, encompassing the 9 western \n     states, plus the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands. Approximately one fifth of the \n     population of the United States lives within the borders of \n     the Ninth Circuit. Our case-load reflects the diversity of \n     our territory and the people that inhabit it and is heavily \n     impacted by increased immigration enforcement, drug \n     interdiction activities, prison litigation, bankruptcy and \n     environmental cases--to name just a few of the most active \n     areas.\n       In order to do our work, and serve the public as Congress \n     expects us to serve it, we need the resources to carry out \n     our mission. While there are many areas of serious need, we \n     write today to emphasize our desperate need for judges. Our \n     need in that regard has been amply documented (See attached \n     March 2009 Judicial Conference Recommendations for Additional \n     Judgeships). Courts cannot do their work if authorized \n     judicial positions remain vacant.\n       While we could certainly use more judges, and hope that \n     Congress will soon approve the additional judgeships \n     requested by the Judicial Conference, we would be greatly \n     assisted if our judicial vacancies--some of which have been \n     open for several years and declared ``judicial \n     emergencies''--were to be filled promptly. We respectfully \n     request that the Senate act on judicial nominees without \n     delay.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge, Ninth Circuit;\n         Sidney R.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and \n     Senator Sessions: I write to express my concern with the pace \n     of judicial confirmations in the United States Senate. \n     Yesterday, the Senate recessed without confirming a single \n     one of the 23 Federal judicial nominations pending on the \n     Executive Calendar. The Federal judiciary and the American \n     people it serves suffer the most from this unprecedented \n     obstruction. One in eight seats on the Federal bench sits \n     empty, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has \n     declared that many of those vacancies constitute judicial \n     emergencies. Despite the urgent and pressing need to fill\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\n     these important posts, a minority of Senators has \n     systematically and irresponsibly used procedural maneuvers to \n     block or delay confirmation votes on judicial nominees--\n     including nominees that have strong bipartisan support and \n     the most distinguished records. The minority has even been \n     blocking non-controversial nominees--a dramatic shift from \n     past practice that could cause a crisis in the judiciary.\n       The Judiciary Committee has promptly considered my judicial \n     nominees. Nonetheless, judicial confirmation rates in this \n     Congress have reached an all-time low. At this point in the \n     prior Administration (107th Congress), the Senate had \n     confirmed 61% of the President's judicial nominations. By \n     contrast, the Senate has confirmed less than half of the \n     judicial nominees it has received in my Administration. \n     Nominees in the 107th Congress waited less than a month on \n     the floor of the Senate before a vote on their confirmation. \n     The men and women whom I have nominated who have been \n     confirmed to the Courts of Appeals waited five times longer \n     and those confirmed to the District Courts waited three times \n     longer for final votes.\n       Right now, 23 judicial nominees await simple up-or-down \n     votes. All of these nominees have the strongest backing from \n     their home-state Senators--a fact that usually counsels in \n     favor of swift confirmation, rather than delay. Sixteen of \n     those men and women received unanimous support in the \n     Judiciary Committee. Nearly half of the nominees on the floor \n     were selected for seats that have gone without judges for \n     anywhere between 200 and 1,600 days. But despite these \n     compelling circumstances, and the distinguished careers led \n     by these candidates, these nominations have been blocked.\n       Judge Albert Diaz, the well-respected state court judge I \n     nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n     Circuit, has waited 245 days for an up-or-down vote--more \n     than 8 months. Before becoming a judge, Diaz served for over \n     10 years in the United States Marine Corps as an attorney and \n     military judge. If confirmed, he would be the first Hispanic \n     to sit on the Fourth Circuit. The seat to which he was \n     nominated has been declared a judicial emergency. Judge Diaz \n     has the strong support of both of North Carolina's Senators. \n     Senator Burr has publicly advocated for Judge Diaz to get a \n     final vote by the Senate. And just before the August recess, \n     Senator Hagan went to the floor of the Senate to ask for an \n     up-or-down vote for Judge Diaz. Her request was denied.\n       We are seeing in this case what we have seen in all too \n     many others: resistance to highly qualified candidates who, \n     if put to a vote, would be unanimously confirmed, or \n     confirmed with virtually no opposition. For example, Judge \n     Beverly Martin waited 132 days for a floor vote--despite \n     being strongly backed by both of Georgia's Republican \n     Senators. When the Senate finally held a vote, she was \n     confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit unanimously. Jane Stanch \n     was recently confirmed by an overwhelming majority of the \n     Senate, after waiting almost 300 days for a final vote. Even \n     District Court nominees have waited 3 or more months for \n     confirmation votes--only to be confirmed unanimously.\n       Proceeding this way will put our judiciary on a dangerous \n     course, as the Department of Justice projects that fully half \n     of the Federal judiciary will be vacant by 2020 if we \n     continue on the current pace of judicial confirmations. The \n     real harm of this political game-playing falls on the \n     American people, who turn to the courts for justice. By \n     denying these nominees a simple up-or-down vote, the \n     Republican leadership is undermining the ability of our \n     courts to deliver justice to those in need. All Americans \n     depend on having well-qualified men and women on the bench to \n     resolve important legal matters--from working mothers seeking \n     timely compensation for their employment discrimination \n     claims to communities hoping for swift punishment for \n     perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking \n     protection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.\n       As a former Senator, I have the greatest respect for the \n     Senate's role in providing advice and consent on judicial \n     nominations. If there is a genuine concern about the \n     qualifications of judicial nominees, that is a debate I \n     welcome. But the consistent refusal to move promptly to have \n     that debate, or to confirm even those nominees with broad, \n     bipartisan support, does a disservice to the greatest \n     traditions of this body and the American people it serves. In \n     the 107th Congress, the Judiciary Committee reported 100 \n     judicial nominees, and all of them were confirmed by the \n     Senate before the end of that Congress. I urge the Senate to \n     similarly consider and confirm my judicial nominees.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barack Obama.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               U.S. District Court\n\n\n                                 for the District of Columbia,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.\n     Re: Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the \n         District of Columbia.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     judges of the United States District Court for the District \n     of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the \n     vacancies that exist at our Court.\n       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four \n     vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the \n     additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M. \n     Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31, \n     2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its \n     15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this \n     situation already is being felt and will only increase over \n     time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly \n     handles includes many involving national security issues, as \n     well as other issues of national significance. A large number \n     of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time \n     and attention from each of our judges.\n       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to \n     foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep \n     up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent \n     vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.\n       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await \n     floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson) \n     have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported \n     out of Committee.\n       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's \n     vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the \n     Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us \n     continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Royce C.

Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader \n     McConnell, Chairman Leahy, and Senator Sessions: Now that the \n     Senate has concluded another historic debate and vote on a \n     nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and is about to recess for \n     its summer break, I am writing to express the American Bar \n     Association's mounting concern over the persistently high \n     number of judicial vacancies on our federal district courts \n     and courts of appeals. I urge you, upon your return to \n     Washington in September, to make the filling of judicial \n     vacancies a priority for the Administration and for the \n     Senate. As lawyers who represent our clients in federal \n     courts across this nation, members of the American Bar \n     Association know first hand that longstanding vacancies and \n     protracted delays in the nomination and confirmation process \n     do great harm to the federal judiciary and to public life.\n       Despite the confirmation of 37 Article III judges during \n     the 111th Congress, the vacancy rate has not dropped below 10 \n     percent since last August. For the past six months, the \n     vacancy rate has remained at over 11 percent, and the number \n     of vacancies has hovered around the 100 mark. The lack of \n     progress in reducing the vacancy rate this session is \n     especially worrisome in light of the number of judges who \n     have reached, or are fast approaching, retirement age: \n     eighteen judges have announced their intention to retire in \n     the next year, and several additional vacancies will no doubt \n     arise as a result of judicial elevations, deaths and \n     resignations. If the nomination and confirmation process does \n     not speed up significantly, confirmations will not even keep \n     pace with the rate of attrition. The high number of \n     vacancies, combined with the low number of confirmations, has \n     created a problem that is fast approaching crisis \n     proportions.\n       Vacancies have different effects on different courts. Those \n     courts with relatively normal caseloads per judgeship and a \n     sufficient number of active judges may be able to absorb the \n     extra workload and operate normally if vacancies are filled \n     within a reasonable time. In contrast, courts that already \n     are operating with staggering caseloads and too few \n     authorized judgeships are strained beyond capacity by \n     unfilled vacancies and are unable to keep up with the \n     workload.\n       In these jurisdictions, persistent vacancies make it \n     impossible for the remaining judges on the court to give each \n     case the time it deserves; community and business life \n     suffers because shorthanded courts have no choice but to \n     delay civil trial dockets due to the Speedy Trial Act; and \n     courts are forced to adopt time-saving procedures, some of \n     which may serve efficiency at the price of altering the \n     delivery and quality of justice over time in ways not \n     intended. The harm caused by persistent vacancies on these \n     courts may reach into the future, too: if no abatement of \n     these conditions is in sight, the specter of this kind of \n     work environment is likely to result in additional judicial \n     retirements and resignations and deter excellent attorneys \n     from seeking positions on the federal bench.\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\n       Lawyers who practice regularly in the federal courts and \n     their clients who expect timely judicial resolution of their \n     disputes are deeply concerned that the partisanship that has \n     long characterized the process and the persistently high \n     number of vacancies are creating strains that will inevitably \n     reduce the quality of our justice system and erode public \n     confidence in the independence and impartiality of our \n     federal courts. This is a result we, as a nation, can ill-\n     afford: all three branches must be robust and strong to \n     advance the important work of government.\n       We urge you to take immediate action to avert a potential \n     crisis and preserve the quality and vitality of the federal \n     judiciary, and we offer the following suggestions:\n       1. The President and the Senate should make the prompt \n     filling of federal judicial vacancies a priority. Each party \n     to the process should commit sufficient time and resources to \n     the endeavor, and resolve to work cooperatively and across \n     the political aisle to reduce the vacancy rate as quickly as \n     possible. A commitment should be made to cultivate a process \n     that is dominated by common purpose and a spirit of mutual \n     respect and bipartisan cooperation.\n       Politics and bipartisanship are not mutually exclusive. \n     Even though the judicial nomination and confirmation process \n     is political by design and gives each branch an opportunity \n     to exercise a check on the quality of the federal bench, it \n     should not serve as a battleground for other political \n     disputes. A renewed spirit of bipartisanship is essential to \n     reducing the backlog of vacancies and improving the process.\n       2. The Administration should make a concerted effort to \n     shorten the time between vacancy and nomination and to submit \n     a nomination to the Senate for every outstanding Article III \n     judicial vacancy. The Administration should make a special \n     effort to act with due diligence to nominate individuals to \n     the vacant judicial seats that the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts has classified as ``judicial \n     emergencies'' (42 now exist), based on a combination of the \n     length of time the seat has been vacant and the number of \n     weighted or adjusted case filings for that seat.\n       We commend the Administration for its commitment to engage \n     in meaningful prenomination consultation with home-state \n     senators, a concept that the ABA endorsed in 2007 as a means \n     to reduce partisanship. As a result, many nominations have \n     had the backing of both home-state senators, regardless of \n     party affiliation. Unfortunately, even though prenomination \n     consultation has increased bipartisan accord during the \n     initial phases of the process, it has not insulated nominees \n     from partisan politics on the Senate floor: senators have \n     blocked or delayed the consideration of numerous nominees who \n     have the support of their home-state senators as well as the \n     overwhelming support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       3. The Senate should give every nominee an up-or-down vote \n     within a reasonable time after the nomination is reported by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Dilatory tactics have been used repeatedly to stall Senate \n     floor consideration of judicial nominees, starting with the \n     first nomination to reach the floor for a vote. Even though \n     the Senate has confirmed 25 nominees this session, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has reported out nominees far faster than \n     the Senate has scheduled votes. As a result, the backlog of \n     nominees awaiting floor action has steadily increased over \n     the course of the session.\n       Twelve of the 21 nominees currently awaiting floor \n     consideration were approved by unanimous consent, unanimous \n     vote, or voice vote of the committee; two were approved with \n     little dissent, and only seven received significant \n     opposition. That almost two-thirds of them had no or little \n     opposition in committee, combined with the fact that many \n     prior nominees subjected to delayed floor consideration \n     ultimately were confirmed by unanimous or almost unanimous \n     vote, strongly suggests that the failure to schedule timely \n     floor votes on many pending nominees has little or nothing to \n     do with their qualifications.\n       Tactics to delay votes on nominees that are launched for \n     reasons not associated with their qualifications blatantly \n     inject politics into the process. Such tactics waste the time \n     of the Senate and increase the time a nominee is in limbo. \n     Worst of all, they needlessly deprive the federal courts of \n     the judges they sorely need.\n       Senate leaders should seek to avoid scheduling delays over \n     nominees who have bipartisan support and should discourage \n     and dissuade their colleagues from using the judicial \n     confirmation process to advance or defeat other legislative \n     objectives. If legitimate concerns are raised over a \n     nominee's qualifications for a lifetime appointment to the \n     federal bench, sufficient time should be scheduled to permit \n     the Senate to engage in full debate. The objective should not \n     be to rush consideration of nominees whose qualifications are \n     questioned, but to assure timely consideration of every \n     judicial nominee whose nomination has been approved by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee and forwarded to the Senate for a \n     confirmation vote.\n       We urge all members of the Senate to remain cognizant of \n     the central importance of a fully staffed federal judiciary \n     and to make an effort to reach across the aisle to try to \n     find constructive ways to support the judiciary and protect \n     it from excessive political zeal. We believe that a true \n     respect for the importance of the federal courts will best \n     inform each senator's decision with regard to action on \n     pending judicial nominations.\n       Our judicial system is predicated on the principles that \n     each case deserves to be evaluated on its merits, that \n     justice will be dispensed even-handedly, and that justice \n     delayed is justice denied. There may be disagreements with \n     individual decisions rendered by the federal courts, but few \n     would dispute their essential role in our system of \n     government and their impact on daily life. Congress should \n     take action to support, not undermine, the vital work of the \n     federal courts.\n       We urge the President and the Senate to take all necessary \n     steps to fill existing vacancies promptly and to restore \n     bipartisan accord to the nomination and confirmation process \n     so that the federal courts will not be deprived of the judges \n     they need to do their important work.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Carolyn B. Lamm,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Washington Watch, Oct. 2010]\n\n          October 201: Vacancy Signs at the Federal Courthouse\n\n                            (By Bruce Moyer)\n\n       The federal judicial confirmation process is at one of its \n     most dysfunctional junctures in American history, and its \n     failure to move nominees has brought about a vacancy crisis \n     in our federal courts. This is not a partisan issue with \n     shades of black and white; the breakdown in the Senate owes \n     itself as much to one party as the other. This is a national \n     issue that speaks to the country's declining appreciation for \n     its courts, the increasing corrosiveness of our politics, and \n     the rising abuse in the Senate of its procedures.\n       As the Senate departed Washington on Sept. 30 for a six-\n     week election recess, 103 federal Article III judgeships \n     stood vacant, equaling nearly one out of every eight federal \n     judgeships. The Judicial Conference says that 48 of these \n     vacant judgeships constitute ``judicial emergencies,'' \n     meaning they have been vacant for at least 18 months and are \n     in districts or circuits dealing with pressing caseloads.\n       Judicial vacancies are harmful. They prevent the courts \n     from operating at their full capacity in dispensing fair, \n     prompt justice. Vacancies mean larger dockets, longer delay, \n     and greater pressure and expense for lawyers and litigants. \n     As Slate legal columnists Dahlia Lithwick and Carl Tobias \n     recently commented, ``Crowded dockets mean longer waits for \n     cases to be heard promptly. This affects thousands of \n     ordinary Americans--plaintiffs and defendants--whose liberty, \n     safety, or job may be at stake and for whom justice may \n     arrive too late, if at all.'' Justice Anthony Kennedy said it \n     best, in comments to the Los Angeles Times: ``It's important \n     for the public to understand that the excellence of the \n     federal judiciary is at risk. If judicial excellence is cast \n     upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of law is \n     imperiled.''\n       Under the Constitution, the U.S. Senate is the sole entity \n     charged with the responsibility to ``advise and consent'' \n     upon the President's appointment of judges. Despite the \n     Founders' straightforward wishes, the judicial confirmation \n     process has grown distorted before our very eyes. Over the \n     past 30 years, the Senate has increasingly stonewalled or \n     rejected the President's judicial nominees, regardless of \n     party. Confirmation rates at 18 months into a presidency have \n     fallen from the high-water mark set in 1982 by President \n     Reagan (93 percent) to 47 percent today (the percentage of \n     President Obama's nominees who have won Senate confirmation). \n     These numbers--along with opaque, obstructionist ``secret \n     holds'' on nominations and unprecedented use of the \n     filibuster--reflect a process more like ``Advice & Dissent,'' \n     the apt title of Sarah Binder and Forrest Maltzman's recent \n     work on the struggle to shape the federal judiciary.\n       Finger pointing by the two main U.S. political parties is \n     in overdrive over how the process has devolved and who is at \n     fault. If the confirmation wars expand and increase, \n     regardless of which party takes control of the Senate, the \n     implications for the future are even more troubling. In \n     August, Assistant Attorney General Christopher H. Schroeder \n     warned an audience of Ninth Circuit judges and lawyers that \n     if the current rate of replacing retired, resigned, and \n     deceased judges continues, nearly half of the 875 federal \n     judgeships could be vacant by the end of the decade.\n       When the Senate left Washington for its election recess, it \n     abandoned its responsibility to provide an up-or-down vote on \n     16 federal judicial nominees--all of whom were favorably \n     approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with strong \n     bipartisan support. One nominee, Albert Diaz, who would be \n     the first Hispanic judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit, has waited the longest: the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee favorably reported his nomination to the \n     Senate back in January.\n       The Federal Bar Association's mission is to promote the \n     effective crafting and administration of justice and \n     jurisprudence in our federal courts. That cannot happen if \n     judgeships remain vacant at current levels. Over the past \n     year, the FBA has called upon Senate leaders of both parties \n     to hasten their work on judicial confirmations to assure that \n     nominees who have been favorably reported out of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee are assured of a prompt up-or-down vote \n     in the Senate. The association also has\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\n     encouraged the President to promptly nominate qualified \n     nominees with dispatch. FBA chapters in districts and \n     circuits with pending judicial nominees have contacted their \n     home-state senators to urge a prompt vote on their nominees. \n     This advocacy must continue.\n       Will the FBA help to make a difference? If the FBA doesn't \n     raise its voice, who will?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8121-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONVICTION OF BAHA'I LEADERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my concern \nabout the detention of seven leading members of the Baha'i community in \nIran: Mahvash Sabet, Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif \nNaeimi, Saeid Rezaie, Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm.\n  The seven leaders were arrested in 2008 and accused of espionage and \npropaganda against the state. In June, the Iranian Government sentenced \nthem to 20 years in prison, a sentence which was subsequently reduced \nto 10 years.\n  The State Department, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and \nleading human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human \nRights Watch have all expressed concern about the harsh sentence and \nthe lack of due process in these cases.\n  The seven Baha'i leaders were held for 2 years without formal charges \nand access to legal representation and they were convicted behind \nclosed doors.\n  The Senate added its voice to this case by passing a resolution \nintroduced by Senator Wyden, S. Res. 71, calling on the Government of \nIran to release the seven leaders and respect the freedom of religion \nof the Baha'i community.\n  These convictions are yet another example of the abuses suffered by \nthe Baha'i community, the largest religious minority in Iran with more \nthan 300,000 members.\n  The Baha'i are denied official recognition of their faith by the \nstate and are barred from establishing places of worship and schools. \nAccording to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, \nBaha'is cannot serve in the military and are barred from government \njobs and benefits.\n  In condemning the sentences as a violation of Iran's obligations \nunder the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton stated: ``Freedom of religion is the \nbirthright of people of all faiths.'' I could not agree more.\n  As a U.S. Senator representing approximately 30,000 Baha'i Americans \nin California, I urge the Iranian Government to release these seven \nleaders and allow the Baha'i community in Iran to practice their \nreligion freely and without fear of persecution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8121-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8121-S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the development of natural gas in the U.S. \nis vital to our energy security, environment, and economy. As we \ncontinue to craft policies affecting the development of natural gas, we \nmust ensure participants in policy crafting are above reproach.\n  U.S. natural gas supplies are abundant and will increase our Nation's \nenergy security. There is an estimated 2,000 trillion cubic feet of \nU.S. natural gas reserves found in shale gas plays across the U.S. As \ncountries around the world move aggressively to secure oil resources, \nU.S. natural gas reserves can play an important role in enhancing our \nenergy security.\n  The significant U.S. reserves of natural gas provide the opportunity \nto reshape our energy future. A recent study by the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, MIT, states that natural gas will provide an \nincreasing share of America's energy needs over the next several \ndecades, doubling its share of the energy market from 20 percent today \nto 40 percent.\n  The increase in our natural gas reserves is creating economic \nopportunities for American workers and communities around the country. \nIn 2008, natural gas companies directly employed roughly 622,000 \nAmericans and indirectly sustained almost 2.2 million additional jobs. \nThe industry contributed $385 billion to our Nation's economy in 2008 \nalone. Representing Oklahoma, I recognize the benefits of the natural \ngas industry all too well. One in seven jobs in Oklahoma is directly or \nindirectly supported by the energy industry. According to the U.S. \nEnergy Information Administration, Oklahoma ranks third in the country \nin natural gas production.\n  One of the key techniques for natural gas production is hydraulic \nfracturing. I have spoken on this floor many times over the past 2 \nyears about the value of this production method. Hydraulic fracturing, \ncoupled with horizontal drilling, has not only aided in the production \nof both oil and natural gas from more than a million wells over the \npast 60 years, production from thousands of wells is dependent on \nhydraulic fracturing. First used in 1947, hydraulic fracturing allows \npreviously inaccessible reserves of natural gas to be recovered with a \nrelatively small footprint. A mixture of pressurized water, sand and \nadditives--less than 1 percent of the overall mixture--is used to \ncreate small fissures in the shale rock which releases the natural gas, \nallowing it to flow up the wellbore to be collected.\n  As natural gas development assumes a more prominent role in our \nNation's energy supply, some Members of Congress and the administration \nare looking at ways to have the federal government regulate the natural \ngas industry. Natural gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing is \nregulated effectively at the State level. Legislation has been \nintroduced in Congress, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of \nChemicals Act of 2009, FRAC Act, to impose new Federal regulations on \nhydraulic fracturing which would only add unnecessary regulations on \nthis vital industry.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is considering how to \nconstruct its study of fracking, which was ordered last year by \nCongress after the agency's 2004 study, that declared the technology \nsafe, was criticized by some groups as being as flawed. The EPA's \nScience Advisory Board recently released a list of candidates for its \npanel to assist with the review of its Hydraulic Fracturing Study Plan. \nThis panel is to provide technical and scientific advice to the EPA as \nit crafts the study plan.\n  This is a great practice by the EPA to seek advice from knowledgeable \nexperts and sound science to develop policy. These panel members must \nbe above reproach. Sadly, several of these candidates have a troubled \nhistory, including questions about expert scientific credentials, \nerror-laden research on the issue of hydraulic fracturing, and \nquestions of objectivity based on previous research and statements \nregarding fracking.\n  One nominee is an environmental activist who also happens to be a \nscientist. A chemist by trade, she consults and advocates against \nvarious industries, including the petrochemical and natural gas \nindustries. Her activist roots color her professional judgments. In \nfact, her expert testimony was once excluded from trial. If her so-\ncalled expert judgment was inadequate for a court of law, how can it be \nadequate for our nation's top environmental agency?\n  Another nominee issued a draft report concluding that natural gas \nproduction specifically using hydraulic fracturing negates the clean \nburning attributes of natural gas. However, the report contained so \nmany errors that the author was forced to withdraw it shortly after it \nwas released.\n  It is clear that these nominees are simply opposed to natural gas \ndevelopment and have already rendered a judgment regarding hydraulic \nfracturing, which raises serious questions about their ability to \nobjectively assess scientific data on this issue and remain impartial. \nClearly, they are not impartial.\n  But more troubling are the questions raised about their scientific \ncredentials and quality of their academic research. Having testimony \nthrown out by a court of law and being forced to withdraw research on \nthis subject because of errors should disqualify an individual from \nserving on the Agency's panel of advisors.\n  EPA record for accepting comments on the nominees to assist the \nScience Advisory Board will soon close. I know that the EPA has \nreceived a wide variety of comments, and I urge the EPA Administrator \nand the Science Advisory Board to carefully consider these comments so \nthat this study may be above reproach and not be affected by anti-\nnatural gas political agendas.\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8122-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING ALLAN PURDY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Missourians, I \nwish to remember the life and achievements of Mr. Allan Purdy, a native \nof Missouri and the founding president of the National Association of \nStudent Financial Aid Administrators, NASFAA, who died at age 96 this \npast October. Mr. Purdy dedicated his life to removing financial \nbarriers to higher education and the awards and scholarships that are \nnamed after him are a testament to his hard work and dedication to this \npurpose.\n  Mr. Purdy's passion for financial aid and serving students was \nsparked by his extraordinary life experiences. He graduated from high \nschool without a nickel in 1932--the middle of the Great Depression. He \nmanaged to attend college through the National Youth Administration, a \nnewly created national work program for students. Although he only \nearned $15 a month at 25 cents an hour through the program, it was \nenough to attend the College of Agriculture at the University of \nMissouri, where he ultimately earned a graduate degree.\n  After graduating, Allan taught at Rutgers University and then joined \nthe U.S. Navy where he served as a PT boat captain during World War II. \nAfter the war, he returned to the University of Missouri, MU, to work \nas an extension horticulturist--driving across the State to help \nfarmers resolve problems with their fruit and vegetable crops. As he \ntoured the State, he met many qualified students who lacked the \nfinancial resources to attend college. He advocated grant and work aid \nfor these students to allow them to attend college. Allan was so \ndiligent at recruiting these students that he was promoted to assistant \nto the dean of the College of Agriculture. In this position, he \nrecruited students, arranged scholarships and part-time jobs for \nstudents, and helped graduates find jobs.\n  At this time, catching the attention of the MU president, Allan was \nasked to start a department in the President's Office to coordinate all \nscholarships, jobs, and loans for all students on campus. Under the \ndirection of the MU president, Allan began meeting with other aid \nadministrators in the Midwest, which led to the formation of the \nMidwest Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators in 1962. \nThe group eventually grew to become NASFAA in 1969 and was incorporated \nin 1973 as a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia and \nemphasized, above all else, the needs of students.\n  Shortly after Allan's retirement in 1979, as then-Governor of \nMissouri, it was my pleasure to appoint him to the Missouri Higher \nEducation Loan Authority, MOHELA, in 1981 where he served more than 20 \nyears. During that time he worked to implement borrower benefit \nprograms including loan forgiveness and low interest rates. The Purdy \nScholarship Fund to benefit students demonstrating the greatest \nfinancial need was also established to honor his legacy.\n  At the 2006 NASFAA National Conference in Seattle, Mr. Purdy told his \nfinancial aid colleagues, ``It has been a wonderful 40 years of service \nto students.''\n  ``It is, I'm sure, a wonderful experience to each of you when you see \nstudents that have long-since graduated and now are gray-haired, and \nthey thank you for what you have done for them over the years,'' Allan \nadded. ``That is your overtime pay. Certainly we are not in the highest \npaid profession, but I think that we have the highest rewards for the \nwork that we have done.''\n  Allan is survived by his wife Vivian and their four children, Robert, \nGeorge, Ray and Christina, and their families.\n  It is my distinct honor to remember Allan Purdy's life today. His \nlegacy of opening the doors of college to Missourians will be \nremembered by the countless lives he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8122-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CALIFORNIA MEDAL WINNERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

WILSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am honored to commemorate \nSan Diego Police Officer Christopher A. Wilson, who tragically died in \nthe line of duty on October 28, 2010 in San Diego. He was 50.\n  Throughout his 17-year career with the San Diego Police Department, \nOfficer Wilson placed duty ahead of his personal safety while \nprotecting the community in southeast San Diego.\n  Christopher Wilson was an extraordinary police officer. He trained \nmore than 50 police officers, many of whom have stated that they are \nbetter officers because of him. A past trainee declared, ``Chris was \nalways interested in making me the best officer he could.'' In addition \nto training officers, for more than 2 years Officer Wilson helped a \nfellow officer recuperate from an on-duty shooting by monitoring his \nphysical and mental health. San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne \nsaid that Officer Wilson was ``the kind of person you want in your \ndepartment, your City.''\n  In a moving tribute to a committed and caring man, more than 700 \npeople attended a candlelight vigil in the Skyline neighborhood to \nhonor Officer Wilson, demonstrating the community's admiration for this \nbrave and honorable man. More than 2,000 police officers, dignitaries, \nand community members paid tribute to Officer Wilson at his memorial \nservice on November 4, 2010.\n  Officer Wilson is survived by his mother Anne Myers, son Conner, and \ndaughter Kaylee. My thoughts and prayers are with them during this \ntragic time. I also send my deepest condolences to Officer Wilson's \ncolleagues in the San Diego Police Department who serve our community \nand protect our people every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8122-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8122-S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WAYNE NATIONAL FOREST\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, 75 years ago this November, \nOhio's first national forest was established. On November 12, 1935, 43 \nacres in the Appalachian foothills of Lawrence County became the Wayne \nNational Forest. Today, more than 240,000 acres of reclaimed and \nreforested land spanning 12 counties makeup the ``Wayne.''\n  For 75 years, rangers, foresters, and dedicated volunteers have \nworked to restore landscapes that had been abandoned or stripped bare \nby mining and logging. The early years of the Wayne corresponded with \nPresident Franklin\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal program, the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC. The \nCCC gave young people across the country work--and a hot meal--\nimproving our Nation's infrastructure and preserving our natural \nresources. The legacy of the CCC lives on in the Wayne's Shawnee and \nSnake Ridge Lookout Towers, constructed in 1939, and the Vesuvius Dam, \ncompleted in 1941 and now home to wildlife and recreational activities \non the lake.\n  With the help of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct of 2009, the Wayne National Forest is once again preparing for the \nfuture; restoring ecosystems, improving roads, and installing more than \n250 solar panels on its headquarters in Nelsonville.\n  Home to more than 300 miles of trails, the Wayne receives thousands \nof visitors and families each year who go hiking, biking, hunting, \nhorseback riding, and camping along the scenic hills and hollows of the \nforest.\n  The Wayne has also played an important role in preserving the storied \nhistory of the Adena and Hopewell Cultures in Ohio. Because the \narchaeological ruins of these mound-building cultures have been \nmaintained, a new generation of visitors will learn about the history \nof Native Americans in Ohio.\n  Our public lands, and in particular the Wayne, are part of Ohio's \nheritage and history. John F. Seiberling, a former Congressman from \nAkron and longtime conservationist said, ``We will never see the land \nas our ancestors did. But we can understand what made it beautiful and \nwhy they lived and died to preserve it. And in preserving it for future \ngenerations, we will preserve something of ourselves. If we all have an \ninterest in this land, then we all have a stake in its preservation. \nThere is no more worthwhile cause.''\n  The Wayne has strengthened the region's economy and encouraged \nresponsible stewardship of southeast Ohio's varied ecosystems and \nhabitats.\n  I congratulate and thank the rangers, staff, and supporters who for \n75 years have served as stewards of Wayne National Forest. When Thomas \nJefferson granted Ohio's statehood 207 years ago, southeastern Ohio was \nthe gateway to our nation's westward expansion--and Marietta the first \nofficial town of the newly established Northwest Territory. Wayne \nNational Forest plays a vital role in our frontier history and will \ncontinue to serve as a getaway for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who \nenjoy its beauty and embrace its role as one of Ohio's natural crown \njewels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8123-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JANE OPPENHEIMER\n\n Mr. CRAPO: Mr. President, today I honor the life of Jane Falk \nOppenheimer. I join with her family, including her 4 children, 12 \ngrandchildren and 1 great-grandchild, and her many friends in mourning \nher passing. Jane will be remembered warmly for her kindness, \nmeaningful interest, sense of humor, wisdom, spirit and commitment to \nher family and the betterment of Idaho.\n  She leaves behind a legacy of support for Idaho's arts and \nsignificant Boise institutions and organizations. Jane helped establish \nand supported the Idaho Botanical Garden and the Idaho Community \nFoundation. She also supported the Boise Philharmonic, Idaho Public \nTelevision, Idaho Shakespeare Festival, Head Start, Boise Junior \nLeague, Family Advocate Program, College of Idaho, Boise Opera Guild, \nBoise Art Museum and the Young Tennis Foundation. She was also a member \nof the Boise Garden Club, Women's Investment Club, Hillcrest Country \nClub and Arid Club. She advocated for art programs throughout Idaho \nthrough her service on the Idaho Commission on the Arts, and her \nsupport of the arts was recognized through a Governor's Award for \nLifetime Achievement in the Arts. Her patronage of the arts also \nextended to her consistent attendance at plays, concerts, art openings \nand other community events. Jane received many other awards and \nrecognitions, including Idaho Statesman Distinguished Citizen, Girl \nScout Women Leaders of Today and Tomorrow and the Boise Area Chamber of \nCommerce Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award for her outstanding \nservice.\n  Born in Boise, Jane graduated from St. Teresa's Academy, attended \nStanford University and Finch School, and worked for the Navy. Jane \nthen served in the Red Cross during World War II in Washington, DC, \nLondon and Walhampton, England. After returning from the war, Jane \nmarried Arthur Oppenheimer in 1945. They traveled the world together \nduring their wonderful more than 55-year marriage.\n  Leo J. and Helen Falk, Jane's parents, were also dedicated supporters \nof Idaho institutions. Her father assisted with the construction of the \nEgyptian Theater, the Boise Depot and the Owyhee Plaza Hotel. Helen \nassisted with the establishment of the Boise Art Gallery, known today \nas the Boise Art Museum.\n  Jane Oppenheimer's dedication, benevolence and generous spirit will \nbe greatly missed but not forgotten. Her legacy of loving and devoted \nsupport will continue to serve as an enduring example. Through her \nleadership and advocacy, more Idahoans are able to benefit from the \narts. I extend deep gratitude for her many years of great service to \nour State and Idahoans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8123-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE ON NOVEMBER 18\n\n  At 9:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5758.

A bill for the relief of Shing Ma ``Steve'' Li; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Shing Ma ``Steve'' Li. Steve Li is a Peruvian \nnational who, until his recent detention, lived in San Francisco, \nCalifornia. He was brought to the United States as a child and is now a \nstudent at City College of San Francisco hoping to become a nurse.\n  I decided to introduce a private bill on Steve's behalf because I \nbelieve his removal would be unjust before the Senate gets a chance to \nvote on the DREAM Act. It is my sincere hope that Congress will \nconsider and pass the DREAM Act before the end of this year. This \nimportant legislation would allow youngsters such as Steve Li to \ncontinue making a contribution to the United States, the country that \nthey grew up in and call home.\n  Beginning with the new session in January, all of my bills are \nreviewed and evaluated for reintroduction.\n  Each year, approximately 65,000 undocumented youth graduate from \nAmerican high schools. Most of these undocumented youth did not make a \nchoice to come to the United States; they were brought by their \nparents. Many of these young people grew up in the United States and \nhave little or no memory of the countries they came from. They are hard \nworking young people dedicated to their education or serving in the \nNation's military. They have stayed out of trouble. Some are \nvaledictorians and honor roll students. Some are community leaders and \nhave an unwavering commitment to serving the United States.\n  Steve Li is one such student.\n  Steve was only 12 years old when his parents brought him to the \nUnited States. Like many other DREAM Act eligible youngsters, Steve \ndidn't have a choice to come to the United States, he came with his \nparents.\n  Steve's parents are Chinese nationals who fled China to Peru to \nescape economic oppression and the Chinese government's policies on \nreproductive rights. From China, Steve's parents went to Peru, where he \nwas born. The family then sought asylum in the United States, which was \ndenied.\n  Steve was ordered removed along with his parents; however, according \nto his mother and himself, he was never told about the denial or his \nillegal status.\n  So, Steve didn't know he was in the United States illegally or that \nhis family had been ordered to leave. He went through all of his \nteenage years in the United States believing he was here legally.\n  This past September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents \narrived at his home early one morning in September and took him into \ncustody for removal to Peru. That is apparently when he learned about \nhis illegal status. He has remained in detention in Arizona since \nOctober 8th. Steve's parents have been ordered to leave the United \nStates and return to China. They cannot accompany their son to Peru.\n  Steve attended George Washington High School in San Francisco. While \nthere, he was enrolled in the Honor's Program. Steve was an athlete on \nthe cross country and track team. He worked for the school newspaper as \na reporter, editor, and cameraman.\n  Steve also served his high school community by providing \npresentations to other students on the risks of drinking and driving \nand sexually transmitted diseases at the wellness center at George \nWashington High School. Steve graduated high school in 2008 and \nenrolled at City College of San Francisco to pursue a career in \nnursing.\n  City College of San Francisco awarded Steve the Goldman Scholarship, \nwhich covers the cost of his tuition. Steve has continued his active \ninvolvement in his community, joining the Asian American Student \nSuccess Center and the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics \nProgram, which is a two-year outreach and educational support program.\n  This past summer, Steve attended the San Francisco State University \nSummer Science Institute, which provided a year-long internship to \nprepare him for a career in health care upon his graduation from \ncollege.\n  My staff has talked with his parents and with Steve in the detention \nfacility. It appears to me that the only positive future for Steve is \nthat he be able to finish his education and remain in this country--at \nleast until the DREAM Act is considered by the Congress. There is no \nfuture elsewhere.\n  With this in mind, I introduce this bill. It is an act of compassion \nfor one young person whose only hope is America. He knows no one, or \nhas he any roots, elsewhere.\n  Educators working with Steve have highlighted his potential for \ngiving back to the United States, while his friends and other community \nmembers contacted me about the impact his compassion and helpfulness \nhas had on his community. Enactment of the legislation I am introducing \non behalf of Steve Li will enable him to continue to remain in the \nUnited States for the time being.\n  Steve Li's case demonstrates why we need to pass the DREAM Act now \nand I am pleased that Leader Reid has announced that it will be brought \nto the floor in December. I will reevaluate this case in January.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market \n     Access and Drug Safety Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times more to fill their \n     prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n       (2) the United States is the largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n     highest prices for brand pharmaceuticals in the world;\n       (3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an \n     individual who cannot afford it;\n       (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n     prescription drugs to ensure access to safe and affordable \n     drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration will \n     provide a level of safety to American consumers that they do \n     not currently enjoy;\n       (5) American spend more than $200,000,000,000 on \n     prescription drugs every year;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office has found that the cost \n     of prescription drugs are between 35 to 55 percent less in \n     other highly-developed countries than in the United States; \n     and\n       (7) promoting competitive market pricing would both \n     contribute to health care savings and allow greater access to \n     therapy, improving health and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 503. REPEAL OF CERTAIN SECTION REGARDING IMPORTATION OF \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       Chapter VIII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 381 et seq.) is amended by striking section 804.\n\n     SEC. 504.

I ask unanimous consent that any statements relating to \nthis matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, I rise today to express my support for \npassage of the Pigford and Cobell Settlements. But before I address the \nneed to pass this legislation, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncongratulate the other side of the aisle for keeping their self imposed \nearmark ban for all of four days.\n  Much like Captain Renault in Casablanca I am sure that my colleagues \nwill be shocked, just shocked to know that there are earmarks embedded \nin the extraneous provisions that have been added to this bill. When I \nfirst heard that these water rights bills were being added to Pigford I \nassumed they simply contained agreements to settle long delayed \ndisputes over water claims with American Indian tribes. And if that \nwere indeed the case, I would offer no objection and encourage the \nspeedy adoption of this package.\n  But unfortunately that is only half the story. The reality is that \nthese bills are laden down with pork, to use a phrase I know is a \nfavorite of a few my colleagues. In fact, to single out one project in \nparticular, this package of bills will send hundreds of millions\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nof dollars to one tribe in Arizona to help them make snow at their ski \nresort, improve water flow to their casino and build fish hatcheries to \nimprove local fish production.\n  Now I am not an expert on the specifics of water rights claims in the \nWest or what it costs to build a drinking water system in east central \nArizona. To my knowledge I have never met any of the 15,000 members of \nthe White Mountain Apache Tribe, which would benefit from this funding, \nand I hold nothing against them. Perhaps these projects are all crucial \nto helping provide economic opportunities for the tribe.\n  But as a long time member of the Appropriations Committee, I do know \nan earmark when I see it. And this, my friends, is an earmark. What I \nfind particularly fascinating about this earmark is that it goes to the \nvery state whose Members of the House and Senate have been the loudest \nvoices in opposing this type of spending. Over the last few months, and \nparticularly in the days since the election, Members of the other side \nof the aisle have been tripping over themselves to take a stronger \nposition in opposition of earmarks. As I noted previously, just this \nweek the Senate Republican caucus took a position to support a complete \nban on pursuing earmarks.\n  Now that the Senate is considering directing millions of dollars to \nthe needs of their constituents, they are nowhere to be found. And I am \njust having the hardest time understanding why. Because I also recall a \nreport that two of our colleagues put together this past August on what \nthey believed to be wasteful spending from the Recovery Act.\n  In fact I have a vivid memory of how this report criticized an \neconomic development project in Vermont that gave a loan for \nimprovements at a ski area that needed to make upgrades to attract new \nbusiness. I believe this report also took to task projects that \nsupported economic activities related to casinos in Connecticut, \nPennsylvania, and Mississippi.\n  I bring this up not to rehash whether these projects are a good use \nof Federal funds, though I strongly support the Vermont project. I do \nso to recall the outrage of my colleagues over this spending on ski \nresorts and casinos and ask, where are they now?\n  Where are the so called budget hawks who rail against what they see \nas wasteful spending now that their colleagues are pushing for an \nearmark for this same purpose?\n  Where are the voices of those who have spoken so strongly against \ntargeted spending in other States, but clearly have no problem with \nthis spending now that it benefits their own constituents?\n  The hypocrisy of the situation before us would be unbelievable if was \nnot so predictable. I often advocate for projects that benefit Vermont \nwithin the budget framework that the Appropriations Committee has to \nwork with each year. I am confident that the Vermont projects I have \nhelped secure have improved our State's infrastructure, economy and \nquality of life.\n  I am proud of that work and stand by each and every project I have \nbrought back to Vermont. But I cannot remain quiet as the other side of \nthe aisle demagogues this work when it helps one area of the country \nand then works behind the scenes to slip an earmark of their own \nthrough the Senate.\n  It is my hope that before the next Congress a measure of sanity \nreturns to discussion of the Federal budget. No one is claiming that \nchanges to the budget should not be made. But the empty rhetoric \nblaming earmarks as the cause of the current budget deficits obscures \nthe real issues that need to be addressed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to first start off by thanking my \nSenate colleagues and in particular the Senate Agriculture Committee \nfor addressing a new cause of action in Federal court for those \nAfrican-American farmers who may have been discriminated against and \nwho were denied entry in the Pigford v. Glickman Consent Decree. The \nFood, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 included a provision titled \nDetermination on Merits of Pigford Claims. It gave these farmers a \nchance to have their claims heard.\n  For those that don't know, in 1997 a lawsuit was filed in the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia against the United \nStates Department of Agriculture, USDA, Pigford v. Glickman, alleging \nthat the USDA had violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act by maintaining a pattern and practice of \ndiscrimination against African-American farmers. Such pattern and \npractice delayed, denied, or otherwise frustrated the efforts of \nAfrican-American farmers to obtain loan assistance and to engage in the \nvocation of farming.\n  Because of the persistent practice of discrimination, Congress, in \nOctober 1998, passed a law tolling the statute of limitations under the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act for an additional 2 years for African-\nAmerican farmers who had been discriminated against between 1981 and \n1996 and had filed complaints with USDA prior to July 1, 1997, so that \nthey could file a civil action against USDA.\n  On April 14, 1999, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia approved a settlement and assigned four entities to facilitate \nimplementation of the claims resolution process set out in the Consent \nDecree. To participate in this process, eligible farmers initially were \nrequired to submit completed claims packages to the Consent Decree \nFacilitator by October 12, 1999. This deadline was subsequently \nextended by the Court to September 15, 2000, upon a showing of \n``extraordinary circumstances beyond [the claimant's] control.''\n  Approximately 61,000 petitions were filed after the original October \n12, 1999, deadline, but on or before the September 15, 2000, ``late-\nfiling'' deadline. Of these, only around 2,500 were permitted to \nproceed to a determination on the merits. Over 25,000 additional \npetitions were filed after the September 15, 2000 late-filing deadline \nand before the May 22, 2008, enactment of the 2008 farm bill.\n  On November 18, 2004, the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives received \nsworn testimony highlighting the inadequate notice provided to those \nwho had viable claims of discrimination against the USDA of the claims \nresolution process set out in the Consent Decree. Because of this \ninadequate notice, many potential claimants were denied participation \nin the Pigford claims resolution process as ``late-filers.''\n  Secretary Vilsack has reached a settlement agreement with the \nclaimants who filed claims after the deadline set by the court who were \ndenied a determination of the merits of their Pigford claims. The \ngovernment has an obligation to fund this settlement which is subject \nto court approval and Congress must act to provide relief for these \nclaimants quickly.\n  Today we have the opportunity to make right these past wrongs by the \nDepartment and give each individual claimant the right to tell their \nside of the story.\n  This second Pigford round is not the same as the claims adjudicated \nin Pigford 1. We've made changes to the settlement agreement that will \nenhance the Department's ability to fight fraud. We require the \nadjudicators to be a truly neutral party. We allow that neutral \nadjudicator to ask the claimant for additional documentation if he or \nshe suspects any fraud. We require the claimants' attorneys to certify \nthat there is evidentiary support for the claims. And we require the \nOffice of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office to \nevaluate the Department's internal controls and audit the process in \nadjudicating the claims.\n  I also thank John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers \nAssociation, NBFA, for his help in getting us where we are today. \nWithout his dedication to this issue, I don't think we would be passing \nthis legislation today. My hope is that the Department will work with \ngroups like NBFA to conduct outreach to the black community and \nclaimants. No one wants to see fraud in the administration of these \nclaims and stakeholder groups such as John's can be a valuable resource \nto getting that message out.\n  All these steps will help deter fraud and better protect taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Other provisions are included in this package including the Cobell \nsettlement and four Native American tribal water agreements. In a \nfiscally responsible manner, we have fully offset the entire package.\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n  The farm bill we passed 2 years ago does one thing right. It focuses \na considerable amount of resources on new and beginning farmers and \nranchers. Well, many of the Pigford claimants were in that same boat 20 \nyears ago. It's time to rectify that. We know USDA has admitted that \nthe discrimination occurred, and now we are obligated to do our best in \ngetting those that deserve it, some relief. It is time to make these \nclaimants right and move forward into a new era of civil rights at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Senate is close to passing legislation \nthat includes three water settlements as well as funding to settle the \nCobell and Pigford claims. I want to briefly discuss the Crow Tribe \nWater Rights Settlement Act, which is included in the larger bill.\n  The Crow Tribe has water related claims against the United States and \nthose claims need to be settled. While I believe it is necessary to \nsolve legitimate water claims, I want to make clear that I do not \nsupport backdoor efforts to steal water from my home state of Wyoming.\n  In the West, we know that water is worth fighting for. It is a \nprecious commodity, and there isn't enough of it to meet all of our \nState's needs. Just as other Western members work hard to protect their \nstate's water rights, Senator Barrasso and I work to protect Wyoming's \nwater rights. Some have suggested that Wyoming water users will be \nharmed by this bill. That is not the intention of the legislation. It \nis in place to settle water claims from the Crow Tribe. It is not \nintended to be a hidden effort to harm Wyoming water users.\n  Senator Barrasso worked closely with the Wyoming Attorney General's \nOffice and the Wyoming State engineer to negotiate substantial changes \nto this bill to guard against unreasonable takings of Wyoming's water. \nMy staff participated in some of the meetings where those changes were \nmade, and after numerous discussions with water experts in Wyoming and \nhere in Washington, I am convinced that this legislation will hold \nWyoming's water users harmless.\n  While I remain concerned about the cost of this legislation and the \nfact that the proponents have bundled together distinctly different \nbills, on the specific issue of protecting Wyoming's water rights, \nthere are numerous protections in the bill to ensure Wyoming's water \nusers will not be harmed if this bill becomes law. Because of that, I \nam not objecting to the bill today.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Pigford II \nsettlement pending full action by the U.S. Senate.\n  We all know that farming is a difficult occupation. The hours are \nlong, the weather unpredictable and the challenge of competing in a \nglobal marketplace intense. Tens of thousands of Black farmers have had \nto face all those normal challenges. Tragically, they have had to deal \nwith a challenge that was unique to them based solely on race. The U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture was discriminating against them.\n  More than 12 years ago Black farmers across America brought a class \naction suit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, for \nracial discrimination. The history of that discrimination is a sad one, \nand it is well documented.\n  Farmers, as do all businesses, need access to loans. They need to \nborrow money for expensive equipment and they need funding to help them \nwhen droughts strike or when markets collapse. The Congress has \nrecognized this need for decades, and we have established special loan \nprograms in the USDA to support these special needs.\n  Tragically, tens of thousands of Black farmers were the victims of \nsystemic discrimination. During the 1980s and 1990s, the average \nprocessing time for a loan application by White farmers was 30 days, \nwhile the average time for a loan application by Black farmers was 387 \ndays. That is more than 12 times longer if you are a Black farmer. This \ndiscrimination earned the USDA the regrettable nickname ``the Last \nPlantation.''\n  Black farmers finally sought justice through a class action lawsuit \nin 1997. More than 20,000 farmers initiated claims citing racial \ndiscrimination in the USDA farm loan programs.\n  Two years after the action was initiated, the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia entered a consent decree approving a class \naction settlement to compensate these farmers for years of racial \ndiscrimination by the USDA. Each farmer who could prove discrimination \nwas entitled to damages. Out of the initial 20,000 farmers, 15,000 were \nmeritorious in the claims they brought. As the legal process continued, \nadditional farmers began to join the class action and file their own \nclaims. Approximately 80,000 farmers eventually brought claims.\n  Unfortunately, many of these farmers did not know about the class \naction suit, and by the time they learned of its existence, the filing \ndeadline had passed.\n  In 2008, Congress--recognizing the injustice of stopping 80 percent \nor more of the farmers who potentially suffered at the hand of \ndiscrimination by our government--decided to take action and created a \nnew cause of action for farmers previously denied access to justice.\n  In the 2008 farm bill, with bipartisan support, Congress included \n$100 million for payments and debt relief as a down-payment to satisfy \nthe claims filed by deserving claimants denied participation in the \noriginal settlement because of timeliness issues.\n  After years of litigation and negotiation between the Department of \nJustice, which represented the USDA, and lawyers for the farmers, a \nsettlement was finally reached in February 2010. The Pigford II \nsettlement agreement will provide $1.25 billion, which is contingent on \nappropriation by Congress, to African-American farmers who can show \nthey suffered racial discrimination in USDA farm loan programs. Once \nthe money is appropriated farmers can pursue their individual claims \nthrough the same nonjudicial process used in the first case.\n  To address this funding need, President Obama included $1.15 billion \nin additional funding for his fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 \nbudget.\n  Both Chambers of Congress have worked to pass appropriations to \nfulfill the settlement agreement since February. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed funding language for the Pigford case twice; \nonce as part of the war supplemental and the other on a tax extenders \nbill.\n  I thank my colleagues for working together and reaching a settlement \non this important issue. We have provided our fellow Americans with \nredress for an injustice that occurred.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 4783), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4783\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 4783) entitled ``An Act to accelerate the income tax \n     benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of \n     victims of the earthquake in Chile, and to extend the period \n     from which such contributions for the relief of victims of \n     the earthquake in Haiti may be accelerated.'', do pass with \n     the following amendments:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Crush Video \n     Prohibition Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has a long history of prohibiting the \n     interstate sale, marketing, advertising, exchange, and \n     distribution of obscene material and speech that is integral \n     to criminal conduct.\n       (2) The Federal Government and the States have a compelling \n     interest in preventing intentional acts of extreme animal \n     cruelty.\n       (3) Each of the several States and the District of Columbia \n     criminalize intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty, such \n     as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, \n     or impaling of animals for no socially redeeming purpose.\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\n       (4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that \n     appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme \n     animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes \n     are commonly referred to as ``animal crush videos''.\n       (5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held \n     that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the \n     First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos \n     are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a \n     whole--\n       (A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex;\n       (B) are patently offensive; and\n       (C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or \n     scientific value.\n       (7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are \n     integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.\n       (8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is \n     intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive \n     for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the \n     serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The \n     primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, \n     distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the \n     animal crush video image.\n       (9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to \n     make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine \n     manner that--\n       (A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain \n     anonymous;\n       (B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the \n     jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of \n     extreme animal cruelty occurred; and\n       (C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred \n     within the statute of limitations.\n       (10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) \n     seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State \n     authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such \n     behavior.\n\n     SEC. 3. ANIMAL CRUSH VIDEOS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 48 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n``Sec. 48.

Animal crush videos.''.\n\n       (c) Severability.--If any provision of section 48 of title \n     18, United States Code (as amended by this section), or the \n     application of the provision to any person or circumstance, \n     is held to be unconstitutional, the provision and the \n     application of the provision to other persons or \n     circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 4. PAYGO COMPLIANCE.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for purposes of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     jointly submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by \n     the Chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage in the House acting first on this conference \n     report or amendments between the Houses.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate passed the Animal Crush \nVideo Prohibition Act of 2010. I thank Senators Kyl, Merkley and Burr \nfor their leadership on this important legislation, which bans the \ncreation, sale and distribution of obscene animal crush videos. We \nworked together on a bipartisan basis to ensure that the bill respects \nthe first amendment and the role of our court system, while at the same \ntime giving law enforcement a valuable and necessary tool to stop \nobscene animal cruelty.\n  Earlier this year, in United States v. Stevens, the Supreme Court \nstruck down a Federal statute banning depictions of animal cruelty \nbecause it held the statute to be overbroad and in violation of the \nfirst amendment. Animal crush videos, which can depict obscene, extreme \nacts of animal cruelty, were a primary target of that legislation.\n  Several months ago, in response to the Stevens decision, the House \noverwhelmingly passed a narrower bill banning animal crush videos on \nobscenity grounds. The Senate Judiciary Committee regularly looks at \nquestions raised by Supreme Court decisions and the first amendment, \nand the House bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for \nconsideration. The version of the bill passed today reflects a \ncarefully crafted compromise between the House and Senate that strikes \nthe right balance between the first amendment and the needs of law \nenforcement, while adhering to the separation of powers enshrined in \nour Constitution.\n  There are a few well-established exceptions to the first amendment. \nThe United States has long prohibited the interstate sale of obscene \nmaterials, and the Supreme Court recognized this exception to the first \namendment in 1957. Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing focused on the obscene nature of many animal crush videos. We \nheard testimony from experts who confirmed that many animal crush \nvideos depict extreme acts of animal cruelty which are designed to \nappeal to a specific, prurient, sexual fetish. Indeed, these animal \ncrush videos are patently offensive, lack any redeeming social value, \nand can be banned consistent with the Supreme Court's obscenity \njurisprudence. Courts and juries play an important role in determining \nwhat is obscene, and I worked hard with Senator Sessions, and the bill \nsponsors, to make sure that the law passed today respects the role of \nboth.\n  The United States also has a history of prohibiting speech that is \nintegral to criminal conduct. The acts of animal cruelty depicted in \nmany animal crush videos violate State laws, but these laws are hard to \nenforce. The animal cruelty is often committed in a clandestine manner \nthat allows the perpetrators to remain anonymous. The nature of the \nvideos makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the jurisdiction \nnecessary to prosecute the crimes. Given the severe difficulties that \nState law enforcement agencies have encountered in investigating the \nunderlying conduct, today Congress has taken an important step towards \ncombating the crimes of extreme animal cruelty that obscene animal \ncrush videos depict.\n  I have long been a champion of first amendment rights. As the son of \nVermont printers, I know firsthand that the freedom of speech is the \ncornerstone of our democracy. This is why I have worked hard to pass \nlegislation like the SPEECH Act, which protects American authors, \njournalists and publishers from foreign libel lawsuits that undermine \nthe first amendment.\n  Today's success demonstrates that Congress can work on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass legislation that is the focus of many competing \ninterests. I commend the coalition that worked hard, alongside the \nHumane Society and first amendment experts, to strike the proper \nbalance between the needs of law enforcement and the first\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\namendment, and I am pleased that, once the President signs this bill \ninto law, obscene animal crush videos will no longer threaten animal \nwelfare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/19/senate-section/article/S8204-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COPYRIGHT CLEANUP, CLARIFICATION, AND CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. REID.
