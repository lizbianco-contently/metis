Madam President, after leader remarks, we are going to be \nin a period of morning business for up to an hour. During that period \nof time, Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. \nThe Republicans will control the first half, and the majority will \ncontrol the second half.\n  Following morning business, we will proceed to the tobacco \nlegislation, H.R. 1256. Two amendments are currently pending to the \nDodd substitute amendment; that is, the Burr-Hagan substitute and a \nLieberman amendment regarding TSP. Senator Hagan will be here as soon \nas we complete morning business to offer some amendments. The \nRepublican leader and I thought it would be appropriate that Senators \nwho have amendments relating to the bill that are relevant and germane \nwould offer their amendments first, and those Senators are Hagan and \nBurr. So we want them to get whatever amendments they want to offer \nlaid down so that we can go to other matters people wish to bring up.\n  I announce that I have had, frankly, a number of conversations with \nSenators on both sides, and there are a number of important events \ntoday--this evening, I should say--so we are not going to be working \nlate tonight. I think if we go to 6 o'clock, that will probably be \nabout as far as we go. There is a funeral service for one of the \nemployees of the Senate who has worked in the Capitol for many years \nwho was killed in a car accident on Sunday. We have to make sure the \npeople who want to go to that have that opportunity. There are a number \nof other events, including something at the Vice President's residence \nthis evening. So everyone should be alerted to that.\n  I had a conversation with the Republican leader yesterday about the \nschedule for the next work period. We have 3 weeks left in this work \nperiod, and we have things we want to do. I have explained to the \nRepublican leader that we would like to do at least two appropriations \nbills. I have indicated that to Chairman Inouye, and he has conveyed \nthat to Ranking Member Cochran. We want to at least get the legislative \nbranch legislation out of the way and Homeland Security out of the way.\n  There are other things, of course, we are going to work on during \nthis work period. We have the supplemental appropriations bill that we \nneed to complete within the next couple of days. We have this tobacco \nlegislation which we need to complete. There is a tourism bill which \nwas completed and reported out of the Commerce Committee which is \nbipartisan and important. It is interesting. In every State in the \nUnion, tourism is important. It is either the No. 1, 2, or 3 most \nimportant part of the State's economy. We are going to try to complete \nthat this work period. So we have a lot of things to do.\n  The next work period, in July, where we have 5 weeks, we will have by \nthen completed, we hope, the legislative branch appropriations, and we \nwill have completed Homeland Security. We have appropriations bills we \nwant to work on. We have health care that will likely be worked on \nduring that period of time.\n  We have the DOD authorization, which is extremely important. Not only \ndoes it have the standard stuff in it that we always did, but we also \nhave to do something about military commissions. This involves the \nsituation we have with enemy combatants and\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nother people who need to be tried in military courts and who can't be \ntried, for various reasons, in civil courts. That is going to be a part \nof the DOD authorization this year, which will make it difficult. We \nhave to do that because what we have passed before was declared \nunconstitutional by the Federal courts. So we have to do that.\n  We also have to make a decision as to whether we are going to be able \nto do the Supreme Court nomination during the next work period or \nwhether that will spill over until the next period, which would be \nSeptember. I have spoken with the Republican leader about that, and he \nhas indicated he is going to be communicating with me as to what he \nthinks should be done in more detail than our brief conversation \nyesterday.\n  So the reason I am talking about this today is to alert all Senators, \nas I have, as well as Senator McConnell yesterday, that the next 5 \nweeks is going to be a unique work period in the Senate. Because of the \nmakeup of the Senate changing over the years and it becoming a place \nwhere there is an obligation people have with their families, we aren't \nable to work the long weeks we have in the past. We have plenty of work \nto do. No one is complaining that we are not working hard enough, but \nsometimes you just have to put in the time because of the procedural \nobligations we have here, procedural rules we have to follow in the \nSenate.\n  So the next work period, which is July 5 through August 7, which is 5 \nweeks, there will only be one no-vote day, and that is July 16. The \nreason for that is as I have outlined. We are going to conduct business \non Mondays and Fridays, and there will be rollcall votes on those days. \nThat is the plan.\n  I have just been advised that the no-vote day is Friday, July 17, not \nJuly 16. So everything I have said other than that is valid. July 16 is \na Thursday.\n  For example, health care--we cannot complete that most important \nlegislation by working just Tuesday through Thursday.\n  I had a chairmen's meeting yesterday. We meet every other week with \nall of the chairmen. It was clear from conversations I had with all of \nour chairmen that we are going to have to have a very long, hard work \nperiod in July. If there are questions anyone has or special \ncircumstances, they can contact either the Republican leader or me, and \nwe will be happy to take a look, but everyone is on notice that is \nwhere we are. So with respect to your scheduling on Mondays and \nFridays, be very careful because we are not going to be able to come in \nhere on Mondays at 5:30. We are going to have to have regular workdays.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask my friend before he leaves the \nfloor, what was the no-vote day in the July work period?\n  Mr. REID. July 17.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The 17th.

Madam President, one thing that unites Democrats and \nRepublicans this morning is that all of us want health care reform in \nthis country. Americans want reform that addresses the high cost of \ncare and gives everyone access to quality care. In America in 2009, \ndoing nothing is simply not an option. We must act, and we must act \ndecisively. The question is not whether to reform health care; the \nquestion is how best to reform health care.\n  Some are proposing as a reform that the government simply take over \nhealth care, but Americans have seen the government take over banks, \nthey have seen the government take over insurance companies, they have \nseen the government take over auto companies, all of that in recent \nmonths, and they are concerned about it. So as we discuss health care \nreform, it is understandable that many Americans would be equally if \nnot more concerned about a government takeover of health care.\n  Some are openly calling for this government takeover of health care, \nmaking no apologies about it. Others disguise their intentions by \narguing for a government ``option'' that we all know will really lead \nto government-run health care being the one and only option. But it \nshould be perfectly obvious to anyone who has followed government \ntakeovers in the financial sector and the auto industry that government \ncreates an unfair, not level playing field that puts other companies at \na disadvantage and only ends up hurting consumers in the end.\n  We have seen this with the insurance bailouts. When most companies \nwant to raise money, they have to show they are viable and their \nproducts and services are a worthwhile investment. That is what most \ncompanies have to go through. Bailed out insurers just have to ask for \nmore money, and the government hands it over. Apply this model to \nhealth care, and the government would be able to create the same kind \nof uneven playing field that would, in all likelihood, eventually wipe \nout competition, thus forcing millions of people off the private health \nplans they already have and which the vast majority of them very much \nlike.\n  We are also seeing the ill effects of government control in the auto \nindustry. The government has already given billions of dollars to the \nfinancing arms of Chrysler and General Motors, allowing them to offer \ninterest rates Ford and other private companies struggle to compete \nwith. This means the only major U.S. automaker that actually made the \ntough choices and didn't take bailout money is at a major disadvantage \nas it struggles to compete with government-run auto companies such as \nGM. If Ford needs money, it has to raise it at an 8-percent rate of \ninterest. If GM wants money, all it has to do is to call up the \nTreasury and ask for it. No company can compete with that.\n  This is how the government subsidizes failure and undercuts private \ncompanies, and this is how a government plan would undercut private \nhealth care plans, forcing people off the health plans they like and \nreplacing those plans with plans they like less.\n  No safeguard could prevent this from happening. Eventually, Americans \nwould be stuck with government-run health care whether they like it or \nnot. That is when the worst scenario would take shape, with Americans \nsubjected to bureaucratic hassles, hours spent on hold waiting for a \ngovernment service representative to take a call, restrictions on care, \nand, yes, lifesaving treatment and lifesaving surgeries denied or \ndelayed. Medical decisions should be made by doctors and patients, but \nonce the government is in control, politicians and bureaucrats would be \nthe ones telling people what kind of care they can have. Americans \ncould find themselves being told they are too old to qualify for a \nprocedure or that a treatment that could extend or improve their lives \nis too expensive.\n  If anybody doubts this can happen, they should consider what happened \nto Bruce Hardy.\n  Bruce was a British citizen suffering from cancer. His doctor wanted \nto prescribe a drug that was proven to delay the spread of the cancer \nand may well have extended his life. But the government bureaucrats who \nrun Britain's health care system denied treatment, saying the drug was \ntoo expensive. The British Government told Bruce his life wasn't worth \nprolonging because of what it would cost the government to buy the \ndrugs he needed. The government decided that Bruce Hardy's life wasn't \nworth it.\n  Or take the case of Shona Holmes, a Canadian citizen who was told by \nthe bureaucrats running the health care system in that country she \nwould have to wait 6 months--6 months--to see a specialist to treat her \nbrain tumor. Here is how Shona described her plight:\n\n       If I had relied on my government, I would be dead.\n\n  Shona's life was eventually saved, fortunately, because she came to \nthe United States for the care she needed. With her vision \ndeteriorating, she went to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and the doctors \nthere told her immediate surgery would be needed to prevent permanent \nvision loss and maybe even death. Meanwhile, the government-run system \nin Canada would have required more appointments and more delays. Ms. \nHolmes got the treatment she needed, when she needed it, in the United \nStates.\n  The American people want health care reform, but creating a \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nbureaucracy that denies, delays, and rations health care is not the \nreform they want. They don't want the people who brought us the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles making life-and-death decisions for them, \ntheir children, their spouses, and their parents. They don't want to \nend up like Bruce Hardy or Shona Holmes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6137-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on a very timely subject, we \nunderstand that discussions are underway on the conference report on \nthe supplemental. I think it is important to remind everybody in the \nHouse and in the Senate that, just a few weeks ago, the Senate answered \nthe question that has concerned Americans and that is this: whether the \nterrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should be transferred \nstateside to facilities that could be in or near their communities.\n  By an overwhelming vote of 90 to 6, the Senate said: No way, not \nwithout a plan. It passed the bipartisan Inouye-Inhofe amendment that \nbars the administration from transferring these terrorist detainees \ninto the United States--90 to 6.\n  This is not a change in the Senate's position. Just a few years ago, \nthe Senate, by a vote of 94 to 3, said the same thing: We should not \nmove some of the world's most dangerous terrorists out of Guantanamo's \nmodern, safe, and secure facility into our country.\n  The views of the Senate are abundantly clear. Nevertheless, it has \nbeen reported that congressional Democrats are privately considering \nthe entreaties of the White House to repudiate these very clear views \nand to allow terrorist detainees to come into the United States.\n  What has changed? What has changed in the last couple weeks?\n  The views of the American people have not changed. In fact, they are \nmore firmly opposed to this now than they were 2 months ago. Nor have \nthe dangers and difficulties of moving the detainees into the United \nStates.\n  The FBI Director, a couple weeks ago, testified about the dangers of \nholding these terrorists in the United States. Most of us are familiar \nwith the problems Alexandria, VA, experienced with the trial of just \none terrorist: security problems, transportation problems, logistical \nproblems, commercial problems and on and on. Indeed, if you want to try \nthese detainees by military commission--something I support--there is \nno better place than the $12 million modern courtroom right there at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  The administration's supporters point to Supermax as a place to house \nthese terrorists. But our colleagues from Colorado don't support moving \nthem there, nor is there anyplace in the facility to put them.\n  The Denver Post reports there is just one bed open at Supermax--just \none. That means these terrorists would have to come somewhere else, \nperhaps to a facility in your State.\n  Why in the world would Senate Democrats be considering the idea of \ngiving the administration millions of dollars for doing this, \nespecially since we still don't have a plan?\n  According to a Member of the Democratic leadership, it is because \nkeeping terrorists at Guantanamo is a ``problem politically'' for the \nadministration.\n  That is most curious. Assuming this is a political problem, with whom \ndoes the administration have it? It is not with the American people. \nThey don't want Guantanamo closed, and they certainly don't want its \ninmates transferred here. It is not with our colleagues from Colorado. \nThey don't want these detainees transferred into their State any more \nthan the rest of America does.\n  It seems like the administration's ``political problem'' is a \ndiplomatic one with the Europeans, who want the United States to accept \nsome of these dangerous terrorists before they will. It is not in the \ninterest of the United States to compromise our security to appease our \nEuropean critics.\n  Similar to most Americans, I am for keeping Guantanamo open. It is \nsafe and securely away from our civilian population. Perhaps I could be \npersuaded to change my mind if the administration comes up with a plan. \nThey have time to do that and still receive funding to execute a plan \nthrough the regular order when we take up the 2010 appropriations bills \nin a few months.\n  But we should not rush to give the administration a blank check to do \nsomething, sight unseen, that Americans overwhelmingly oppose.\n  As Senate Democrats have often said, the Senate is not a rubberstamp. \nWe should not flip-flop on our vote of a few weeks ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6137-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have given a lot of thought to this, \nand I appreciate what the leader said about health care. I am the only \npracticing physician in the Senate. We have one of our colleagues who \nis no longer practicing. But it struck me, as a physician, that what we \nshould do in health care ought to be what our patients want us to do. \nWhat is it the people--the very personal aspect of health care--would \nlike to see?\n  There is no question we have big problems in health care. There is \ndissatisfaction in the insurance side, with Medicare and Medicaid, and \nthe lack of access. But what is it we should be talking about that will \nsolve the insecurities, the problems, the concerns of the American \npeople? I wish to go through with you a little list of items I think \nindividuals in this country would agree with on how we ought to handle \nhealth care.\n  First, we ought to make sure health care is available to everybody in \nthis country and that it is affordable. We will spend, this year, $2.4 \ntrillion on health care, or 17.5 percent of our GDP. Yet we know that \nout of that $2.4 trillion, $700 billion doesn't help anybody get well \nand doesn't prevent anybody from getting sick. We now have an \nadministration that wants to spend another $1.3 trillion over the next \n10 years, or $130 billion more per year, to try to solve this problem. \nThe money is not the problem. We know, in Medicare alone, there is $70 \nbillion to $80 billion worth of fraud and in Medicaid $40 billion worth \nof fraud and that is in the government-run programs.\n\n  The second thing we ought to make sure of is that everybody can be \ncovered. We can do that with the money we have today. We can make sure \neverybody gets covered. The other thing we ought to do is make sure \neverybody who has a plan they like today can keep it. After all, health \ncare isn't about health care, it is about individuals, it is about \npersons, what they desire, what they need, and when they need it.\n  We can, in fact, fix the fraud, waste, and abuse in health care. It \nis something we can do. Not long ago, we discovered we had one \nwheelchair that had been sold multiple times by one durable medical \nequipment company in Florida, but it was never delivered, and they \ncollected $5 million from Medicare for that one wheelchair. That is \njust the tip of the iceberg of the fraud.\n  Another thing we know we need to do, and that patients want us to \ndo--because we have a government-run system for 60 percent of our \nhealth care today--is we ought to prioritize wellness and prevention. \nDo you realize Medicare doesn't pay for wellness and prevention and \nMedicaid doesn't pay for wellness and prevention? So we don't have \nwellness and prevention. What that leads to is additional chronic \ndisease, which we then will have to manage--a disease we could have \nprevented.\n  Another issue I was thinking about--especially with my patients--is \nthat\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nsome are employed and have insurance through their employer, but those \nwho are employed but don't have insurance or they own their own \nbusiness or they are self-employed, they get a totally different look \nfrom the IRS about their health expenses. If your employer pays for it, \nthere are no taxes, but if you have to pay for it or you are self-\nemployed or you have your own business, you have to take dollars, after \ntax, and pay for your health care. So one of the things we have to do \nis equalize that so everybody is treated the same under the Tax Code \nfor their health care.\n  How does that work out? Well, if your employer provides your health \ncare, you get about $2,700 worth of tax benefits a year. But if you \nprovide your health care, you get only about $100 worth of tax benefit. \nIt is ironic because it is so unfair to say you don't get the same \nbenefit under the Tax Code because you happen to either work in a place \nthat doesn't provide health insurance or you own your own business or \nyou are self-employed.\n  The other issue I thought about that my patients would want is: What \nshould we not do? What should we make sure we do not do? I think about \nmy patients, and the last thing they want is more government \ninvolvement in their health care. We heard the minority leader talk \nabout what happens in Canada when you get sick and how you have to wait \nand what happens in England when you get sick and are denied care \nbecause you are not worth it because of your age. Health care delayed, \nin the case of the lady he mentioned from Canada, is death. Health care \ndenied, as he mentioned about the gentleman from England, is death--for \nboth those individuals.\n  If you think about the government-run health care programs today, \ntalk about Indian health care, a government-run program that is so \nsubstandard nobody would embrace it. If you think about VA health \ncare--although it is improving through the years--it is still far below \nthe standards of health care in this country. Then, if you think about \nthe fraud in Medicaid and Medicare and the hoops everybody has to jump \nthrough, in terms of those two programs, I think most Americans would \nsay: Let's fix it so everybody can have what they need and let's make \nsure everybody gets covered and let's make sure we do that without \nhaving government bureaucrats deciding what, when, and how we get our \ncare.\n  The final issue is we know one of the problems we have today--besides \na recession--is this huge amount of people who are unemployed. Yet we \nalso know 72 percent of all new job creation comes from small business. \nA proposal is floating out there that we are going to tax you, through \na pay-or-play mandate, if you don't provide health insurance for your \nemployees, and you are going to pay into the government to do that. \nThat will kill job creation in this country.\n  We can fix health care. It needs to be fixed. Everybody agrees with \nthat. How we fix it is the most important issue we are going to deal \nwith in the next 2 years. The idea that we can come to a solution of \nthis in the next couple months, with the complexity we have, will \nassure us of one of two things: One is a government bureaucratic \ntakeover of health care, or a piece of legislation that will deny care, \nwhich will put somebody in between a patient and their doctor and will \neither delay care or, in fact, will raise the cost of health care.\n  As somebody who has practiced for 25 years in the field of medicine, \nobstetrics, and allergy, what I know is that we have a good health care \nsystem if we can get the government out of it and not put more \ngovernment into it. What we need is fairness in access, fairness in the \nTax Code, and allow the true American experiment to work in health care \nas we have had it work in so many other things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6138-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6138-S6140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the crucial \nissue of energy, to express real and deep concern that President \nObama's energy proposals are, pure and simple, a huge package of new \ntaxes on domestic energy production that will hurt this country and \nparticularly hurt middle-class and working-class families, and to offer \na clear alternative which is embodied in a bill I have introduced with \n14 other Senators and 30 House Members, the No Cost Stimulus Act of \n2009.\n  Energy plays a very unique and important role in our great society \nbecause energy--affordable, accessible energy--is one of the great \nequalizers in our great society. Low-cost energy provides for the \nsingle mom working two jobs to be able to drive her kids to school in \nthe morning or soccer practice on the weekend, the way a wealthy family \ncan. Low-cost energy allows for an elderly couple living on Social \nSecurity to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer, as Warren \nBuffett can.\n  In providing energy that is truly affordable and accessible to \nbusinesses and consumers, we not only grow the society, but it is even \nmore fundamental than that. It is a great equalizer. We ensure that \nthose important opportunities and comforts are available to everyone in \nour society.\n  The converse of that is also true. When Congress acts to increase the \ncost of energy or when Congress acts knowing that will be the effect, \nwe are making a decision to reduce the standard of living of middle-\nclass, working-class families and the poor. We are making a decision to \nincrease that gap, to put classes into our society and take away one of \nthose great equalizers.\n  Cheap, affordable, accessible energy is as basic as putting a roof \nover your head and food on the plate of your children. Energy keeps the \nelderly in Wisconsin warm in the winter, keeps kids in Louisiana cool \nin the very hot and very humid summer.\n  With that truth, as sure as we should supply clean drinking water to \nall Americans, we must provide reliable, affordable energy to the \npeople of our great Nation. It is our responsibility to do so in a \nnation of the people and by the people and for the people. It is \nfundamental to who we are as a people because it is a great equalizer, \nand we are a society not of classes but of one people.\n  In contrast to this, I am concerned about President Obama's energy \nproposals which across the board constitute a set of major new taxes on \ndomestically produced energy. I favor an alternative to that, the No \nCost Stimulus Act of 2009.\n  Our goal in the energy debate should be four things. It should be \nensuring affordable energy for all Americans, including middle- and \nlow-income families, keeping energy that great positive equalizer in \nour society. It should be growing the economy from our own abundant \nresources right here at home and not creating another factor that \npushes jobs out of the country to other countries. It should be to work \nvigilantly to achieve energy independence, doing more here at home. And \nNo. 4, tied directly to that, it should be about ensuring our efforts \nare consistent with our national security interests, which is, of \ncourse, more energy independence.\n  Again, the President's tax proposals are big increases on domestic \nenergy production across the board. So they work against all of those \nfour core aims that I laid out.\n  To see how that happens, we can look at history, and not that far \nback, to President Carter. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter increased \ntaxes on domestic energy production. He signed into law the Crude Oil \nWindfall Profits Tax Act. The windfall profits tax was forecasted to \nraise more than $320 billion between 1980 and 1989. But a funny thing \nhappened on the road of implementation. The reality was far different.\n  According to the CRS, the government collected only $80 billion in \ngross tax revenue, compared to that $320 billion projection. The CRS \nalso found the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing \ndomestic production, what we produce at home, by between 3 percent and \n6 percent, thereby increasing our dependence on foreign oil sources \nfrom 8 percent to 16 percent.\n  A side effect was declining, not increasing, tax collections. And \nwhile the tax raised considerable revenue in the initial years \nfollowing its enactment, those revenues declined to almost nothing as \nthat domestic energy industry went down as a direct result.\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\n  So here we are in 2009 and, unfortunately, it seems to be back to the \nfuture, a repeat of that sad experience. The Obama administration is, \nagain, proposing to increase taxes across the board in major ways on \ndomestic energy production and on domestic utilities, even in the midst \nof this serious recession. In this case, the President imagines \ndifferent results from the same policy of the 1980s, but I am afraid \nthe result will be more of the same.\n  Let's look at exactly what these energy proposals, which are just tax \nincreases, are.\n  First, a huge category of President Obama's proposals is his so-\ncalled cap-and-trade plan. Let's make no mistake. Cap and trade is a \nphrase in vogue. It has gained a lot of vogue. What it is about, again, \nis a tax on domestic utilities and domestic energy. It is a carbon tax. \nIt is an energy tax, pure and simple. You can dress it up, you can \nmuddy it up, you can try to confuse the public, but it is a tax on \nutilities, and it is a tax on energy.\n  Independent analysis by the Heritage Foundation estimates that the \neconomic impact of the Waxman-Markey bill by 2035 will be enormous and \nit will be negative: reduce aggregate gross domestic product by $7.4 \ntrillion; destroy 844,000 jobs, with peak years seeing unemployment \nrise by over 1.9 million jobs; raise electricity rates 90 percent after \nadjusting for inflation; raise gasoline prices by 74 percent after \nadjusting for inflation; raise natural gas that goes to residential \ncustomers, American families, by 55 percent; raise an average family's \nannual energy bill by $1,500. That is a $1,500 a year tax bill on \nworking-class, middle-class families. Increase the Federal debt by 29 \npercent after adjusting for inflation. That is $33,400 of additional \nFederal debt per person, again, after adjusting for inflation.\n  Some might say this is a conservative think tank, this is biased. \nThere is independent analysis, and in this case it comes from President \nObama. The President spoke very directly on the campaign trail. It was \nat a private editorial board meeting, but it was on the record, and we \nhave his direct quote that said that utility rates would skyrocket--\n``skyrocket,'' his word--and he is right.\n  In addition to his carbon tax, cap-and-trade proposals, President \nObama has other energy taxes on domestic production, right when we \nshould be increasing domestic production, increasing that bridge to the \nfuture, energy independence. He has tax proposals on domestic \nproduction that would do the opposite: $62 billion of new taxes on the \nso-called LIFO reserve through a change in accounting rules, bottom \nline, a $62 billion tax increase on domestic energy; $1 billion of new \ntaxes by increasing the amortization period to 7 years for oil and \nnatural gas production, bottom line, a billion-dollar tax increase on \ndomestic energy; $5 billion tax increase with new taxes on a \nsignificant part of domestic oil and gas production, 25 percent of oil \nproduction in the United States and 15 percent of gas; $49 billion of \nnew taxes through the repealing of the passive loss exception for oil \nand gas properties; $13 billion of new taxes by repealing section 199 \nof the manufacturers tax deduction; $175 billion of new taxes by \nforcing States into a renewable portfolio system which is particularly \ndifficult and particularly troubling for States such as Louisiana which \nhas many resources and many renewable resources but not the specific \nones demanded by that portfolio; and $17 billion of new taxes by \nreinstating the Superfund excise and income taxes--again, a package of \nenormous tax increases all on domestic energy production.\n  If you raise taxes in a major, significant way on domestic energy \nproduction, do you think that production is going to go up or go down? \nThe answer is obvious. In theory, it is going to go down. And the \nanswer is obvious, in history, in practice, it is going to go down. It \ndid go down with the Jimmy Carter windfall profits tax, which is small \ncompared to this huge onslaught of new taxes on our utility bills and \non domestic production.\n  Energy Secretary Chu has argued clearly in the past that if the \nUnited States wanted to reduce its carbon emissions, policymakers would \nhave to find a way to increase petrol prices, as he put it, to levels \nlike we see in Europe. It is not a secret. Secretary Chu is saying we \nneed to increase taxes on oil, the cost of gasoline. President Obama \nsaid on the campaign trail that we need to do a carbon tax, cap and \ntrade, that will, of course, cause utility bills to skyrocket. This is \nnot a secret.\n  Let me go back to what I think the four main goals of a sound energy \npolicy are and are these major energy tax increases doing any of it.\n  No. 1, ensuring affordable energy for all Americans, including \nmiddle- and low-income Americans. The President is doing the opposite. \nHe is taking away a great equalizer of our society. He is putting an \nenormous burden on working-class, middle-class families.\n  No. 2, growing the economy from our own abundant resources and trying \nto stop the outsourcing of jobs to other countries. The President's \nplan is doing the opposite of that. He is putting taxes on at a time of \na severe recession, and he is putting a tax on domestic energy which is \ngoing to increase the flow of jobs elsewhere.\n  No. 3, working vigilantly to achieve energy independence. It is \ncommon sense that if you dramatically increase the taxes on energy \nhere, you are going to increase energy dependence, not increase \nindependence.\n  No. 4, we need to ensure that our efforts are consistent with our \nnational security interests. We need to increase our energy \nindependence consistent with national security. Taxing energy here will \ndo exactly the opposite.\n  It is one thing to say no to bad ideas, but with that comes a \nresponsibility to lay out clear, positive alternatives that provide a \npositive answer. I have done that, working with many other colleagues, \nin introducing our No Cost Stimulus Act of 2009. Again, I introduced \nthis bill with 14 other Senators and with 30 House Members about 2 \nmonths ago.\n  As the title suggests, this bill is a comprehensive economic recovery \nbill. It is a solid energy bill that does not require borrowing more \nmoney from China or anywhere else, increasing the outflow of taxpayer \ndollars in a time of already historic deficits.\n  The No Cost Stimulus Act of 2009 can achieve a number of positive \noutcomes--again, without further indebting our kids and grandkids--and \nspecifically, it does six major things:\n  First, we can save or create more than 2 million long-term, \nsustainable, well-paying jobs.\n  Second, we can dramatically increase GDP that could exceed $10 \ntrillion over the next 30 years.\n  Third, we would reduce the cost of energy to manufacturers, all U.S. \nbusinesses, and American families, including low-income families. On \ntop of helping businesses compete internationally, that reduces the \ncost of a key input so that resources may be used on other purchases or \nemployee hiring.\n  Fourth, we would have a real, positive impact on low-income families, \nas this is the equivalent of receiving a major stimulus check. As the \nprice of energy decreases, a family may direct the extra money toward \nother needs.\n  Fifth, we can achieve these goals while not incurring huge amounts of \nnew debt to foreign governments or to anyone else, leveraged against \nour kids' and grandkids' futures.\n  Sixth, this bill will have a direct and significant impact on \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  So again, you go back to those four main goals I laid out for sound \nenergy policy. The No Cost Stimulus Act moves us toward those goals, \nunlike the President's energy tax proposals, which move us away from \nall of those goals.\n  What does the No Cost Stimulus Act do exactly? It does three big \nthings:\n  No. 1, it increases domestic production of energy. We produce more \nenergy here at home on the Outer Continental Shelf, in Alaska, and from \noil shale. We have enormous energy resources in this country. We are \nthe only country in the world that has major resources but puts 95 \npercent of them off limits. This bill would change that.\n  No. 2--and this is very important--this bill would invest in \nalternative and renewable energy. No one, including me, thinks our \nlong-term future in energy is oil and gas. We need a new alternative, \nrenewable energy future, and this bill will help build that by actually \ncreating new Federal revenue\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nthrough the royalty on energy production and devoting most of it to \nthose investments in alternative and renewable energies. Again, we do \nthis without borrowing money by establishing a renewable and \nalternative energy trust fund and putting funds from domestic \nproduction royalties into that trust fund. In doing so, we do more for \nalternative and renewable energy than President Obama's entire $800 \nbillion stimulus plan.\n  No. 3, the third big thing the No Cost Stimulus Act of 2009 does, it \nstreamlines the regulatory burden and clarifies environmental law. We \nstreamline the review process for new nuclear energy production, and we \nprevent the abuse of environmental laws, which were not meant to be \nused as a way to simply stop and block all of these projects.\n  Madam President, I wish to close as I began. Energy is a big topic, \nand ensuring affordable, reliable energy is central to the core of who \nwe are in this country because energy is a great equalizer. We are a \nsociety of equals. We have never had distinct classes. We have always \nhad great mobility. You can make it in America. If you are successful, \nyou can do anything. You are not born into a class. You are not limited \nin that way. Affordable, reliable energy is a key equalizer that \nensures that American way of life.\n  So what should energy policy be about? It should be about four \nthings:\n  No. 1, ensuring affordable energy for all Americans, particularly \nmiddle- and low-income families, so that we keep that great equalizer \nin the center of our society, in the center of our economy.\n  No. 2, it should be a way to grow the economy with our abundant \ndomestic resources, particularly as we need to get out of this serious \nrecession.\n  No. 3, good energy policy should work us toward energy independence \nso we do more here at home and we rely less on foreign sources.\n  No. 4, a good energy policy should ensure that it is consistent with \nnational security, which, of course, increasing our energy independence \nis.\n  I truly believe the No Cost Stimulus Act of 2009 achieves all four of \nthose broad goals in a very significant way. Just as clearly, President \nObama's energy tax proposals, which across the board increase the tax \nburden on utility bills, on domestic energy, on domestic energy \nproduction, move us in the opposite direction.\n  President Obama said very recently about GM, in the midst of the \nlatest GM bailout, that:\n\n       GM has been buried under an unsustainable mountain of debt, \n     and piling an irresponsibly large debt on top of the new GM \n     would mean simply repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\n  There is an old saying: What is good for GM is good for the country. \nI would like to modify that to say: What is true for GM is true for the \ncountry. So why are we piling an irresponsibly large debt on top of our \nexisting historically high levels of debt in this country? We need \nanother way. We need something like the No Cost Stimulus Act of 2009. \nWe need to learn again how to generate wealth and a healthy economy. We \nneed to refocus here at home on our abundant energy resources. And that \nis the way we can have a sound energy policy that meets those four \ncrucial goals I mentioned and allow us to work out of this severe \nrecession--not by borrowing more from the Chinese, not by spending more \ntaxpayer dollars--and it is all borrowed money right now--but focusing \nhere at home on our own resources, on our own people, on good \nsustainable jobs we can build here toward a prosperous future and \ntoward a new energy future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6140-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6140-S6150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to describe and explain \nmy amendment to H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act. The central purpose of this legislation is to give the \nFood and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts. I support the bill's goals and am an original cosponsor of \nthe Senate counterpart, S. 982.\n  Because the regulation of tobacco products under H.R. 1256 passes \nmuster under budget rules only because of the increase in tax revenues \ngenerated by one federal employee retirement program, I want to make \nsure that the overall retirement system treats federal employees \nfairly. To accomplish this, I and colleagues on the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee--Senators Collins, Akaka, and \nVoinovich--have developed this bipartisan amendment to make a number of \nmuch-needed corrections and improvements to the federal employee \nretirement program. In addition to Senators Collins, Akaka, and \nVoinovich, I would also like to thank Senators Murkowski, Mikulski, \nInouye, and Begich, who have all asked to be included as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The central purpose of our amendment is to bring justice to federal \nemployees who--because of quirks in the law, errors, and oversight--\nhave lost out on retirement benefits for which they would otherwise be \neligible. Many of the provisions of this amendment have the very strong \nsupport of federal employee unions and organizations of managers.\n  Our amendment would add back into the pending substitute amendment \nseveral of the reforms to the federal retirement system that were \nalready passed by the House in its version of H.R. 1256. In addition, \nthe amendment includes two very significant reforms to the federal \nemployee pay and retirement systems that our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee recently approved by voice vote without \ndissent.\n  I have prepared a complete written summary of these provisions, and I \nwill ask consent that it be printed in the record. Now I want to focus \non those that are most significant.\n  One of the most important reforms in our amendment would lift \nretirement penalties now experienced by long-time federal employees \nunder the Civil Service Retirement System who want to switch to part-\ntime work at the end of their careers. The amount of an employee's \nannuity is based, in part, on the highest rate of salary that the \nemployee received over a 3-year period. Because an employee's salary \nordinarily reaches its highest rate at the end of the employee's \ncareer, employees count on that end-of-career work period to help \ndetermine the amount of annuity. However, as the law now stands, \nemployees who have a substantial period of service before April 1986, \nand who now switch to part-time work at the end of their career, get \npart of their annuity determined on the basis of the amount of salary \nreceived, which, for the part-time work, is only a fraction of the rate \nof salary received. With retirement credit for part-time work so \nreduced, many employees have little incentive to stay on part-time, and \nsimply opt to retire altogether.\n  Our amendment would fix this problem by using the rate of salary, not \nthe amount of salary, for determining the entire amount of the \nemployee's annuity. This would remove the disincentive that now \ndiscourages federal employees near retirement from working on a part-\ntime basis while phasing into retirement.\n  Our amendment is not only fair to the employee, but also good for the \ngovernment, by helping to retain valuable employees who wish to phase \ndown their work but to continue offering their talent and experience to \nserve the government and to train future leaders. This is one of the \nprovisions in our amendment that was passed by the House as part of its \nversion of H.R. 1256, and this provision is also very similar to a bill \nintroduced by Senator Voinovich, S. 469, which was unanimously approved \nby the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee late last \nmonth by voice vote.\n  A second provision in our amendment would correct an injustice in \ncalculating the retirement dates and benefits for nonjudicial employees \nof the DC courts, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency \nand the DC\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nPublic Defender Service. Legislation in 1997 and 1998 converted these \nindividuals from being employees of non-federal agencies into being \nfederal employees. The converted employees were brought under the \nFederal Employees Retirement System, which essentially began \ncalculating their eligibility for retirement and the amount of their \nbenefits anew, without recognition of their previous service.\n  Some employees of these three agencies could have retired years ago \nhad they received credit for their years of service with the DC \ngovernment. Instead, they are still serving to make up for time lost \nwhen they were transferred into the federal service. One provision in \nour amendment would simply require that the time served by these \nemployees before their date of transfer from DC to federal service will \ncount towards their overall federal retirement eligibility as \n``creditable service.'' This is a fair and just correction.\n  Another important provision in our amendment will equalize the \ntreatment of participants in the old Civil Service Retirement System \nand participants in the newer Federal Employees' Retirement System. \nThis provision would allow FERS participants to apply their unused sick \nleave in determining their length of service for the purposes of \ncomputing the amount of retirement benefit--something Civil Service \nRetirement System participants are already allowed to do. This reform \nwould not only bring equity to all federal employees participating in \nthe two retirement plans. It also would help reduce the inevitable \nabsenteeism that results from the current ``use it or lose it'' policy \nfor sick leave under the FERS program.\n  Our amendment also provides relief to approximately 170 U.S. Secret \nService agents and officers who have lost out on tens of thousands of \ndollars in retirement benefits because they did not receive what they \nwere promised when hired. This provision would restore this group of \nagents and officers to the retirement system they were promised and \npaid into over 22 years ago.\n  Historically, Secret Service nonuniformed agents, like other federal \nemployees, joined the Federal Civil Service Retirement System, whereas \nuniformed officers of the Secret Service were covered under the \nDistrict of Columbia Police and Fire Retirement Plan, because their \ndivision had originally begun as an adjunct to the DC police force. \nNonuniformed agents who accrued 10 years of protection time could also \ntransfer into the DC plan, and many did so, because the DC plan is more \ngenerous and more flexible than the federal system.\n  New-hires to the Secret Service continued to be promised that they \ncould retire under the DC Metro plan up until 1987. In that year, when \nthe Federal Employee Retirement System was created to replace the older \nCSRS, the law did not permit Secret Service agents hired between the \nyears of 1984 and 1987 to opt into the DC plan, but instead required \nthem to be covered by the new federal retirement system.\n  We ask a tremendous amount from the men and women of the Secret \nService, many of whom have some of the most challenging jobs within the \nfederal government. It is not too much to expect that the federal \ngovernment abide by its promises in return. Accordingly, this amendment \nwill enable the affected Secret Service agents to convert to the DC \nMetro plan if they so choose.\n  Finally, our amendment incorporates two additional bipartisan reforms \nof the federal pay and benefits system that our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee recently approved without dissent.\n  First, the amendment incorporates a bill introduced as S. 507 by \nSenator Akaka, and cosponsored by Senators Murkowski, Inouye, and \nBegich, called the ``Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act \nof 2009.'' This legislation will bring federal employees in Hawaii, \nAlaska, and other ``nonforeign'' U.S. territories in line with federal \nemployees in the lower 48 states with regard to pay and pension. \nFederal employees in the lower 48 states receive locality pay, which is \ntaxed and counts towards employees' pensions Federal employees in \nnonforeign areas instead receive a nonforeign cost of living allowance, \nwhich is neither taxed nor counted towards pensions.\n  This puts nonforeign area employees at a substantial disadvantage \nwhen it comes time to retire. To correct this situation, the \nlegislation would move federal employees in nonforeign areas from the \nnonforeign COLA system to locality pay that would both be taxed and \ncount toward pensions. Locality pay would be phased in over a 3-year \nperiod and the nonforeign COLA would be phased out. Although all future \nemployees would be covered by the act, existing employees in nonforeign \nareas could choose to continue receiving the nonforeign COLA rather \nthan being transitioned to locality pay.\n  We have also included in this amendment a bill, S. 629, which was \nintroduced by Senator Collins and cosponsored by Senators Voinovich, \nKohl, and McCaskill, named the ``Part-Time Reemployment of Annuitants \nAct of 2009.''\n  This legislation would authorize Federal agencies to reemploy retired \nFederal employees, under certain limited conditions, without offset of \nannuity against salary. The purpose is to help agencies weather the \nupcoming wave of retirements by hiring back retirees on a limited \nbasis.\n  Under present law, most annuitants who return to work have the amount \nof their pension offset against their salary. Congress has enacted \ncertain limited exceptions to this general rule, and our amendment \nwould grant all agencies the power to hire annuitants at full salary \nand annuity if certain conditions are met.\n  The bill includes several limits intended to ensure that the \nauthority is used for the intended purpose, to fill particular staffing \ngaps and needs. A reemployed individual may not work more than a \nmaximum of 520 hours--i.e., 65 days--in the first 6 months after \nretirement, or more than 1,040 hours--i.e., 130 days--in any 12-month \nperiod, or exceed a total of 3,120 hours--i.e., 390 days--for any one \nindividual. These limits represent working at about half time.\n  Moreover, reemployed annuitants at an agency may not comprise more \nthan 2.5 percent of the agency's total workforce, and may not exceed 1 \npercent of the agency's total workforce unless the agency head submits \na written justification to OPM and Congress. The legislation would \nsunset after 5 years.\n  Federal employees, wherever they work, are a dedicated group of \npeople who are asked to make a number of sacrifices for the sake of \ntheir country.\n  Those in the Secret Service, obviously, sacrifice more, sometimes \nwith their lives. Our amendment will update and bring retirement parity \nand fairness to many federal employees. This amendment will provide a \nmeasure of justice for hundreds of thousands of public servants. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, to reiterate, I rise today to describe and explain \nand speak on behalf of the bipartisan amendment to this underlying bill \nI am proud to introduce, along with Senator Collins, Senator Akaka, and \nSenator Voinovich. The central purpose of the legislation before us, of \ncourse, is to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \nregulate tobacco products. I support the aims of the bill strongly and \nI am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Senate counterpart, S. \n982.\n  Because the regulation of tobacco products is estimated to result in \nsome reduction in tobacco excise taxes, the bill before us, H.R. 1256, \npasses muster under budget rules only because of an increase in \nrevenues generated by a change that is made in the proposal in the \nFederal Employee Retirement System. The aim of Senator Collins, Senator \nAkaka, Senator Voinovich, and myself, in proposing this amendment is to \nmake sure that while that revenue-raising change occurs, that the \noverall retirement system treats Federal employees as fairly as \npossible. So we have developed this bipartisan amendment to make a \nnumber of corrections and improvements in the existing Federal employee \nprogram.\n  In addition to the Senators I have mentioned, I also thank Senators \nMurkowski, Mikulski, Inouye, and Begich, who have also become \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The central purpose of the amendment is to bring justice to Federal \nemployees who, because of quirks in the law--frankly of errors or \noversights--have lost out on retirement benefits for which they would \notherwise be eligible.\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nMany of the provisions of this amendment have the very strong support \nof the groups representing Federal employees and managers as well. Our \namendment would add back into the pending substitute amendment several \nof the reforms to the Federal retirement system that actually were \nalready passed by the House in its version of H.R. 1256. In addition, \nthe amendment includes two very significant reforms to the Federal \nemployee pay and retirement systems that our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee recently approved by voice vote without \ndissent.\n  I should state here for the record that the committee now has very \nbroad jurisdiction which has been added to, in recent years, when we \nbecame the Homeland Security Committee, but in the original \ngovernmental affairs jurisdiction of the committee we not only have \ngeneral oversight of the activities of government, of the Federal \nGovernment, this is the committee responsible for the civil service, \nfor those who work every day to enable our Federal Government to work \nfor the citizens of our country.\n  I have a complete written summary of the provisions that are in this \namendment. I will offer it a little bit later, but now I want to focus \non a few of the most significant changes.\n  One of the most important reforms in the amendment would lift \nretirement penalties now experienced by long-time Federal employees \nunder the Civil Service Retirement System when they want to switch to \npart-time work at the end of their careers. It is very important, as we \nface a time of increasing retirement from Federal service and \nincreasing demand on Federal service. The amount of an employee's \nannuity is based in part on the highest rate of salary an employee \nreceived over a 3-year period. Although an employee's salary naturally \nreaches its highest rate at the end of an employee's career, employees \ncount on that end-of-career work period to determine the amount of \nannuity they will live on in retirement. However, as the law now \nstands, employees who have a substantial period of service before April \n1986, and who now switch to part-time work at the end of their career, \nget part of their annuity determined on the basis of the amount of \nsalary received, which, for part-time work, is only a fraction of the \nrate of salary received.\n  With retirement credit for part-time work so reduced, a lot of \nemployees have very little incentive to stay on part time when we need \nthem to do so, and they will, therefore, retire altogether.\n  Our amendment would fix this problem by using the rate of salary, not \nthe amount of salary, for determining the entire amount of the \nemployee's annuity. That would remove the disincentive to continue to \nserve that now exists.\n  A second provision in our amendment would correct an injustice in \ncalculating the retirement dates and benefits for nonjudicial employees \nof the D.C. courts, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, \nand D.C. Public Defender Service. These are fair and just corrections.\n  Another important provision in the amendment would equalize the \ntreatment of participants in the Civil Service Retirement System with \ntreatment of participants in the newer Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem. To the average American, this vocabulary is probably not too \ncomprehensible. To the millions of Federal employees, the difference \nbetween the CSRS and FERS is quite well understood and significant. The \nprovision that we have in this amendment would allow for its \nparticipants to apply their unused sick leave in determining their \nlength of service for the purposes of computing the amount of \nretirement benefits--something Civil Service Retirement System \nparticipants are already allowed to do. So that is an inequity this \namendment would eliminate.\n  The amendment also provides relief to approximately 170 U.S. Secret \nService agents and officers who have lost out on tens of thousands of \ndollars in retirement benefits because they did not receive what they \nwere promised when hired. This provision would restore this small group \nof agents and officers to the retirement system that they were promised \nand paid into over 22 years ago. We obviously ask so much of the men \nand women of the Secret Service that we should treat them fairly.\n  Finally, our amendment incorporates those two additional bipartisan \nreforms of the Federal Pay and Benefit System that our Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee recently approved without \ndissent.\n  First, the amendment incorporates a bill introduced as S. 507 by \nSenator Akaka, who I know is on the floor and I believe may speak on \nthis when I am done, cosponsored by Senators Murkowski, Inouye, and \nBegich, called the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act of \n2009. These obviously are colleagues from Alaska and Hawaii, so it has \nunique relevance there. The legislation would bring Federal employees \nin Hawaii and Alaska and other ``nonforeign'' U.S. territories in line \nwith Federal employees in the lower 48 States, as we call them, with \nregard to pay and pension. Federal employees in the lower 48 receive \nlocality pay, which is taxed and counts toward employee pensions. \nFederal employees in nonforeign areas, such as Alaska and Hawaii, \ninstead receive a nonforeign cost of living allowance, which is neither \ntaxed nor counted toward pensions.\n  This puts Federal workers in places such as Hawaii and Alaska at a \nsubstantial disadvantage when it comes to retirement. To correct this \nsituation, this legislation would remove Federal employees in \nnonforeign areas--Alaska, Hawaii, et cetera--from the nonforeign COLA \nsystem to locality pay that would both be taxed and would count toward \npensions.\n  We have also included in this amendment a bill, S. 629, which was \nintroduced by Senator Collins and cosponsored by Senators Voinovich, \nKohl, and McCaskill, which is called the Part-Time Reemployment of \nAnnuitants Act of 2009. This is relative to something I talked about \nearlier. It would authorize Federal agencies to reemploy retired \nFederal employees under certain limited conditions without offset of \nannuity against salary. In other words, we have some retired employees \nwho, after a long period of service, have built up specialized skills \nwe need and will need more and more in the years ahead, as a generation \nretires from Federal service. Yet now there is an economic disincentive \nfor those retired employees to come back part time or for limited \nperiods of time to serve the American people.\n  Under present law, most annuitants who return to work have the amount \nof their pension offset against their salary. Congress has enacted \ncertain limited exceptions to this general rule. Our amendment would \ngrant all agencies the power to hire annuitants at full salary, while \nmaintaining their full retirement benefit, if certain conditions are \nmet.\n  The bill includes several limits to ensure that this authority is \nused for the intended purpose, which is to fill particular staffing \ngaps and needs and not used to frustrate the desire of a new generation \nof Federal workers to come in. A reemployed individual may not work \nmore than a maximum of 520 hours, 65 days, in the first 6 months after \nretirement or more than 1,040 hours, 130 days, in any 12-month period \nor exceed a total of 390 days for any one individual for the entirety \nof their retirement.\n  Each of these proposals that are part of this amendment treat Federal \nemployees fairly. They correct inequities; in some cases, oversights. \nThe fact is, in many countries of the world, developed countries \nparticularly, one of the most respected professions, lines of work one \ncan go into is civil service, what we call the civil service. We are \nnot where we should be in this country. These are the people who make \nthe Federal Government work. We should treat them fairly and, in this \nunique circumstance, when we are taking some more out as a result of a \nchange in the Federal retirement system to offset the loss of excise \ntaxes on tobacco, there is some money left over which we can use to \ncorrect these inequities on Federal employees. That is why I am so \npleased this is a bipartisan amendment.\n  I hope, when it comes to a vote, it will receive overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  I thank Senator Akaka, who is an extraordinary Senator in general but \nhas been a wonderful, productive, contributing member of this committee \nand a great advocate for the most progressive\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nhuman capital management; that is, the best management of our Federal \nworkforce.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Madam President, I thank Chairman Lieberman for his leadership. He \nhas been doing a grand job in moving legislation on issues of homeland \nsecurity. I rise today to support the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act. Tobacco products kill approximately 400,000 people \neach year. The FDA must be provided with the authority to regulate \ndeadly tobacco products, limit advertising, and further restrict \nchildren's access to tobacco.\n  I commend my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his \nlong-term commitment to advancing this vital public health legislation, \nand I thank my friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for managing this \nbill. I am proud to support their efforts.\n  Included in the bill are a number of Federal retirement provisions \nthat go a long way to support retirement security and provide more \noptions for Federal employees.\n  The provisions in the managers' amendment would make four changes to \nenhance the Thrift Savings Plan. Federal employees would be \nautomatically enrolled in the TSP with the option of opting out of the \nprogram. Federal employees also will be eligible for immediate matching \nTSP contributions from their employing agency. In addition, the Thrift \nSavings Board will have the option to create a mutual fund window \nduring which employees will be able to select mutual funds that are \nappropriate for their investment needs. Finally, employees will be \nallowed to invest in a Roth IRA through the TSP.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, I also \nam proud to support my other good friend from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, in offering an amendment to support additional retirement \nsecurity and equity provisions for the Federal workforce.\n  Most important to my home State of Hawaii, the amendment provides \nneeded retirement equity to Federal employees in Hawaii, Alaska, and \nthe territories. Nearly 20,000 Federal employees in Hawaii, and another \n30,000 Federal employees in Alaska and the territories, currently \nreceive a cost of living allowance, which is not taxed and does not \ncount for retirement purposes.\n  Because of this, workers in these areas retire with significantly \nlower annuities than their counterparts in the 48 States and DC.\n  COLA rates are scheduled to go down later this year along with the \npay of these nearly 50,000 Federal employees if we do not provide this \nfix.\n  In 2007, the Office of Personnel Management offered a proposal to \ncorrect this retirement inequity. After soliciting input from all \naffected employees, I introduced the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity \nAssurance Act. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in \nOctober 2008. Unfortunately, the House did not have time to consider \nthe bill before adjournment.\n  I reintroduced this as S. 507, which is included in this amendment, \nwith Senators Murkowski, Inouye, and Begich. It is nearly identical to \nthe bill that passed the Senate last year.\n  This is a bipartisan effort to transition employees in Hawaii, \nAlaska, and the territories to the same locality pay system used in the \nrest of the United States, while protecting employees' take-home pay in \nthe process. In this current economic climate we must be careful not to \nreduce employees' pay.\n  The measure passed unanimously through committee on April 1. OPM \nrecently sent Congress a letter asking for prompt, favorable action on \nthis measure.\n  This is one of the most important issues facing Federal workers in \nHawaii, Alaska, and the territories. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis change.\n  One of the other provisions in the amendment corrects how employees' \nannuities are calculated for part-time service under the Civil Service \nRetirement System. This provision treats Federal employees under CSRS \nthe same way they are treated under the newer Federal Employee \nRetirement System. Eliminating this unnecessary disparity is a matter \nof fairness and correction.\n  Similarly, this amendment includes a provision to treat unused sick \nleave the same under the new retirement system as under the old system.\n  The Congressional Research Service recently found that FERS employees \nwithin 2 years of retirement eligibility used 25 percent more sick \nleave than CSRS employees within 2 years of retirement. OPM also found \nthat the disparity in sick leave usage costs the Federal Government \napproximately $68 million in productivity each year.\n  This solution was proposed by Federal managers who wanted additional \ntools to build a more efficient and productive workplace and to provide \nemployees with an incentive Congress should have retained years ago.\n  This amendment also will make good on the recruitment promise made to \na small group of Secret Service agents. Approximately 180 Secret \nService officers, hired during 1984 through 1986, were promised access \nto the DC retirement plan. This amendment would provide it.\n  The majority of these retirement reform provisions have the \nendorsement of all the major Federal employee groups including: the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, the National Treasury \nEmployees Union, the National Active and Retired Federal Employee \nAssociation, the Senior Executives Association, the Federal Managers \nAssociation, the Government Managers Coalition, and the list goes on.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill and the \nFederal retirement reform provisions.\n  I thank Chairman Lieberman for his support and his leadership.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous conent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act that is before us. While the bill \npurports to reduce smoking among teenagers and to regulate tobacco \nproducts, it goes far beyond these two goals.\n  This broad, sweeping legislation will further devastate the economy \nof North Carolina and the lives of many of my constituents. In my \nState, we have 12,000 tobacco farmers and 65,700 jobs tied to this \nindustry. It also generates close to $600 million annually in farm \nincome. And the economic impact of tobacco in North Carolina is $7 \nbillion. We know we are in the midst of an economic crisis, and the \nbill before us today will further impact the economy in North Carolina \nby putting thousands of people out of work and exacerbating the already \nhigh levels of unemployment throughout our State.\n  Many aspects of the bill will make it impossible for tobacco \nmanufacturers to earn a living. For example, the labeling requirements \nin the bill will present a burdensome and costly obstacle for many of \nthe smaller tobacco manufacturers, as will the marketing and \nadvertising restrictions in this bill.\n  But I am also concerned that the bill will allow the FDA to develop \nstandards for tobacco products for which technology now may not exist. \nFor example, the bill requires the FDA to establish standards for the \nreduction or elimination of certain components, including smoke \ncomponents. The problem is that many of these components are naturally \nfound in the tobacco leaf and technology may not be available to \nextract these natural--they are not artificial--components. Allowing \nthe FDA to develop unattainable standards will put farmers in an \noutright impossible position--again, hurting generation-old families \nand businesses in North Carolina.\n  But let me make it clear that the bill is going to make it more \ndifficult for\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\ndomestic tobacco manufacturers to compete with foreign tobacco \nmanufacturers who are not going to be forced by the FDA to abide by the \nsame standards as our domestic manufacturers.\n  For example, the bill requires that tobacco products be tested. I \nwant to offer an amendment that is going to require that this testing \nbe done in a laboratory in the United States because it is hard to \nfathom that the FDA is going to be allowed into foreign manufacturing \nfacilities.\n  I believe we need to be cognizant of the burdens these new standards \nwill impose on our domestic tobacco manufacturers in terms of greater \ncosts to implement the reporting, testing, and labeling requirements. \nAnd we have to ensure that these costs are not going to put our \ndomestic manufacturers at a total disadvantage with foreign \ncompetitors.\n  The bottom line is that in North Carolina, people are working hard to \nmake a living. Some 65,000 work in this industry, and 12,000 work on \nour wonderful tobacco farms. In this economic downturn, I do not think \nnow is the time to pass a bill that is going to disproportionately \nimpact so many people in my State.\n  I have three amendments I wish to discuss at this point. I understand \nthe majority leader is working on an agreement with the Republican \nleader so that these amendments will be called up at a later date.\n  The first amendment I wish to discuss is amendment No. 1249, \nrequiring that the technology exist before the FDA can develop \nstandards. This is an amendment I wish to have serious consideration \ngiven.\n  This amendment, No. 1249, simply clarifies that the FDA cannot \nestablish technological standards until they have determined that the \ntechnology is available to meet that particular standard.\n  The bill does not limit the FDA's authority to reduce or ban \ncompounds found naturally in tobacco leaf. Rather, this bill gives the \nFDA the authority to require the removal of harmful components from \ntobacco products, including components that are native to the tobacco \nleaf. Because of this, many of the new requirements will only be \nachievable through dramatic changes in tobacco farming operations and \ncould affect the growing and curing of the actual tobacco leaf. As \nsuch, this bill allows the FDA to establish standards on tobacco \nproducts that may not be achievable with the technology that exists. \nWhile the bill does include language that would require the FDA to \nconsider technical achievability, it does not go far enough to ensure \nthat the technology does, in fact, exist.\n  My amendment would require the FDA to actually establish that the \ntechnology is available before it sets the standards. This approach is \nsimilar to the standards the EPA must meet to implement environmental \nlaws. I believe if we are going to put 65,700 jobs on the line in North \nCarolina, we certainly have to ensure that the technology is available \nto give those people and employers and employees a chance to adhere to \nthe FDA standards.\n  I urge support of this amendment.\n  Madam President, I also wish to discuss amendment No. 1253, \ndisallowing FDA regulation of the actual tobacco farmer.\n  This amendment would clarify that the FDA does not have the authority \nto regulate the production of tobacco or a farmer who produces tobacco, \neither directly or indirectly. The underlying bill does state that the \nFDA does not have authority over the tobacco leaf that is not in the \npossession of the manufacturer and that the FDA does not have the \nauthority to enter onto a farm owned by a producer of tobacco. But the \nbill provides an exception to allow the FDA to regulate activities by a \nmanufacturer that affects the actual production. This is a backdoor way \nof getting at the tobacco grower because nearly every activity by the \ntobacco manufacturer affects the production of the tobacco leaf.\n  Further, the underlying bill would allow the FDA to indirectly place \nmandates on a tobacco producer by placing mandates on a manufacturer. \nIt is unrealistic to expect that mandating standards on tobacco \nmanufacturers will not trickle down to drastically impact the actual \nfarmer and their operations. I believe the exception in this bill is \ntoo broad.\n  My amendment drops this exception. This amendment is critical to \nensure that as new standards and regulations are imposed on tobacco \nmanufacturers, farmers and their families will be protected.\n  Again, there are 12,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina who are on \nthe line. Their livelihoods are on the line. We need to be sure they \nare able to have a playing field they can work with.\n  I urge support of this amendment.\n  Madam President, the third amendment I want to discuss is amendment \nNo. 1252, which has to do with testing in U.S. laboratories.\n  This bill before us today requires foreign-grown tobacco to meet the \nsame standards applied to domestically grown tobacco. But the problem \nis, the bill does not contain language suggesting how the FDA is going \nto enforce this. I sincerely doubt we will find any foreign tobacco \nmanufacturers willing to invite the FDA into their companies to inspect \nand test their tobacco products. And I doubt we will find many foreign \ntesting facilities that are willing to submit to U.S. standards.\n  My amendment addresses this concern by requiring, simply, that any \ntesting of tobacco products required in this bill be conducted in a \nU.S. laboratory. Undoubtedly, the FDA is going to have a difficult time \nregulating products coming in from overseas. We do not have to look \nvery far into FDA's past to figure that out. The solution to this \nproblem is to require tobacco products intended for domestic \nconsumption to be, simply, tested in our country.\n  This requirement would help ensure that domestic tobacco \nmanufacturers are not put at a competitive disadvantage to foreign \nmanufacturers, and that foreign manufacturers do not get preferential \ntreatment because domestic manufacturers would be subject to stricter \ntesting requirements. It would also help to ensure that foreign \nmanufacturers are not simply dumping unsafe products into the U.S. \nmarket.\n  In this time of economic uncertainty, I think we have to do what we \ncan to protect and create American jobs. Requiring tobacco products to \nbe tested in the United States would certainly help keep those jobs \nhere at home.\n  Once again, I urge support and consideration of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, later this morning, today, we will go back on the \ntobacco FDA bill. As one who has tried to educate Members on why this \nis a flawed bill, let me state I am fighting an uphill battle. I have \nbeen all week.\n  I wish to thank my friends and colleagues who have come to the floor \nover the last days to support their belief that this is misguided, not \nthe regulation, but the fact that we are concentrating this in the Food \nand Drug Administration, an agency that has the trust and confidence of \nthe American people that the gold standard of proving safety and \nefficacy for all drugs, devices, biologics, and cosmetics, and food \nsafety is their No. 1 mission. But my colleagues know this has been an \nuphill fight, too. I have tried over the course of those days to \nhighlight for the American public why it is bad policy. I have \nhighlighted portions of the bill that I thought were flawed. I haven't \ncome out and said this is the wrong thing, even though, let me remind \nmy colleagues, this is the current flowchart for the Federal regulation \nof tobacco before we do anything. So for Members who come and say this \nindustry is underregulated, let me remind them it is the Department of \nTransportation, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of \nCommerce, the\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nDepartment of Justice, the Office of the President, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department \nof Labor, General Services Administration, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Agriculture, \nEnvironmental Protection, U.S. Postal, and the Department of Defense. \nNow we are going to take all of those areas of Federal regulation and \nwe are going to condense them all into the Food and Drug \nAdministration, which has a mission statement of proving the safety and \nefficacy of every product over which they have jurisdiction.\n\n  Twenty-five percent of the U.S. economy is currently regulated by the \nFood and Drug Administration. Americans go to bed at night after taking \npills prescribed by a doctor and filled by a pharmacist with the \ncomfort of knowing they have been approved to be safe and effective. \nThrough this bill, we are going to dump on the Food and Drug \nAdministration a product that is not safe and it is certainly not \neffective.\n  I have tried to point out the flaws. Heck, I have tried to point out \nthe good things in the bill. I haven't been one-sided on it. But every \ntime one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle has come to \nspeak, we have either seen charts that are 10 years old or data that is \n10 years old. We have seen products that they have painted in a light \nthat didn't even exist 10 years ago. I haven't heard a single question \nI have asked in this debate answered by the other side or even their \nopinion of what is wrong with the substitute. It has all been rhetoric.\n  I wish to share a story with my colleagues. This story is a news \nreport. It was a report CNN ran on a product that is new to the market. \nIt is called Camel Orbs. It is not a cigarette, and it is really not \nsmokeless tobacco; it is a dissolvable tablet.\n  As I pointed out to my colleagues yesterday when I showed them the \nchart for continuum of risk, nonfiltered cigarettes have a 100-percent \nrisk factor and filtered cigarettes have a 95-percent risk factor. As \nyou introduce new products into the marketplace that allow individuals \nto move from cigarettes to other products, you reduce the risk. You \nreduce the risk of death and disease, and that is one of the three \nobjectives of tobacco legislation. Youth usage should go down. Death \nand disease should be reduced from the standpoint of risk.\n  Let me come all the way over here on the chart to dissolvable \ntobacco. The risk is 2 percent. To bring these to market is to reduce \nthe risk from 100 percent to 2 percent--98 percent better.\n  CNN ran this article on Orbs. It is a smokeless product, but I will \nget into that in a few minutes. For now, what you need to know is Orbs \nfalls under the same age restrictions all tobacco products do. That \nmeans it contains no cartoon images. It must be shelved behind the \ncounter where it is out of reach of children. Heck, it is out of reach \nof adults. They have to physically ask for the product. By the way, you \nmust show photo ID to buy tobacco products today. Let me say that \nagain. You must show a photo ID to purchase tobacco products.\n  When CNN did their story, take a guess on the angle they took. They \nlabeled it as candy--candy--even though it is not candy flavored. They \nsaid it was candy. They didn't mention death or disease. You would \nthink a story on tobacco would lead with that. I haven't been shy to \ncome to the floor and say that is the result of tobacco usage. But they \ndidn't even go to death and disease. No, they said it was candy. That \nis how they labeled it.\n  Even though they mischaracterized the product and took people down \nthe path they wanted to go, that wasn't the bad news of this story. The \nbad part of the story was they took tins of the product and they \nactually placed them in the candy aisle at the convenience store, right \nthere beside the Reese's Cups and the chewing gum. Then they took \nfootage of a young boy, I think, reaching over and picking up one of \nthe Camel Orbs, even though this is highly illegal. Even though the \nconvenience store could be prosecuted, and therefore they don't put \ntobacco products in the candy section, still CNN wanted to make their \npoint. What a better way to make the point than to stage what the \npicture was. Let me say that again. What a better way to make the point \nthan to stage that every retailer in the world out there is putting \nOrbs, a tobacco product, in its candy section. They portrayed Reynolds \nAmerica as being deceptive and luring children. No candy. It is not \ngoing in the candy section. It is in the tobacco section where \nsmokeless and stick smoke products are.\n  That is why it is so difficult. That is why the job I am on a quest \nfor is an uphill battle. It is because nobody on that side wants to \ncome down and talk about the policy.\n  The bill we are considering was written 10 years ago. No wonder we \nare using 10-year-old charts and 10-year-old statistics. The truth is, \nif you look at the statistics today, if you want to address death and \ndisease, then accept the fact that there has to be an opportunity to \nreduce the risk. But what my colleagues need to know is that H.R. 1256 \ngives the FDA full jurisdiction over tobacco products, and it takes \nthis category right here and it locks it in. It cements it because it \ngrandfathers FDA from ever doing anything on the existing products that \nare in the marketplace: filtered cigarettes and nonfiltered cigarettes. \nFDA is forbidden from changing anything. The products that were sold \ncontinue to be sold. No new products can be sold.\n  They say there is a pathway for these products to come to market. It \nis a three-pronged test they have to meet. I won't dwell on the first \ntwo prongs. Let me dwell on the third one. The third one is this: You \nhave to prove that people who don't use tobacco products aren't likely, \nwhen this new product is introduced, to actually use this product. But \nthe way the bill is crafted says this: You can't communicate with the \npublic unless you have an approved product. So I ask my colleagues, if \nyou can't communicate with the American people to find out whether they \nare likely to buy a product that is new to the market until that \nproduct is actually approved, then how can you fill out an application \nand make the claim that the American people aren't likely to use that \nproduct when they don't use tobacco products? So it is disingenuous to \nsuggest that there is a pathway for reduced-risk products when, under \nthe construction you make anybody go through, you can't possibly make \nthe claim they ask you to make because you can't communicate with non-\ntobacco users as to whether this product would be something they would \nchoose to use. So any claim based upon that, that this is a bill which \naddresses death and disease, is disingenuous at best because what it \ndoes is it locks this category. It cements those people who currently \nuse smoke products--cigarettes--the 19.8 percent of the American people \nwho currently smoke.\n  So far in this debate, I have seen charts, like everybody else, that \nwould make your skin crawl and I have heard stats that would make your \nhead spin. I even heard Senator Sanders come to the floor yesterday and \nsay tobacco manufacturers want to get you addicted to heroin. I think \nhe misspoke, but I have to tell my colleagues I am not absolutely \npositive of that.\n  All of this follows the same conclusion: Under H.R. 1256, which is \nthe base bill, the sponsors claim that the FDA will stop everything, \nthat all of this will go away. And let me concede for a minute that \nmaybe they are right, then they would have to concede that I am right--\nwith the exception of locking this product in forever. If you lock that \nproduct in forever, then you can't make the claim that you are reducing \ndeath and disease.\n  I think, as I have gone through this debate and pointed out that when \nyou look at the CDC study of 50 States and you look at the percentage \nof smoking prevalence in our youth, what you find is that in 48 States \nout of 50, the prevalence of marijuana usage is higher than the \nprevalence of smoking. Let me say that again. In 48 out of the 50 \nStates, the prevalence of marijuana use is higher than the prevalence \nof smoking. One would conclude from that, since marijuana is illegal--\nit is not age-tested; it is illegal--that the usage prevalence among \nyouth would be zero. Well, the American people aren't that foolish. \nThey realize nothing goes to zero. But they also realize it is foolish \nto suggest that if you concentrate tobacco jurisdiction at the FDA, the \nsmoking prevalence is going to go below that of marijuana because \nmarijuana is illegal.\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\n  The fact is, putting tobacco regulation at the FDA is not going to \nhave any impact on youth usage. What is going to have an impact on it? \nActually taking the master settlement dollars from 1998, the $280 \nbillion the tobacco industry committed to the States, all 50 of them, \nfor two things: one, to defray their health care costs, and two, to \nfund the programs of cessation to get people to quit smoking and fund \nthe programs to make sure children never take it up. But as I pointed \nout, we have some States that, when the CDC annually makes its \nrecommendations, spend as little as 3.7 percent of what the CDC told \nthem they needed to spend of this tobacco money to make sure kids got \nan educational message: ``Do not smoke. It kills.'' Now we are blaming \nit on the fact that they are not regulated enough today and that we can \nconcentrate this under one Federal agency, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and by some magical, mythical thing that happens, youth \nprevalence of smoking is going to go down. No. It is going to go down \nwhen States take the money the tobacco industry gave them and they \nactually use it to reduce the youth usage, to make sure they never take \nup tobacco products, to make sure people switch from smoking products \nto some other form that has a better effect on death or disease.\n  I would love to say that my State of North Carolina devotes 100 \npercent of what the CDC recommends to use on cessation and youth \neducation, but we only spend 17.3 percent of what the CDC recommended \nof the money we got. When you look at all of the States, though, 17 \npercent is pretty good. I don't know whether it was used in other \nStates for sidewalks or for greenways. I know one thing for certain: It \ndidn't go to try to educate young people in this country not to use \ntobacco products. If we want to get the youth usage down, then we have \nto use the tools we know work; that is, education.\n  I have listened to my colleagues come to the floor for weeks and make \nunbelievable statements. All of this has followed the same conclusion: \nFDA will stop all of this and FDA will put the evil tobacco out of the \nhands of kids. I think I have made a pretty good case that it is not \ngoing to happen, not with this legislation. The sad reality is, maybe \nCongress could pass a bill that does all that. That is why Senator \nHagan and I have offered a substitute. That substitute will be debated \nover the first half of this afternoon, and every Member will have an \nopportunity before the afternoon is over to vote on that substitute.\n  I encourage all Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to read the \nbill. You will find that it provides all the regulation in H.R. 1256, \nand more. The base bill limits print advertising to black-and-white \nads. What does our substitute do? It eliminates print advertising. That \nmagazine that mom buys that a 14- or 16-year-old daughter may like to \nlook at in the afternoon--under our substitute, they cannot advertise \nthere anymore. Under H.R. 1256, they are allowed to advertise, but in \nblack and white. In some way, they believe kids cannot read in black \nand white, they can only read in color. That probably tells you more \nabout how misguided the legislation is. It is not solving the \nproblems--death, disease, and usage. The tools are in place. We can \nreinforce them in a more effective way. That is what the substitute \namendment, I believe, will do.\n  My friend from Connecticut yesterday stated that I was misguided in \nmy belief that the FDA was not the right agency to regulate tobacco. He \nsaid the FDA was the only agency in America that had the scientific \nexpertise to do the job. I only have one question: Does the FDA have \nthe expertise to make tobacco safe? Again, does it have the expertise \nto make tobacco safe? I think the answer is, no, it doesn't. Therefore, \nit doesn't meet the mission statement of safety and efficacy. But that \nis what they are vested to do. That is what the American people believe \nthe FDA accomplishes. To suggest that we would regulate a product that \ndoesn't meet that threshold is, to some degree, disingenuous to the \nAmerican people.\n  My friend from Connecticut also pointed out that my downplay of CBO's \nestimate on smoking reduction was misplaced. He said that while I kept \nusing the 2-percent figure--which is all the population over 10 years--\nand CBO had estimated that if we pass the bill, we will reduce smoking \nby 2 percent over 10 years--that was 900,000 fewer smokers over 10 \nyears, and that number was impressive. I agree that it is impressive. I \nthink he said there would be tremendous health care savings with \n900,000 fewer smokers. I am not sure if Senator Dodd heard the \nstatistics I gave that were the result of the CDC study. I said \nnumerous times that the CDC said that if we do nothing, there is a \nreduction in smoking of between 2 and 4 percent per year--not over 10 \nyears, but per year.\n  I ask my friend from Connecticut, what is more impressive, 900,000 or \n9 million fewer smokers? By doing nothing, as CDC has said, we \neliminate 9 million smokers. By passing this legislation, CBO says we \neliminate 900,000 smokers. Nine million fewer smokers is what we would \nhave if we pass the substitute, but it is not what we would have if we \npass the base bill. I ask my friend from Connecticut to truly think \nabout the health savings realized without passing the base bill and \nrealize that, with the substitute, we might actually get to more than 9 \nmillion.\n  My colleague went on to say that I purposely ignore CBO's estimate \nthat youth smoking rates will reduce by 11 percent over the next 10 \nyears under the bill. That is the CBO projection.\n  Obviously, he didn't hear me earlier in the morning on this issue. I \nthink it is great that smoking rates would decline by 11 percent over \nthe life of the bill. I think it is much better that they would reduce \n16 percent if, in fact, the bill weren't enacted. That is what the CDC \nsays--16 percent if you do nothing, and 11 percent if you pass H.R. \n1256.\n  We are not saving lives with this bill. We are not reducing youth \nusage. If you want to save lives, you need to follow where Senator \nHagan and I are and create a harm reduction center--one that will \npromote harm reduction products.\n  If we go back to the continuum of risk chart, if you look at the 100 \npercent risky and 90 percent risky, it is hard to believe you reduce \ndeath and disease. The only way to do that is if you get people to give \nup these products and you make available products that are on this \nchart, but also some products that are not on this chart. In the \nabsence of doing that, there is no way you can claim that you have \nactually affected death, disease, or the cost of health care.\n  I listened to my friend from Oregon make statement after statement \nabout those dissolvable tobacco products that I pointed out in the CNN \nexpose on tobacco. He repeatedly called it candy, also, even though you \ncannot buy it unless you are 18, and it cannot be put in the candy \nsection--unless you are CNN and you are doing a story. He said the \npackaging was intentionally shaped like a cell phone to attract kids. \nIf a cell phone doesn't work, children don't want it, let me assure \nyou. But I will make the pledge to him today that if he will offer an \namendment to outlaw any packaging that looks like a cell phone, I will \ncosponsor it with him. If he were right, I think every manufacturer of \nanything in the United States would make it look like a cell phone \ntoday, if it were that effective.\n  My friend went on to call Camel Orbs dangerous. He had no scientific \nbasis for that claim. He quoted an 8-year-old Surgeon General warning \non smokeless tobacco that said it caused cancer, but the last time I \nchecked, Camel Orbs didn't exist back then. He said that I called harm \nreduction products, such as Camel Orbs, safe.\n  I have been on the floor 4 days, and I spoke for 2 hours 37 minutes \nyesterday. I might have slipped, but I don't believe I have ever \nreferred to any tobacco product as ``safe.'' If I did, let me retract \nit. I have frequently said there are products that are ``less \nharmful.'' I have constantly described and made the point that if you \ndon't move people from cigarettes to other tobacco products that allow \nthem to make that transition, you will not reduce death and disease.\n  I don't think tobacco is safe, but I do believe there are products \nthat are safer than smoking. I believe that for adults who choose to \nuse tobacco products, they should have every option available to make \nsure that that product is something they can access. Compared to \nsmoking, they do reduce death and disease.\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\n  Camel Orbs and Sticks represent a 99-percent reduction in death and \ndisease associated with tobacco use compared to cigarettes. They don't \ncause lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, emphysema, or COPD.\n  The American Association of Public Health Physicians states that \nthose Orbs are the most effective way to fight death and disease \nassociated with current tobacco users. Yes, much to my amazement, the \nAmerican Association of Public Health Physicians came out and endorsed \nthe substitute to H.R. 1256. Again, yesterday, the Association of \nPublic Health Physicians endorsed the substitute amendment to this \nbill.\n  Unlike my friend from Oregon, I have the science to back up my claim. \nI have the studies from Sweden, and I have looked at the documented \nevidence. Alternative tobacco products work in harm reduction. I will \ntell you what doesn't work--current cessation programs, especially the \nones that are not funded in that money that was supplied to the States. \nThe current cessation programs don't work; they have a 95-percent \nfailure rate. So 95 percent of the people return to smoking.\n  Why in the world would we continue to support that as a pathway for \nreducing death and disease? Why wouldn't we acknowledge the science \nthat currently exists and accept, in new policy, a policy that would in \nfact embrace this?\n  May I inquire how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. Senators come to the floor and speak about the $13 billion \nin marketing the tobacco industry spends. They fail to tell you that 95 \npercent of that money goes to retailers and coupons against the \ncompetition and to make them more attractively priced at retail. Only 3 \npercent actually went to advertising in adult venues and point of sale \ndisplays. That doesn't make it a good point.\n  What makes it a good point is that the tobacco industry spends a \ntremendous amount of money making sure that their industry is protected \nfor those who choose to use it and are of legal age.\n  Last year, we taxed the tobacco industry to fund the children's \nhealth insurance program. There is a proposal on the table to tax them \nto pay for universal health care. Senator Dodd admitted yesterday that \nthe industry would be taxed to pay for this bill.\n\n  But that is not a good story. A good story is placing tobacco \nproducts in the candy aisle by a news organization just to make a point \nand then portray to the American people that these are the tactics of \nthe tobacco industry.\n  I have, over 4 days now, come to the floor not to defend the tobacco \nindustry, but to defend the FDA, because I don't believe the American \npeople deserve us to discredit the gold standard of the FDA by putting \nthis product under their jurisdiction and asking them to do something \nthey have never, ever done.\n  When I showed the flow chart of jurisdictions, the one missing out of \nthe current regulatory architecture for tobacco is the FDA. Nobody can \nclaim to me they have done this before and, therefore, this is an \nappropriate thing to do again. Simply, I have come to the floor in the \nlast 4 days to debate the policy. At the end of the day, I hope Members \nof the Senate will weigh the policy, the points that I have made, the \nstatistics I have produced, the evidence I have brought to the table, \nand if, at the end of the day, what you are attempting to do is reduce \ndeath and disease, reduce youth usage, I hope I have made the case to \nyou that you should not pass H.R. 1256.\n  This afternoon, before there is an opportunity to vote, I hope to \nmake the case that you should support the Hagan-Burr substitute. I hope \nI have made the case to most that even if the choice comes down to \npassage of H.R. 1256 or nothing, that the CDC report says if you want \nto address a reduction in death and disease, the fastest way to get \nthere is to do nothing if, in fact, your only choice is to pass H.R. \n1256.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues for their patience as I come to the \nfloor to try to educate and provide facts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I will address the issue pending on \nthe floor of the Senate, which is the issue of whether we are going to \nhave the FDA regulate tobacco.\n  The FDA, historically, focuses on the obvious--food and drugs. Over \nthe years, we have expected from them that they would do their job and \nmake sure, as much as humanly possible, that American consumers would \nnot be exposed to dangerous food products or dangerous drugs and \nmedicine. Sometimes they have failed us, but most of the time they do \nthe job pretty well.\n  The way they do their job, when it comes to food, is pretty obvious \nwhen you go to the grocery store. A consumer buying a pound of \nspaghetti can grab the box or bag and look at the label and find out \nthe contents, including a nutrition square that talks about \ncarbohydrates, fat, and calories, which people are concerned about \nbefore making choices.\n  When it comes to medicines and drugs, the Food and Drug \nAdministration goes a step further. They require that products that are \nsold in the United States be both safe and effective. If you are going \nto sell a drug that is supposed to lower your cholesterol, the Food and \nDrug Administration wants it tested to make sure it does not hurt you, \nNo. 1, and, No. 2, that it does what it is supposed to do.\n  So over the years, for almost 100 years, the Food and Drug \nAdministration has created a safety net for American consumers so that \nthe things we purchase, at least by that agency and a few other Federal \nagencies, have some review before the consumer purchases it.\n  Then along comes tobacco, and the tobacco industry has argued for as \nlong as this issue has been going on that they should not be covered by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. They say: We are not food. Nobody \neats tobacco for nutrition or other purposes. And we are not a drug. We \nare just tobacco leaves that are ground up, put in a little paper \ncylinder that people enjoy smoking or maybe chewing. That is all it is \nabout.\n  For the longest time, they were exempt from the Food and Drug \nAdministration asking the most basic questions. For example: What is in \nyour product? If you believe it is just tobacco leaf ground up and \nstuck in paper, you are wrong. It turns out that tobacco companies \nlearned a long time ago that if they added chemicals to the cigarettes, \nthey could get more consumer satisfaction, more consumer use, and \npeople buying more of their product.\n  What did they add? They learned a long time ago that the tricky part \nof tobacco is nicotine. Nicotine is a drug naturally occurring in \ntobacco which, if you smoke it, your body starts to crave it, and with \nthat craving and that demand of your body each day for more and more of \nthe chemical, you smoke more and more. Nicotine, craving, leading to an \naddiction.\n  I don't use that word lightly. I have seen people who are addicted to \ntobacco products--virtually all of us have--folks who just cannot quit. \nThey try everything--hypnosis, patches, lectures, you name it--and they \ncannot quit. They crave that nicotine chemical.\n  The tobacco companies learned a long time ago that if they added more \nnicotine to those tobacco leaves than naturally comes out of them, the \npeople get more addicted. It makes it more difficult for them to quit. \nSo they started piling more nicotine into the cigarette. But that was \nnot the end of it.\n  They also said: The first time a kid or somebody picks up a cigarette \nand takes a big drag of it, often they cough because their body is \nsaying: What are you doing to me? You are jamming that smoke into my \nlungs? That doesn't belong there. They found other chemicals that they \ncould add to cigarettes which would reduce the body's rejection and \nwould make it more pleasant to the taste, and so they pumped those \nchemicals in as well. Then came a whole soup of chemicals that they \nadded for any number of reasons.\n  Obviously, when you buy a pack of cigarettes, if you want to know \nwhat is in the cigarette and take a look at the\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\npackage, you will find there is no disclosure whatsoever. None. You \ndon't know what is in there. All you know is this is paper and tobacco \nto start with, but you don't have a clue that there is more nicotine or \nother chemicals added. And you certainly don't have a warning on the \npackage that some of the chemicals they stick in cigarettes literally \ncause cancer. It isn't bad enough that burning tobacco and inhaling the \nsmoke can cause cancer, there are other chemicals that are carcinogenic \nadded by tobacco companies because they think it makes a more pleasant \nproduct.\n  The obvious thing the American consumers would say is: Where is the \nFood and Drug Administration warning? Why won't they tell us the \ningredients on that tobacco package? Why won't they tell us if they are \ndangerous? Because they do not have the legal authority to do it.\n  From the beginning of time, with the tobacco lobby being one of the \nmost powerful in Washington, they made sure the Food and Drug \nAdministration had no authority when it came to this product. None.\n  Who does regulate tobacco in the United States? The answer is not \nanyone; no agency does. The only real regulation has come out of court \ncases where people who were injured sued the tobacco companies because \nof things such as misrepresentations--light tobacco, low-tar tobacco, \nsafer cigarettes. People take them to court and say that is misleading \nand deceptive. They have won cases, and they have had to disclose more \ninformation over the years.\n  Today we are trying to do something that the tobacco companies' lobby \nhas been fighting for decades. We are trying to let the Food and Drug \nAdministration take over the responsibility of making certain that \nAmerican consumers are at least informed about tobacco products so they \nknow what is in that little package, whether it is dangerous, and they \ncan make a conscious choice about purchasing it.\n  The second thing we do is to make sure that we keep those tobacco \nproducts out of the hands of kids. Why? The math is very simple. Every \nday about 1,000 Americans die from tobacco-related disease--lung \ncancer, heart disease--1,000 die. If you were a company selling a \nproduct and 1,000 of your consumers are dying every day, you start \nwondering whether you are going to be in business in a few years. So \nyou have to recruit more consumers of tobacco products.\n  But tobacco companies have a problem. If people wait until they are \nolder--18, 19, 20 years old--to make a choice about smoking and using \ntobacco, they will probably say: Are you kidding? No way. It is \ndangerous and it is stupid and it is expensive. So if you cannot get \nadults to make up for the 1,000 tobacco users who die each day, where \ndo you go? Kids. You go to children. You try to find ways to lure \nchildren into using tobacco products.\n  The advertising has a lot to do with it, but so does human nature. My \nwife and I raised three kids. We have seen a lot of kids being raised. \nI even have vague memories of my youth. The first thing you are \nattracted to is what your parents say you should not touch. Don't you \ndare touch that pack of tobacco. Don't you dare smoke a cigarette. \nCan't wait to try it, right? Get out behind the garage with your \ncousin, the way I did when I was 10 or 11 years old, to smoke my first \ncigarette. Man, that shows I am independent, I am grown up, I make up \nmy own mind. Kids will do this. I wish they did not. I wish I had not. \nBut they do it.\n  I told the story on the floor the other day about when I was a little \nkid growing up in East St. Louis. My cousin Mike and I went out behind \na garage and smoked a cigarette. Lucky for me I didn't like it much. I \ndidn't continue the habit. Unfortunately, my cousin Mike did. He passed \naway 2 weeks ago--younger than I am--passed away from tobacco-related \nlung disease. It was an addiction started behind that garage that he \ncould never break the rest of his life. There he was, on oxygen, \nsmoking the night before he died. He just could not quit. It is a \nterrible addiction.\n  The tobacco companies know to make up for the thousand who die each \nday. They need 1,000 new smokers a day. Where do they get them? They \nget them from our kids. Mr. President, 3,000 to 4,000 kids will try a \ncigarette in America for the first time today, and about 1,000 of them \nwill decide: I am going to keep doing this. And so the ranks of those \nwho die from tobacco-related disease are filled by children.\n  This bill says we know that and we have to stop it. So not only do we \ngive the Food and Drug Administration the authority to tell us the \ningredients in the package, we give them the authority to police how \npeople sell tobacco products in America.\n  It is no coincidence that they start peddling these tobacco products \nwith candy flavors, because they know kids enjoy candy and will enjoy \ncandy cigarettes. I am not making this up. Chocolate cigarettes and \nvanilla and strawberry--all these things they come up with so that kids \nwill be attracted to the product. We put an end to that stuff. And we \nsay to retailers: Get serious. You better put those cigarettes away \nfrom kids. You better not sell to them or you are going to face a \nserious penalty. If we are sincere about protecting our kids, we have \nto do this.\n  I have been involved in this fight for a long time. I was attracted \nto it when I first got elected to Congress and probably because like \nvirtually everyone following this debate, somebody in my family died \nfrom a tobacco-related disease. In my case, it was my dad. He was 53 \nyears old, and he died of lung cancer. I was 14 years old. It was \ndevastating to my family, to me. But my story is not unique. Sadly, it \nis a story that is repeated over and over every single day.\n\n  About 20 years ago, I decided as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives that I was going to do something about it. The first \nthing I did was to tackle the tobacco lobby on one little tiny issue: \nbanning smoking on airplanes. Hard as it may be for younger people to \nbelieve, there was a time when we had what we called smoking and \nnonsmoking sections on airplanes. Can you believe that? We are all \nsitting in the same metal tube flying across the world or around the \ncountry, and we are somehow of a mind that if I sit in row 1 through 18 \nin the nonsmoking section that I will not be bothered by secondhand \nsmoke; it is only those folks in rows 19 to 36 who are going to be in \nthe smoking section that are in trouble. Crazy idea. It never made \nsense and caused a lot of problems, health and otherwise.\n  So 20 years ago, we banned smoking in airplanes. I did it in the \nHouse. Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey did it in the Senate. It \nbecame the law of the land and eventually all flights became smoke \nfree.\n  I do not want to take more credit than is due, but I think finally \npeople woke up and said: If secondhand smoke is dangerous on a plane, \nthen it is dangerous on a train or a bus or an office or a school or a \nhospital. Things changed across America. Now, it is rare to walk into a \npublic gathering place and see people smoking. Folks understand, and \nthey do not do that. You do not expose some innocent person to \nsecondhand smoke. If you want to smoke, if you made that terrible \ndecision that you want to be a smoker, go outside and do it. Don't try \nto put yourself in a position where you endanger others.\n  What we are trying to do with this bill is to move this debate \nforward. It was not enough that we could put warning labels on at one \ntime that now have become so small and irrelevant that people do not \neven see them. It wasn't enough that we banned it on airplanes. If we \nare serious about protecting our kids from tobacco and smoking, we have \nto do more.\n  This may be an easier issue for me coming from the State of Illinois \nthan Senators from tobacco-producing States or tobacco-manufacturing \nStates. I accept that. This is not easy. For them the issue may be \ndifferent. It may be in terms of tobacco growers and farmers. It may be \nin terms of tobacco-related employees. For them the idea of reducing \nthe number of people smoking cigarettes has an economic impact. So I am \nnot going to begrudge them coming to the floor and their attempts to \nchange this bill that is before us. It is perfectly understandable. I \ndo not question their motives at all. But I come to it from a public \nhealth viewpoint. I think what they are offering as an alternative is \nnot a good one. Let me tell you why.\n  We have 1,000 organizations, literally 1,000 organizations, health \nand consumer organizations across the United\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\nStates that have endorsed this bill. I have literally in my time in \nCongress, 27 years, never seen a bill with this kind of endorsement. \nPeople understand this now. They understand we have to do this now. \nSenator Kennedy, who is our champion and inspiration, cannot be with \nus. He is battling a brain tumor and doing well, but he cannot make it \nto the floor. But I will tell you that he is in our hearts, thoughts, \nand prayers today. This bill is about his valiant effort to make sure \nwe do this. So many organizations join him and us in saying this is \nlong overdue.\n  Those on the other side have come up with a substitute, an \nalternative. There are a lot of problems with it. I have heard the \nSenators from North Carolina--Senator Burr was just on the floor--talk \nabout their alternative. We took a look at it. It turns out there are \nsome problems with their alternative.\n  They want to create a new Federal agency. They don't want the Food \nand Drug Administration to do this. Unfortunately, it will be an \nuntested and underfunded agency. They do not understand the concept \nbehind trying to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids. They \nsay maybe there are some alternative products these kids could use \nwhich would not be as dangerous, the so-called risk reduction idea. We \nstarted our bill on the premise that the tobacco industry's practices \nmislead people and result in terrible health consequences, and they \nhave to be changed.\n  One of the ways they propose to reduce the risk of tobacco is to \nchange the form of tobacco. Instead of cigarettes inhaled into the \nlungs, it turns out they believe that spit tobacco, chewing tobacco, is \na safer way to use tobacco. The proposal that is being offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina virtually exempts smokeless tobacco \nproducts from regulation. You know what I am talking about, those \nlittle pouches you stick in your mouth that let tobacco juices flow, \nand so forth. We even have some Senators who chew tobacco, if you can \nbelieve that--it is a fact--and spit into cups. Not my idea of a good \ntime. But some of them do it anyway.\n  This bill would not go after that form of tobacco. There is little, \nif any, evidence that smokeless tobacco products are a step in the way \nof quitting smoking or becoming healthy.\n  In fact, many of these new smokeless products are being marketed to \nsmokers as a way to sustain their addictions in places where smoking is \nno longer allowed. Take a look at this product: Camel Snus, frost-\nflavored Camel Snus, 15 pouches. See these little pouches over here?\n  For those who aren't familiar with it, snus is a smoke-free, spit-\nfree tobacco product that comes in little pouches which can be placed \nunder the upper lip. And as one high school student described it: It is \neasy--says the high school kid--it is super discreet. None of the \nteachers will ever know what I am doing.\n  This is their idea and the alternative? This is the idea, the \nalternative of the Senator from North Carolina to kids smoking \ncigarettes. The Web site for Camel Snus boasts that ``snus can be \nenjoyed almost anywhere, regardless of growing smoking bans and \nrestrictions.''\n  So do we really want a national policy--as the Senator from North \nCarolina is suggesting--that steers people toward this kind of a \nproduct? Let's look at the facts.\n  Smokeless tobacco is loaded with dangerous ingredients, just like \ncigarettes. The National Cancer Institute reports that chewing tobacco \ncontains at least 28 known cancer-causing agents. Smokeless tobacco may \nbe a reduced risk in some respects compared to cigarettes, but its use \nis still a serious health problem and a danger to children. If you need \nproof of that, look at this poor young man here.\n  Gruen Von Behrens is an oral cancer survivor. This young man has had \nmore than 40 surgeries to save his life, including one radical surgery \nthat removed half his neck muscles and the lymph nodes and half of his \ntongue. Like too many teenagers, Von Behrens first tried spit tobacco, \nwhich this bill says is a safer way of using tobacco than cigarettes, \nat age 13--13--in order to fit in. It only took 4 years for him to be \ndiagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. Look what this poor young man \nhas been through because of a product which the North Carolina Senator \ntells us is something we should be moving toward in this country.\n  I think of all those kids who used to have the little can of snuff--\nbaseball players--in the back of their jeans and how cool that was, and \nI just wonder how many of them face this kind of an outcome because of \npopular fads. Would we want to endorse that as part of our debate on \nthe future of tobacco in America?\n  The Burr substitute is based in part on an unproven assumption that \nsmokeless tobacco should be promoted as a way to help people quit \nsmoking. But the 2008 U.S. Public Health Service Clinical Practice \nGuidelines concluded that the use of smokeless tobacco products is not \na safe alternative to smoking, nor is there any evidence to suggest it \nis effective in helping smokers quit.\n  Smokers who are trying to quit already have access to safe, \nrigorously tested, and FDA approved forms of nicotine replacement, like \nincluding nicotine gum, the patch, lozenges and other medications.\n  Let's steer people who want to quit toward these FDA approved \nproducts, not toward smokeless tobacco, which is riddled with \ncarcinogens.\n  Another weakness in my colleague's bill is in the limited authority \nit gives the new agency to oversee the contents of tobacco products.\n  The Kennedy bill gives the FDA strong authority to regulate the \ncontent of both existing and new tobacco products, including both \ncigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.\n  The Burr substitute gives the new agency virtually no authority over \nthe content of existing smokeless tobacco products--no matter how much \nnicotine, and no matter how many cancer-causing agents they contain.\n  My colleague's substitute gives the agency far less authority to \nremove harmful constituents in cigarettes than the Kennedy bill does, \nand it makes it far more difficult for the agency to act.\n  The Kennedy bill allows the FDA to fully remove harmful constituents.\n  The Burr proposal allows only the reduction--but not the \nelimination--of known harmful substances.\n  The Kennedy bill allows the FDA to take into account the impact of \nproduct changes on potential users--including children--and the effects \non former smokers who might be enticed to resume the nicotine \naddiction.\n  The Burr substitute allows the agency to consider only the narrow \nhealth impact on existing smokers.\n  The Kennedy bill allows the FDA to reduce or fully eliminate \nsubstances that ``may be harmful'' using the best available scientific \nevidence.\n  The Burr substitute requires the agency to demonstrate that a single \nproduct change is likely to result in ``measurable and substantial \nreductions in morbidity.'' This standard will be extraordinarily \ndifficult to meet given the large number of harmful substances in \ncigarettes. It is language that will tie the agency in knots and \nprevent actions that are clearly in the interests of public health.\n  The Kennedy bill includes an outright ban on candy and fruit-flavored \ncigarettes.\n  The Burr alternative bans only the use of candy and fruit names on \nthe products, while allowing the use of candy and fruit flavors to \nentice young people to begin using products laced with nicotine and \ncarcinogens.\n  All these details are important--they mark the difference between an \napproach that gives the government real authority to regulate the \ncontents of tobacco products, and an approach that bows down to the \nindustry and leaves tobacco companies in charge of these decisions.\n  We shouldn't continue to give those companies that kind of power.\n  There is another serious problem with the substitute offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina. It does not adequately protect consumers \nfrom misleading health claims about tobacco products.\n  The Kennedy bill sets stringent but reasonable scientific standards \nbefore manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are \nallowed to claim that their products are safer or reduce the risk of \ndisease.\n  The Burr substitute completely exempts smokeless tobacco products \nfrom these standards even if those\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nclaims are likely to cause youth to take up tobacco for the first time.\n  When smokeless tobacco manufacturers aggressively marketed their \nproducts to young people in the 1970s, often with themes suggesting \nthat they were less harmful than cigarettes, use of those products \nincreased among adolescents.\n  The Burr substitute only allows the agency to look at the impact of \nhealth claims on individual users of tobacco products.\n  It does not allow the agency to consider whether the reduced risk \nclaim would increase the harm to overall public health by increasing \nthe number of youth who begin using tobacco products or reducing the \nnumber of current users who quit.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has criticized the Kennedy bill for \nlimiting tobacco advertising to black-and-white text-only material in \npublications with significant youth readership.\n  His substitute, he says, goes further by banning tobacco advertising.\n  That is an attractive talking point. But like so much tobacco \nadvertising, it is misleading. It has a barbed hook buried in it.\n  The fact is, a broad, indiscriminate ban on tobacco advertising would \nlikely be struck down by the courts.\n  The courts would probably rule that it is an impermissibly broad \nlimitation on speech.\n  They would say the ends are not sufficiently tailored to the means, \nand they would conclude that it violates the first amendment.\n  That is what constitutional scholars tell us.\n  The result of the Senator's amendment would be a continuation of \ncurrent law--a continuation of the insidious advertising the industry \ncurrently uses to lure new customers. Under the guise of a total \nadvertising ban, he would give us the status quo.\n  And the tobacco industry would thank him for it.\n  My colleague from North Carolina has improved the warning labels he \nwould require on cigarettes. But they would not be strong enough.\n  The Burr substitute would allocate 25 percent of the bottom front of \nthe package to a warning label.\n  In contrast, the Kennedy bill reflects the latest science on warning \nlabels by requiring text and graphic warning labels that cover 50 \npercent of the front and back of the package.\n  Clearly, a health warning that takes up the top half of the front and \nback of a package will be more noticeable and easier to read than one \nthat takes up only a quarter of the bottom of the package--an area that \nmay be hidden by the sales rack.\n  Senator Kennedy's bill also gives the FDA the authority to change the \nwarnings in light of emerging science. Under the Burr substitute, the \nagency would not have any authority to change the warning labels.\n  And the Burr amendment's required warning labels for smokeless \ntobacco products read more like endorsements than warnings.\n  For example, one of the required statements is a warning that the \nproduct has a significantly lower risk of disease than cigarettes. That \nis not a health warning--it is an unhealthy promotion.\n  We have an historic opportunity to finally put some real and \nmeaningful regulations in place, and that will stop some of the tobacco \nindustry's most egregious practices.\n  For decades, this industry has lied to us, and I don't know why we \nwould trust them now to do the right thing.\n  We should not accept the underlying premise of the Burr substitute, \nthat a lifetime of addiction and a high risk of premature death must be \naccepted, and that our strategy should be to steer people towards \n``reduced harm'' products.\n  That is the smokeless tobacco approach, not the public health \napproach.\n  The Kennedy bill is a strong and carefully crafted solution that puts \nthe public health first.\n  The Kennedy bill is the bill that should be enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6150-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, if you got up early this morning--like \nabout 6 a.m.--and turned on the television, you would have heard a \nhistoric speech. President Barack Obama is in Cairo, Egypt, this \nmorning--our time this morning--giving a speech to an assembled group \nat a university in Cairo about the relationship of the United States \nand Muslims around the world. It is a critically important speech.\n  All of us know what happened on 9/11/2001. We know our relationship \nwith people in the Middle East has been strained at best, and we have \nbeen troubled by the threats of Islamic extremism, and so the President \nwent and spoke in Cairo. I listened to his speech. Now, I am biased \nbecause he was my former colleague from Illinois and I think so highly \nof him, but I think it was an excellent speech. I think what he tried \nto do was to explain to them how we can develop a positive relationship \nbetween people of the Islamic faith and America, and I thought he laid \nout the case very well in terms of our history, our tolerance, the \ndiversity of religious belief in our country, and how some elements of \nIslam--extremist elements of Islam--are not even operating in a way \nconsistent with their own basic values and principles.\n  The reason I refer to that speech is that one of the points that was \nimportant was when President Obama said to this assembled group--to \ntheir applause--that the United States was going to change its policies \nunder his leadership. He said we are not going to use torture in the \nfuture, and he received applause from this group. He said we are going \nto close Guantanamo, and they applauded that as well.\n  What the President's statement said--and basically the reaction of \nthe audience told us--is that regardless of our image of the United \nStates, for some people around the world there are things that have \noccurred since 9/11 which have created a tension and a stress between \nus that need to be addressed honestly. President Obama made it clear \nthat we are starting a new path, a new way to develop friendships and \nalliances around the world to stop terrorism and stop extremism, and he \nunderstands that torture--the torture of prisoners held by the United \nStates--has, unfortunately, created a tension between the United States \nand other people in the world. They know of it because of Abu Ghraib, \nthe graphic photographs that are emblazoned in our memory, and theirs \nas well, of the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq. They know it from \nthe photographs that have emerged and the documentary evidence about \nthe treatment of some prisoners at Guantanamo.\n  It has, unfortunately, become a fact of life that Guantanamo itself \nis a symbol that is used by al-Qaida--the terrorist group responsible \nfor 9/11--to recruit new members. They inflame their passions by \ntalking about Guantanamo and the unfair treatment of some prisoners at \nGuantanamo. President Obama knew this and said in his first Executive \norder that the United States will not engage in torture and within a \nyear or so we will close the Guantanamo corrections facility. I think \nit was the right decision--not an easy decision but the right decision. \nIf we are truly going to break with the past and build new strength and \nalliances to protect the United States, then we have to step up with \nthis kind of leadership.\n  The President inherited a recession, two wars, and over 240 prisoners \nin Guantanamo, some of whom have been held for 6 or 7 years. Many of \nthese people are very dangerous individuals who should never, ever be \nreleased, at least as long as they are a threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the United States or a threat to other people. Some should \nbe tried. They can be tried for crimes\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nand, if convicted, they can be incarcerated. Others may be sent to \nanother country, maybe returned to their own country of origin.\n  One of these prisoners I happen to know a little about because he is \nrepresented by an attorney in Chicago. He is Palestinian. He is from \nGaza and was captured when he was 19 years old. He has now been held in \nprison for 7 years. He is now 26 years old. Last year, our government \nnotified him and his attorney that we have no current charges against \nhim. They have been trying to find a place to send him. He stayed \nanother year in prison while we are trying to determine where he should \nbe sent.\n  Each of these 240 cases is a challenge to make sure we come to a just \nconclusion as to each person and never compromise the safety of the \nUnited States.\n  A little over a week ago, the President went to the National Archives \nand gave a speech about Guantanamo and what we are going to do, and he \nmade it clear that some of these people will be tried in our courts, \nsome of them may end up in prisons in the United States, some of them \nmay end up being held as long as they are enemy combatants and a danger \nto the United States, and some may be sent to other countries. They are \ntrying to work out 240 different cases. It is not an easy assignment.\n  The reason I raise this is because it is clear that as long as \nGuantanamo remains open, it is going to be an irritant to many around \nthe world and lead to the recruitment of more people to engage in \nterrorism against the United States. Don't accept my conclusion on \nthat. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, said:\n\n       The concern I've had about Guantanamo in these wars is it \n     has been a symbol, and one which has been a recruiting symbol \n     for those extremists and jihadists who would fight us.\n\n  On the floor of the Senate this morning, shortly after the \nPresident's speech, the Republican minority leader, Senator McConnell \nof Kentucky--as he has many times before--came to discuss Guantanamo. \nHe said explicitly--and he may have said this before, but I just want \nto make it clear that I am reading from the transcript of what he said \non the floor this morning--``Like most Americans, I'm for keeping \nGuantanamo open.'' So he clearly disagrees with the President. He wants \nGuantanamo to stay open. I certainly hope that it doesn't. I don't want \nthis recruiting tool for terrorists to continue.\n  Senator McConnell has raised the question repeatedly of whether it is \nsafe for us to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States for a \ntrial or for incarceration. I think it is, based on the fact that we \ncurrently have 347 convicted terrorists serving time in American \nprisons today. Over half of them are international terrorists, and some \nof them are in my State of Illinois at the Marion Federal penitentiary. \nThey are being held today. As I traveled around southern Illinois last \nweek, I didn't hear one person step up and say: I am worried about the \nterrorists being held at the Marion prison.\n  In fact, I went to the Marion prison, met with the corrections \nofficers and guards, and asked them this: What do you think about \nGuantanamo detainees?\n  Well, they were somewhere between insulted and angry at the notion \nthat they couldn't safely incarcerate a Guantanamo detainee. One of the \nguards said to me: Senator, we have more dangerous people than that in \nthis prison. We have serial killers, we have sexual predators, we have \nterrorists from Colombia, we had John Gotti--the syndicate kingpin. We \nheld these people safely, and we can do it. That is what we do for a \nliving. So don't you worry about putting them in this prison. We can \ntake care of them. We have not had an escape, and we are not going to.\n  So when Senators come to the floor and suggest that these detainees \ncannot even be brought to the United States for trial and held in a \nprison while they are going to trial, that it is somehow unsafe to \nAmerica, defies logic and experience. If there is one strength we have \nin this country--and you can debate it--we know how to incarcerate \npeople. We have put more people in prison per capita than any nation on \nEarth. We hold them safely, certainly in the supermax facilities, and \nwe must continue to. And this idea that we have to keep Guantanamo open \nbecause there is not a prison in America where they can be held safely \nis not true. The 347 convicted terrorists being held in America today \nare living proof that is not true.\n  This tactic of opposing the closing of Guantanamo is based on fear--\nfear that is being pedaled on this Senate floor that these detainees \ncannot be held safely and securely in the United States. It is the same \nfear that led people to conclude that our Constitution wasn't strong \nenough to deal with a war on terrorism, and therefore we had to look \nfor ways to go around it when it came to wiretapping and interrogating \nprisoners. These are the same people who had fear that our courts in \nAmerica couldn't handle the cases before them if they dealt with \nterrorism, though, in fact, they have done that many times over. It is \nthe same fear that our law enforcement authorities can't do their job \neffectively, when, in fact, they can.\n  We cannot as a nation be guided by fear. And those politicians who \ncome up and make speeches, whether it is on radio or television or on \nthe floor of Congress, and who try to appeal to the fear of the \nAmerican people aren't doing us any favor. We are not a strong nation \ncowering in fear. We are a strong nation of principle, of values, that \ncan stand up to the world and say: We will not in any way harbor or \nencourage terrorism and extremism. We are proud of our values. We can \nstand by them even in the toughest of times. And we are proud of the \ninstitutions of America that we have created and that make us strong.\n  I don't think those who come to this argument out of weakness and \nfear have a leg to stand on. And when the argument was made on the \nfloor this morning that we should keep Guantanamo open, I would like to \nthink that those who heard President Obama in Cairo, Egypt, and across \nthe Muslim world today and who were encouraged by his aspirations to \nhigher values and a better place for the United States will understand \nthat this statement by one Senator on the floor of the Senate doesn't \nrepresent where America needs to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to conclude briefly by saying we have a chance to \ndo the right thing, to close Guantanamo in a safe and secure fashion, \nto put these prisoners in supermax facilities, to stop the use of \nGuantanamo as a recruitment device for al-Qaida. Turning them loose in \ncountries around the world may mean the release of terrorists and more \nproblems to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, we are in morning business, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6151-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6151-S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I have four amendments I wish to \ndiscuss to the pending bill. I will not call them up but I wish to \ndiscuss them. When the bill is presented on the floor, then I will come \nback and talk about the specific amendments that are going to be \nconsidered in the first tranche of amendments.\n  First, I rise today in strong opposition to the tobacco regulatory \nbill on the floor. This sweeping legislation would dramatically \nincrease the FDA's regulatory authority outside the scope of original \ncongressional intent. This is something that Congress did not intend to \ngive the FDA when we wrote the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and \nthat intent was even upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000. Yet \nthere are still some of my colleagues out here who believe it would be \nsafer for the American public to regulate tobacco under the FDA. They \nargue that, by doing so, we will help reduce the negative effect of \nsmoking and prevent underage smokers.\n  As a grandfather of 39 grandchildren, believe me, I want to keep \ncigarettes out of the hands of kids. But the bill before us today does \nnot do that. It is nothing more than an attempt to eliminate our \nnational tobacco industry. The big problem with this approach is that \nour Nation's tobacco\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nfarmers are the ones who are going to pay the price.\n  Not once in this bill did I read any language that would provide any \ntype of protection to our tobacco farmers--not even once. This is why I \nhave introduced the four amendments. Let me give you their numbers: \n1236, 1237, 1238, and 1239.\n  If the FDA is going to regulate tobacco and require sweeping changes \nwithin the industry, I want to ensure that farmers have a voice at the \nnegotiating table. My amendments do this. Not only do they allow for \nfair grower representation, but they help ensure that those who will be \nmost affected by this legislation will not be forced to pay the biggest \nprice.\n  Let me be clear that I oppose the FDA regulation of tobacco. I have \nsaid that as long as tobacco is a legal commodity, it should be \nregulated through the USDA, the United States Department of \nAgriculture, not the FDA. If we are going to discuss giving the FDA \nthis authority through this or similar legislation, I want to make sure \nthat we consider the impact on agriculture.\n  In Kentucky, the family farm is the foundation for who we are as a \nState. For over a century, the family farm in Kentucky has centered \naround one crop--tobacco. Tobacco barns and small plots of tobacco dot \nthe Kentucky landscape. We are proud of our heritage and proud that \ntobacco plays a role in our history. Even after the buy-out, tobacco \nstill plays a prominent role in my State's agricultural landscape.\n  We have tried to broaden our agricultural base. We have had some \nsuccess with several types of vegetables, cattle, and even raising \ncatfish. But at the end of the day, nothing brings as much of a return \nto the small farmer in Kentucky as tobacco. It is big business for \nsmall farmers.\n  With the current economic conditions, more and more farmers in my \nState are turning to growing tobacco to supplement their income or, in \na lot of cases, tobacco is their sole source of income. The money they \nget from tobacco pays their mortgages, puts their kids through school, \nand actually allows them to stay on the farm.\n  Outside of the western part of my State, Kentucky does not have tens \nof thousands of acres of flat land. We have a lot of green, rolling \nhills and a climate where tobacco thrives. It can be raised very \ncheaply on small plots of land that simply cannot accommodate other \ncrops. Whether we like it or not, tobacco remains an economic staple \nfor rural Kentucky. It is profitable and farmers rely on it. That might \nnot be popular today, but it is an economic reality that we have to \nface.\n  Whatever the opponents of tobacco say, there is no denying that this \nbill will add unnecessary mandates and expenses on the farmers in the \nattempt to punish the big tobacco companies. Sure, this bill will hurt \nbig tobacco companies. They might have to move offshore. They might \nhave to start exporting more of their products. But they will survive. \nBut Kentucky's tobacco farmers do not have these options available to \nthem. They are the ones who are going to be hurt by this type of \nlegislation.\n  Some of my colleagues might support this legislation because they \nwish to outlaw tobacco. The last time I looked, tobacco was still a \nlegal product in this country. If my colleagues want to make it \nillegal, let them be honest and upfront about it. Let's consider \nlegislation to make it illegal. We can fight that here, out on the \nfloor of the Senate. But let's not keep trying to slip it through the \nback door, through overregulation and taxes in the name of preventing \nunderage smoking.\n  Children should not have cigarettes. They should not. This is why we \nhave age limits and advertising limits. We should do all that we can to \nkeep cigarettes out of the hands of our kids. But the bill before us is \nnot the answer. We can do better and should do better. All this bill \ndoes is move the regulation of a legal product from several agencies to \nanother, one that has no jurisdiction to regulate it.\n  The only people this bill is going to hurt in the end are not the big \ntobacco companies, but the small and honest farmers who depend on \ntobacco to pay their bills. This is why I have offered four farmer-\nfriendly amendments to the bill. I want to explain for a few minutes \nthe four.\n  One, Bunning amendment No. 1236, clarifies that nothing in this bill \nwould prevent our farmers from growing and cultivating tobacco as they \nhave been able to do for the past hundred-plus years.\n  My second amendment, No. 1237, establishes a grower grant program \nthat would help ease the financial burden of this bill on our farmers.\n  Amendment No. 1238 gives growers a seat at the negotiating table. The \nunderlying bill establishes a Tobacco Scientific Advisory Committee \nmade up of 12 members. Seven of those members are from the medical \nfield to ensure that public health needs are taken into account. There \nis one of the public, and three representatives from the tobacco \nindustry. There are two manufacturers and one grower. All members of \nthe committee are voting except for the last three--the tobacco \nrepresentatives. My amendment is simple. It gives the tobacco \nrepresentatives the right to vote and adds two more grower positions. \nThat way, all three forms of tobacco--burley, flue cured and dark \nleaf--are represented at the negotiating table.\n  The final Bunning amendment, No. 1239, asks the FDA if they are going \nto impose any new restrictions or requirements on farmers, then they \nshould consider and conduct a feasibility study so that we know the \neffect on the farm level.\n  When my amendments come up, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthem.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today along with Senator Bennett and \nSenator McConnell and Senator Kyl, I will introduce the Auto Stock for \nEvery Taxpayer Act--to require the Treasury to distribute to individual \ntaxpayers all its stock in the new General Motors and Chrysler within 1 \nyear following the emergence of the new GM from bankruptcy proceedings. \nThis is the best way to get the auto companies out of the hands of \nWashington bureaucrats and politicians and into the hands of the \nAmerican people in the marketplace where they belong. So instead of the \nTreasury owning 60 percent of shares in the new GM and 8 percent of \nChrysler, you would own them if you were one of about 120 million \nindividual Americans who paid Federal taxes on April 15.\n  This is the fastest way to get the stock out of the hands of \nWashington and back into the hands of the American people who paid for \nit. To keep it simple, and to help the little guy and girl also have an \nownership stake in America's future, Treasury would give each taxpayer \nan equal number of the available shares.\n  The Treasury Department has said it wants to sell its auto shares as \nsoon as possible, but Fritz Henderson, president and CEO of General \nMotors, told Senators and Congressmen in a telephone call on Monday \nthat while it is the Treasury's decision to make, this is a ``very \nlarge amount'' of stock, and that orderly offering of those shares to \nestablish a market may have to be ``managed down over a period of \nyears.''\n  Those shares might not be worth very much at first, but put them away \nand one day they might contribute something toward a college education. \nFor example, General Motors' 610 million shares were only worth 75 \ncents just before bankruptcy, but they were worth $40 per share 2 years \nago, and $75 a few years before that.\n  Already we can see what government ownership of car companies will \nlook\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\nlike. Yesterday the presidents of General Motors and Chrysler spent 4 \nhours in front of congressional committees talking about dealerships.\n  I assume they drove themselves here from Detroit in their \ncongressionally approved method of transportation, probably their \nnewest hybrid cars.\n  They did not have much time yesterday to design, build, or sell cars \nand trucks for their troubled companies. Unless we get the stock out of \nthe hands of Washington, this scene will be repeated over and over \nagain.\n  There are at least 60 congressional committees and subcommittees \nauthorized to hold hearings on auto companies, and most of them will \nhold hearings, probably many times.\n  Car company executives who need to be managing complex enterprises \nwill be reduced to the status of an assistant secretary in a minor \ndepartment hauling briefings books from subcommittee to subcommittee.\n  You can imagine what the questions will be and the president of each \ncompany will probably be asked these questions: What will the next \nmodel look like? What plant should be closed and which one opened? How \nmany cars should have flex fuel? What will the work rules be? What will \nthe salaries be? Where will the conferences be held, and in which \ncities should they not be held?\n  Congressmen will want to know why the Chevy Volt is using a battery \nfrom a South Korean company when it can be made in one of their \ncongressional districts. There will be a lengthy hearing about the \nnumber of holidays allowed, and thousands of written questions \ndemanding written answers under oath.\n  And it is not just the Congress we have to worry about. The President \nof the United States has already called the mayor of Detroit to \nreassure him that the headquarters of General Motors should stay in \nDetroit, instead of moving to Warren, MI. And the mayor of Detroit has \nannounced his satisfaction with talking with members of the President's \nauto task force to make sure that the executives of the car companies \ndo not get any ideas about moving their own headquarters.\n  Then there is the Treasury Secretary--and his Under Secretaries--who \nwill want to keep up with what is happening to the taxpayers' $50 \nbillion investment in the New General Motors.\n  There is a very active economic czar in the White House. He will have \nsome questions and opinions as well about how to run the car companies, \nnot to mention the Environmental Protection Agency officials who might \nbe busy deciding what size cars they ought to build.\n  And, of course, it was not very long ago that this administration let \nGeneral Motors know that it was making too many SUVs and that its Chevy \nVolt was going to be too expensive to work. That was the opinion here \nin Washington. And the President of the United States himself fired the \npresident of General Motors.\n  Giving the stock to the taxpayer who paid for it will get the \ngovernment out of the companies' hair and give the companies a chance \nto succeed. It will create an investor fan base of 120 million-plus \nAmerican taxpayers who may be a little more interested now in what the \nnext Chevrolet will be. Think of the fan base of the Green Bay Packers, \nwhose ownership is distributed among the people of Green Bay.\n  This is the fastest way back to the wise principle: If you can find \nit in the Yellow Pages, the government probably shouldn't be doing it. \nMore than the money, it is the principle of the thing.\n  The other day, a visiting European automobile executive said to me \nwith a laugh that he had come to the ``new American automotive capital: \nWashington, DC.''\n  To get our economy moving again, let's get our auto companies out of \nthe hands of Washington and back into the marketplace. Let's put the \nstock in the hands of 120 million taxpayers, the sooner the better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I gather we are still in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6153-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6153-S6155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout the importance of what we are doing to address the issues raised \nby my friend and colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, who has \nraised some important issues. We are debating, of course, very historic \npublic health legislation. The bill before this body will, for the \nfirst time, give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate \nthe tobacco industry and to put in place tough protections for families \nthat for too long have been absent, when it comes to how cigarettes are \nmarketed to children.\n  As I have said, particularly over the last couple days, I don't think \nwe can afford to wait any longer on this issue. As I think all \ncolleagues are aware, every single day we delay action on this \nlegislation, another 3,500 to 4,000 children across the Nation are \nensnared by tobacco companies that target them with impunity as they \ntry smoking for the very first time in their lives, 3,500 to 4,000 \nevery single day. Smoking kills more Americans every year than alcohol \nabuse, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drug use, murders, and suicides \ncombined. As tragic as all deaths are, particularly ones caused by the \ncircumstances I have raised, if we took all of them together, they do \nnot total the 400,000 people who lose their lives every year as a \nresult of tobacco-related illnesses. Absent action by this Congress, \nmore than 6 million children who are alive today will die from smoking, \nincluding the 76,000 or so in my home State of Connecticut.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill before us \nwould reduce adult smoking by 900,000 Americans. That is not an \ninsignificant number. It represents about 2 percent. The CBO estimates \nthat over the next 10 years, 2 million children will not take up \nsmoking, if we are able to pass this legislation and have an effect on \nthe marketing of these products to kids. That is 11 percent of children \nacross the country. That is 700,000 people we would be able to have an \ninfluence on, convincing them not to take that first cigarette, to \nbegin the habit of smoking.\n  Unfortunately, flaws in the Burr substitute will not achieve those \ngoals. It would result in much less regulation of tobacco products, \nallow the tobacco industry to play many more games and hide more of the \nharm their products cause and leave children and others more vulnerable \nto the scourge of tobacco. Instead of using the FDA, a proven agency of \n100 years, with experience in regulatory, scientific, and health care \nresponsibilities, to carry out the purpose of this bipartisan bill, the \nBurr substitute creates a flawed agency, with inadequate resources, and \nlimits the authority of that agency to take meaningful action to \ncurtail the harm caused by tobacco products and their marketing.\n  The Institute of Medicine, which is highly respected by all of us, \nand the President's cancer panel have both endorsed giving the FDA this \ncritical authority. The Food and Drug Administration has 100 years of \nexperience in regulating almost every product we consume in order to \nprotect public health. A new agency is not the answer. Obviously, one \nmore bureaucracy is hardly the direction we ought to be going. Our \nbipartisan bill provides adequate funding to effectively regulate \ntobacco products through a user fee paid by the tobacco industry.\n  The Burr substitute does not provide adequate resources to get the \njob done either. In the first 3 years, the Burr substitute provides \njust a quarter of the funding provided in the Kennedy proposal, which \nhas been with us for the last 7 or 8 years and has been endorsed by \n1,000 organizations, faith-based organization, State-based \norganizations, and virtually every major public health advocacy group \nin the United States.\n  Our bipartisan bill gives the FDA strong authority to regulate the \ncontent of both existing and new tobacco products, including both \ncigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. The Burr\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nsubstitute gives the new agency no authority whatsoever over the \ncontent of smokeless tobacco products, no matter how much nicotine and \nno matter how many cancer-causing agents are in those products. The \nNational Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the U.S. \nSurgeon General, and the Public Health Service have all concluded that \nsmokeless tobacco products, as sold in the United States, are a cause \nof serious disease, including cancer.\n  This is not a partisan analysis. When the Surgeon General, the \nNational Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, as well as the \nPublic Health Service, says these products cause cancer and can kill, \nthat is not an ideological conclusion. That is the scientific opinion \nof the very agencies and organizations we rely on for this information. \nThey are saying, if one uses those products, they could get cancer and \ncould die. Suggesting we ought to have an agency with no power to \nregulate those products takes us in exactly the wrong direction, given \nthe growing use of smokeless tobacco products. They should be subject \nto regulation like other tobacco products. This amendment would allow \nsmokeless tobacco manufacturers to make their products as harmful as \nthey may want with no regard for public health.\n  The Food and Drug Administration regulates the food our pets consume. \nProducts consumed by dogs and cats are regulated by the FDA. The idea \nthat we would have an agency with the power to regulate not only the \nfood we consume and the cosmetics and all variety of pharmaceuticals \nand so forth that we ingest, excluding tobacco, that we would also give \nthem the power to regulate products our pets consume, but we wouldn't \nallow them to regulate smokeless tobacco or cigarettes runs counter to \ncommon sense in this day and age. This is the 21st century, and 400,000 \npeople die every year from self-inflicted injury as a result of the use \nof these products. As well, 3,500 children begin smoking every single \nday. To say we can't use this Agency, which has the power and ability \nto regulate, do research, as well as engage in public health, flies in \nthe face of logic. The idea that our pets at home have better \nprotection than our children when it comes to tobacco products makes no \nsense to anyone I know.\n  The Burr substitute gives the Agency far less authority to remove \nharmful constituents in cigarettes than our bipartisan bill does, and \nit will make it far more difficult for the Agency to act.\n  I mentioned before I was a smoker. I am grateful that most of my \ncolleagues were not. But having been one, I can tell them, it is hard \nto quit. People struggle every day to quit, and it is hard. I don't \nhave any polling data, but I would bet that if we asked every parent \nwho smokes--my parents did, my father smoked cigars and pipes; my \nmother smoked Chesterfields for about 20 years before she died of \ncardiovascular issues that may have been related to smoking--whether \nthey would like their children to begin smoking or using smokeless \ntobacco products, I will guarantee that number is off the charts. They \ndon't want their children to start this.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a State of 12,000 small tobacco \nfarmers in North Carolina. I haven't said this before, and I should \nhave--and I apologize for not saying it--this is not the fault of the \ntobacco farmer. They are in business. They grow a crop. I don't know \nenough about the science of this, but I suspect the leaf itself is not \nthe issue. It is the 15 carcinogens that are included. When we light up \na cigarette, it isn't just the tobacco leaf that comes from North \nCarolina that is rolled into a piece of paper. There are 50 other \ningredients, particularly ones designed specifically to create the \naddiction associated with cigarettes.\n  The last thing I wish to see is a farmer in North Carolina, whose \neconomic well-being could be adversely affected by a decision we make, \nbe harmed. We can help them. I know we try to do that in this bill, and \nI will be anxious to hear from my colleague from North Carolina with \nthe adoption of this legislation--not that I expect her to support it--\nwhat we can do to help these people. I suspect many of them, if asked \nthe question: Would you like your children to begin smoking, would \nlikely give the same answer. So that farmer out there would need some \nhelp, and we ought to provide it.\n  Our bill allows the Food and Drug Administration to take into account \nthe impact of product changes on potential users, particularly \nchildren, and former smokers. The Burr substitute only allows the \nAgency to consider the narrow health impact on existing smokers. Our \nbipartisan bill allows the Food and Drug Administration to reduce or \nfully eliminate substances that may be harmful using the best available \nscientific evidence. The Burr substitute requires the Agency to \ndemonstrate that a single product change is likely to result in \n``measurable and substantial reductions in morbidity,'' knowing that \nthis standard would be extraordinarily difficult to meet, given the \nlarge number of harmful substances in cigarettes.\n\n  Our bill bans candy- and fruit-flavored cigarettes. I hope my \ncolleagues don't need me to explain why there are candy- and fruit-\nflavored cigarettes. That is not to convince a 55-year-old they ought \nto start smoking. When they decide to make cigarettes taste like candy, \ntell me who the audience is. If you think it is some adult, then we are \nliving on different planets because that is designed specifically to \nget the kids. We know 90 percent of adults who smoke began as kids. \nThose are the statistics. Our bill bans candy- and fruit-flavored \ncigarettes. The Burr substitute only bans the use of candy and fruit \nnames on products--leaving tobacco manufacturers to market cigarettes \nthat taste like mocha mint or strawberry.\n  The Burr substitute prevents the Agency from requiring the \nmanufacturer to make any product change that the manufacturer elects to \nimplement by requiring changes in how tobacco is cured or might \notherwise impact the tobacco leaf. This would always be used by the \nmanufacturers to challenge the product standard. For example, a new \nstudy found that the high level of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in \ntobacco products has probably resulted in twice as many people dying \nfrom lung cancer. Under the Burr standard, it is highly unlikely, we \nare told, that the Agency would take action to address this issue \nbecause the simplest solution is to change how some tobacco is cured \nafter it is grown. The Burr substitute allows tobacco companies to \ncontinue to deceive consumers in that regard.\n  The Burr substitute also bases its tar and nicotine standards on the \nresults of a specific test that the Federal Trade Commission recently \nrejected because it does not provide meaningful information about the \nhealth risks of different cigarettes. In its statement discrediting the \ntest, the Federal Trade Commission wrote:\n\n       Our action today ensures that tobacco companies may not \n     wrap their misleading tar and nicotine ratings in a cloak of \n     government sponsorship. Simply put, the FTC will not be a \n     smokescreen for the tobacco companies' shameful marketing \n     practices.\n\n  That is from the Federal Trade Commission, hardly an ideological or \npartisan organization. That is their quote on discrediting the test the \nFTC conducted.\n  In addition, the National Cancer Institute has determined there is no \nevidence that reducing tar to a degree even greater than called for in \nthe Burr substitute actually results in a reduction of risk of disease. \nThe Burr substitute makes it likely that Americans will continue to be \nmisled by nicotine and tar figures that appear to have the government \nstamp of approval, believing that cigarettes with lower tar numbers are \nsafer. The National Cancer Institute is an organization that is highly \ncredible and respected. The Burr substitute does not adequately protect \nconsumers from misleading health claims about tobacco products, a very \nserious problem. The bipartisan bill sets stringent, but reasonable, \nscientific standards before manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless \ntobacco products are allowed to claim that their products are safer or \nreduce the risk of disease.\n  The Burr substitute completely exempts smokeless tobacco products \nfrom these standards, no matter how spurious and even if those claims \nare likely to cause youth to take up tobacco for the first time. \nSupporters of this proposal argue we should allow and encourage the use \nof smokeless tobacco because it is less harmful than smoking. But this \nwas refuted in 2003\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\nby Surgeon General Richard Carmona, who was appointed by President \nBush, when he addressed a congressional committee.\n  Let me quote the Surgeon General:\n\n       Do not fall for the myth--a very dangerous public health \n     myth--that smokeless tobacco is preferable to smoking.\n\n  Again, this is the Surgeon General. Going back several \nadministrations, Surgeons General, Secretaries of Health and Human \nServices, this is an issue that does not divide people. President \nBush's Surgeon General was a fine man, Richard Carmona. I see my friend \nfrom Arizona. I believe Richard Carmona is from Arizona. I had an \nopportunity to meet with him and talk with him in the past, and he did \na good job.\n  I will quote him again:\n\n       Do not fall for the myth--a very dangerous public health \n     myth--that smokeless tobacco is preferable to smoking.\n\n  He went on to say, and I quote him further:\n\n       No matter what you may hear today or read in press reports \n     later, I cannot conclude [as Surgeon General] that the use of \n     any tobacco product is a safer alternative to smoking.\n\n  And the 2008 Update of the U.S. Public Health Service Clinical \nPractice Guidelines regarding tobacco cessation concluded:\n\n       [T]he use of smokeless tobacco products is not a safe \n     alternative to smoking, nor is there evidence to suggest that \n     it is effective in helping smokers quit.\n\n  Senator Burr's substitute only allows the agency to look at the \nhealth impact on individual users of tobacco products. It does not \nconsider whether the reduced risk claim would increase overall public \nhealth harms by increasing the number of youth who begin using tobacco \nproducts or reducing the number of current users who quit. Senator \nBurr's and our colleague Senator Hagan's standard would allow health \nclaims that would increase tobacco use levels and increase the total \namount of harm thus caused by tobacco use.\n  To prevent health claims from being used to increase the number of \ntobacco users, our bipartisan bill gives the Food and Drug \nAdministration authority over how these products are marketed. Senator \nBurr's substitute eliminates that authority, putting our youth at \ngreater risk. If you eliminate that authority, then, obviously, you \nhave torn the heart out of what we are trying to achieve.\n  Senator Burr's substitute fails to give even the new agency it \ncreates the authority to reduce youth access to tobacco products. \nUnlike our legislation, Senator Burr's substitute does not establish or \nfund a nationwide program to reduce illegal tobacco product sales to \nchildren. In addition, because the Burr substitute allows any retailer \nto fully escape responsibility for illegal sales if the employer's \nemployees have signed a form saying they were informed that it is \nillegal to sell to underage youth, no matter how often the retail \noutlet is caught doing so, and no matter how strong the evidence that \nthe employer looks the other way, it provides a significantly less \neffective approach than the one we have in the substitute, the \nbipartisan substitute that is before us.\n  The Burr substitute's minimum standards for State youth access laws \nare also too weak. The youth access standards in Senator Burr's \nsubstitute are riddled with loopholes that make them ineffective. For \nexample, a retailer who never enforces the law against illegal sales to \nyouth cannot be fined if the retailer has conducted a training program \nfor its staff, even if it repeatedly looks the other way when illegal \nsales to youth are made. In addition, the vast majority of States \nalready have laws in place that exceed the minimum standards in Senator \nBurr's substitute.\n  At any rate, these are all reasons why I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Burr substitute. Our bipartisan bill, as I say, has been endorsed--\nI have been here for some time. I have never heard of a piece of \nlegislation being endorsed by 1,000 organizations: faith-based, State, \nas well as all the credible national public health or health \norganizations in the country. That is not reason enough, but understand \nwe voted overwhelmingly in both Chambers, just not in the same \nCongress, over the last 6 or 7 years on this proposal.\n  Again, I want to say to my colleagues who come from tobacco-producing \nStates, I understand the impact this kind of bill can have, and, in \nfact, we hope it has, with the reduction of smoking by all generations \nand all age groups, but particularly among children. I certainly stand \nready and prepared to do what we can to help those farmers and others \nwhose jobs and livelihoods depend on this industry, who, through no \nfault of their own but through their livelihoods, are engaged in this \nbusiness. We want to provide that transitional help.\n  But we cannot stop doing what needs to be done. With 400,000 people a \nyear dying--more deaths due to this self-inflicted disease than AIDS, \nmurders, illegal drugs, suicides, alcohol abuse, automobile accidents--\nall of those combined--they do not equal the number that tobacco use \ncauses. With 3,000 to 4,000 kids starting every day, I think my \ncolleagues understand this cries out.\n  We are about to begin a health care debate. Prevention is a major \nissue. We are all trying to work on ideas to incentivize healthy living \nstyles. What an irony it would be, on the eve of the emerging debate \nabout prevention, that we had an opportunity to make a difference in \ndoing just that, with having 900,000 adults who stopped smoking and \n700,000 kids--maybe those are numbers that are not as impressive as we \nwould like them to be--but if we can save 700,000 children's lives and \n900,000 adults, to have them stop smoking and not get involved in this \nhabit, what a difference it would make.\n  I have talked about deaths. There are people who live with this \nstuff--the emphysema. The cost--even if you are not impressed with the \nethics of it, the morality of it, if the numbers is the only thing that \ndrives you, we are spending billions of dollars every year to provide \nfor people who are suffering from smoke-related illnesses.\n  So on the eve of the great health care debate, what a great way to \nbegin that by saying, at least in this one area, we are going to do \nsomething about the children in this country. We are going to do \nsomething that is long overdue on the manufacturing and the marketing, \nas well as in the production of these products. We are going to say to \nthe Food and Drug Administration: Take over here. Take a look at all of \nthis. Provide the regulations and the guidelines. If we can do it for \nthe produce or the foodstuffs we provide for every pet in this country, \nwe ought to be able do it for the American children.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6155-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6155-S6156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss recent events in \nNorth Korea. On April 5, the North Koreans tested a long-range Taepo \nDong 2 missile, which traveled nearly 2,000 miles before falling into \nthe Pacific Ocean. This test, which the North Koreans described as an \nattempt to launch a satellite into orbit, represented an improvement in \nthe range of North Korea's missiles. In 2006, the Taepo Dong 2 only \ntraveled 1,000 miles and did not successfully reach a second stage, as \nthe most recent missile did.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718 prohibits the country's use of \nballistic missile technology, and the United Nations Security Council \nissued a statement on April 13 condemning the recent launch and calling \non member states to implement existing sanctions against North Korea.\n  In response, North Korea abandoned the six-party talks, promising to \nreactivate its nuclear program and never to return to the six-party \nnegotiating table.\n  Less than 2 weeks later, North Korea conducted a nuclear test. \nBetween the Taepo Dong 2 test and the nuclear test, North Korea also \nlaunched at least five shorter range missiles. Intelligence reports \nalso indicate another long-range test is in the offing for later this \nmonth or early July.\n  So far, world response to this latest illicit behavior has been one \ndimensional, with leaders around the globe issuing condemnations of \nvarying strength. President Obama issued a clear condemnation of North \nKorea's action, stating:\n\n       North Korea's ballistic missile programs pose a great \n     threat to the peace and security of the world and I strongly \n     condemn their reckless action.\n\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\n\n  Secretary Clinton echoed the President's remarks and emphasized, as \nthe President did in his April speech in Prague that--and I am \nquoting--``there are consequences to such actions.'' The question is, \nit is unclear what consequences the administration has in mind. And \nSusan Rice, our Ambassador to the United Nations, has been reluctant to \ncommit U.S. support for the inclusion of sanctions in the U.N. \nresolutions currently being drafted.\n  Despite North Korea's detonation of a nuclear device and test of \nlong-range missiles designed to threaten us, the relationship between \nthe United States and North Korea has not substantially changed. There \nare, however, several things that the United States could do to back up \nits condemnation of North Korea's reckless actions. Thankfully, we have \na number of options available to us, and we are not faced with the \n``shoot first, ask questions later'' approach that former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry advocated in a 2006 Washington Post editorial, \nwhen he argued that the United States had no other option than to \ndestroy North Korea's missiles on their launching pads.\n  First, the United States could return North Korea to the state \nsponsor of terrorism list. North Korea was removed from this list when \nit agreed to a series of measures related to the disablement of its \nplutonium production at the Yongbyon reactor. Now that North Korea has \nrenounced that agreement and restarted its nuclear program, there is no \nreason it should not return to that list.\n  President Obama indicated his support for this type of strategy on \nthe campaign trail, saying:\n\n       If the North Koreans do not meet their obligations, we \n     should move quickly to reimpose sanctions that have been \n     waived, and consider new restrictions going forward.\n\n  Second, the United States could reimpose financial sanctions on high-\nlevel North Korean officials and banks affiliated with the North Korean \nGovernment. In March 2007, the U.S. Treasury ordered U.S. companies and \nfinancial institutions to terminate their relationships with Banco \nDelta Asia over alleged links between the bank and the Government of \nNorth Korea and froze certain funds of high-ranking North Korean \nofficials.\n  Third, the United States could expand defense and nonproliferation \ninitiatives. President Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen \nrecently argued in the Washington Times for reversing President Obama's \ndeep cuts to missile defense programs. I agree with Secretary Cohen \nthat the President's $1.4 billion of cuts do not send the right signals \nto those who seek to threaten us, especially those who tout ballistic \nmissiles as the chief element of their threats.\n  President Obama, in direct support of U.N. Security Council \nResolutions 1695 and 1718, could also expand interdiction and \nintelligence cooperation under the Proliferation Security Initiative \nwith our new partner, South Korea.\n  As the President said in Prague:\n\n       Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words \n     must mean something.\n\n  These commonsense steps would send a clear message to the North \nKoreans and their partners in proliferation that the United States is \nserious when it repeatedly refers to consequences and is willing to \nemploy all measures and its full leverage in order to influence North \nKorea and avoid conflict.\n  Of course, the United States should work with the international \ncommunity to enlist its support for increasing pressure on the North \nKoreans, and the administration has signaled its support for a \nmultilateral approach through its focus on working through the United \nNations. But this approach is already limited by North Korea's history \nof disregarding U.N. action and by continued Russian and Chinese \nwaffling. I am not convinced new U.N. resolutions would be treated any \ndifferently by North Korea than the ones it has already ignored. Its \nrecord has led some to question whether a regime so willing to wreak \nfamine and destruction on its own people is not beyond the traditional \napplication of ``carrot and stick'' diplomacy.\n  Moreover, our effort to work with other nations does not excuse us \nfrom the responsibility to act ourselves. If Russia or China will not \nsanction North Korea, is that any argument that the United States \nshould not? Of course not. We can offer nations attractive terms for \ntheir support, such as help in dealing with increased flow of North \nKorean refugees, trade incentives, or enhanced military-to-military \ncooperation, such as revoking the misguided Obey amendment and allowing \nJapan to purchase an export variant of the F-22 fighter. However, if \nother nations conclude that holding North Korea accountable is not in \ntheir interest, then we must not let that prevent us from doing what is \nbest in our interest.\n  The gravity of events in North Korea is only increased by the similar \ndisagreement between the international community and Iran on the \nsubject of its nuclear program. If strong words are followed by weak \nand ineffective action toward North Korea, why should Iran expect \ndifferent treatment? Conversely, if we display resolve and fortitude in \nconfronting a belligerent North Korea that uses nuclear explosions and \nballistic missiles as foreign policy tools, we send a powerful message \nto the rest of the world of our sincere commitment to nonproliferation \nand regional stability. This is doubly important considering the well-\nknown cooperation between North Korea and Iran on a variety of illicit \nprograms.\n  While some debate the proper U.S. response, I believe one thing is \ncertain: Past negotiations have not been successful. North Korea has \nnot been an honest negotiator, preferring to use, instead, ``missile \ndiplomacy'' to spark international panic and extract a concession--\ntypically fuel or grain shipments--from a worried international \ncommunity. This process, in various permutations, happened in 1993, \n1994, 1998, 2006, 2007, and it may repeat itself in 2009.\n  For those who would not repeat the blunders of the past, North \nKorea's actions have forced an unwelcome choice on the world: either \nNorth Korea is a threat and we must take actions across all fronts to \nisolate the regime and defend our Nation and our allies against its \nconsiderable capabilities or these actions are the benign outbursts of \na misunderstood regime.\n\n  The President has clearly said that North Korea poses a threat to \nworld peace and security. It is now a question of matching action to \nrhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 20 years ago this week, on June 3 and 4 in \n1989, the world watched the Communist Government of China violently \ncrack down on peaceful demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. We all \nremember that. It is hard for me to believe it has been 20 years ago.\n  One picture that is forever imprinted on our minds and our memories \nis that of a lone Chinese student who stood before a line of army tanks \nfollowing days of violence that had resulted in hundreds killed and \nthousands more wounded. We never did find out what happened to that \nyoung student. I assume he was taken away, tortured, and killed, but we \ndon't know that. He displayed tremendous courage in the face of tyranny \nand injustice. For weeks, students had raised their voices demanding \ngreater democracy, basic freedoms of speech and assembly, and an end to \ncorruption. While the photo of this student became infamous to the \nworld as a picture of the Chinese people and their desire for true and \nlasting freedom and democracy, it remained virtually unknown to the \npeople of China due to the Chinese Government's continued censorship \nand oppression.\n  On March 25, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy \nPelosi, while on a trip to China, remained silent regarding the ongoing \nhuman rights abuses there. Instead, she talked about the government on\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nglobal warming and issues such as that. This week in Beijing, U.S. \nTreasury Secretary Tim Geithner followed the Pelosi model, remaining \nmute on human rights abuses that are going on today, and spoke only of \nenvironmental issues.\n  In 2005, I gave a series of speeches on the threat China poses to our \nNation. Now, 4 years later, we are in a position where they are the \nlargest holder of our national debt, and my concerns regarding China \nremain the same.\n  I have spent many years in activity in Africa, primarily Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and right now we are competing with China for the energy that \nis there. China is doing a better job than we are. They are competitors \nof ours not just militarily but economically. It is of great concern to \nme that as we continue to grow in our relationship and our dependence \non China, our U.S. Government officials seem to place more value on the \nChinese Government's treatment of the environment than the treatment of \ntheir own people and the threat they pose to our Nation.\n  On the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Pelosi and \nGeithner's omission is a disgrace to the memory of those who stood and \nmany who died as they pleaded with the government to allow them basic \nfreedoms that we as Americans possess and enjoy.\n  Sadly, ignoring these issues is exactly what the Government of \nBeijing wants. They would like nothing more than to erase the memory of \nthe Tiananmen Square massacre from our minds and from the minds of all \npeople around the world. The Chinese Government would like us to forget \nthat in June of 1989, they used lethal force of 300,000 troops strong \nto crush peaceful protestors who were seeking greater freedoms. The \nChinese Government would like the image of that courageous man standing \nbefore the line of tanks to fade from our memory. However, we can't \nforget the hundreds who were murdered, the thousands who were injured, \nand the more than 20,000 people who were arrested and detained without \ntrial due to the suspected involvement in the protests, specifically in \nTiananmen Square.\n  We don't know today where those people are. Most likely, they are \nstill incarcerated someplace or they have been killed. The Communist \ngovernment is so bent on wanting us to forget these issues that they \nhave shut down blogs, blocking access to individual news sources such \nas Twitter, and denied access to popular sites such as YouTube.\n  Since Tiananmen Square, China has continued to increase severe \ncultural suppression of ethnic minorities such as the Tibetans, the \nUighurs; increase persecution of Chinese Christians, the Falun Gong, \nand other religious groups and other minorities; increase detention and \nharassment of dissidents and journalists; and has maintained tight \ncontrols on freedom of speech and access to the Internet. We know \njournalists who right now are still incarcerated over there, but there \nis no trace of exactly where they are.\n  Despite the promises to the contrary, China didn't provide greater \naccess to the international media during the 2008 Olympic Games. Unlike \nthe previous hosts of the past games, the Government in Beijing blocked \naccess to certain Internet sites and media outlets in an attempt to \ncensor free speech.\n  As China grows economically and continues to exert its influence \nglobally and thus considers itself a significant player on the world \nstage, I believe China should be held to a standard of political, \nreligious, and ethical responsibility.\n  Our country was founded by those who were seeking basic freedoms, and \nwe have to stand for those who are doing the same in other countries. \nWhen basic freedoms can be practiced, countries thrive and prosper \nbecause people are allowed to choose a better way of life for \nthemselves. We must also recognize the danger we place ourselves in by \nbecoming closer and more dependent upon nations that continue to \nsilence their people, deny them access to information and the ability \nto practice their cultures and beliefs. That is what is happening \ntoday.\n  On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, my \ncolleague Senator Brown and I have introduced S. Res. 167 to remember \nthe families and the victims who were killed in the June 1989 protest \nand to call on the Government of China to put an end to its continuing \nhuman rights violations. Our country must not remain silent, and many \nof my fellow colleagues in the Senate who are cosponsors of this \nresolution agree.\n  This resolution calls on the Chinese Government to release all \nprisoners still in captivity as a result of their suspected involvement \nin Tiananmen Square protests and to release all others who are \ncurrently being imprisoned without cause. This resolution puts the \nSenate on record, encouraging the Chinese Government to allow freedom \nof speech and to access information, while ending the harassment, \nintimidation, and imprisonment practices the government has carried out \nagainst those who are minorities and who seek religious freedom. We \nalso call on our government to uphold human rights in China. Our \nsilence only dishonors those who lost their lives and freedoms in \nTiananmen Square.\n  We have this resolution right now. So far, we have cosponsors who \nhave just found out about it and called in, including, in addition to \nSenator Brown and myself, Senators Graham, Lieberman, Kyl, Coburn, \nVitter, Menendez, Webb, and Brownback. I encourage others to join in \nthis message that I believe is a very clear message that should be sent \nby the United States.\n  Today--this very day, this moment--there are 150,000 people who are \nprotesting in Hong Kong right now because of the problems we are \naddressing with this resolution. So I encourage my colleagues to join \nin this resolution and get this message out loud and clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6157-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, one of our colleagues from Illinois was \ntalking about their desire to have these detainees from Guantanamo Bay \ncome into the United States for trial. Let me just suggest--I am not a \nlawyer, but I do know this: I have spent a lot of time down there. I \nknow the situation. I know it is a resource that we have to have, that \nwe have to keep. There is no justification at all for closing \nGuantanamo Bay. No justification. All we hear is: Well, this came at a \ntime when there was suspected terrorism or torture of prisoners in \nother areas. But never at Gitmo. There hasn't been a documented case of \ntorture that went on there. This is a resource we need.\n  My friend from Illinois suggests bringing them to this country. The \nrules of evidence are different. These are not criminals, these are \ndetainees. The proper place for them to be adjudicated is in the \ntribunals. The only place available right now is the tribunal that is \nset up in Gitmo.\n  If we bring them to this country, under our laws, quite a few of \nthose would actually be released. When they are released, they could be \nreleased into society. For those who say we need to use some 17 areas \nfor incarceration in the United States, as opposed to using Gitmo, to \nincarcerate these people, that would become 17 magnets for terrorist \nactivity in the United States.\n  We have to get over this thing of everybody lining up and saying we \nhave to close it. Guantanamo Bay is something we need, and we have to \nhave it. There is not a pleasant alternative. It would cause the \nrelease of terrorists in the United States. If that is what the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the Democrats and the President want, they are going \nto find that virtually all Americans disagree with them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As my colleagues know, supporting the development and \nexpansion of the nuclear industry is something that has been one of my \ntop priorities since I came to the Senate. I have been working to shape \nnuclear policy in this country for the past 8 years as chairman or \nranking member of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. I wish \nto recognize my colleague, Senator Inhofe, for the leadership he \nprovided before I became chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \ncommittee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nWhen he was Governor of Ohio, he had the reputation of being the most \nknowledgeable person on air issues. Of course, the primary concern we \nhad at that time was that we had a crisis in energy, and the one thing \nthat had to be in the mix to resolve that crisis was to do something \nwith nuclear power. There is nobody who has carried that banner more \nforcefully than the Senator from Ohio. I appreciate our joint efforts \nto make that happen. I believe we will be successful with the number of \napplications that are there right now and the progress that has been \nmade.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I take pride in the fact that our committee has helped \ntransform NRC into one of the best and most respected regulatory \nagencies in the world. We have worked very hard on placing the right \npeople on the Commission and providing the Commission with the \nresources and tools necessary to do its job and holding them \naccountable to the results. In fact, we have held more than 20 hearings \ninvolving the NRC in the past 8 years. So it is no accident that we \nhave seen a dramatic improvement in both the safety record and the \nreliability of the 104 operating nuclear reactors today over the past 8 \nyears. Without the public confidence that these plants are safe and \nsecure, there won't be any nuclear renaissance.\n  We have spent time and effort to make sure the NRC has the \nresources--particularly the human capital--it needs to make sure that \nour 104 nuclear plants are operating safely but also to ensure it can \nprocess multiple license renewal applications and combined license \napplications for the new plants coming on board. We wanted to make sure \nthe NRC doesn't become the bottleneck.\n  In 2005, we introduced three pieces of legislation as part of the \n2005 Energy Policy Act to provide flexibility in hiring and employee \nretention. As a result, the NRC was able to hire over 1,000 highly \nqualified engineers and scientists over the last 3 years to replace \nretiring workers and also bring on those new people who are going to be \nnecessary to process the new applications coming in. I am also pleased \nto note that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been rated as the \nbest place to work among Federal agencies for 2 years in a row. They \nhave a great workforce, and they are a top-notch organization.\n  The good news is that the NRC now has 17 applications for 26 new \npower reactors under review. All indications are that NRC's review of \nthe applications is progressing on schedule. I haven't heard a \ncomplaint from anybody who filed applications. We are expecting that \nthese applications will be approved in late 2010 or in early 2011. \nObviously, it is not a done deal, but we have every reason to believe \nwe are on the right track. As a matter of fact, five utility companies \ntoday--Southern in Georgia, SCANA in South Carolina, NRG in Texas, \nConstellation in Maryland, and Progress in Florida--have signed \nengineering-procurement-construction contracts and are gearing up for \nconstruction pending NRC approval and loan guarantees from the DOE. In \nother words, we are starting to take off in terms of getting some air \nunder our wings.\n  Mr. President, I have an opinion piece I wrote in the Nuclear News \nmagazine last year, entitled ``Making the Nuclear Renaissance a \nReality.'' This paper outlines the need to expand the use of nuclear \nenergy in the carbon-constrained economy and provides a roadmap to \novercome challenges faced by the nuclear industry.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read this. Anybody interested \ncan get it on my Web site, voinovich.senate.gov.\n  As I watch the climate change debate unfold in this Congress, I rise \nto raise the same concern I raised last year during the debate on the \nLieberman-Warner climate change bill: We cannot get there from here \nwithout nuclear.\n  The Waxman-Markey bill that was reported out of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee 2 weeks ago sets the greenhouse gas emission \nreduction cap at 80 percent by 2050, as did the Lieberman-Warner bill \nlast year, but it continues to ignore the need for much wider use of \nemission-free nuclear energy in order to make this extremely aggressive \ngoal.\n  I pointed out then that one of the glaring holes in the Lieberman-\nWarner bill was its deafening silence on nuclear, while studies \nconducted by EPA, EIA, and others pointed to an inconvenient truth for \nsome people: More than doubling the number of nuclear plants would be \nrequired; that is, bringing online more than 100 new nuclear plants in \nthe next 40 years, in order to meet the emission goals set in that \nlegislation. Around the world, governments are reaching the same \nconclusion and are turning to nuclear energy as a safe, homegrown, \ncost-effective, and emission-free solution to increasing energy demand.\n  This is true in Europe especially, where the nuclear renaissance is \nin full swing. In France, for example, almost 80 percent of its \nelectricity comes from nuclear power. In fact, France exports a good \ndeal of its nuclear power-generated electricity to its neighboring \ncountries, including Germany. President Sarkozy has announced plans to \nbuild five additional plants within the next 5 years, in addition to \none currently under construction.\n  Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently signaled his intent to rebuild \nnuclear energy in the United Kingdom, saying:\n\n       Whether we like it or not, we will not meet the challenges \n     of climate change without the far wider use of nuclear power.\n\n  He went on to note that the International Energy Agency estimates \nthat we are going to have to build 32 nuclear powerplants each year if \nwe are going to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That is more \nthan 1,300 new reactors.\n  Italy, Finland, and Switzerland have all announced plans to build new \nreactors after spending the past 25 years trying to phase out nuclear \npower. These European countries have come full circle in reembracing \nnuclear after two decades of trying to solve their energy and \nenvironmental challenges with conservation and renewables alone. That \nis significant.\n  Unfortunately, many proponents of a cap-and-trade scheme, such as \nLieberman-Warner or Waxman-Markey, seem to be stuck on fantasies that \nwe can achieve the emission reduction goals with just conservation, \nefficiency, and renewables. Even those who believe nuclear has a role \nto play espouse policies that overwhelmingly favor renewables over \nnuclear.\n  A case in point: Nuclear energy was conspicuously missing from the \n$787 billion stimulus package, while approximately $40 billion in \nvarious tax credits went to energy efficiency, renewables, and \ntransmission. I am not opposed to that, but why did they ignore \nnuclear?\n\n  So it was particularly discouraging when the Senate version of the \nlegislative language providing an additional $50 billion in loan \nguarantee authority in the stimulus bill was stripped from the final \npackage during conference. Who did it? Why? The same thing happened \nwhen the Senate version of the budget resolution was passed a few weeks \nago. We had it in there. We know we have to increase the Loan Guarantee \nProgram to at least $50 billion, and it got stripped out again. \nInstead, the majority added the taxpayer-paid $60 billion Loan \nGuarantee Program allocated solely for renewables--wind, solar, and \ngeothermal--and electric transmission systems to support renewable \ngeneration.\n  If you can do a priority in spending big money, let's do the grid. \nThe grid is not what it should be. It has to be improved so that we can \nuse wind and solar and get energy out across this country.\n  Unfortunately, many of the supporters of green energy never mention \nthat it is unrealistic to rely solely on wind and solar power. This is \nsomething that I think needs to be made clear to every person in the \nUnited States, particularly our children, who are being taught in \nschool that windmills and solar power are the way to the future in \nterms of the energy needs of America, and there is something wrong, and \ncoal is bad, nuclear is bad. I hear it constantly from people when I go \nback to Ohio. Right now, 50 percent of our electricity is generated by \ncoal; 20 percent by nuclear; 19 percent by natural gas; 6 percent by \nhydro; 3 percent by wind, solar, and geothermal; and 2 percent by oil. \nGiven this current makeup of U.S. energy use, I don't think these folks \nare leveling with the\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\nAmerican people about the reality of what is possible.\n  They continually tout the need to increase the renewable energies to \nsolve our dependence on foreign sources of energy. They say we need to \ndouble our use of renewables. I tell you this: A doubling of the \nutilization of renewables will bring us to 6 percent, and it would \nlikely take at least 10 years or more to accomplish. Further, it is \nunlikely that a doubling in renewables would lead to any significant \ndecrease in the use of oil because oil only produces 2 percent of the \nelectricity in the country today.\n  Particularly, I think it is incredible that some policymakers, such \nas the newly appointed Chairman of FERC, suggest we can get our energy \nneeds strictly from renewable sources of energy. Give me a break. At \nonly 3 percent of total U.S. electric generation, it is simply \nintellectually dishonest to suggest that these renewable sources can \nreplace the 70 percent of the base-load electricity currently generated \nby coal and nuclear in this country.\n  Don't get me wrong, I do support expanding the use of renewables such \nas solar and wind, and we see that industry growing in my State. But to \njust say that is it and not to look at reality is intellectually \ndishonest. My point is that, realistically, we are not yet in a \nposition to be able to rely upon them for base-load power generation. \nThis is despite receiving government subsidies.\n  Here is another little statistic people are not aware of. Most \nAmericans are not aware of the fact that, in 2007, nuclear energy \nonly--this is according to the Energy Information Agency--received a \n$1.59-per-megawatt-hour subsidy while wind received $23.37 and solar \nreceived $24.34 per megawatt hour.\n  Today, there is a huge energy gap between renewable electricity and \nthe reliable, low-cost electricity we must have. We need to look at the \nway to get the job done. If we want to generate carbon-free \nelectricity, nuclear needs to be a big part of it--I am not saying the \nonly part, but it has to be a big part.\n  The 104 nuclear powerplants we have operating today, which is 20 \npercent of the electricity generated, represent over 70 percent of the \nNation's emission-free portfolio. In other words, the 20 percent coming \nfrom nuclear represents 70 percent of the emission-free electricity in \nthis country.\n  That means we are avoiding 700 million tons of carbon dioxide each \nyear because of nuclear--700 million tons.\n  What does that mean to the ordinary citizen? That means 13 million \ntons is avoided by wind and solar today. That is compared with 700 \nmillion in terms of nuclear power. To put this in perspective, 700 \nmillion tons of annual carbon emission that is being avoided by our \nnuclear plants is more than what Canada collectively emits each year. \nIn other words, nuclear nonemitting into the air is the equivalent of \nall of Canada. In terms of something we may better understand, it is \nthe equivalent of 130 million cars each year. That is what nuclear \npower is doing for us. In effect, it is the equivalent of reducing \nemissions of 130 million automobiles each year in this country.\n  Nuclear power is the best source we have available to meet our energy \nneeds while also curbing emissions of greenhouse gases. People are \nrecognizing the importance of nuclear energy because they understand \nthe facts.\n  Public opinion widely supports utilizing nuclear energy. According to \na recent Gallup poll, 59 percent of Americans support it. We are not \ngoing to be able to turn around our economy, meet our energy needs, and \nenact some of the environmental policies being discussed today without \nexpanding the use of nuclear energy.\n  I look at nuclear as a three-fer. Without it, we will not reach our \ngoal of reducing carbon emissions. Without it, we are not going to be \nable to provide the baseload electricity we are going to need for our \ncountry. And without it, we are not going to be able to rebuild our \nmanufacturing base in this country.\n  At a time when we are struggling to regain our economic footing, \nnuclear energy offers thousands of well-paying jobs in all stages of \ndevelopment and production. Each new nuclear plant will require an \naverage of 2,000 workers during construction, with peak employment at \n2,500 workers. If the industry were to construct 30 reactors that are \ncurrently planned, well over 60,000 workers would be required during \nconstruction. And once constructed, each plant will create 600 to 700 \njobs to operate and maintain it.\n  That is not to mention the ripple effect this undertaking would make \nin other areas of the economy. Aris Candris, CEO of Westinghouse \nElectric, and Mike Rencheck, president of AREVA, recently told me that \nabout 12,000 jobs will be created for each new nuclear plant if you \ninclude the manufacturing jobs.\n  This means that more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs will be created \nto supply the needed parts and components for the 30 nuclear reactors \nthat are currently planned.\n  And that is not counting the jobs associated with export \nopportunities to Europe, China, and India.\n  Organized labor understands expanding nuclear power will create a lot \nof well-paying jobs. In fact, here is what John Sweeney said at a \nroundtable discussion on nuclear workforce issues I chaired last year:\n\n       This isn't a Republican issue. This isn't a Democratic \n     issue. It's an American issue.\n\n  I couldn't agree with him more.\n  I have met with Mark Ayers, Building and Construction Trades national \npresident, a big union. He and his union members are actively \nsupporting construction of new nuclear plants. They have also partnered \nwith local community colleges and the nuclear industry in training \nworkers. They are already training workers for the renaissance.\n  I have been working hard to get this message out in the past several \nyears. Ohio and the surrounding Midwestern States have been the \nbackbone of this Nation's nuclear manufacturing base. Ohio's small to \nmedium-size enterprises are poised to lead the Nation's transition back \ninto this market. In fact, hundreds of manufacturing jobs are already \nin existence in Ohio to support the nuclear industry, and more are to \ncome in light of two announcements that are going to be coming up in \nthe next couple of weeks that Ohioans will be very happy about that \nagain will increase the number of people working in this industry.\n  I recently gave a speech at the Nuclear Manufacturing Infrastructure \nCouncil and had an opportunity to meet with several small manufacturing \ncompany executives. Their message was loud and clear: A clear policy \nstatement from the administration and Congress is absolutely critical \nin acknowledging that nuclear power generation will be a growing part \nof our Nation's energy mix and investments in programs that will \nsupport the nuclear industry's near-term implementation needs are \nabsolutely vital. The No. 1 thing is getting that $50 billion loan \nguarantee so we can get more of these people off the ground.\n  They all see the long-term potential growth in nuclear and they would \nlike to invest in nuclear manufacturing, but they need a clear \ncommitment from the government before they make those investments.\n  I think what these people are saying is we need Presidential \nleadership to acknowledge what most of us and the rest of the world \nalready know: We cannot get there from here without nuclear.\n  I am convinced that nuclear power is the only real alternative we \nhave today to produce enough low-cost, reliable, clean energy to remove \nharmful pollutants from the air, prevent the harmful effects of global \nclimate change, and keep jobs from going overseas.\n  The biggest challenge remains the financing, particularly in \nnonregulated States. The deepening global economic crisis is putting \nadditional pressure on the nuclear industry and on utilities.\n  As I mentioned, we have applications coming in, but right now DOE \ncurrently has 14 nuclear projects, representing a total project cost of \n$188 billion and loan guarantee requests of $122 billion. Basically \nwhat I am saying is that unless we can get this $50 billion loan \nguarantee taken care of, it is going to bring the progress we have been \nmaking to a halt.\n  A very important point that often gets lost in this discussion is the \nfact that the loan guarantee program authorized under the Energy Policy \nAct requires the borrowers to pay all the\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\nrequired fees, including what is called a subsidy cost and, thus, there \nis no cost to the government. In other words, if they borrow $5 \nbillion, they are going to have to come up with close to $1 billion to \nsecure that loan so if things do not go well on the loan, we have \nsomething to turn to.\n  The subsidy cost is levied on each loan guarantee, similar to a \ndownpayment on a mortgage, in case of a default. Any potential defaults \nare covered by fees paid by the applicants.\n  In my hand, I have a copy of a recent MIT study on the future of \nnuclear power. The authors of this study include former Clinton \nadministration officials John Deutch and Ernest Moniz. The central \npremise of the MIT study on the future of nuclear power is that in \norder to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming, \nwe must reevaluate the role nuclear power has as part of this country's \nenergy future.\n  I wish to share the conclusions of this report because I believe it \nfits rather nicely with this speech:\n\n       The current assistance program put into place by the 2005 \n     Energy Policy Act has not been effective and needs to be \n     improved. The sober warning is that if more is not done, \n     nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option \n     for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material \n     contribution to climate change risk mitigation.\n\n  I commend to my colleagues this MIT report on the future of nuclear \npower.\n  Another issue that has plagued the nuclear industry for decades is \nthe U.S. Government's failure to meet its commitment to assume \nresponsibility for spent nuclear fuel. First, let's set the record \nstraight. I have talked with many experts and policy people, including \nSecretary Chu and NRC Chairman Klein. They all assured me--it is \nimportant that everyone understands this--that the current spent \nnuclear that is being stored today in dry casks and pools are safe--are \nsafe--and are secure for at least 100 years. That is very important \nbecause folks are saying you cannot go forward with this because we \ndon't know what to do with the waste; we would like to do something \nmore permanent than what we are doing.\n\n  But the fact is that with the dry casks we have, we are in good shape \nfor at least 100 years. The lack of a repository at Yucca should not be \nsomething that inhibits us from licensing new reactors.\n  That being said, we must pursue a long-term solution now. If Yucca is \nnot going to materialize, then we owe the American people a viable \nalternative. The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act established a nuclear \nwaste fund, a fee paid by utilities to create a fund to deal with \nnuclear waste. Since its beginning, it has collected $29 billion. So \neveryone understands this, since that act went into effect, we have \ncollected $29 billion from ratepayers in this country. Unfortunately, \nthe fund is on budget and only about $9 billion was used to deal with \nwaste. The rest of the $20 billion amounts to little more than an IOU \nto U.S. ratepayers. Even if the administration decided to proceed with \nYucca, we don't have the money to build a repository. We spent the \nmoney on other things. We will have to borrow over $20 billion to \nreplenish the fund.\n  The Federal courts have ruled in favor of utilities. This is \nsomething else of which most people are not aware. And thus far we have \npaid utilities $550 million in damages because we have not come up with \na permanent repository for nuclear waste. I am sure if we keep going \nthe way we are, it is going to be in the billions.\n  I recently met with Secretary Chu, and he told me he would convene a \nblue ribbon panel to study Yucca. Unfortunately, I believe this is just \nkicking the can down the road for a couple of years. We have been \nstudying this for more than four decades. We need to provide clear \ndirection and certainty on this issue. The time for studying options is \nover, and the Federal Government must meet its legal obligations and \nstart taking care of the spent fuel problem sooner rather than later.\n  If the administration is pulling the plug on Yucca without having a \nviable alternative long-term solution, then I think we owe it to the \nAmerican people to refund their fees and stop levying fees.\n  I introduced the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Management Corporation \nEstablishment Act of 2008 in the last Congress, together with Senators \nDomenici, Murkowski, Alexander, and Dole, to create an independent \ngovernment corporation to manage the back end of the nuclear fuel \ncycle. The bill will also take the nuclear waste fund off budget and \ngive it directly to this corporation without the budget/appropriations \nprocess. I am planning to reintroduce that bill with Senators \nMurkowski, Alexander, and Burr, and I hope we can get additional \ncosponsors on the bill. It is about time we get serious about mapping \nout a future course for our Nation.\n  I firmly believe that utilizing nuclear energy as a key part of a \nmixed bag of energy sources offers us the best opportunity to truly \nharmonize our energy, the environment, and economic needs.\n  As I said before, nuclear energy offers thousands of well-paying jobs \nin all stages of development at a time when we are struggling to regain \nour economic footing. It is worth repeating--12,000 well-paying jobs \nwill be created with each new nuclear powerplant. That is 360,000 jobs \nfor the 30 nuclear reactors that are currently planned.\n  The American people get it, manufacturing gets it, the labor unions \nget it, and the international community--I have been to London, I have \nbeen to Paris, I have been to Austria. I have been around. All of them \nunderstand. In fact, I was on a climate change panel about a month ago \nthat was sponsored by the German Marshall Fund when we met in Brussels. \nI was amazed at the number of people who said: Mr. Senator, we are \nnever going to meet the Kyoto or Copenhagen goals for reducing our \nemissions without the use of nuclear power.\n  It is time President Obama and this Congress get it. We have to \nlaunch a nuclear renaissance in this country. We just cannot get there \nfrom here without nuclear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the question that has been \npostured before the Senate is, What has the stimulus bill done? It has \nsome fancy name--the recovery act--but, in effect, it is known as the \nstimulus bill. It was an expensive bill. With the country in the \neconomic doldrums that we have been in, it was hoped it was going to \nget money out there into the economy and provide a kind of electric \nshock therapy and stimulate the economy to get it moving again; that it \nwould turn the engine of the economy and, therefore, as those dollars \nin the stimulus bill got injected into the economy and it turned over, \nit was going to create jobs.\n  Indeed, the number of jobs that it was expected the stimulus was \ngoing to create was something like 2\\1/2\\ million. So the question is, \nIs it stimulating the economy? Well, a few minutes ago, the CEO of the \nShands Health Care Center at the University of Florida was in my \noffice. He told me the story of how the Shands Hospital in \nJacksonville--there are a number of these Shands Hospitals; it is a \ntrue medical center complex over several cities--was short some $35 \nmillion, and he didn't know what he was going to do and how that was \ngoing to affect their operation--possibly the shutdown of major \nportions of that hospital.\n  Remember that one part of the stimulus bill is that we were putting \nout money into Medicaid to help the States, and there were States that \nhad not been doing their part on Medicaid,\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nwhich is a joint State operation--generally with a funding formula of \nabout 55 percent Federal, 45 percent State. A lot of the States hadn't \nbeen putting their share in, or they had been constricting the \neligibility for the poor and the disadvantaged to have access to health \ncare for Medicaid. Well, with the beneficence of the stimulus bill, we \nput a lot of money back into the States. In Florida's case, it was \nabout $4.5 billion, just for Medicaid. It went from a funding formula--\nin Florida's case--of 55 to 45 for the 2-year period of the stimulus, \nto a funding formula of 67 percent Federal, 33 percent State. That has \nallowed him to stop the major abrupt halt of that hospital in \nJacksonville, FL.\n  Let me give another example. The big county hospital in Miami--\nJackson Memorial Hospital--is a similar case of about a $45 million \nwhack that was going to occur because of the State of Florida \nconstricting its Medicaid funding. The stimulus bill for Florida \nallowed that additional money to flow and, therefore, that hospital \nwill not have its services terminated for a good part of the medically \nneedy as well as the disabled.\n  Another example: In my State, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \nawarded over $100 million in stimulus funds to jump-start crucial \nEverglades restoration projects, such as the Picayune Strand and the \nSite 1 Reservoir construction. When you combine that with an additional \n$140 million in stimulus money for other projects such as water quality \nimprovements down in the Florida Keys, then the spending in Florida is \ngoing to create about 2,000 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs. \nOverall, the stimulus bill is going to create over 200,000 jobs in the \nState of Florida.\n  Another example: Seminole County School District. Seminole County is \nto the north of Orlando. It is a major bedroom community for the metro \nOrlando area. Well, they had a plan to eliminate 139 teachers. Because \nof the stimulus bill, they reversed that plan.\n  Clay County, to the south of Jacksonville, in northeast Florida--\nanother bedroom community for the metro Jacksonville area. It will \nbring back 26 elementary school teachers who had been laid off.\n  Another example: I am just taking a few examples. Miami, Dade County. \nIt has one of the largest highway improvement projects in our State--\nthe Palmetto Expressway. It has been under construction continuously \nsince 1994 because of the mass of people who utilize that arterial \nroadway. Now they are going to be able to complete that and put \nhundreds of people to work.\n  Another example: Northeast Florida. The military complex in \nJacksonville--the Jacksonville Naval Hospital and Kings Bay and Mayport \nNaval Station. The $40 million of stimulus funding is going to be spent \nover the next several years for improvements for those hospitals and at \nthe air station and at the Kings Bay submarine base, which means \narchitecture, construction, and engineering jobs on top of expanded \nhospital facilities and energy efficient upgrades.\n  Another example: St. Johns County, St. Augustine, FL--the oldest \ncontinuous settlement in the United States--1565. We are going to \ncelebrate the 450 year anniversary. We have 42 years on the English \nsettlement in Jamestown, VA. Not 1607, Jamestown; but 1565, St. \nAugustine. Well, their school system was going to cut teacher and staff \nsalaries and force them to take unpaid days. Now they are going to get \nan infusion of an additional $9 million this year and another $9 \nmillion next year so these cuts won't occur.\n  Going over to the West Coast of Florida--Tampa. The Tampa \nInternational Airport. It is going to create 250 new jobs using $8 \nmillion from the stimulus bill to go out there and improve a taxiway on \none of the major runways. This is a job that would not have been done \nhad it not been for this bill.\n  I will give one final example. Go back to north Florida. We have a \nhuge forestry industry in Florida. But as we have seen, Mother Nature \nhas not been kind in bringing us droughts. When a drought occurs, the \nforest becomes a tinderbox. When a match is struck or a lightning bolt \nstrikes, the forest erupts into an enormous fire that becomes a \ncontagion that can rage out of control and impinge on urbanized areas. \nWell, the Florida Department of Forestry is putting contractors to work \non fire mitigation projects in high-risk communities using a $900 \nstimulus grant.\n  It is helping in my State, and I suspect it is helping in all the \nother 49 States that are represented on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are desperately working to try to make \nsure we can move to amendments on H.R. 1256, a bill that attempts to \nconsolidate the regulatory responsibility for tobacco products under \nthe FDA.\n  This is being sold as a public health bill. I have been now to the \nfloor for over 3.5 hours in the balance of this week suggesting it does \nnot meet that threshold and that, at some point today, I would have the \nopportunity, along with Senator Hagan, my colleague, to give, in some \ndetail, what is in the substitute amendment.\n  I am going to attempt to do that now, even though we have not moved \nto the consideration of the other pending amendments. But let me start \nwith a chart I had used earlier today. The reason I make the claim that \nthis is not a public health bill is from this chart that shows the \ncontinuum of risk of tobacco products.\n  It starts on my right, your left, with nonfiltered cigarettes. The \nbaseline we use is that is 100 percent risky. The industry, at some \npoint, probably before I was born, all of a sudden created a filter \nthat went on the end of an unfiltered cigarette.\n  Because of that filter, it eliminated, it removed some of the \nconstituencies of the combustion of tobacco. That made it 10 percent \nless risky. The risk went from 100 to 90 percent. Then in the 1990s we \nhad a new product that was never marketed except in test markets. It \nwas a tobacco-heating cigarette, where it did not actually burn the \ntobacco, it heated the tobacco. It extracted the nicotine, delivered \nthe nicotine in the system but never produced smoke.\n  That product was considered to be about 45 percent risky but, \nclearly, a reduction at the time of 45 percent. All of a sudden, in the \npast 12 months, 18 months, we have seen a new product called an \nelectronic cigarette. Again, no tobacco is burned. It is a fairly \nexpensive product, it is popular outside the United States, not as \npopular or readily available in the United States. But that electronic \nproduct that has a cartridge you replace actually brought the risk \nlevel down to about 18 percent. Some might be catching on. As we have \nintroduced new products, we have brought the risk down, the health \nrisk, the risk of disease, of death.\n  Now we are over here to U.S. smokeless tobacco, a product that most \nAmericans understand. It is not the old snuff our parents and \ngrandparents grew up with, it is ground tobacco. All of a sudden, we \nrealize we reduced even further the health risk. It is now down at the \n10-percent risk level, 90 percent below where we started decades ago \nwith an unfiltered cigarette.\n  Now introduced in the marketplace in the past year is something I \nreferred to as Swedish smokeless snus, it is now on the market. It is \nsold, it is pasteurized, it is spitless. It was not something the \nUnited States or U.S. tobacco companies created, it is something the \nSwedes created.\n  Part of what I will get into is how the Swedes have used this product \nand\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\nother innovative products, other new products, in the marketplace to \nmove smokers from very risky products to less risky products. In the \ncase of Swedish snus, you see a risk level of about 2, maybe 3 percent.\n  Then we get over to a product that has yet to hit the market except \nfor test markets, the one I covered in great detail several hours ago \non the floor, a dissolvable tobacco product, one that was covered by \nCNN as a candy, one that still meets the age requirements and proof of \nID for somebody to purchase.\n  But to magnify CNN's report, they actually took that product from \nbehind the counter and put it in the candy section next to Reese's cups \nand gum and had an underage person come up and take one as CNN filmed \nto make it even more appealing from a standpoint of a story.\n  But this is the product. This is the product some have come to the \nfloor of the Senate and said looks like a cell phone. I am not sure. It \ndoes not look like my cell phone. Maybe it looks like someone's cell \nphone but not mine. It is not a product that is accessible for anybody \nwho does not produce an ID and does not meet the minimum age \nrequirements of that State.\n  Risk? About 1 or 2 percent. We are actually getting better with every \nproduct that is innovative: therapies, gums, patches, lozenges, \npharmaceuticals, negligible, if any, risk.\n  Let me explain why I started with this because the base bill that is \nbeing considered, 1256, takes these categories right here, nonfiltered \ncigarettes and filtered cigarettes, it locks them in forever. The \nlegislation says to the FDA: You cannot change these categories unless \nyou find some specific thing that would cause you to alter it. It \nforbids the FDA.\n\n  Even though H.R. 1256 creates a pathway to less-harmful products, it \nis a pathway that cannot be met because one of the conditions of new \nproducts entering the market is, you have to prove that people who \ndon't use tobacco products will not be enticed to use these products. \nIt also says you can't communicate with anybody in the public unless \nyou have a product that is approved.\n  I ask: How do you meet the threshold of proving that somebody who \ndoesn't use tobacco products is not going to use this product, if you \ncan't communicate with them until you get the product approved by the \nFDA? I have come to the conclusion, since nobody who is a cosponsor or \nauthor of the bill has come up with an answer, it can't be done.\n  To claim that this is a public health bill, one would have to make a \nreasonable claim that these products are going to be available and \nmaybe potentially more products in the future. But what H.R. 1256 does \nis, it cuts off availability of product right here. It says, on this \nside of the line, we have constructed a pathway that nothing will pass. \nI don't believe you can make a genuine claim that this is a public \nhealth bill when you have locked every user into the 90- or 100-percent \ncategory of risk.\n  Senator Hagan and I have offered a substitute amendment. That \namendment will be voted on about 4:30 today, if things go according to \nschedule. It is absolutely essential that Senators listen to their \nstaffs who have read the bill, read the substitute amendment, listened \nto the debate. I know there are a lot of things that go on during the \nday. It doesn't allow Members to sit down and listen to what Richard \nBurr is going to say. Hopefully, staff has looked at the statistics I \nhave presented, the facts I have brought to the table, the claims I \nhave made, and understands I am right. H.R. 1256 is not a public health \nbill.\n  The substitute does allow this to happen. We allow it to happen \nbecause the substitute doesn't concentrate regulation in the Food and \nDrug Administration, an agency that, by their mission statement, is \nrequired to prove safety and efficacy of all products they regulate. \nPharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, food safety, cosmetics, \nproducts that emit radiation--that is the world of the FDA. They \nregulate 25 cents of every dollar of the U.S. economy. They are the \ngold standard for every American. When they get a prescription and go \nhome to take it, they never wonder whether it is safe or whether it \nwill work because the gold standard in the world is the Food and Drug \nAdministration. When they go to a doctor's office and they get ready to \nuse a device, they don't question whether it was something the doctor \nmade in the back room. They know that device was approved by the FDA. \nUp until recently, they had every assurance when they bought food that \nthat food was not contaminated, that it wouldn't hurt them or kill \nthem. But as we know over the past several years, we have had things \nthat have slipped through, and Americans have died. The FDA is \nstruggling today to make sure that, in fact, they meet the demands of \nthe regulation they have in place.\n  What I am saying is, don't concentrate this regulation at the FDA. \nDon't jeopardize the gold standard. Employees work there with a \ncomplete understanding that if it doesn't pass safety and efficacy, it \ndoes not receive approval of the FDA.\n  Let me say it as I said it a couple hours ago. Tobacco products are \nnot safe. Tobacco products cause disease and death. There is no way the \nFood and Drug Administration, on their current mission statement, can \nregulate a product they can't prove safe and effective. If you try to \nput a square peg in a round hole, you will have reviewers at the FDA \nwho say: The gold standard is no longer important because Congress has \nlegislated that it is important. If I turn my head on tobacco products, \nI can turn my head on this medical device because it doesn't look like \nit is going to be dangerous. All of a sudden, something is going to \nslip through, a pharmaceutical product that kills somebody, a device \nthat does somebody damage, because we lowered our guard. We lowered the \nthreshold that every product must meet to get FDA approval.\n  I am not advocating for the Federal Government to sit back and do \nnothing with respect to tobacco. I am advocating that we craft a bill \nthat will achieve the real goals of what Federal regulation should \naccomplish: To reduce death and disease associated with tobacco and to \nreduce youth usage of tobacco products. That is exactly what our \nsubstitute amendment does. It is designed to keep kids from smoking. \nBut you can't keep kids from smoking if you are not willing to limit \nadvertising.\n  In the base bill, H.R. 1256, they limit print advertising to black \nand white. In the substitute amendment, we eliminate print advertising. \nLet me say that again. In the current base bill, they restrict print \nadvertising to black and white only. In the substitute amendment, we \neliminate the ability for print advertising. The substitute amendment \nis actually tougher on advertising than the base bill.\n  Specifically, the Burr-Hagan amendment bans outdoor advertising, \nyouth-organized sponsorships, usage of cartoon characters, sponsorship \nof events that youth attend, and many other provisions, all designed to \nlimit children's exposure to tobacco advertising.\n  Our amendment does not stop at print advertising. The amendment \ncodifies the other youth marketing restrictions contained in the Master \nSettlement Agreement of 1998 and makes it a crime for underage youth to \npossess tobacco products. Let me say that again. In 1998, all the \ntobacco companies got together, responding to State concerns that \nhealth care costs were out of control and that tobacco contributed to \nit. They provided $280 billion to all 50 States for two things: Cost \nshare of their health care and so they could create cessation programs \nto get people to quit.\n  I covered in great detail over the last couple days that even with \nthis money available, one State only spent 3.7 percent, not of their \ntotal money, of the amount of money CDC said was an adequate number to \nspend on cessation programs. No State hit 100 percent. There are some \nthat deserve gold medals for the fact that they were higher than \nothers.\n  I pointed out one yesterday. I will point it out again. The State of \nOhio is a large State. Of the amount CDC recommended Ohio should take \nof the tobacco money and devote to cessation programs, Ohio spent 4.9 \npercent. When you hear these numbers, no wonder we are not doing better \nat moving people off cigarettes to other products or getting them to \nquit altogether. It is because the effort we have made through \neducation has been pitiful. As a matter\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nof fact, 21.6 percent of the youth in Ohio have a prevalence to smoke; \n45 percent have a prevalence to alcohol; 17.7 percent have a prevalence \nto smoke marijuana. Yet some come to the floor and claim that if we \ngive this to the FDA, youth smoking, youth usage will go away. If that \nclaim were even partially correct, the marijuana usage would be zero \nbecause it is illegal. There is no age limit.\n  Some will claim we don't address labeling. We address labeling on \npackages of cigarettes to discourage children from even looking at \nthem. We require warning labels on the front and the back. We require \ngraphic warning labels that show gruesome and tragic cases of mouth \ncancer, lung cancer, and other pictures designed to deter children from \nsmoking. As my colleagues can see, keeping kids from tobacco \nadvertising is a key component to the Burr-Hagan substitute amendment. \nCompare that with the underlying bill, and they will not see the same \ncommitment to limit advertising that children see. The underlying bill \ncontains graphic warning labels but doesn't limit print advertising. \nTobacco companies would still be able to advertise in magazines such as \nPeople, U.S. Weekly, and Glamour--clearly, purchased by their parents \nbut accessed by their kids, and they can then see the black-and-white \nads.\n  Maybe in some weird way the authors of this bill thought children \ncan't read black and white, that they can only read color. That is why \nthey chose to limit it just to black-and-white advertising.\n  The only stipulation is, the ads would be in black and white. We can \ndo better. We can absolutely do better than this. Keeping children from \nusing tobacco products must be the first accomplishment of Federal \nregulation. The Burr-Hagan amendment accomplishes that goal with a two-\npronged attack. First, our amendment encourages States to use more of \ntheir MSA payments on cessation, putting billions of dollars into the \neffort. In the last 10 years, States have used just 3.2 percent of \ntheir total tobacco-generated money for tobacco prevention and \ncessation. In 2009, no State is funding tobacco prevention programs at \nCDC-recommended levels. Our amendment would change this by requiring \nStates to comply with the CDC-recommended spending levels on cessation \nprograms. It would no longer be voluntary.\n  In the case of Ohio, instead of spending 4.9 percent, Ohio would be \nobligated by law, if we pass the substitute amendment, to spend 100 \npercent of what the CDC said needed to be spent for us to successfully \nmake sure our Nation's children were given the message that the use of \ntobacco products is not an advantageous thing.\n  Studies show that when States commit the money to cessation, youth \nsmoking and smoking in general declines. Unfortunately, the underlying \nbill, H.R. 1256, contains no cessation program. Even though the bill \nrequires the manufacturers to pay up to $700 million a year, it \ncontains no cessation program. How can you call this a public health \nbill? How can we suggest this is going to reduce the risk of death or \ndisease? How can we make the claim we are going to reduce youth usage, \nwhen there is no commitment, no requirement to cessation?\n  Secondly, our amendment assists current smokers who are unable and \nunwilling to quit by acknowledging a continuum of risk of tobacco \nproducts, what I showed here. More specifically, our amendment does not \npreclude reduced exposure products from entering the marketplace. The \npiece over here, they lock this in. We try to pull all the 100 percent, \n90 percent over here to less harmful products because the objective in \nthis bill should be to reduce death and disease.\n  There is a great debate underway in the academic world on tobacco \ncontrols. Some advocate abolishment of tobacco. Straight abolishment is \nhard to achieve and can bring many unintended consequences such as \nelicit trade, and we all know that. Since abolishment is not an \neffective solution at this point, the question remains: How do we lower \ndeath and disease rates associated with smoking? Nicotine therapy has \nproven to be a failure. NIH states that patches and lozenges and other \nthings have a 95-percent failure rate. They fail because smokers don't \nphysically use these products as they do cigarettes. They are marketed \npoorly and are not designed to be a long-term solution. Under H.R. \n1256, the base bill, that trend continues.\n\n  Also, H.R. 1256 does not give manufacturers of nicotine products the \nregulatory framework needed to market and enhance smoking replacement \nproducts appropriately. Since we have scratched current nicotine \ntherapy products and abolishment as an effective means to stop smoking, \nthat leaves us with very few options. The most promising option the \nFederal Government can help perpetuate to reduce death and disease \nassociated with smoking is low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco products.\n  Until recently, the academic community resisted the fact that \nsmokeless products could aid in tobacco harm reduction. Skeptics, many \nof whom helped write the underlying bill, stated that smokeless tobacco \nproducts are gateway products that will lead to more children smoking.\n  Experience and data shows differently. Over the last 20 years, Sweden \nhas allowed tobacco manufacturers to promote low-nitrosamine snus, a \nsmokeless tobacco product, as an alternative to smoking.\n  This quote is from the Royal College of Physicians dated 2007:\n\n       In Sweden, the available low-harm smokeless products have \n     been shown to be an acceptable substitute for cigarettes to \n     many smokers, while ``gateway'' progression from smokeless to \n     smoking is relatively uncommon.\n\n  You get where I am going. The data is out there. I never dreamed we \nwould use Sweden as an example of where the United States would go. But \nwhen the focus is on how you reduce the risk of disease and death, they \nnever lost focus of what that was. They were not clouded as to the \nintroduction of new tobacco products in a blinded effort to lock in \nwhat existed. They experimented and found new products that would \nactually entice smokers to switch.\n  The claim that in some way, shape, or form these products are gateway \nproducts, that they will take nonsmokers and turn them into smokers--\nfor the Royal College of Physicians, in 2007: ``relatively uncommon.''\n  No statistic is perfect, and I am sure there are some who might have \nmade a decision to use one of these products. But as you saw on the \nchart before, had they decided to use it, the risk of that Swedish snus \nwas not 100 percent, it was 3 percent. There was no risk of heart \ndisease, COPD, lung cancer, the things that one might get from these \nproducts, as shown on the chart over here, that the base bill H.R. 1256 \nlocks in.\n  As a matter of fact, let me bring this other chart up: Harm \nReduction: Smokers, Quitters, Switchers. The question we have to ask \nis, do we want people to be smokers? Do we want them to be quitters? Or \ndo we want them to be switchers? Because this graph clearly shows you \nthat there is a reduction--quite dramatic--in the relative risk for \nquitters and switchers in relation to smokers. What every Member will \nhave to ask themselves, as they get ready to decide what they are going \nto do on this legislation, is: Do we want the American people to be \nsmokers? Do we want them to be quitters? Or do we want them to be \nswitchers?\n  If the answer is, you want them to be quitters or switchers, then it \nis very easy. Support the Burr-Hagan substitute. Because the base bill, \nH.R. 1256, does not create any effort to have quitters or switchers. \nAll it does is lock in smokers. And if the bill's intent is to reduce \nthe risk of death and disease, common sense tells you, without creating \nquitters and switchers we are not going to do a very good job of \nreducing the risk of death and disease.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining of the 30 \nminutes granted.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, you see the chart behind me. The Lancet supports the \ngoal of harm reduction. I will be honest with you, I do not know what \nthe Lancet is. But I have been told it is a very reputable health \npublication. But let me quote it:\n\n       We believe the absence of effective harm reduction \n     strategies for smokers is perverse,\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\n     unjust, and acts against the rights and best interests of \n     smokers and the public health.\n\n  A reputable health publication that basically says: The absence of \neffective harm reduction strategies acts against the rights of smokers \nand public health. But the base bill, H.R. 1256, has no effective harm \nreduction strategy, no pathway to harm reduction products. But they \nclaim it is a public health bill. A health care publication says that \ncannot happen. It is ``perverse.'' It is ``unjust.'' Well, they said \nit. I did not. But I think what they mean is, that to consider passing \nH.R. 1256, with the knowledge that has been given, would be perverse, \nunjust.\n  I am not going to have an opportunity to talk fully at this time \nbecause I have a colleague who will take the floor. But let me say, I \ntalked earlier about Camel Orbs and the way CNN portrayed this product \nas candy and staged a news event--well, ``news'' would be--let's say \n``entertainment'' event by taking this from behind the counter in a \nconvenience store and putting it in the candy section and having a kid \ngo up and pick the Orbs up out of the rack to say that it was candy.\n  Orbs represents a 99-percent reduction in death and disease \nassociated with tobacco use compared to cigarettes.\n  I ask my colleagues, if the objective of Federal legislation is to \nreduce the risk of death and disease--with nonfiltered cigarettes, it \nis 100 percent; with filtered cigarettes, it is 90 percent; and with \nOrbs, it is 1 percent--isn't it perverse and unjust not to allow the \nAmerican consumer to have this product to switch from cigarettes? I \nthink the answer to the question has already been answered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6164-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6164-S6165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIANANMEN CRACKDOWN\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 1989 was a seminal year in world history. \nLate in the year, on November 9, the Berlin Wall fell. And like \ndominoes, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria went from being \nSoviet satellites to nascent democracies.\n  The revolutions of 1989 would set the tone for the quick and peaceful \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. The winds of change were bringing \ndemocracy and freedom to the oppressed. I look forward to honoring the \npeaceful revolutions of 1989 later this year.\n  But I want to speak today about the revolution that never was, an \nevent that took place 20 years ago this week, in a country where people \nremain subject to totalitarianism and tyranny--a peaceful prodemocracy \nrally that was snuffed out with a brutality the world had not seen \nsince the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the USSR in 1968.\n  It started much like the revolutions of 1989. Hu Yaobang, the Sixth \nGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was famous for \nsupporting ideas like political reform and capitalism--not much \ndifferent from Lech Walesa of Poland or Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia.\n  When he died on April 15, 1989, thousands of Chinese students began a \npeaceful protest in Tiananmen Square in his honor and to call for \nsupport of his views. Protestors continued to assemble for weeks, \ncalling for nothing more than a dialog with their government and party \nleaders on how to combat corruption and how to accelerate economic and \npolitical reforms such as freedom of expression and democracy.\n\n  More than a million people would eventually gather in Tiananmen \nSquare in the shadow of the Forbidden City and the monument in front of \nChairman Mao's mausoleum. That 1 million people who congregated were \njust in Beijing. Protests had spread across the vast expanse of China, \nin city after city and community after community.\n  On the night of June 3, 1989, 15,000 soldiers with armored tanks \nstormed Tiananmen Square to put down the protests.\n  On June 4, the Chinese Red Army fired upon the protestors and those \nin the surrounding areas.\n  On June 5, as the crackdown continued, more than 300,000--300,000--\nChinese troops amassed in and around Tiananmen Square.\n  There, the world witnessed one of the pivotal moments of the 20th \ncentury--20 years ago this week--when an unknown protestor stood in \nfront of a column of Chinese Army tanks. He stood alone. Surely he \nwanted the tanks to stop. Just as surely, he wanted to stop the violent \ncrackdown. He has become an enduring symbol of freedom and democracy in \nthis country and around the world--but not in China, where the image \nand accounts of the heroic act are banned, attempts to erase it from \nhistory.\n  The identity and fate of this young man are not known. However, it is \ngenerally agreed that he died in a Chinese prison for his brave act of \nnonviolence.\n  The Chinese Government continues to deny Western estimates of 300 \ndead and 20,000 arrests and detentions during the Tiananmen crackdown.\n  The United States responded to the crackdown by suspending all \ngovernment and commercial military sales and all high-level government-\nto-government exchanges.\n  We cannot go back and change the past. But we can begin to hold China \naccountable for its actions. Not only does China continue to hold \npeople in jail based on their actions at the Tiananmen protest, but the \nfear from the crackdown continues to remind Chinese citizens of what \nthey may face should they try again to bring freedom and political \nreform to their nation.\n  Today, in Beijing, police are on the streets in and around Tiananmen \nSquare to preempt--not to control but to preempt--any observance of the \nanniversary.\n  In Hong Kong, 150,000 people showed up for a candlelight vigil in \nremembrance of those who died 20 years ago this week.\n  The government has shut down much of the Internet, including Western \nnews sources, for fear that its citizens may learn what really \nhappened. The police are using umbrellas to block cameras. It is a \nspectacle and it is a travesty.\n  For too long, the West has looked the other way as China declares a \nwar on human rights.\n  For too long, the West has rewarded China with lopsided trade \npolicies while China continues to carry out a war on minority cultures.\n  The United States should not endorse in any way the brutal and \nhorrific policies of the Chinese Government. Instead, we reward them. \nOur trade deficit with China in the first 3 months of this year was \nmore than $50 billion. Last year, it was a quarter trillion dollars.\n  China manipulates its currency. Most economists agree that the \nChinese yuan is 30 to 40 percent undervalued. That manipulation is a \npure and simple subsidy--a coerced and false price reduction--on \neverything it produces. It puts our manufacturers at a disadvantage, \nbut there is so much money to be made by U.S. investors that investors \nand large corporate interests and our government simply look the other \nway.\n  China profits from its abysmal human rights record. It profits from \nits nearly nonexistent environmental standards. But American investors, \nthe American Government, American business, look the other way.\n  China refuses to enforce its labor laws. But there is money to be \nmade. So American investors, American corporations, and the American \ngovernment look the other way. China benefits from its human rights \nabuses, but again, American investors, American corporations, and the \nAmerican Government look the other way.\n\n  Even before this current recession, the U.S. manufacturing sector has \nbeen in crisis. Forty thousand American factories have closed in the \npast decade. Since 2000, the United States has lost more than 4 million \nmanufacturing jobs, many in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nColorado, and 200,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio.\n  A 2008 study by the Economic Policy Institute found the United States \nhas lost more than 2.3 million jobs since 2001 as a direct result of \nthe U.S. trade deficit with China. We shouldn't let China profit from \nsuppression.\n  It is not just the Chinese who are pushing for the status quo. \nInvestors\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nwho profit from their investments in China--American investors, \nAmerican companies--actively support a regime that is trying to become \na global competitor with our Nation. Multinational corporations know no \nboundaries. Too often these companies leave their moral compass at \nhome.\n  The United States and all democratic governments should stand up to, \nrather than apologize for, China's brutal regime. If China seeks to \nbecome a responsible member of the international community, its actions \nshould match its aspirations.\n  Since the Tiananmen Square protest and crackdown, China has continued \nto deny its people basic freedoms of speech and religion and assembly. \nIt has increased severe cultural and religious suppression of ethnic \nminorities such as the Tibetans, the Taiwanese, and the Uighurs in \nwestern Muslim parts of China. It has increased persecution of Chinese \nChristians. It has increased detention and harassment of dissidents and \njournalists and has maintained tight controls on freedom of speech and \nthe Internet.\n  Earlier today I had the pleasure of meeting again with someone I \nworked with 10 years ago, Wei Jingsheng. Wei Jingsheng, who is about 60 \nnow, has been called the ``father of Chinese democracy.'' He spent 18 \nyears in prison. He was an electrician at the Beijing Zoo. He spent 18 \nyears in prison for the cause of freedom and democracy in his home \ncountry. He was jailed because the Chinese Government accused him of \nconspiring against it by writing about democracy. Since his release \nfrom prison for the second time, Wei Jingsheng this time was exiled to \nCanada. He has been a force for democratic change for his nation, \nfounding the Overseas Chinese Democracy Coalition and the Wei Jingsheng \nFoundation. He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize seven \ndifferent times. He lives in Washington, the capital of our democracy, \nbut he continues to fight for democracy in his home country.\n  The Chinese people, like Americans, are trying to live meaningful, \npeaceful lives and create a better world for their children. \nUnfortunately, they are held hostage by a brutal, one-party Communist \ntotalitarian regime. This regime benefits from many of our country's \npolicies, from lax trade enforcement to our lax response in the face of \nblatant human rights abuses. The United States, by its acquiescence, \nhas helped to prop up the Chinese Communist party. The partner in \nworking to prop up the Chinese Communist party is large U.S. \ncorporations.\n  Wei Jingsheng told me, as we walked the halls of the House of \nRepresentatives in 1999 during the discussion and debate on the \npermanent normal trade relations with China, he looked me in the eye \nand he said the vanguard of the Communist party revolution in the \nUnited States--the vanguard of the Chinese Communist party in the \nUnited States of America--is American CEOs. It was the American CEOs \nwho walked the halls of Congress in 1989--our Presiding Officer \nremembers this--who walked the halls of Congress in 1989 lobbying on \nbehalf of the Chinese Communist party dictatorship to get trade \nadvantages to China. It was the CEOs of many of America's largest \ncorporations who walked from office to office in the Senate and in the \nHouse of Representatives begging Members of the House and Senate to \nvote to give trade advantages to this Communist party dictatorship--\nthis dictatorship that oppresses its people, that inflicted violence on \nthose people in 1989, and has ever since. It was American CEOs who \nlobbied for trade advantages for China so that China, in the end, would \ntake millions of jobs from the United States of America--from Galion, \nOH, and Toledo, OH, and Akron and Youngstown and Dayton--hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in my State because American CEOs lobbied this House, \nthis Senate, and lobbied the Congress down the hall to give trade \nadvantages to the Communist party dictatorship in China. We have paid \nthe price. The Chinese people have paid an even more important price.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Inhofe to be introducing with him a \nresolution acknowledging the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square \nprotest and crackdown. The resolution is simple. It honors those who \ndied in the protest. It demands that China release its political and \nits religious prisoners.\n  Today as we look back on the Tiananmen protest, we honor the lives of \nthose who died in a struggle for freedom. Let's remember that brave, \nunnamed protestor in front of the tank who 20 years ago believed, like \nWei Jingsheng believes, that one person can change the world through \npeace and nonviolence. Think what a whole nation could do.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for \nup to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6165-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6165-S6169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, when I yielded the floor to allow Senator \nBrown to speak, I was in the process of describing the substitute \namendment to the base bill, H.R. 1256. Before I go back to that, let me \nshare with my colleagues the response to a letter from the Campaign For \nTobacco-Free Kids. They assessed the substitute bill and they provided \nin a letter to the committee why they found the substitute to be wrong. \nI will use that word.\n  Let me take on some of the things they raised in that letter. One, \nthey said that the Burr-Hagan bill would create a new bureaucracy that \nlacks the experience, expertise, and resources to effectively regulate \ntobacco products. I think I made it abundantly clear earlier today that \nunder the current regulatory framework for tobacco, every Federal \nagency in the United States has jurisdiction in it, except for the Food \nand Drug Administration. So to suggest that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has the experience or the expertise or the resources to \neffectively regulate this would be disingenuous. They have no \nexperience, because they haven't been involved in regulation. They do \nhave expertise, but expertise to prove safety and efficacy of products, \nnot to come to the conclusion that a product is unsafe and kills. Yet \nthey are not going to do anything to restrict its access or provide \nresources to effectively regulate tobacco products.\n  Incorporated in this base bill H.R. 1256 is, in fact, a surcharge on \nthe tobacco industry of $700 million over the first 3 years to fund--to \nprovide the resources--for the FDA to regulate the industry. And it \ndoesn't stop there, because they can't hire the folks, they can't set \nup the regulation until they have the ability to do the surcharge it \nrequires, in putting it in the FDA, that you come up with $200 million \nto fund the initial effort to set up the infrastructure to regulate \nthis product. So, in fact, there were no resources. Within H.R. 1256, \nit creates the resources to create the framework, to create the \npersonnel, to regulate a product they have never regulated before.\n  I remind my colleagues that in the substitute amendment, we set up a \nnew Harm Reduction Center under the guidelines of the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, within Health and Human Services, the same \nplace that the FDA is. When we asked the Secretary of HHS how much does \nit take to fund that, they gave us a number of $100 million a year; \n$700 million for the baseline, H.R. 1256; $100 million for this new \nCenter of Harm Reduction, overseen by the same Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  Granted, I will be the first to say that if we are creating a new \nagency, the agency for harm reduction, it does not have the experience, \nthe expertise, or the resources yet, but it can search within the \nglobal marketplace to find the individuals, and the Secretary of HHS \nhas already said $100 million will permit us to do that function in a \nharm reduction center. So the first complaint, hopefully, I have \ndisposed of.\n  The second complaint from the Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids as to \nwhy they would not support the substitute amendment: The Burr-Hagan \nbill does\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nnot give the FDA any meaningful authority to require changes in tobacco \nproducts. Well, I do hope somebody from Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids \nis watching, because what the base bill, H.R. 1256, does is it locks in \nthese products, nonfiltered and filtered cigarettes, and legislatively \nsays to the FDA: You can't do anything with those products. They are \ngrandfathered. As you heard me say, H.R. 1256 does not allow these \nreduced-risk products to come to market. So the tobacco industry, based \nupon how the legislation is written, would basically limit tobacco uses \nto these two categories, the 100 percent risky and the 95 percent \nrisky.\n  I misspoke. Let me correct it, because within H.R. 1256 it does state \nthat any product that was sold prior to February 2007 could, in fact, \nbe sold. Some, not all, smokeless products fall into that category of \nhaving been sold prior to February of 2007.\n  One has to ask: Why February of 2007? Why is that magic? It is very \nsimple. That is the last time they updated this bill. I am sure they \nupdated before the markup in 2009, but they weren't even careful enough \nto change the effective date that cut off when a product could be sold. \nThere can't be any other reason, because there is nothing magical to \nFebruary of 2007, except that U.S. smokeless products were included, \nand if you include U.S. smokeless products and filtered and nonfiltered \ncigarettes, you might have one manufacturer that then controls about 70 \npercent of the market. And because you have grandfathered it all in and \nyou have forbidden FDA from ever changing it, you have basically given \nan unbelievable market share to one company, and you have not allowed \nany other company in the world to participate because if they weren't \nsold before February of 2007, they can't be sold in the future. \nBecause, as I discussed earlier, to bring a new product to the \nmarketplace, you have to make the claim that no nontobacco user would \nuse the product.\n  Yet how can you make that claim if the same provision disallows you \nfrom talking to a non-tobacco user about whether they would use the \nproduct? It is a catch-22. Yes, we created a pathway, but we also \ndesigned it in a way that you couldn't meet the threshold needed to \nhave an application approved. It is very simple.\n  Two was that the Burr-Hagan bill doesn't give the FDA meaningful \nauthority to require changes in tobacco products. They are 100 percent \ncorrect. Nor does H.R. 1256. As a matter of fact, not only does it not \nallow for changes, it legislates there cannot be changes to products \nsold before 2007. If the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is trying to \nreduce the risk of death and disease and usage, it has supported the \nwrong bill.\n  Third, the Burr-Hagan bill will harm public health because it \nperpetuates the consumers' misconception that they can reduce their \nrisk of disease by switching to so-called low-tar cigarettes. Our bill \ngoes further than the Kennedy-Waxman legislation by banning the use of \nterms such as ``light,'' ``ultra-light,'' ``medium,'' and bans the use \nof candy, fruit, or alcohol descriptors on cigarettes even if not \ncharacterized in the legislation.\n  In addition, the risk reduction center is required to establish a \nrelative risk ranking for tobacco and nicotine products annually and \ndisseminate that information to the public. This preempts any \nunsubstantiated lower or reduced-risk consumer communications by a \ntobacco manufacturer. In other words, under H.R. 1256, the FDA does not \nhave to inform the public about the relative risk of the products they \nregulate. So they are not going to share with the people that if you \nsmoke filtered cigarettes, it is a 100-percent risk, and unfiltered is \na 90-percent risk. In the substitute that is being offered, we require \nthe harm reduction center to annually print a list of what the risks of \nthe products are that are tobacco related and that they regulate.\n  The fourth complaint by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is that \nthe Burr-Hagan bill doesn't strengthen warning labels in a meaningful \nway. Well, actually, our bill incorporates the same warning levels for \ncigarettes contained in the Kennedy-Waxman legislation and requires \nthey be placed on the bottom 30 percent of a cigarette pack, including \nSenator Enzi's graphic warning label language. Also, our amendment goes \nfurther than H.R. 1256 by requiring the disclosure of ingredients on \nthe back facing of a tobacco product packaging.\n  Let me state what the claim was: The Burr-Hagan bill doesn't \nstrengthen warning labels. The only thing I can think is that the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids didn't read my bill or it doesn't know \nthe difference between identical language in H.R. 1256 and the Burr-\nHagan substitute because the wording is actually the same. In addition, \nwe require that the ingredients in those products be listed on the \npack, which I think is beneficial to consumer choice.\n  Fifth, the Burr-Hagan bill doesn't adequately protect consumers from \nmisleading health claims about tobacco products. Well, once again, our \nbill requires the same rigorous standards used in H.R. 1256 for \nreducing the risk of tobacco products. Furthermore, it requires the \nharm reduction center to establish and publish the relative risk of \ntobacco and nicotine products on an annual basis. Unlike Kennedy-\nWaxman, this legislation also requires disclosure on individual packs \nof all ingredients.\n  The sixth complaint by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is that the \nBurr-Hagan bill gives the tobacco industry license to create ways to \nmarket to youth. We have covered this. Our bill is much more \ncomprehensive. It eliminates print advertising. There are marketing \nprohibitions and restrictions over and above what H.R. 1256 does.\n  Last, the bill gives the tobacco industry undue influence and creates \ngridlock on an important scientific advisory committee by giving the \ntobacco industry the same number of voting representatives as health \nprofessionals and scientists--a 19-member board with 10 health care \nexperts, 4 members of the general public, 2 representatives of tobacco \nmanufacturing, 1 representative of small tobacco manufacturing, 1 \nrepresentative of the tobacco growers, and 1 expert on illicit trade of \ntobacco products. Somehow, 14 health care experts and 1 trade expert \ncan be depicted by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids as being the same \nnumber as 4 tobacco-related members of the advisory board. So clearly, \n15 without a tie to tobacco, 4 with a remote tie to tobacco, and the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said that by giving the tobacco industry \nthe same number of voting representatives as health care professionals \nand scientists--Mr. President, the American people deserve an honest \ndebate. They deserve the information on one side of a bill or another \nto be factual. I am not sure how you can look at 15 individuals in one \ncategory and 4 in another and portray for a minute that is the same \nnumber. But that is what the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids does. If, \nin fact, they have misled in the letter to the committee about H.R. \n1256 and the substitute, what else haven't they told us or what else \nhave they told us that is not accurate? It brings into question that \neffort and, clearly, in 1256, the effort is not to reduce the risk of \ndisease or use of tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. When I ended talking about the substitute, I held up this \ncan of Camel Orbs and I told the Members of the Senate that this was a \nproduct that currently is rated at about a 1-percent risk, or an 89 \npercent reduction from typical nonfiltered cigarettes. It is an 89 \npercent reduction from nonfiltered cigarettes. I will hold one up. It \nis a dissolvable tobacco. You don't get lung cancer or COPD from it, \nand it doesn't cause heart disease. There is a 1-percent risk. But \nunder H.R. 1256, this product is outlawed. Why? Because it wasn't sold \nbefore February 2007.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if the intent of passing Federal \nregulation of the tobacco industry--and I am supportive of it--is to \nreduce death and disease, why would you exclude a product that has a 1-\npercent risk but then grandfather in products with a 100-percent \nlikelihood of killing you? Even if you are not debating whether it is \nin the FDA or in the harm reduction center, how in the world can a \nMember of the Senate say it is OK to eliminate the ability for an adult \nto choose to use this and to be locked into a certain death?\n  We are supposed to pass policy that makes sense and that works for \nthe American people, that actually reduces\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nthe risk of death, disease, and usage of tobacco. When you lock them \ninto the highest risk and likelihood of death, you haven't fulfilled \nthat. When you don't require States to use the money they were given \nfor cessation programs, how can you expect that you are going to reduce \nyouth usage? When you see that 48 States have a higher prevalence of \nmarijuana use among youth than they do of tobacco, how can you conclude \nthat by giving the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco, somehow that \nmeans you are going to have a reduction in youth usage? It is just not \ngoing to happen.\n  The American Association of Public Health Physicians states that this \nproduct, Orbs, is the most effective way to fight death and disease \nassociated with current tobacco use. Again, the American Association of \nPublic Health Physicians states that these are the best tools we have \nto get people to quit smoking. As a matter of fact, I am proud to say \nthat yesterday the American Association of Public Health Physicians \nendorsed the substitute amendment and not the base bill because they \nrecognize that the base bill does nothing but provide a pathway to \ncertain disease or death.\n  Just so I am clear, under the base bill, H.R. 1256, Marlboro is \ncemented on the retail shelves. Camel Orbs, which reduces death and \ndisease associated with tobacco use, is banned, can't be sold; It \nwasn't on the market before January 2007, and Marlboros are on the \nshelf.\n  Snus is banned. In the past 25 years, Swedish men showed a notable \nreduction in smoking-related disease, a decline in lung cancer \nincidence rates to the lowest of any developed nation, with no \ndetectable increase in the oral cancer rate, improvement in \ncardiovascular health, and the tobacco-related mortality rate in Sweden \nis among the lowest in the developed world. But in our infinite wisdom \nin this austere body, we are getting ready to pass a bill that takes a \nproduct that Sweden used to get people off cigarettes, to reduce lung \ncancer, to bring down cardiovascular disease, to reduce mortality by \ntobacco products, and we are going to eliminate it and we are going to \nlock them into everything Sweden is trying to get rid of. Think about \nthis before you do it, for God's sake. Once you pass this, it is too \nlate.\n  Mr. President, the current cessation programs don't work. I said \nearlier that those products have a 95-percent failure rate. Giving \ncurrent smokers an opportunity to migrate to a less harmful product--it \nis a public health initiative, and not creating a pathway to reduce \nharmful products is not a public health bill. But those products are \nbanned in H.R. 1256.\n  Senator Hagan's and my amendment allows these products to be marketed \nand regulated correctly. Our amendment establishes a tobacco harm \nreduction center within the office of Health and Human Services. We \nprovide the harm reduction center with the regulatory authority to \nbetter protect our children from tobacco use and significantly increase \nthe public health benefits of tobacco regulation. We require tobacco \nmanufacturers to publish ingredients of products. We require the harm \nreduction center to rank tobacco products according to their risk of \ndeath and disease associated with each type of tobacco product in order \nto inform the American public more fully about the risk and harm of \ntobacco products.\n  We ban candy and fruit descriptors of cigarettes. We ban the use of \nthe terms ``light'' and ``low tar.'' We give the Harm Reduction Center \nthe authority to review smoking articles and adjust accordingly to what \nis in the best interest of public health. What we don't do is give an \nalready overburdened agency the responsibility to regulate tobacco.\n  We have a change in administrations. As supportive as I am of the new \nCommissioner of the FDA, Margaret Hamburg--she will do a wonderful \njob--let me turn to the former Commissioner of the FDA. Two years ago, \nAndy von Eschenbach gave his opinion on the FDA regulation of tobacco. \nYou might say: Gosh, this was 2 years ago. I think I already made a \ncredible case that most of what is in this bill was written 10 years \nago. Even some of the deadlines that are in the bill have not been \nchanged since the bill was updated 2 years ago. So I think it is very \ncredible to use the comments of the former FDA Commissioner 2 years \nago:\n\n       The provisions in this bill would require substantial \n     resources, and FDA may not be in a position to meet all of \n     the activities within the proposed user fee levels . . . As a \n     consequence of this, FDA may have to divert funds from its \n     other programs, such as addressing the safety of drugs and \n     food, to begin implementing this program.\n\n  All of a sudden, we are right back where I started 3 days ago. Why in \nthe world would we jeopardize the gold standard of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the agency that provides the confidence to every \nconsumer in the country that when they get home at night, after having \na prescription filled, they don't have to worry about whether it is \nsafe or effective; that if they go to a doctor or hospital and they use \na device on them, it wasn't something crafted in the back room and \nnobody reviewed that it was safe or effective; that it had the gold \nstandard, the seal of approval of the Food and Drug Administration; \nthat as biologics were created that did not exist 10 years ago, that we \ncould feel certain that the FDA looked at this new product and approved \nit for use in humans; that when we went to buy food, our food would be \nsafe.\n  Do we want to jeopardize the FDA having to divert funds from food \nsafety right now when we have had Americans who have been killed? Do we \nwant a reviewer at FDA, whose gold standard is to prove safety and \nefficacy on all the products they regulate, except for the tobacco, to \nlower their guard and let something through that did not meet the \nthreshold of safe and effective?\n  I am not sure that is in the best interest of America. I am not sure \nit is in the best interest of the American people.\n  My colleague from Connecticut came to the floor and said the Food and \nDrug Administration is the only agency that has the experience, the \nexpertise, and the resources. The Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration said: I don't have the resources, and if you give this \nto me, I might have to divert funds from other programs. As a matter of \nfact, they would have to divert people from reviewing the applications \nfor new drugs, new biologics. It could be that somebody who is waiting \nfor a new therapy dies before the therapy is available because we had \nto divert funds or people to take care of regulating a product that the \nFDA has never regulated and for which Commissioners of the FDA told us \nthey did not have the funds.\n  I am not sure how clear we need this. I said when I started on Monday \nthis was an uphill climb, the deck was stacked against me. I understood \nthe threshold was come to the Senate floor and to spend as much time as \nit took to convince my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents--that this was not a bill where one party trumped the \nother.\n  Senator Hagan is a Democrat; I am a Republican. We have come to the \nfloor passionately with our substitute amendment because we think it \ntrumps H.R. 1256 from a policy standpoint. The American people expect \nus to pass the right policy, not any policy. If the FDA is not the \nappropriate place to put it, the American people expect us to find \nsomething else that meets the threshold of the right regulation but \ndoes not encumber the gold standard of an agency on which we are so \nreliant.\n  I am hopeful we are going to have a vote this afternoon on the \nsubstitute. It will be next week before the base bill is voted on. I \nsay to my colleagues, they are only going to have one opportunity to \nchange this bill. That one opportunity is to vote for the substitute \namendment. If they vote for the substitute amendment, they are going to \nvote for a bill that actually reduces the risk of death and disease for \nadults who choose to use tobacco products. If they vote for the \nsubstitute, they are actually going to vote for a bill that actually \nreduces youth usage in a real way. If they pass on supporting the \nsubstitute--and it will be a close vote--if they pass on supporting it, \nthey are going to have to live with what they do to the FDA. They are \ngoing to have to live with the consequences.\n  When I came to the Congress, the House of Representatives, in 1995, I \nwas given the task of modernizing the Food and Drug Administration. We \nopened the Food and Drug Administration in its entirety. It took 2\\1/2\\ \nyears to\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\nproduce a bill. It was a bipartisan bill. As a matter of fact, I think \nin the Senate and in the House it passed by voice vote.\n  Why did it take 2\\1/2\\ years, two Congresses? It is because we \nunderstood, at that time, the delicacy of what we were attempting to \ndo. We were attempting to modernize the Agency and to maintain the gold \nstandard.\n  At the end of the day, no Member of the House or the Senate offered \nan amendment to give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. In 1998, that \nbill became law. Why didn't they? It is because every Member knew it \nwas not worth the risk of giving them the responsibilities of tobacco \nwhen we had spent 2\\1/2\\ years trying to protect the gold standard.\n  We are not that forgetful. Don't forget our commitment to make sure \nthe gold standard of the FDA is intact. Don't jeopardize it by giving \nthem tobacco. Don't let our kids be sold short by producing a bill that \ndoes not do the education they need so they never pick up a tobacco \nproduct. Don't lock the adults who choose to use risky products to \nrisky products forever. Give them an opportunity to have less harmful \nproducts. That can only be done one way. That can only be done if \nMembers of the Senate vote to support the Hagan-Burr substitute.\n  It does keep kids from smoking. It does preserve the core mission of \nthe FDA. It does reduce the risk of death and disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act. We all know someone who is \ncurrently a smoker or someone who has been a smoker. I know we all \nworry about their health. That is with good reason.\n  Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United \nStates. It kills more people each year than alcohol, AIDS, car crashes, \nillegal drugs, murders, and suicides combined.\n  Let me repeat that because it is hard to believe. The fact is, \ntobacco use kills more people each year than alcohol, AIDS, car \ncrashes, illegal drugs, murders, and suicides combined. Tobacco-related \nhealth problems affect millions more, resulting in skyrocketing health \ncare costs every year.\n  The cycle of addiction is so hard to break, and the tobacco companies \nwork hard to attract smokers with flashy marketing campaigns and by \nincluding chemicals that are proven to be addictive. Undoubtedly, this \nhurts our Nation's overall health.\n  There is no question that one of the most important steps the Senate \ncan take to improve health and to reduce costs is to reduce the use of \ntobacco. That is why this legislation is so important, why I am proud \nto be one of the 53 cosponsors of this legislation. Again, over half \nthe Senate is cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership and work on this important \nissue over so many years. I thank Senator Dodd for managing this bill \non the floor.\n  Throughout my career, I have advocated for smoking prevention. We all \nrealize the cost in lives and in health care expenses that smoking \ncreates, not only to the consumer but also to those who are exposed to \nthe dangerous secondhand smoke.\n  In New Hampshire, almost 20 percent of adults smoke cigarettes, and \ntobacco-related health care expenses in New Hampshire amount to $969 \nmillion a year.\n  During my tenure as Governor, I was proud to sign legislation that \nbanned the sale of tobacco products to minors, that prohibited the \npossession of tobacco products by children, and that required the New \nHampshire Department of Health and Human Services to disclose harmful \ningredients in tobacco products.\n  The important legislation we are considering expands on what New \nHampshire has done. It will give the FDA the authority to regulate the \nmanufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products.\n  In New Hampshire this year alone, 6,300 children will try cigarettes \nfor the first time. Just over a third of these children will become \naddicted lifelong smokers. The tobacco companies know these statistics \nand target much of their marketing to this vulnerable population. In \nfact, published research studies have found that children are three \ntimes more sensitive to tobacco advertising than adults and are more \nlikely to be influenced to smoke by marketing than by peer pressure. \nThis year in New Hampshire alone, the tobacco companies will spend $128 \nmillion on marketing, much of it geared to kids.\n  Tobacco companies also attract children to their products by using \nflavors, such as Twista Lime or Kauai Kolada, which says it contains \n``Hawaiian hints of pineapple and coconut,'' or Winter Mocha Mint. It \ndoesn't sound like we are talking about tar-filled cigarettes, does it? \nIt sounds like we are talking about ice cream or candy. But, \nunfortunately, these fruit and mint flavors not only entice kids to try \nthem but also makes the smoke less harsh, more flavorful so it is \nactually easier for kids to smoke.\n  Unfortunately, they do not make cigarettes less dangerous or less \naddictive. The tobacco companies do not stop at just the flavors to \nattract kids. They package the flavored products in colorful and fun \npatterns clearly aimed at attracting children to their products.\n  Norma Gecks of Derry, NH, reports that her youngest child is 19 and \nis addicted to smoking. He buys the mint- and fruit-flavored products \nand by now is smoking up to two packs a day. Already at age 19, he has \ndeveloped a smoker's cough.\n  Keith Blessington of Concord is now an adult, but he is also a victim \nof childhood addiction. He smoked his first cigarette after a \nbasketball game when he was only 17. Recently, he was diagnosed with \nadvanced stomach cancer and told me he has about a year to live. \nDespite this awful situation, despite the fact that he has cancer, he \nwill tell you plainly: I am addicted. He cannot quit.\n  We need to enact this legislation to help people in New Hampshire and \nacross the country, people such as Keith, people such as Norma's son. \nTobacco products and marketing geared to kids need to end. We cannot \nafford to let another generation of young people put themselves at risk \nby becoming addicted to tobacco products and suffering the lifelong \nconsequences of their addiction or, even worse, dying.\n  For decades, tobacco companies have targeted women and girls. But in \nthe last 2 years, the industry has significantly stepped up its \nmarketing efforts aimed at our daughters and granddaughters, and we \nhave a picture of one of the ads R.J. Reynolds uses. It is their new \nversion of Camel cigarettes targeted to girls and women, and it is \nCamel No. 9--sort of a takeoff on some other product descriptions we \nhave heard. This cigarette has sleek, shiny black packaging, flowery \nads, and, as you can see, the enticing slogan ``light and luscious.'' \nThis advertisement has appeared in Cosmopolitan, Glamour, InStyle, \nLucky, and Marie Claire magazines, and it has been effective. Today, \nabout 17 percent of adult women and about 19 percent of high school \ngirls are smokers. That is more than 20 million women and more than 1.5 \nmillion girls who are at increased risk for lung cancer, for heart \nattacks, strokes, emphysema, and other deadly diseases. These \nstatistics are staggering, and it is important to remember they \nrepresent mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, colleagues, and \nfriends.\n  Seventeen-year-old Cait Steward of Dover, NH, has seen these Camel \nNo. 9 advertisements. She saw them in Glamour magazine. But \nfortunately, she sees through the marketing campaign. She says:\n\n       Tobacco companies advertise to try and get me and my \n     friends to smoke. They try to make young girls think that \n     smoking is sexy, glamorous, and cool. They know that if they \n     get us to start smoking now we will be addicted for years to \n     come.\n\n  It is not just cigarettes that we are attempting to regulate in this \nlegislation. The tobacco companies have also developed new products \nthat are both smokeless and spitless. They are just as addictive as \nthose products you smoke, however, and they are just as deadly. Like \ncigarettes, they do not have any FDA regulation, and the consequences \nare dire.\n  I want to show a photo of a young man named Gruen Von Behrens. He is \nan oral cancer survivor. He has had more than 40 surgeries to save his \nlife,\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nincluding one radical surgery, and you can see how it left him in this \npicture. It removed half his neck muscles and lymph nodes and half of \nhis tongue. Like too many teenagers, Von Behrens first tried spit \ntobacco at age 13 to fit in. By age 17, he was diagnosed with cancer. \nHow can we let this happen? Tobacco companies are targeting our \nchildren, and it is our job to protect them.\n  This legislation is vital to our children and to our Nation's health. \nIt will prevent the tobacco companies from marketing to children. It \nwill require disclosure of the contents of tobacco products, authorize \nthe FDA to require the reduction or removal of harmful ingredients, and \nforce tobacco companies to scientifically prove any claims about \nreduced risk of products.\n  The FDA is the proper place to have this authority. It is responsible \nfor protecting consumers from products that cause them harm. The FDA \neven regulates pet food. Yet it doesn't have the authority to provide \noversight for tobacco--one of the most dangerous consumer products sold \nin the United States.\n  Under this legislation, the FDA will oversee tobacco products with \nthe same objective and the same oversight with which it directs all of \nits activities--to promote and protect public health. It has the \nnecessary scientific expertise, regulatory experience, and public \nhealth mission to do the job. We can't wait any longer to make the \nnecessary changes that will impact the lives of so many people we know \nand love.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his outstanding leadership on this \nissue and join many of my colleagues in supporting this important \nlegislation that will save lives in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6169-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6169-S6170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly about North \nKorea and what is taking place there. To put some of this in context, I \nthink everybody knows--around the country and the world--what North \nKorea is doing today. Two Americans are on trial, in a crazy setting. \nThey have a missile on a pad that can reach the United States. They \nhave tested another nuclear device. They have tested previously a \nnuclear device. They are in the throes of some sort of possible change \nwithin the regime. It is a very unstable, very provocative situation in \nNorth Korea.\n  I raise all that because at the end of the Bush administration, they \ntook North Korea off the terrorism list, and they did it as a way to \ntry to negotiate, to try to get them into the six-party talks to do \nmore things and to work with us and with the world community.\n  Since that period, the North Korean Government has taken the exact \nopposite tack. Instead of working with us, they have done everything \nthey can to provoke us even further. President Bush, when he took North \nKorea off the terrorism list, said:\n\n       We will trust you only to the extent that you fulfill your \n     promises . . . If North Korea makes the wrong choices, the \n     United States . . . will act accordingly.\n\n  That was President Bush. He is, obviously, not President any longer. \nAt that point in time, many of us objected to taking North Korea off \nthe terrorism list, but he went ahead and did it anyway. Then Candidate \nObama said, at roughly that same period:\n\n       Sanctions are a critical part of our leverage to pressure \n     [North Korea] to act. They should only be lifted based on \n     North Korean performance. If the North Koreans do not meet \n     their obligations, we should move quickly to reimpose \n     sanctions that have been waived, and consider new \n     restrictions going forward.\n\n  Since President Bush said that, since Candidate Obama said that, here \nis what the North Korean regime has done. I mentioned some of these, \nbut I will go into detail. They have: launched a multistage ballistic \nmissile over Japan; kidnapped and imprisoned two American journalists; \npulled out of the six-party talks, vowing never to return; kicked out \ninternational nuclear inspectors and American monitors; restarted their \nnuclear facilities; renounced the 50-year armistice with South Korea; \ndetonated a second illegal nuclear bomb; launched additional short-\nrange missiles; are about to launch a long-range missile capable of \nreaching the United States; and, at this very moment, are calling the \ndetained American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, before a North \nKorean court, if you could even call it that possibly, to answer for \nsupposed crimes of illegal entry into North Korea and unexplained \nhostile acts. The two could face years in a North Korean labor camp. \nThat is what has taken place since those statements.\n  We want to put forward an amendment on this bill or on some future \nbill--but I would like to do it and we should do it on this bill--to \nlabel North Korea a terrorist state again, like President Bush said we \nshould, if they don't act right; like Candidate Obama said we should, \nif they don't fulfill their obligations. We think the administration \nshould do this now, should relist them as a terrorist state. We think \nit would be an important vote and statement by this body if we would \nsay the North Korean Government is a terrorist government because it \nis. It is one of the lead armers to provide armament to rogue regimes \nand individuals around the world. Some of my colleagues may have seen \nthe story this week about a North Korean general who was one of the \nlead counterfeiters in the world of United States one hundred dollar \nbills. They were very good quality, done on state machinery I have no \ndoubt. He is one of the lead counterfeiters around the world.\n  Why, then, the State Department would say earlier today that they \ndon't think this ``meets the test'' is beyond me. I think this body \nshould vote and send a very clear signal that we believe the North \nKorean regime should be listed as a terrorist state and a terrorist \nsponsor. It has taken an incredible list of provocative acts. The Obama \nadministration has said: Let's get the U.N. to issue sanctions against \nthem.\n  Let's get the United States to do our sanctions against them for what \nthey are doing. All this amendment does that I want to vote on is have \nthe administration place North Korea back on the terrorism list, where \nit rightly deserves to be and should have been all along. Of course, \nthe amendment does allow the President to waive the requirement of \nrelisting so long as he certifies that certain conditions have taken \nplace, that they have met their obligations, which they clearly are not \ngoing to.\n  I think it is wrong for this body not to be clear on this toward \nNorth Korea. It is wrong for this country not to be clear toward North \nKorea of what we believe of their provocative actions, that we will not \nstand by and say: Yes, you can keep doing this; yes, you can keep \nlaunching missiles; yes, you can keep detonating nuclear devices, and \nwe will not do anything. We should be clear we are going to act. These \nare wrong and provocative actions, and they deserve the minimum \nresponse this is. That is why I would like to get a vote on this \namendment. I would hope I would get a unanimous vote by my colleagues \nto relist them as a terrorist state. I would hope we could get that up \non this bill. We are in negotiations now with the majority leader about \nthis. It is time to vote. It is time to send this at least minimal \nmessage to the North Korean Government that these actions cannot stand \nwithout some response from the United States. I hope we could get a \nvote up on this.\n  I urge the majority leader and those working on coming up with an \nagreement to go to the next bill to allow us to vote on this North \nKorean amendment to provide these sanctions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6170-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there are a number of amendments that have \nbeen filed that are at the desk. They haven't been offered as yet. \nAmendments on both sides in agreement should be considered. We were \nvery close on working out an agreement to do just that. The vast \nmajority of the amendments will be germane postcloture. I have \nindicated that for those that are arguably germane, I would be willing \nto work with the person who offered the amendment to have a vote on it. \nBut one Senator has held this up. That is the way things can happen \naround here. It is unfortunate, but it does happen. We worked for a \ncouple of days trying to arrive at the point we are. The sad part about \nit is the Senator who has held all this up has an amendment that isn't \nremotely germane to this bill, but he has lodged an objection to this \nagreement that is agreeable by all other Senators. I would hope that \nthe Senator would reconsider this objection over the next few days.\n  In the meantime, I have had conversations with the managers of the \nbill. I have spent a lot of time with Senator Dodd. It is an important \npiece of legislation. I watched the Presiding Officer offer her speech \ntoday. What a sad thing, the man she spoke about. A picture is worth a \nthousand words. The picture that she had when she was talking about \nthis bill and how important it is was worth more than a thousand words.\n  I will have more to say about this on Monday, but everyone in my \nfamily smokes. Sadly, my parents are dead. My dad's miner's consumption \nwas terribly exacerbated by his smoking. So when did he start smoking? \nHe was a kid. He started smoking as a little boy. The same with my \nmother. The same with my brothers. One brother started when he was in \nthe Air Force. He was I guess 20 years old or something like that. He \nwasn't very old. But the others, all of my other family members, \nstarted smoking as kids. One of my brothers chewed tobacco. I can \nremember I had a friend who learned that my brother chewed tobacco. He \nwas a lobbyist for the tobacco industry and he said, Oh, I will send \nhim a case of--what kind does he chew? I didn't think that was a good \nidea.\n  In Los Angeles last week I met the first lawyer who filed litigation, \nserious litigation against the tobacco industry--a wonderful man. He \ngot terribly upset with the Joe Camel advertisements, when they placed \nthat little comic strip character on lunch boxes for kids. He also was \nupset because at that time the tobacco industry went through another \none of their ideas to get kids to start smoking in stores, like a 7-\nEleven store. They would have bins of cigarettes out there. You are \nsupposed to pay for them, but they were there. Kids could steal them so \neasily. So he filed this lawsuit. He had the confidence to tell me he \nlost that lawsuit. But when all the lawyers got together to go after \nthe tobacco companies big time, they pooled their money and went after \nthe tobacco companies, and they used all of his pleadings. He said even \nthe misspelled words they used. They didn't change anything. \nUltimately, that led to the favorable ruling by the courts that tobacco \ncompanies were liable for the damages in the billions of dollars.\n  It is important that we move forward. I hope that cloture would be \ninvoked on this Monday afternoon. It is one of the most popular pieces \nof legislation we could do. I am sorry we weren't able to work anything \nout on the amendments, but we simply were not able to do so. No one can \ncomplain this entire Congress that we haven't had the ability to offer \namendments. We were concerned for a lot of reasons. One is we have the \nsupplemental appropriations bill floating around here and we didn't \nwant a lot of nongermane amendments on this, but there were no \nrestrictions whatsoever on even nongermane amendments. We just wanted--\nevery Republican wanted to look at ours; we wanted to look at theirs. \nWe used to do that a lot. We can still do that. But no one can complain \nand use it as an excuse to not vote for this bill, that we haven't \ngiven them a chance to offer amendments.\n  So I hope Senators will take a look at this to move forward. Let us \ninvoke cloture and complete this legislation. I have already indicated \nI would be happy to work out something that would be fair to dispose of \nthe amendments that are germane to this bill that have been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wanted to begin by thanking the majority \nleader for his efforts and those of others, and to agree with him. We \nare prepared to debate these germane amendments, or amendments that are \narguably germane, and it is regrettable we couldn't do that. This bill \nhas enjoyed overwhelming support in both Chambers in previous \nCongresses. Our colleague from Massachusetts has been the leading \nchampion of this effort for more than a decade, if not longer. As I \npointed out, every single day we fail to act on this legislation, the \nstatistics are that 3,000 to 4,000 children will begin to smoke every \nday; 400,000 of our fellow citizens will die this year, not to mention \nthousands who will live very, very debilitated lives as a result of \nbeing contaminated by cigarette smoke and tobacco products. Here we are \non the eve of a national health care debate where a major part of that \nwill be about prevention, and what better way to begin that debate than \nthe Congress taking a step in this area which could make such a \ndifference.\n  So I thank the majority leader for his efforts. I am still hopeful we \ncan get this done. I believe we can. People such as Senator Burr and \nSenator Hagan who have legitimate interests and concerns about the \nlegislation before us deserve to have their amendments considered, \ndebated, and discussed. In fairness to other Members, it is regrettable \nthat one single Member of this body, on a totally nongermane proposal, \ncan cause us to delay or avoid meeting the obligation of the issues and \nconcerns about tobacco and the effects on our citizenry.\n  So I thank the majority leader for his efforts. We will be here next \nweek to debate those amendments and hopefully our colleagues will \ninvoke cloture so we can get to this matter.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let me say, while the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut is on the floor, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and the manager of this bill, Senator Enzi has been a real \npartner in what we have done here. He asked that we do a committee \nhearing on this bill. We could have brought it to the floor under rule \nXIV. This bill has had lots of hearings in the past, but because \nSenator Enzi is such a gentleman and he thought it would be the right \nthing to do, we went ahead, in spite of a very difficult schedule that \nwe had and the schedule that especially Senator Dodd had, of all of the \nthings that we were doing under the jurisdiction of that Banking \nCommittee, but with Senator Kennedy's help, he was the one who was \nobligated to do this legislation. So we have done that. We have jumped \nthrough all the hoops. I repeat, I hope no one will use as an excuse to \nnot vote for cloture that we have been unfair in moving forward on this \nbill, because it would be unfair for them to say that we have been \nunfair.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to terminate morning \nbusiness and have the bill reported.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6170-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to go into a \nperiod of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, what did we do?\n  Mr. REID. We just went into morning business. We would like to go \ninto morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have an amendment that I have been \ntrying to get a vote on, I would say to the distinguished majority \nleader, and it certainly is important to the American people.\n  It is certainly important on this bill and the function of the FDA \nconcerning the importation of prescription drugs into this country. I \nbelieve the Senator from North Dakota has an amendment. I would agree \nto a time agreement of an hour to be equally divided, or half hour, and \nthen vote on it.\n  I think the American people ought to know whether we are going to be \nable to import prescription drugs into this country so we can save them \nbillions of dollars every year, rather than taking so much of their \nhard-earned money, especially retirees.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am happy to respond to my friend. We \nhave been trying for 2 days to move forward on germane amendments. I \nhave had several conversations with Senator Dorgan. I know how \nimportant it is to him. I voted with him, and I do every time this \nmatter comes up. As I indicated earlier, I would be happy to work out \nsome kind of agreement.\n  At this time, until we get some ability to vote on the germane \namendments, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do. I am willing, \nas I have indicated to my friend, Senator Dorgan, to work out an \narrangement for him to offer this amendment. This is something that \nshould have been done, I am sorry to say, years ago, not weeks ago. I \nwill work with the Senator from Arizona on this drug reimportation \nissue, which is important. At this stage, we simply cannot do it; I \nknow of no way to get from here to there.\n  As I said--and the manager of the bill is here--if we can work \nsomething out by Monday, I will be happy to try to work something out. \nNobody is trying to stop the Senator from offering that amendment. We \nhave to have an agreement to move forward on the other stuff first \nbecause it is germane.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very appreciative of the difficulties \nthe majority leader faces on a bill of this nature, the challenges of \namendments being nongermane, and also the difficulties he faces in \nmanaging legislation. This issue has been around for a long time, I say \nto my friend from Nevada. We should address it. It is important to the \nAmerican people. It does have a lot to do with pharmaceuticals in this \ncountry and the availability.\n  Again, I point out to the majority leader that there should not be a \nlot of debate on this. People have taken their positions.\n  I have an e-mail that was sent to us by mistake by the lobby for \nPhRMA, regarding how important it is to stop this amendment and not \nhave a vote on it. If my friend will indulge me, this is urgent. This \nis from, as I understand it, one of the lobbyists for PhRMA:\n\n       The Senate is on the tobacco bill today. Unless we get some \n     significant movement, the full-blown Dorgan or Vitter bill \n     will pass as an amendment and a Cochran or Brownback safety \n     amendment will fail.\n       (1) We need to locate a Democratic lead cosponsor for the \n     second degree amendment--which will be either Brownback or \n     Cochran. Can the J, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and the other \n     New Jersey companies coordinate and contact Senator \n     Menendez's office and ask him to take the lead?\n       (2) We are trying to get Senator Dorgan to back down--\n     calling the White House and Senator Reid. Our understanding \n     is that at least Senator McCain has said he will offer \n     regardless, so even if Dorgan withdraws, he may still go \n     forward.\n       We believe we have 39 `yes' votes for a safety second \n     degree amendment and 25 members in the `undecided' column. \n     Kennedy--who whipped this for us last time--is not here.\n       We are scheduling a call for later this morning to follow \n     up on our targets from yesterday's whip call. Please make \n     sure your staff is fully engaged in this process. This is \n     real. We only had six companies participate in the last call.\n\n  My friends, that is a little insight as to how the special interests \nin Washington work. I would like to have a vote on this amendment, I \nsay to my friend from Nevada, with a full appreciation of the \ndifficulties he has in getting this legislation through--a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I thank my friend from Nevada for his indulgence and allowing me to \nread that e-mail.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is kind of an insight--I don't know \nwho is on first, but that is pretty interesting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6171-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I listened carefully to the conversation \nbetween the majority leader and our colleague from Arizona. As the \nmanager of this bill on smoking, I for one have been a strong advocate \nfor the reimportation proposal. Others have also expressed an interest \nin this. Most of my colleagues have expressed views, and a majority \nhave expressed support for the idea. This is not about denying a vote \non reimportation. We would all like that opportunity.\n  However, this bill on smoking and children is about as fragile a \nproposal as I have seen here in a long time. There are strong voices \nthat wish to kill this legislation, and they effectively have. The FDA \nhas jurisdiction over almost every product--except tobacco--including \npet food. We waited 10 years trying to get to this bill. If you lose \none or two votes on this--if we lose this again, we are back to the \nlast decade.\n  There will be any number of attractive ideas proposed to this \nlegislation, many of which I have either supported or would like to, \nbut we will run the risk of breaking up the necessary 60 votes to deal \nwith children and smoking. So no matter how appealing some amendments \nmay be, understand what you may be doing, and that is destroying the \nability to deal with the 3,000 to 4,000 kids who start smoking every \nday and the 400,000 people who die every year from tobacco. I want to \nvote on reimportation as well and a lot of other issues. If every time \nwe bring up a bill of this significance and somebody offers a very \nappealing proposal--understand that the danger is that you fracture \nthat relationship. That has denied us the opportunity to pass this for \na decade, despite the fact that both bodies have voted overwhelmingly \nbut not in the same Congress.\n  We are on the brink of getting this done. What better thing could we \naccomplish on the eve of the health care debate than to start saving \nlives of children? I have 76,000 kids in Connecticut who will die \nbecause they are smokers if we do nothing. There are 6 million children \ntoday who are going to die prematurely because of smoking if we do \nnothing. As much as I want to deal with reimportation of drugs, if we \ndo that and it is adopted and we lose the coalition on smoking, what \nhave we achieved? The bill dies. You lose both reimportation as well as \nthe smoking proposal.\n  I appreciate the majority leader taking the position he did. I know \nwhere he stands on the issue. Senator Reid has been a strong advocate \nof reimportation. That is not the issue here. It is whether at long \nlast, a decade later, our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator DeWine, a former colleague from Ohio, Henry Waxman \nfrom California, Tom Davis of Virginia, who on a bipartisan basis have \ntried year in and year out to get this done--we can finally achieve it. \nSo I know the game. But this is not a game, this is life and death for \npeople. For 10 long years, we have not been able to pass legislation \ninvolving kids and smoking. We can get it done in the next few days. If \npeople insist upon nongermane amendments based on a short-term appeal \nthat denies us that opportunity, we will have done great damage to our \ncountry.\n  I appreciate the position the majority leader has taken. My \ncolleagues know, because I went through the process last week in \ncommittee, there were any number of appealing amendments. I thank the \nmembers of the committee who wanted to vote for some of those \namendments. I see Senator Merkley here, a member of our committee. He \nand I would have liked to have supported additional amendments, fines \nand such, for kids. We knew that if we did that, we might break that \nfragile coalition that would get to us the goal line of passing the \nbill.\n  I thank the majority leader for standing up on an issue he cares \ndeeply about, the reimportation of drugs. He understands, as does the \nPresiding Officer, as do all of us here who have loved ones who have \nbeen smokers and have been affected by tobacco and the damage it does \nto our citizenry. It is the only disease I know that is self-inflicted. \nThere are more deaths each year as a result of smoking and tobacco \nproducts than alcohol, drugs, suicide, automobile accidents, and AIDS \ncombined. It is the greatest killer in America. We have a chance to \nmake a difference. The day will come for reimportation. We ought to get \nto that. If you do it on this bill, you lose both reimportation and the \nsmoking bill.\n  I thank the majority leader and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, a \ncomprehensive effort to address the threat of tobacco products to \npublic health.\n  This bill will finally give the Food and Drug Administration the \nlegal authority it needs to prevent the sale of tobacco products to \nminors, make tobacco products less toxic and addictive for those who \ncontinue to use them, and prevent the tobacco industry from misleading \nthe public about the dangers of smoking.\n  As the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, \ntobacco use kills over 400,000 Americans a year. More deaths in the \nU.S. are caused by tobacco use than from illegal drug use, alcohol use, \nmotor vehicle accidents, suicides, and murders combined. This \nlegislation takes crucial steps to save the lives of as many as 80,000 \nAmericans every year.\n  Sadly, our failure to address this issue is having the greatest \neffect on our Nation's children. Ninety percent of all new smokers are \nchildren. In just 1 day, about 3,500 children will try their first \ncigarette and 1,000 more will become daily smokers. In just 1 year, \nkids in my home State of California will purchase 78.3 million packs of \ncigarettes.\n  Even though studies have shown children are twice as sensitive to \ntobacco advertising as adults and that one-third of children experiment \nwith smoking due to advertising, marketing for tobacco products is \nvirtually unregulated. Each year, the tobacco industry spends $13.4 \nbillion nationwide on advertising. Granting the FDA the authority to \nregulate tobacco advertising will reduce targeting of kids and crack \ndown on false claims.\n  Additionally, this bill will grant the FDA the authority to regulate \nsmokeless tobacco--particularly those products that have been designed \nto appeal to children, such as tobacco candy. Claims by the tobacco \nindustry that these products are safe alternatives to smoking are \ndangerous and wrong. In fact, the Surgeon General has determined the \nuse of smokeless tobacco can lead to oral cancer, gum disease, heart \nattacks, heart disease, cancer of the esophagus, and cancer of the \nstomach.\n  This legislation will ensure that tobacco companies can no longer \nmarket addictive carcinogenic candies targeted at children without \nreview by the Food and Drug Administration and careful regulation to \nsafeguard the public health.\n  Cigarettes contain 69 known carcinogens and hundreds of other \ningredients that contribute to the risk of heart disease, lung disease, \nand other serious illnesses. Yet tobacco products are currently exempt \nfrom basic consumer protections like ingredient disclosure, product \ntesting and marketing restrictions to children. Tobacco products are \nthe only products on the market that kill a third of their customers if \nthey are used as directed. In spite of the risks, in spite of the \ncosts, tobacco products are the most unregulated consumer products \navailable today.\n  This bill will ensure that the tobacco industry is finally required \nto tell us what is in the products they sell.\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\n  This legislation will also give the Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority to require stronger warning labels, prevent industry \nmisrepresentations, and regulate ``reduced harm'' claims about tobacco \nproducts. According to a 2006 Harvard School of Public Health study, \nthe average amount of nicotine in cigarettes rose 11.8 percent from \n1997 to 2005. More important, this bill will give the FDA the authority \nto ban the most harmful chemicals used in these products, or even \nreduce the amount of nicotine. The Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act is not about unfairly punishing tobacco companies \nor consumers of tobacco products; it merely gives the Food and Drug \nAdministration the right to regulate tobacco products as it regulates \nother products to safeguard the public health.\n  This Congress and the President have committed to reducing health \ncare costs through comprehensive reform. This legislation is precisely \nthe kind of investment in prevention and wellness that will enable us \nto increase access to quality health care while reducing costs. Tobacco \nuse results in $96 billion in annual health care costs and California \nalone will spend $9.1 billion on smoking related health care costs--\nimagine if we spent those funds on preventative medicine or wellness \nmeasures.\n  The passage of this bipartisan bill would be one of the single, \ngreatest public health protections that affirms our commitment to \nprevention and wellness as the foundation of responsible health care in \nour country. I urge my colleagues to make an investment in the health \nof the American people and support this legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to share my views on H.R. \n1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009.\n  First and foremost, I want to make it perfectly clear that I am \ndeeply concerned about the dangers of smoking, particularly when it \ncomes to children and teenagers. We must do everything we can to \ndiscourage our youth from using tobacco products; because once they \nstart, it is very difficult to stop. Long term use of tobacco causes \nserious health conditions such as lung cancer, emphysema, or COPD--\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. There is no question that \ntobacco is a killer.\n  And not only does tobacco kill, it also results in a tremendous \namount of unnecessary health care costs. Experts believe tobacco costs \nsociety billions of dollars each year. Even second-hand tobacco smoke \nharms those who do not smoke themselves but are merely around those who \ndo.\n  Do I believe that tobacco should be regulated? Of course I do. But do \nI believe that the Food and Drug Administration is the appropriate \nagency to regulate tobacco? Absolutely not. Let me take a few minutes \nto explain why I feel so strongly about this issue.\n  The FDA's core mission is to promote and protect public health. As a \nmember and former chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, the committee with jurisdiction over the Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act, I feel very strongly that the FDA should have \nsufficient resources to do its current job before taking on new \nresponsibilities. Over the years, I have worked hard to get the FDA the \nfunding it needs to protect consumer health; approve new drugs, \nbiologics and medical devices; and protect our Nation's food supply.\n  For years, FDA scientists have pleaded with Congress to give the \nagency more resources. In fact, according to the Alliance for a \nStronger FDA, the FDA's budget is small--$2.04 billion was appropriated \nfor the agency and it collects nearly $600 million in user fees. \nEighty-three percent of the FDA's costs are staff-related. The \nAlliance, whose membership includes three former Secretaries of Health \nand Human Services and six former FDA Commissioners, believes that the \nFDA's appropriation must increase by about $100 million per year just \nin order to stay even with increased costs--anything lower will result \nin decreased staff and programming. In addition, the Alliance believes \nthat the FDA's base has eroded even while it was given new \nresponsibility and ``operates in a world of increased globalization and \nscientific complexity.'' To put it in perspective, the FDA receives \nless funding than its local school district. Montgomery County, MD, \npublic schools received $2.07 billion in fiscal year 2009; the FDA \nreceived $2.04 billion in appropriated funds that same year.\n  Recently, we heard about peanut products tainted with salmonella. \nHundreds of people became sick and nine people lost their lives. In \n2008, consumers were sickened by salmonella in peppers and possibly \ntomatoes. Before that, it was spinach tainted with E. coli that was \nsold all across the United States.\n  Overall, the FDA has done good work on food safety, but it also needs \nmore inspectors and more resources to conduct inspections. In fact, on \nMarch 14, President Obama stated that about 95 percent of the Nation's \n150,000 food processing plants and warehouses go uninspected each year.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA struggles with more than just food. On the \npharmaceutical side, the FDA has had to deal with safety issue after \nsafety issue. From the withdrawal of Vioxx, to new data about suicide \nand SSRI antidepressants, FDA has been working to match its performance \nto its mission. We all know that it still has a way to go.\n  If the FDA is given the responsibility of regulating tobacco \nproducts, it will require the agency to expand considerably. A \ncompletely new center, the Center for Tobacco Products, will be \nestablished within the FDA and new scientific experts will have to be \nhired for that new Center. These individuals--epidemiologists, \ntoxicologists and medical reviewers--could be working on evaluating \ncancer drugs, or new vaccines, or tracing outbreaks of food borne \nillness--areas where, quite frankly, they are desperately needed. \nInstead, they will be wasting time, effort, and money in attempt to \nmake a deadly product slightly less deadly.\n  The former FDA commissioner, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, expressed \nserious concerns in 2007 that this bill does not provide enough funding \nfor an expansion of the FDA and does not authorize appropriations for \nstart-up costs. He also expressed concerns that regulating tobacco \nwould jeopardize FDA's public health mission. Dr. von Eschenbach was \nright--it makes no sense to expand this agency and divert its attention \nto tobacco products. I simply cannot understand why Congress is giving \nthis agency any additional duties without a clear idea, in my opinion, \nabout how much money it will cost to carry them out. Although this \nlegislation is funded by tobacco company user fees, how do we know that \nenough money will be collected? And, while it is my understanding that \nthe substitute big being considered by the Senate will require \nperformance reports on these user fees every 3 years, I feel that these \nreports should be filed on an annual basis so that we in Congress may \nmake necessary adjustments if the program is running out of money.\n  Another concern I have is the impact that these user fees could have \non public health programs like the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--CHIP--which relies on tobacco taxes for its financing. For \nthat reason, I filed an amendment calling for the Comptroller General \nof the Government Accountability Office to study whether this bill will \nhave an impact on public health programs. It is my hope that this \namendment will be accepted by my colleagues.\n  Finally, I want to talk in more detail about the mission of the FDA, \nwhich is to protect public health. I feel that by requiring the FDA to \nregulate tobacco, we are putting the agency in direct conflict of this \nimportant mission. Here are two undeniable truths about tobacco: (1) \ntobacco is known to cause serious illnesses and death, and (2) tobacco \ndoes not have any health benefits whatsoever. So, I ask you, what sense \ndoes it make to have the FDA regulate tobacco? How does an agency in \ncharge of protecting public health regulate tobacco, a product that is \ninherently unsafe?\n  In fact, when the bill was being considered by the Senate HELP \nCommittee a few weeks ago, I cosponsored and strongly supported Senator \nEnzi's amendment to have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nregulate tobacco products. Unlike the FDA, the CDC has the \ninfrastructure, personnel and mission to take on tobacco. The CDC \noperates programs that reduce the health and economic consequences of \nthe leading causes of\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\ndeath and disability, thereby ensuring a long, productive, healthy life \nfor all people. For those reasons, I felt that the CDC's mission was \nfar more suited to the regulation of tobacco. Unfortunately, that \namendment was not approved by HELP Committee members and, as a result, \nthe Senate is now considering a bill that would designate the FDA as \nthe regulator of tobacco products.\n  In conclusion, I am probably one of the FDA's strongest supporters in \nCongress. Back in the 1990s, I introduced legislation that created the \nWhite Oak campus; the unified FDA campus which I envisioned would bring \nprestige back to the agency. This campus is on track to be completed in \n2012. I wanted FDA to be able to attract the brightest minds so we \ncould get the best researchers in the country working together in order \nto ensure the safety of our drugs, medical devices and food supply. Dr. \nMargaret Hamburg, the newly confirmed FDA Commissioner has impressed me \nwith her strong vision for the future of the FDA. It is my hope that by \nadding the regulation of tobacco to the FDA's portfolio, that vision \ndoes not go off course.\n  I want to make one thing perfectly clear--I support the intent of \nthis bill which is to stop our young people from picking up that first \ncigarette and to protect public health by regulating tobacco. That \nbeing said, it is my hope that some of the concerns that I have raised \nwill be carefully considered and addressed before this legislation is \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6174-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRAISE OF DR. DOUGLAS LOWY AND DR. JOHN SCHILLER\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I would like to continue what I began \nlast month by honoring the contribution of our Federal employees.\n  On May 4, I came to the floor to discuss the importance of \nrecognizing the hard work and dedicated service of our Federal \nemployees. This is especially important because of our recovery efforts \nduring these challenging economic times. The programs we enact, it is \neasy to say, will be carried out by a Federal workforce that requires \npeople's confidence. I know from personal experience how industrious \nand trustworthy civil servants are. The public needs to know too.\n  As I said then, we also need to encourage more of our graduates to \nenter careers in public service. America is blessed with so many \nenthusiastic and entrepreneurial citizens. We need them to lend their \ntalents. We need their ideas, their creative minds. This is why I have \nmade it a priority to honor excellent public servants and call \nattention to what Federal employees can and do accomplish.\n  In my previous remarks, I promised to highlight some of our excellent \npublic servants from this desk every so often. In keeping with my \npromise, I rise to speak about two Federal employees whose achievements \nare particularly relevant to our work in this session: the current \nstate of our health care system.\n  As many know, cervical cancer is the second most common cause of \ncancer deaths in women worldwide. It takes the lives of almost a \nquarter million women each year. Here in America, nearly 11,000 women \nare diagnosed annually.\n  What distinguishes cervical cancer from most other cancers is its \ncause. While many cancers are linked to a genetic predisposition for \nabnormal cell growth, nearly all cases of cervical cancer result from \nviral infections. The majority of these infections come from exposure \nto the human papillomavirus or HPV. HPV is the most common sexually \ntransmitted disease affecting Americans.\n  When Dr. Douglas Lowy and Dr. John Schiller began studying HPV, \nlittle did they know that their 20-year partnership as researchers \nwould lead to the development of a vaccine.\n  Working at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer \nInstitute Center for Cancer Research, the two discovered that previous \nattempts at creating a vaccine had failed because a genetic mutation \nexisted in the virus, making it difficult for the body to produce \nantibodies against it.\n  Once Drs. Lowy and Schiller made this finding, they worked to create \na modified version of the HPV without the mutation. This development is \ninstrumental in the creation a few years ago of a vaccine that will \nprevent the vast majority of cervical cancer cases from developing.\n  Because over 80 percent of those who develop cervical cancer cases \nlive in developing nations, Drs. Lowy and Schiller have been working \nwith the World Health Organization to make the HPV vaccine available to \nwomen around the world.\n  In recognition of their achievement, the two men jointly were awarded \nthe 2007 Service to America Federal Employee of the Year Medal.\n  Today, women and girls age 9 through 26 have the ability to be \nvaccinated against developing cervical cancer.\n  Once again, I call on my fellow Senators to join me in honoring Dr. \nLowy and Dr. Schiller and all Federal employees who have distinguished \nthemselves in their service of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6174-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6174-S6175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I would like to speak on reforming our \nhealth care system. Simply put, health care reform has been delayed for \nfar too long, and it cannot wait any longer. Most Americans are \nsatisfied with the health care they receive today.\n  Let me repeat this. Most Americans are satisfied with the health care \nthey receive today. But if we want to sustain and improve the quality \nof health care, we need to act now.\n  What they are concerned about is what future health care is going to \nbe about, and they are also concerned about the cost of health care. We \nmust get health care costs under control while preserving choice.\n  If we do nothing and allow the status quo to persist, it has been \nestimated that the share of gross domestic product devoted to health \ncare will rise from 18 percent in 2009 to 28 percent in 2030.\n  If health care premiums continue to rise at 4 percent per year, which \nis actually less than the historical average, then by 2025, premiums \nfor family coverage will reach $25,200 a year--over $2,000 a month. \nThis trajectory is simply unsustainable.\n  We have attempted to reform our health care system several times in \nthe past to no avail. But this year is different and has to be \ndifferent. This time the call for reform is coming from people and \norganizations that previously opposed reform. This time businesses, \nalong with unions that represent their workers, are asking for reform.\n  Businesses in America have to compete against companies from other \ncountries. Many of them do not pay anything for health care for their \nworkers or retirees. Others pay far less than what many of our larger \ncorporations pay. This puts many of our businesses at a disadvantage in \nthe global marketplace.\n  In addition, people in my home State of Delaware and Americans across \nthe Nation are struggling to keep up with the crushing and seemingly \nconstant increase in the cost of health care.\n  Over the last decade, Americans have watched as their health \ninsurance premiums and deductibles have risen at much faster rates than \ntheir wages, threatening their financial stability. It also puts them \nat risk for losing their insurance as employers struggle to provide \nadequate health care coverage.\n  Americans rightfully value their relations with their doctor and the \ncare they receive. We must--and I say must--preserve these \nrelationships. In addition, as costs rise and insurance benefits erode, \nAmericans are also asking to protect what works and fixes what is \nbroken.\n  Our current health care system--the status quo--is rampant with \nbureaucracy, inefficiency, and waste. It is time for reform. It is time \nto reform health care for Americans so everyone has access to quality, \naffordable care, regardless of preexisting medical conditions. It is \ntime to reform health care so we\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nplace a higher priority on prevention and wellness, saving lives as \nwell as money. It is time to reform health care so all Americans can \ncompare the costs and benefits of different health care policies. It is \ntime to reform health care so Americans have more choices, not less, \nand can choose their own doctor.\n  I applaud the members of the Finance Committee and the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, as well as our \ncounterparts in the House, for their sincere dedication, their \nthoroughness, and their commitment to crafting legislation that truly \nwill transform the health care system in this country.\n\n  It is clear this is not an easy task and is one that will require \ntrue compromise from everyone across the ideological spectrum, but it \nis a task that must be done. Our country and the health of its \ncitizens, as well as the economy, cannot afford to maintain the status \nquo.\n  As the members of these committees gather to discuss and ultimately \nmark up legislation, I encourage them to include a viable public option \nin a menu of insurance options from which Americans may choose. It will \nbe--and let me stress this--it would be a purely voluntary option.\n  If you like your current plan, you keep it. But a public health \ninsurance option is critical to ensure the greatest amount of choice \npossible for consumers. There are too many Americans who do not have \nreal choices when it comes to health insurance, especially those who \nlive in rural areas.\n  In addition, many large urban areas are dominated by one or two \ninsurers that serve more than 60 percent of the market. In fact, there \nare seven States where one insurer has over 75 percent of the market \nshare.\n  A public option can help Americans expand their choice of insurance \nprovider. A public option could take various forms, and I think the \ncommittees are the proper place to determine the appropriate contours \nof a public option.\n  I think a good starting point for discussion is the proposal put \nforward by my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer. It delivers all \nthe benefits of increased competition without relying on unfair, built-\nin advantages for the federally backed option.\n  This public option would not be subsidized by the government or \npartnered with Medicare. It would not be supported by tax revenue. It \nwould compete on a level playing field with the private insurance \nindustry. If a level playing field exists, then private insurers will \nhave to compete based on quality of care and pricing, instead of just \ncompeting for the healthiest consumers.\n  This is just one proposal for public option. There are others we can \ndebate as we move forward.\n  Right now, more than 30 State governments offer their employees a \nchoice between traditional private insurance and a plan that is self-\ninsured by the State. Some of them have had them for more than 15 \nyears.\n  In these States, the market share of the self-funded plans within the \nmarket for State employees typically ranges from 25 to 40 percent. This \nshows a healthy competition between the public option and private \ninsurers, not domination by either type of insurer. The States provide \nthese options because they believe it adds value to competitive \nofferings they give their workers.\n  These arrangements do not seem to be a problem or incite ideological \nissues at the State level. Why should it be so when discussing health \nreform on the national level?\n  A public option can go a long way in introducing quality advancements \nand innovation that many private insurers do not now have the incentive \nto implement.\n  Medicare and the veterans health system have spearheaded important \ninnovations in the past, including payment methods, quality of care \ninitiatives, and information technology advancements.\n  A new public option could also help lead the way in bringing more \ninnovation to the delivery system and introducing new measures to \nreduce costs and improve quality.\n  A public option can serve as a benchmark for all insurers, setting a \nstandard for cost, quality, and access within regional or national \nmarketplaces. It can have low administrative costs and can have a broad \nchoice of providers.\n  Simply put, Americans should have a choice of a public health \ninsurance option operating alongside private plans.\n  A public option will give Americans a better range of choices, make \nthe health care market more competitive, and keep insurance companies \nhonest.\n  The key to all this, however, is that a public option will be just \nthat, as I said--an option, not a mandate.\n  Some people will choose it; others will not. If you like the \ninsurance plan you have now, you keep it. If you are happy with the \ninsurance you get with your employer, or even the individual insurance \nmarket, you stay enrolled in that insurance plan. And if you are \nunsatisfied with the public option, you have the option to switch back \nto private insurers.\n  Americans firmly support the ability to choose their own doctor and \nvalue their relationships with their providers. So do I.\n  An overriding goal of health reform is to increase patients' access \nto affordable, quality health care, and offering a public option can \nhelp increase Americans' choices.\n  I am heartened that I was joined by 26 other Senators several weeks \nago in cosponsoring a resolution introduced by Senator Brown calling \nfor the inclusion of a federally backed health insurance option in \nhealth care reform.\n  Senators who have been involved in health care issues for decades--\nSenators Kennedy, Dodd, Rockefeller, Harkin, Bingaman, and Inouye, just \nto name a few--have all agreed that a public option should be included.\n  As I said before, I admire the efforts of my colleagues on the \nFinance and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committees who will \nbe drafting our health reform legislation.\n  They have an important responsibility, and I recognize that they will \nbe debating many options regarding coverage, financing, regulations, \nand so on.\n  I simply encourage them to consider seriously a public option as a \nchoice for Americans in any new health insurance exchange.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6175-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6175-S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think the American people are aware \nthat our country is in the midst of a major health care crisis. That is \nnot a secret to anybody. Forty-six million Americans have no health \ninsurance and, importantly, even more are underinsured, with high \ndeductibles and copayments. Further, some 60 million Americans, \nincluding many with health insurance, do not have access to a medical \nhome of their own. In fact, according to the Institute of Medicine, \nsome 18,000 Americans die each year from preventable diseases because \nthey lack health insurance and do not get to a doctor when they should.\n  I can recall very vividly talking to several physicians in Vermont \nwho told me how people walked into their office, quite sick, and when \nthey asked why they hadn't come in earlier, they said: Well, we don't \nhave a lot of money; we didn't have any health insurance. The result is \nthat those patients died. That happens every single day in this great \ncountry.\n  When we talk about health care, we have to understand that access to \ndental care is even worse. On top of that, in our Nation, we pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. My State of Vermont \nborders on Canada, and it is not uncommon for people to go from Vermont \nto Canada to buy the prescription drugs they need at far lower cost \nthan in America.\n  In the midst of all of this--the 46 million Americans without health \ninsurance, people being underinsured, and people paying outrageously \nhigh prices for prescription drugs--at the end of the day, our Nation \npays far more for health care per person than any other country on \nEarth. Far more. It is not even close. Yet despite the enormous\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nsum of money we spend, our health care outcomes--what we get for what \nwe spend--lag behind many other countries in terms of life expectancy--\nhow long our people live, in terms of infant mortality, and other \nhealth indices.\n  According to a recent report from the National Center for Health \nStatistics--this is just one example--the United States ranks 29th in \ninfant mortality in the world--29th in the world. We are tied with \nPoland and Slovakia for 29th in the world in terms of infant mortality. \nIn all due respect to our friends in Poland and Slovakia, we should be \ndoing a lot better than that because we spend a lot more on health care \nthan they do in Poland and Slovakia.\n  Further, according to a study published in the London School of \nHygiene and Tropical Medicine, the United States has the highest rate \nof preventable deaths among 19 industrialized nations. Although our \nrate has declined over the past 5 years, it is doing so at a slower \nrate than other countries. According to that study, if the rate of \npreventable deaths in the United States improved to the average of the \ntop three countries, which are France, Japan, and Australia, \napproximately 100,000 fewer residents of the United States would die \nannually.\n  When we talk about health care, we are not just talking about \nindividuals who suffer and die because they do not have health care. \nWhat we are talking about is that the high cost of health care--as \nPresident Obama makes clear all of the time--is a major economic issue \nas well. In our country today, we are now spending about 16 percent of \nour GNP on health care, and the cost of health care is continuing to \nrise at a very high rate, which becomes economically unsustainable. The \nfact is, General Motors, which recently declared bankruptcy, spends \nmore money on health care per automobile than they do on steel, and \nthat creates an economic climate in which America--our companies--\nbecomes noncompetitive with other countries around the world. But it is \nnot just large corporations such as GM. Small business owners in \nVermont and throughout this country are finding it harder and harder \nnot only to provide health care for their workers but even for \nthemselves.\n  In addition, a recent study found that medical problems contributed \nto 62 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 and that between 2001 and \n2007, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical \nproblems rose by nearly 50 percent. Interestingly, 78 percent of those \nwho experienced bankruptcy as a result of illness were insured. They \nwere insured. These are not people who did not have any health \ninsurance. But it speaks to the inadequacy and the lack of coverage, \ncomprehensive coverage, in many health insurance programs.\n  We as a Congress, for whatever reason--and I will suggest the reason \nin a moment--do not really spend a lot of time discussing why the \nAmerican health care system is so expensive, why it is so inefficient, \nwhy it is so complicated. We do not talk about that very much. I fear \nthat has a lot to do with the role private health insurance plays over \nthe political process in this country. Let me be very clear. In my \nview, the evidence is overwhelming that the function of a private \nhealth insurance company is not to provide health care. The function of \na private health insurance company is to make as much money as it \npossibly can. The truth is, the more health care a private health \ninsurance company denies people, the more money it makes. If you submit \na claim for coverage and they deny it, from their perspective that is a \nvery good thing because they make more money.\n  Further, in pursuit of making as much money as they can, private \nhealth insurance companies have created a patchwork system which is the \nmost complicated, the most bureaucratic, and the most wasteful in the \nworld. According to a number of studies, we are wasting about $400 \nbillion a year in administrative costs, in profiteering, and in \nbureaucratic billing practices. That is enough money to provide health \ncare to all of the uninsured.\n  I know that is not an issue we are supposed to be talking about here \non the floor of the Senate because we are not supposed to take on the \ninsurance companies or the drug companies because of all of their \npower. But I believe, if we are serious about moving toward a \nuniversal, comprehensive, cost-effective health care system in this \ncountry, we have to talk about the very negative role private health \ninsurance companies are playing in that process.\n  Administrative costs for insurers, employers, and the providers of \nhealth care in the United States are about one out of every four health \ncare dollars we spend. In other words, for every $1 we spend, one \nquarter of that dollar does not go to doctors, does not go to nurses, \ndoes not go to medicine, does not go to therapies; it goes to \nadministration. That is at the root of the problem we have in terms of \nhealth care costs in America. In California--one example--only 66 \npercent of total insurance premiums are used to cover hospital and \nphysician services. One-third, $1 out of every $3, is spent on \nadministration, billing, claims processing, sales and marketing, \nfinance and underwriting.\n  The American people want their health care dollars spent on health \ncare. I know that is a radical idea, but when people spend money on \nhealth care, they assume it goes to the provision of health care, not \nprofiteering, not administration, not hiring more bureaucrats to tell \nus we are not covered when we thought we were covered. What the \nAmerican people want is close to 100 percent of that dollar to go to \nhealth care and not bureaucracy.\n  While health care costs in America have soared, as everybody knows, \nfrom 2003 to 2007 the combined profits of the Nation's major health \ninsurance companies increased by 170 percent. Health care costs are \nsoaring, profits of the major health insurance companies have gone up \nby 170 percent from 2003 to 2007, and CEO compensation for the top \nseven health insurance companies averaged over $14 million per CEO. To \nadd insult to injury, some of these health care profits are going \ndirectly into campaign contributions and into lobbying to make sure, in \nfact, the Congress does not move forward toward real health care \nreform, which, in my view, means a single-payer health care system.\n  That is where we are right now. We have the most inefficient, \nwasteful, bureaucratic system of any major country on Earth. Our health \ncare outcomes, despite all the money we spend, are way below many other \ncountries in the world. And we are not discussing the most important \nissue with regard to health care spending; that is, the role private \nhealth insurance companies are playing.\n  We are now in the beginning of the debate on health care. I am going \nto do my best to make sure that issue of the role private health \ninsurance companies are playing in the system, the very negative role \nthey are playing, is something that, in fact, we talk about.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I commend my friend, the junior Senator \nfrom Vermont, for his words, this critique about the health insurance \nsystem--what is right about it and what is wrong with it. We know, for \nthose with insurance, we can get good medical care in this country. We \nknow many people do not have any insurance. We know many others have \ninadequate insurance. And we know that so many Americans are in a \nsituation where they are anxious about the future of their health and \nthe quality of health care they have. Too many Americans have seen \ntheir health care premiums go up, their deductibles go up, and their \ncopays go up. They end up with a private insurance company that finds \nways to delay paying them, to in many cases not reimburse them at all \nfor their health care expenses. It is insurance that does not really \ndeliver, and that is really no insurance at all.\n  What Senator Sanders said is exactly right. The behavior of health \ninsurance companies has meant we have huge administrative costs.\n  More and more, we remember what the President of the United States \nsaid when he was a candidate for President. Senator Sanders mentioned \nthat story at the White House the other day to President Obama, how \nmoved people in this country were when they heard the President talk \nabout his own mother who was dying, who was fighting with insurance \ncompanies over paying for her cancer treatment while she was dying. She \nhad to advocate for herself.\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nHer son was advocating for her, of course, too. But she went through \nthe trauma and pain of cancer and the trauma and pain of dealing with \ninsurance companies. We know that. Yet some in this body want to \nincrease the role of private insurance and allow them to continue to \ngame the system.\n  We also know that private insurance companies in many ways are simply \na step ahead of the sheriff. They do not mind insuring someone who is \n50 and healthy, but they would rather not insure someone who is 63 and \nunhealthy because they can make more money on someone who is healthy, \nbut in somebody who has a preexisting condition, they will find a way \nnot to insure them or not to pay off to them when they get sick. We \nknow about the inefficiencies in the health care system, in private \ninsurance. We know the difficulties with private insurance, the \nbureaucracy, and we know about the administrative costs of private \ninsurance.\n  Private insurance administrative costs run anywhere from 15 percent \nto 30 percent, depending on whether you are in a big group plan, a \nsmaller group plan, or an individual plan. We also know Medicare, which \nhas delivered for 44 years--it was signed by President Johnson in July \nof 1965--we know Medicare has delivered very well in the great majority \nof cases for the American people, for the elderly, but we also know \nMedicare has about a 2-percent or 3-percent administrative cost--again, \ncontrasted with 15 to 30 percent with private insurance companies.\n  We also know, interestingly, there is a statistic--there was a study \nseveral years ago of the richest industrial democracies--France, \nGermany, Japan, Israel, England, Spain, Italy, Canada, and the United \nStates--and they rated all these countries according to several health \ncare indices: life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, \ninoculation rates for children, all those things. Of the 13 countries \nthey looked at, the United States ranked 12th. Even though we spent \ntwice as much as any other country on Earth per capita, our outcomes \nwere not as good. We were 12th out of 13. In one category, America \nranked near the top, and that is life expectancy at 65.\n  If you get to be 65 in this country, the chances are you are going to \nlive a longer, healthier life than almost any other country in the \nworld. Why? Because we have a health care system, Medicare, that \nprovides health insurance for everybody over 65. There are holes and \ngaps in coverage in Medicare; the premiums can be pretty hard for some \nto reach; the copay and deductibles can be a problem.\n  Overall people know when they have Medicare they are pretty darned \nwell taken care of. That is not the case for people under 65. I came to \nthe floor tonight for a few more moments, as I was listening to Senator \nSanders talk so eloquently, to share a couple stories.\n  Sherry, in Albany, OH, is not Medicare eligible. She is forced to \nconsider borrowing from the equity in her home to pay her $1,070 \npremium through COBRA. She had a job. She lost her job. She has to pay \nthe employer and employee side to pay for her health insurance. That is \nthe way COBRA works. It is a good program but a bit of a cruel hoax. If \nyou lose your job, it is pretty hard to pay your premium and your \nemployer's premium at the same time.\n  She is considering borrowing against her house to pay for her health \ninsurance for COBRA for 18 months. She will get a little bit of help \nnow, because in the stimulus package, we took care of some of that. She \nhas to find a way until she is 65 to cobble together insurance.\n  Terry, a small business owner nearby in Columbus, expects to pay 35 \npercent more this year to cover his employees. He wants to cover his \nemployees, but he has a 30-percent increase. What is he supposed to do, \nespecially when his business--I don't know a lot about his business, \nbut so many small businesses are squeezed more and more because of the \neconomy. So we know these stories, and that is why it is so important \nthat we address health care reform this year.\n  We want to do several things. First of all, anybody who is in a \nhealth care plan they are happy with, they are satisfied with now, they \ncan stay in that plan. If they want to make that choice, they stay in \nthe plan. Second, we need to do something on costs, to stop the huge \nincrease in premiums, copays, deductibles. We have to do a better job \nto constrain costs in the health care plan than this government or the \nprivate sector has been able to do for decades.\n  Third, we need to give people full choice. That means they can stay \nin their plan, as I mentioned earlier, No. 1, but they also will have a \nchoice of private insurance plans and a public plan, a public option. \nSo they can choose a private plan with Aetna or a private plan with \nUnited Health or a private plan with BlueCross BlueShield or they can \ndecide to join a public plan, a public plan that might look similar to \nMedicare, which they can decide, perhaps they would save money or have \nbetter preventive care or a plan with lower copays or deductibles.\n  They can make the choice. A great majority of the Democratic caucus, \nand I hope Republicans will join us, an overwhelming sector wants that \noption, a public plan and a private plan they can choose, that might be \nsimilar to Medicare.\n  Anything we tried in health care, every time that health care reform \nwas introduced, the cries of ``government takeover'' and ``socialized \nmedicine'' were heard from by conservatives who do not think government \nshould have a role in health care.\n  We are the only country in the world that thinks that, it seems like, \nbecause every other country has a major part of their health care plan, \na major part is involved with the government, if not the whole plan.\n  We are not asking for a government takeover, we are not doing \nsocialized medicine. That is what they always say. We heard it in 1948, \nwhen Harry Truman tried to push through Medicare. We heard it in 1965, \nwhen Lyndon Johnson and the overwhelmingly Democratic House and Senate \npassed the Medicare law. We heard it in 1993, my first term in the \nHouse, Senator Sanders' second term in the House. And that is what \ninsurers are claiming today. They are saying: Government takeover of \nmedicine. That is not true. We want a government option plan. We want \nthe government to provide a Medicare plan that people can choose from. \nYou can choose a private plan or public plan.\n  Americans deserve no less. Our country can afford no less. The \nPresident asked us to move on this as quickly as we can and to do it \nright. This is our chance, and I think we are going to do it.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Would the Senator from Ohio yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I wish to thank him for his cogent remarks, talking \nabout one of the most basic issues facing this country and that is \nhealth care. We are on the Veterans' Committee as well, and I know you \nspend a lot of time talking to veterans in Ohio. Has the Senator heard \na veteran in Ohio tell you they want to privatize the VA?\n  Mr. BROWN. I have heard mostly conservative Republicans say they want \nto privatize the VA.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Every time that issue is raised, the veterans say no.\n  Mr. BROWN. One of the things we noticed about the Veterans' \nAdministration is that the VA has found a way to buy, at the lowest \ncost possible, some of the least-expensive but good-quality \nprescription drugs. Because what the VA does--there are millions of \nveterans--they negotiate on behalf of veterans with individual drug \ncompanies for individual prescription drugs, individual \npharmaceuticals, and they get a rate at about one-half of what you \nwould pay if you went to Drug Mart or Rite Aid or any of the other \nstores.\n  The Medicare bill, when it came through the House and Senate--\nPresident Bush pushed that bill--they did not allow us to negotiate \ndrug prices. We know what this is about. We know if we follow the lead \nof the drug industry and the insurance industry, which this Congress \ndid through most of the first part of this decade with President Bush, \nwe end up with special interest laws that protect the drug companies or \ninsurance companies.\n  Or we can now pass health care with a public option plan, give the \npublic the option of going to a Medicare-like plan instead of a private \ninsurance company plan, if they want to, or stay in the plan they are \nin and then they decide on what kind of care they would like.\n  Mr. SANDERS. My friend from Ohio is exactly right. If you talk to the \npeople of this country, if you talk to the veterans and say: Do you \nwant VA\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nhealth care to be privatized? Overwhelmingly, no.\n  In recent years, the Senator from Ohio, I, and others, have worked to \nsubstantially increase funding for federally qualified community health \ncare centers all over this country. These are the most cost-effective \nways of providing quality health care, dental care, low-cost \nprescription drugs, mental health counseling.\n  The people of this country want those. I hope we have success in \nexpanding that program. But I get a little bit tired of hearing from \nsome of our friends on the other side who tell us: Oh, people do not \nwant government involved in health care. Well, you tell that to \nseniors. Tell them you want to privatize Medicare. Tell that to the \nveterans, that you want to privatize the VA.\n  The fact is, as the Senator from Ohio indicated, we are wasting tens \nand tens of billions of dollars every year in bureaucracy, in billing, \nin excessive CEO salaries through private health insurance companies. \nAt the very least, the people of this country are demanding, and we \nmust bring forth, a strong--underline ``strong''--public option within \nany health care reform program we develop.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. It is pretty clear, and \nI think this Congress is going to do the right thing. The President, \nwhen he met with us last week, as he promised in his campaign, was \nstrongly in favor of purchasing insurance from the Medicare look-alike \nplan or private plans or either one or keeping what they already have.\n  The President has spoken strongly on it for months. The majority of \nthis Congress wants to do the same. I am hopeful that is what we will \ndo in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6178-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Sergeant Justin Duffy\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SGT \nJustin J. Duffy, age 31, who was killed in Iraq on June 2, 2009.\n  Sergeant Duffy was born in Moline, IL. As a child, his family moved \nto Cozad, NE, where he graduated from high school in 1995. He earned a \ndegree in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska-Kearney. \nDuffy worked at Eaton Corporation for 5 years, where he was recognized \nfor his work ethic and leadership ability and promoted to a supervisor \nposition. His colleagues and friends said Duffy was the kind of person \nwho never missed a day on the job and was always on time and ready to \nwork. This young man stood out among his peers and always sought a \nchallenge, so it came as no surprise to his friends and family when he \ndecided to join the Army, enlisting in May 2008.\n  Sergeant Duffy's father Joe said the U.S. Army had attracted his son \nbecause he wanted adventure and needed more of a challenge and he \nbelieved that desire would be fulfilled by serving in the military. His \ntime with the U.S. Army was marked by success; one of his proudest \naccomplishments was his quick rise to Sergeant, beating the standard \ntime it normally takes to achieve that rank. Sergeant Duffy was \nassigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. While \nin Iraq, Sergeant Duffy's team was responsible for escort security for \nhigh-ranking military leadership.\n  Sergeant Duffy passed away in eastern Baghdad after an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near the humvee he was driving; three of his \nfellow soldiers were also wounded in the blast. Sergeant Duffy served \nhis country honorably and made the ultimate sacrifice for his fellow \nAmericans. His life and service represents an example we should all \nstrive to emulate.\n  SGT Justin Duffy leaves behind his parents Joe and Janet Duffy of \nCozad, NE; his grandfather LeRoy Hood of Moline, IL; and two sisters \nJenny of Grand Island, NE, and Jackie of Yuma, AZ. He will forever be \nremembered by his family and friends as the kind of person who was \nquick to jump in wherever he was needed; some even labeled him a \nshepherd, as he always looked out for family, friends, and even \nstrangers. I join all Nebraskans today in mourning the loss of Sergeant \nDuffy and offering our deepest condolences to his family.\n\n\n                      Specialist Jeremy R. Gullett\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to invite my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing Greenup County, KY, for paying tribute to Army \nSPC Jeremy R. Gullett.\n  SPC Jeremy R. Gullett served in the 4th Battalion, 320th Field \nArtillery Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division based out of Fort \nCampbell. He lost his life in the line of duty on May 7, 2008, in the \nSabari District of Afghanistan.\n  This evening Greenup County will have a dedication ceremony to name a \nlocal bridge after Specialist Gullett, honoring his life and service to \nour Nation. The bridge will serve as a reminder to all of those who \nlive or travel through Greenup County of the sacrifice Specialist \nGullett made for our freedom.\n  A member of the Greenup County High School Class of 2003, Specialist \nGullett participated in his high school's Junior ROTC program and \njoined our Nation's Armed Forces soon after earning his diploma. In \naddition to serving under our Nation's armed services, Specialist \nGullett was a member of Little Sandy Volunteer Fire Department and \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, dedicating his life to service domestically \nand internationally.\n  Specialist Gullett's sacrifice for our Nation will forever be a \nreminder that freedom comes at a high cost. We should never take for \ngranted the sacrifice that men and women make daily in all branches of \nthe Armed Forces.\n  As we commemorate the life and service of SPC Jeremy Gullett, my \nthoughts and prayers are with his friends and family. All Kentuckians \nand Americans are deeply indebted to Specialist Gullett.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6178-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6178-S6180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DECEPTIVE MARKETING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month the Senate passed and the \nPresident signed H. R. 627, the Credit CARD Act of 2009. Thanks to the \nhard work of Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, Representative Maloney, many \nother Members of Congress, and the multitude of fed-up citizens who \nprotested unfair treatment by credit card companies, this landmark bill \nto protect consumers from abusive credit card practices was passed over \nthe objections of powerful lobbies. Millions of Americans will benefit \nnow that some balance of power is being restored between card holders \nand card issuers.\n  Today, I want to thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for including \nin the Credit CARD Act a provision that I authored and that was \ncosponsored by Senator Collins and Senator Menendez, to stop the \ndeceptive marketing of free credit reports. I would also like to thank \nSenator Pryor for working with me to address his concerns about the \nprovision.\n  Credit reports are a record of an individual's history of receiving \nand repaying loans, and they frequently contain errors. At the same \ntime, these credit reports are used to calculate the credit scores that \nhave become so central to evaluating a person's creditworthiness. \nCredit scores are used to determine whether someone will qualify for a \ncredit card, what interest rate they will get, and whether and when \nthat rate will increase. Credit scores perform a similar function for \nhome mortgages, car loans, and consumer lines of credit. Some companies \nuse these scores to screen applicants for apartments, insurance, \nsecurity clearances, and even jobs. The important role a credit score \nplays in our everyday lives makes it all the more critical that the \nreports used to calculate these scores are accurate and accessible to \nconsumers.\n  In the United States, three large nationwide credit reporting \ncompanies, often called ``credit bureaus,'' compile and maintain credit \nreports for the vast majority of consumers. Until Congress passed the \nFair and Accurate Credit Transactions, FACT, Act of 2003, consumers had \nto pay a fee in order to access or attempt to correct the information \nin their credit reports.\n  The FACT Act gave consumers the right to a free annual report from \neach of the nationwide consumer reporting companies. The FTC mandated \nthe establishment of a website, AnnualCreditReport.com, to provide \nconsumers access to their federally mandated free credit reports. In \nthese difficult economic times, it is critical that consumers have a \nclear understanding of their right to get a free annual report, an easy \nway to obtain\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nthose reports, and the ability to correct any mistakes since mistakes \nin a credit report could cost someone a loan or a job.\n  Today, however, television, radio, and the internet are awash in \nmisleading advertisements for free credit reports. A cottage industry \nhas sprung up of unscrupulous marketers who confuse or deceive \nconsumers into buying products or services they may not need or want by \ntying the purchases to the offer of a so-called ``free credit report.'' \nMany of these marketers deliberately obscure the difference between the \nfree reports to which consumers have a right under Federal law--which \ncome with no strings attached--and the ``free reports'' that marketers \ncondition on purchases of credit monitoring, credit scores, or other \nproducts.\n  Deceptive advertisements direct consumers to contact commercial \nsources unaffiliated with the government-authorized \nAnnualCreditReport.com. Consumers who request ``free'' credit reports \nfrom these sources often find they have unwittingly signed up for \ncredit monitoring or other services they must pay for. Some of these \noffers include notice that they are not affiliated with the federally \nmandated free report, and that consumers who accept the offer will \neither have to pay for another product or cancel a ``trial membership'' \nwithin a short time to avoid being charged. These disclaimers, however, \nare often buried in fine print or appear in places where most consumers \nwon't see them. They simply are not adequate to correct the overall \nimpression that the offer is for the free, no-strings-attached credit \nreport available under federal law. Deceptive advertisements using free \ncredit reports as bait are particularly destructive, because they take \nadvantage of a consumer's general knowledge that free credit reports \nare available under law, and subvert the law's intent to protect \nconsumers.\n  The FTC has received hundreds of complaints from consumers who have \nbeen confused or deceived into paying for what they thought was their \nfree report provided by law. The Better Business Bureau reports that \njust one prominent advertiser of free credit reports, \nFreeCreditReport.com, has been the subject of more than 9,600 \ncomplaints over the last 36 months. FreeCreditReport.com requires a \npotential customer to provide a credit card number in order to \nestablish an account and request a credit report. Many consumers assume \nthis information is necessary for the company to identify the correct \ncredit file, because why else would you have to provide a valid credit \ncard to receive a free report? In fact, buried in the small print it is \nrevealed that customers that request a free credit report must also opt \nout of a credit monitoring service or else they will be charged $15 a \nmonth, indefinitely.\n  A 2007 study by Robert Mayer and Tyler Barrick of the University of \nUtah for Consumer Reports WebWatch analyzed 24 websites that market \nfree credit reports and scores and revealed them to be rife with \ndeceptive practices. Many of the websites studied had the word ``free'' \nin the domain name; others had names similar to the FTC-mandated \nAnnualCreditReport.com, such as NationalCreditReport.com. Of the 58 \nsales pitches for credit reports or scores across the 24 websites \nanalyzed, 41 pitches were for ``free'' reports or scores that in fact \nrequired purchase of a product or enrollment in a credit monitoring \nservice. The study concluded that the ``enticement of free credit \nreports and free credit scores is an integral part of marketing credit-\nrelated services.'' Interestingly, the study also revealed that of the \n24 websites analyzed, nine were owned by, or closely connected to, the \nnationwide bureau TransUnion, and eight were owned by or closely \nconnected to the nationwide credit bureau Experian.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has sued companies engaged in such \nmisleading practices, but the deceptive advertisements have not \nstopped. Since 2005, for example, Experian has paid the government more \nthan $1.2 million in settlements over deceptive marketing of ostensibly \nfree credit reports through the website FreeCreditReport.com. And yet \nFreeCreditReport.com, through its seemingly ubiquitous advertisements, \ncontinues to deceptively peddle its product. At this very moment the \nFlorida Attorney General's office has an active investigation into \nFreeCreditReport.com for ``Failure to adequately disclose negative \noption enrollment in credit monitoring with `Free' credit report, \ndeceptive advertising, misleading domain name, and failure to honor \ncancellations.''\n  Section 205 of the Credit CARD Act, which contains the Levin-Collins-\nMenendez provision, will shore up the consumer protection in the FACT \nAct by requiring simple, honest disclosure in advertisements for \n``free'' credit reports. Mandatory disclosures will help ensure that \nconsumers are given accurate information about how to obtain a free \ncredit report with no strings attached. It is an effort to end the \ndeceptive activities of companies that attempt to trick people into \nbuying something that they are entitled by Federal law to receive for \nfree.\n  Section 205 directs the Federal Trade Commission to issue a rule by \nFebruary 2010, to require companies advertising free credit reports to \ndisclose the availability of the government-mandated free credit report \nin all mediums--internet, television, radio and print. Under the \nstatute, the rulemaking must require that all television and radio ads \nfor free credit reports include the disclaimer that ``This is not the \nfree credit report provided for by federal law.'' The rulemaking will \nalso require that all internet advertisers of free credit reports \nprominently display on the advertiser's homepage and possibly the \nadvertisement itself that consumers can order the free credit reports \nprovided for by federal law from www.AnnualCreditReport.com.\n  Section 205 provides for FTC rulemaking to flesh out the disclosure \nrequirements, such as what information should be provided, how it \nshould be formatted, and where it should be displayed. This section \nwill not achieve its purpose unless the mandated disclosure is made in \na clear, prominent, and effective manner, a standard that disclosures \nin many current promotions do not achieve. The cleverly deemphasized \ndisclosure currently on FreeCreditReport.com, for example, would not be \nsufficient.\n  The success of a disclosure in alleviating confusion and deception \ndepends critically on the manner in which it is presented. Even \nseemingly minor differences in language or presentation can make the \ndifference between effective and ineffective disclosures. Section 205 \nrecognizes these challenges and the FTC's unique ability to meet them \nby giving the agency the authority to implement this new disclosure \nrequirement by rule. I encourage the FTC to use consumer testing to \nidentify the most effective disclosures and to design separate \ndisclosure requirements for each type of medium: television, radio, \ninternet, and print.\n  Section 205 (b)(2)(B) states that, ``for advertisements on the \nInternet,'' the FTC rulemaking shall determine ``whether the disclosure \nrequired under section 612(g)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (as \nadded by this section) shall appear on the advertisement or the website \non which the free credit report is made available.'' I want to be \nperfectly clear, as the Senator who authored this provision and ensured \nits inclusion in the final bill, that this provision is intended to \nallow the FTC to require disclosure on an internet ad, on the website \nto which the ad is linked, on the ``home'' website of the company \nadvertising ``free'' credit reports, or on any combination of the \nthree. In my view, most forms of internet advertising, such as banner \nads and paid search engine links promising free credit reports, should \ninclude disclosures. It will be up to the FTC to determine the nature \nand extent of the disclosure on each form of internet advertising.\n  The goal of section 205 is to eliminate consumer confusion and \ndeception by preventing commercial promotions from posing as the \nFederal free annual report program, and by ensuring that consumers know \nhow to get their truly free annual reports. Although this provision \ndoes not prohibit the marketing of ``free credit reports'' per se, \nnothing in this section is intended to limit the FTC's authority under \nSection 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in \nor affecting commerce, or its authority under the FACT Act to \npromulgate regulations regarding the\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\ncentralized source for free credit reports. In fact, I hope the FTC \nutilizes all of its authority to end the deceptive marketing of free \ncredit reports.\n  Today, deceptive marketing of ``free'' credit reports is big \nbusiness. Ads appear on television, the internet, and other media. One \nof the leading advertisers of ostensibly free credit reports that are, \nin fact, linked to paid services is Experian, which vigorously opposed \nthe disclosure requirements in Section 205. Despite its best efforts to \nsugarcoat its marketing practices, Experian acknowledged that if it \nwere required in its advertising to inform potential customers of their \nlegal right to get a no-strings-attached free credit report, it would \nhave a harder time selling a ``free'' credit report that also requires \nconsumers to sign up for credit monitoring at $15 per month.\n  Experian spends tens of millions of dollars advertising \nFreeCreditReport.com, dwarfing government efforts to publicize the \navailability of free credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com and \neffectively undermining the intent of the free credit report provision \nof the FACT Act. So it is no surprise that Experian defended its \nmarketing practices with aggressive lobbying. I am confident that the \nFTC will stand up to that kind of pressure and issue strong pro-\nconsumer regulations by the February 2010 deadline in the law.\n  If, however, the FTC has not issued final rules by the statutory \ndeadline, Section 205 requires an interim disclosure, ``Free credit \nreports are available under Federal law at: AnnualCreditReport.com,'' \nto be included in any advertisement for free credit reports in any \nmedium. That interim disclosure is intended to be required in all ads \nfrom February 2010, until the FTC rulemaking is finalized.\n  As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have \nspent the last 4 years working to expose industry-wide credit card \nabuses. In 2007, my subcommittee held hearings which brought before the \nSenate not only consumers victimized by unfair practices, but also the \ncredit card CEOs who approved those practices. In many cases, the card \nissuers that engaged in these practices relied upon information in a \ncredit report.\n  Section 205 of the Credit CARD Act will help prevent the subversion \nof a key consumer protection. Again, I thank my colleagues for enacting \nSection 205 into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6180-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING TIANANMEN SQUARE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today marks a somber anniversary. Twenty \nyears ago today, months of peaceful protests throughout China \nculminated with the violent deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of \nChinese citizens advocating for democratic reforms. It is with sadness \nthat we mark this occasion, but it is also an opportunity to renew our \ncall for political reform in the People's Republic of China.\n  One of the first things you see when you walk into my office is a \nlarge poster depicting the iconic image of a lone man staring down a \nline of Chinese tanks. This image has come to symbolize the worldwide \nstruggle for democracy, the rule of law, and the promotion of basic \nhuman rights. Unfortunately, a generation of students in China can't \nidentify the image or tell you about the events leading up to June 3 \nand 4, 1989. This is because China has failed to acknowledge or account \nfor the actions that led up to this event.\n  While the intervening years since the tragedy have seen China grow \ninto a rapidly developing country, economically intertwined with the \nrest of the world, China's failure to deal with the Tiananmen events \nprevents the nation from making the political reforms necessary to \ntruly become a respected member of the international community.\n  In the years following Tiananmen, leaders of the Communist Party of \nChina including Jiang Zemin, declared, ``If we had not taken absolute \nmeasures at the time, we would not have the stability we enjoy today. A \nbad thing has turned out to be good.'' General Chi Haotian, the General \nin charge of the People's Liberation Army's response to the protest \nlater stated that, ``I can tell you in a responsible and serious manner \nthat at that time not a single person lost his life in Tiananmen \nSquare.'' Leaders of the military crackdown such as Deng Xiaoping and \nLi Peng, have never been held accountable for the actions of the \nPeople's Liberation Army and there has never been an official \nacknowledgement of the number of protesters killed or put in prison. \nSome accounts have claimed that more than 20,000 people were \narbitrarily arrested and held without trial. A number of these people \nremain in prison today.\n  Today would have been a landmark occasion for the Chinese government \nto announce that they were starting an independent and open \ninvestigation relating to the events of June 4, 1989. However, other \nthan checkpoints set up in Tiananmen Square and efforts by the Chinese \ngovernment to prevent international media outlets from filming in the \nsquare, there are no signs that today is anything other than an \nordinary day in China.\n  While the events of 20 years ago by the Chinese government launched a \ncoordinated effort to prevent further unrest, it also helped \ncrystallize a movement that continues today. Democracy advocates in \nChina have built upon the legacy of Tiananmen and have led various \nefforts to force accountability and political reforms. All who watch \nChina applaud the tireless work of Ding Zilin, the leader of Tiananmen \nMothers, Liu Xiaobo and the rest of Charter 08, as well as countless \nothers such as Jiang Qisheng who continue to face intimidation and \nimprisonment, yet persist with their cause.\n  They can rest assured that ultimately their efforts will be \nsuccessful. Today's world is increasingly interconnected. Communication \nand travel have gotten easier, and with the development of the \ninternet, despite censorship efforts, information is becoming more \nreadily available to the Chinese people. Every day it becomes more \ndifficult for the Chinese government to keep its people in the dark. \nThey will find out about Tiananmen, they will find out about how the \noutside world operates, they will demand changes at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6180-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6180-S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent defeat of Sri Lanka's Tamil \nTigers, otherwise known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or \nLTTE, is a very welcome development. Led by a reclusive, cult-like \nfigure who apparently saw no evil in forcibly recruiting and \nbrainwashing young children to become suicide bombers, the LTTE long \nago forfeited any legitimate claim to representing the interests of the \nTamil population. This resounding victory offers the possibility--after \n30 long years of conflict, including ruthless acts of terrorism by the \nLTTE and other atrocities against civilians by both sides--of lasting \npeace for all inhabitants of that small island nation.\n  I first became interested in Sri Lanka when a good friend, James \nSpain, was the U.S. Ambassador there. He often told me of the beauty of \nthe country and its people, and it has been painful to observe the \nsuffering that has befallen them. That suffering was further \nexacerbated by the tsunami which crashed ashore in December 2004, \ncausing immense destruction and loss of life. A member of my staff was \nin Sri Lanka at that time, but far enough inland to escape harm.\n  I have strongly supported humanitarian aid for Sri Lanka, and 2 years \nago, as chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I \nincluded additional funding for economic development in the north \neastern region of the island after the LTTE were forced to retreat from \nthat area. I look forward to being able to support additional \nreconstruction aid, so the northern communities that have been trapped \nin poverty and devastated by the conflict can recover. But for that to \noccur, several things need to happen.\n  The war claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Sri Lankan \nsoldiers, LTTE combatants, and civilians. The tremendous loss and grief \nsuffered by the families of both sides needs to be acknowledged in \norder for reconciliation to occur.\n  The government should immediately account for all persons detained in \nthe conflict. It should provide access by international humanitarian \norganizations and the media to affected areas\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nand to populations of internally displaced persons who remain confined \nin camps, which should be administered by civilian authorities. These \npeople should be allowed to leave the camps as soon as possible so they \ncan start to rebuild their lives.\n  As soon as possible, the government needs to begin implementing \npolicies for the devolution of power to provincial councils in the \nnorth and east as provided for in Sri Lanka's Constitution. This and \nother steps are needed to demonstrate that all Sri Lankans can live \nwithout fear and participate freely in the political process. It must \naddress the longstanding, legitimate grievances of the Tamil population \nso they can finally enjoy the equal rights and opportunities to which \nthey, like other Sri Lankan citizens, are entitled.\n  There is also the issue of accountability for violations of the laws \nof war. The LTTE had a long history of flagrant violations of human \nrights, including kidnappings, extrajudicial killings, disappearances, \nand deliberately targeting civilians. The Sri Lankan military engaged \nin similar crimes. Although the Sri Lankan Government prevented access \nfor journalists to the war zone in order to avoid scrutiny of the \nmilitary's conduct, video footage was smuggled out. And as the smoke \nhas lifted from the battlefield there are reports that thousands of \nTamil civilians who were trapped in the so-called safe zone perished in \nthe last months of the war. There is abundant evidence that they were \ndeliberately targeted with relentless shelling and aerial bombardments, \ndespite repeated appeals by the international community that they be \nspared. There are also growing fears of retaliatory attacks against \nthose who criticized such tactics.\n  The recent decision of the United Nations Human Rights Council \nrejecting calls, including by Navi Pillay, the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, for an international investigation of \nthese violations is unfortunate but not surprising. Several of the \nCouncil's members routinely arbitrarily imprison and torture political \nopponents in their own countries. The Sri Lankan Government, which \nseeks international aid to rebuild, insists that what occurred there is \nan ``internal'' matter and that for outsiders to call for an \nindependent investigation and justice for the victims is an \n``infringement of sovereignty.'' To the contrary, the denial of basic \nrights and freedoms is a legitimate concern of people everywhere, \nwhenever it occurs.\n  It is now incumbent on the Sri Lankan authorities to demonstrate that \nthe rule of law is respected, that sweeping security measures that have \nbeen used to silence journalists, doctors, lawyers and other citizens \nwho have criticized government policies are revised or repealed, that \nthe government takes seriously its duty to defend the rights of all Sri \nLankans irrespective of religious affiliation or ethnicity, and that \nthose responsible for crimes against humanity or other violations of \nhuman rights are held accountable.\n  Thankfully, a long, bloody chapter of Sri Lanka's history has ended. \nBut it is the next chapter that will determine whether justice and \nlasting peace can be achieved. If the Sri Lankan Government seizes this \nopportunity to unite the Sri Lankan people in support of an inclusive \neffort to address the causes of the conflict, the United States will be \na strong partner in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6181-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING AMERICA'S WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, this week, we pay tribute to those who \nfought for freedom's cause during World War II. Two monumental efforts \noccurred that resulted in turning the war efforts in favor of the \nAllied Forces. These events are D-day and the Battle of Midway. Each \nwas a demonstration of our nation's commitment to freedom, a blow \nagainst tyranny, and the tremendous sacrifice everyday Americans are \nwilling to make for peace and security.\n  This Saturday marks the 65th anniversary of D-day, the day the tide \nbegan to turn against totalitarianism in World War II. On that day, \nAllied troops stormed a Normandy beachhead to claim a foothold on the \nedge of Nazi-occupied Europe. More than 1,400 Americans sacrificed \ntheir lives during the invasion, including 130 Floridians.\n  As the largest land, air, and sea invasion in history, D-day brought \ntogether Allied forces and unprecedented military resources, including \nmore than 150,000 servicemen, 13,000 aircraft, and 5,000 ships. By the \nday's end, more than 9,000 Allied warriors had sacrificed life and limb \nso that others could begin the perilous journey into Europe to defeat \nthe forces commanded by Adolf Hitler.\n  D-day tested the courage and character of every American involved in \nthe invasion. Like those who came before them, the soldiers who fought \nthat day fought courageously for a freedom the men and women of our \nmilitary still fight to defend.\n  Coinciding with the anniversary D-day is the 67th anniversary of the \nBattle of Midway, another turning point in the war. The battle claimed \nthe lives of more than 300 Americans and helped to slow Japan's advance \nacross the Pacific. America's forces executed the mission with \ntremendous skill and helped deliver one of the war's most decisive and \ncrucial victories.\n  On these anniversaries, let us remember and recognize the courage of \nthose who sacrificed their lives to restore hope through the liberation \nof those in occupied territories. Let us honor and thank those veterans \nthat continue to share their unique stories from these extraordinary \nbattles. May God bless the men and women of the U.S. military, and \ncontinue to bless our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6181-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   COMMENDING MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before I became a member of this \nbody, I was privileged to serve as the president of University of \nTennessee and as Secretary of Education under President George H.W. \nBush. Therefore, I know how important it is for our nonprofits to make \ninvestments in our system of higher education. That is why I am pleased \nto report that Meharry Medical College in Nashville is poised to \nreceive the single largest endowment gift in the college's 130-year \nhistory.\n  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the largest philanthropic \norganization in America devoted exclusively to health care, has \nselected Meharry to receive a multimillion-dollar endowment and other \nfunding to establish the Robert Wood Johnson Center for Health Policy \nat Meharry Medical College to produce our country's next generation of \nhealth care policy experts. Meharry will be partnering with Vanderbilt \nUniversity College of Arts and Science on this project.\n  This gift is especially timely as the Nation grapples with economic \nchallenges and millions of uninsured citizens amid growing bipartisan \nsupport for reforming the U.S. health care system. The new center aims \nto serve as a think tank for the pressing health care issues of the \nday; to increase the diversity of health policy scholars with doctors \nwho are formally trained in sociology and economics; and to provide \nstudents and faculty with new curricula, research and academic \nofferings in health policy. The center seeks to reshape the future of \nAmerica's health policies by creating a more inclusive pool of experts \ntrained in health policy and allied disciplines.\n  Meharry Medical College is the Nation's largest private, independent, \nhistorically Black academic health center. It produces over 20 percent \nof the Nation's African-American physicians and 33 percent of the \nNation's African-American dentists. These health professionals take \ncare of those most in need: the underserved in our rural and urban \ncommunities across the country.\n  I know Meharry is pleased to be selected to receive this gift and \nproduce scholars who will make a real impact on our health policy at \nthis critical time. Though their graduates may serve the country, we \nTennesseans are especially proud of Meharry and its many contributions \nto our State and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6181-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6181-S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING KATHLEEN L. ``KATIE'' WOLF\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor my fellow \nHoosier, Kathleen L. ``Katie'' Wolf. Today we recognize the many \naccomplishments of Katie, a distinguished public servant and a model \ncitizen who over the years\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nhas contributed much to her community in Monticello and to the Hoosier \nState.\n  A native of Princeton Township, IN, Katie Wolf has long been a pillar \nof her community. In 1967, she served as the secretary on the founding \nboard of the White County United Fund, now known as the United Way of \nWhite County.\n  In 1968, Katie ran and was elected to the position of clerk of the \nWhite County Circuit Court, a role she filled for over a decade before \nbeing nominated to the Judiciary Committee for the Democratic National \nCommittee. In 1984, Katie became the first woman to run for and win a \nposition in her district in the Indiana House of Representatives, and \nduring her first term she was elected Outstanding Freshman Legislator. \nIn 1986, Katie was appointed senator for District Seven in the Indiana \nState Senate.\n  Throughout her career, Katie has been the recipient of numerous \nawards and designations, a testament to her stature as a model Hoosier \nand as a leader in public life in Indiana. She has received the \nDirector's Award from the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the Director's Award from the Purdue University Cooperative \nExtension, and Legislator of the Year from the Indiana Trial Lawyers \nAssociation. Former Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon presented Katie \nwith the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, which is the highest honor that \nthe Governor of Indiana can bestow. It is an award reserved for those \nwho have made outstanding contributions to the Hoosier State. Last \nmonth, she received an honorary doctor of laws from Saint Joseph's \nCollege in Rensselaer.\n  Next week, Katie will receive an award from the local chapter of \nWomen Giving Together, an organization committed to strengthening the \ncommunities of White County.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \ncommunity of Stockholm on reaching its 125th year. The people who make \nup this community are proud of their heritage and will be celebrating \nboth their resilient history and their promising future June 13 to 14, \n2009.\n  This strong rural community in northeast South Dakota was primarily \nfounded by Scandinavian homesteaders who named the town after \nStockholm, Sweden. Also in this area was Brown Earth, an Indian \nsettlement of 52 families. These communities were closely intertwined \nand shared churches and a post office. In 1896, the town joined \ntogether to construct a creamery, financed at $25 a share.\n  In celebration of reaching this historic milestone, the town has \npainted 24 Dala Hasten, traditional Swedish wooden horses. There will \nalso be a parade, races, and musical events to commemorate Stockholm's \nnotable occasion.\n  The welcoming spirit of Stockholm's citizens helped sculpt this \ntown's unique history, and I am confident that this strength of \ncharacter will help them continue through the coming years. I am proud \nto represent this community, and I commend this town on reaching this \nhistoric anniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6182-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF MOUND CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of Mound City, SD. This rural \ncommunity is the seat of Campbell County in northern South Dakota. This \ntown was built on hard work and a spirit of community 125 years ago, \nand those same values sustain it today.\n  Edward C. and his father E.H. McIntosh were the first settlers, \narriving in the area on June 10, 1884. They called the town Mound City \nbecause of the small hills to the north. Soon after, an elegant hotel \nand post office were constructed. The first newspaper, the Mound City \nJournal, was started in 1886. Mound City also had a flour mill, built \nin 1893 by contributions by the town's citizens. After it burned down \nthe first night of operations, the town rallied and raised enough money \nto again build the mill.\n  This perseverance and dedication illustrates what has gotten Mound \nCity to this monumental anniversary, and I am proud to recognize them \non their achievements. The citizens of this town are dedicated and hard \nworking, demonstrating what a great State South Dakota is. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6182-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING ELMET TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the lengthy \nprocess of globalization has made it necessary for many American \nbusinesses to promote their goods in international markets. And despite \nthe present economic recession, Maine businesses exported a record $3 \nbillion in goods last year. I wish to highlight Elmet Technologies, a \nshining company that has been a part of that historic figure and has \nexcelled in growing its customer base by marketing to overseas firms.\n  Elmet Technologies was founded in Lewiston in 1929, at the beginning \nof the Great Depression. At that time, the company had 50 employees and \n13,400 square feet of manufacturing space. The firm now employs over \n230 people and occupies a 220,000-square-foot facility. Elmet makes \ntop-quality, high-performance advanced materials and specialized \nrefractory metal products, such as wire, filaments, and rods. Its \nproducts have numerous applications for a variety of industries. For \ninstance, the company's components and materials are used in electronic \ndevices such as GPS units and digital music players and medical \nequipment like x-ray tubes.\n  Elmet supplies a wide range of customers, from IBM and Philips \nLighting, to Veeco, which produces process equipment and metrology \ntools, and Varian, producers of medical equipment. These firms have \nturned to Elmet because of its high-quality products, attention to \ncustomer detail and specification, and its employees' stellar Maine \nwork ethic. Additionally, what makes Elmet's production method so \neffective is that the company uses raw materials instead of base \nmaterials, allowing employees to easily customize products based on \nconsumer specifications. The company has also earned two critical \ncertifications for quality and environmental standards from the \nInternational Organization for Standardization, ISO.\n  Though an 80-year-old company, Elmet Technologies is relatively new \nto global trade. It began only recently promoting its products abroad \nand now has clients in places as far away as Europe, Israel, and China. \nElmet's strategy is paying off and earning the company much-deserved \nrecognition. Last Thursday, the Maine International Trade Center \npresented Elmet Technologies with its 2009 Exporter of the Year Award. \nThe award demonstrates the determination and commitment of Elmet's \nleaders in forging new international marketplaces for its extensive \nvariety of products that serve a wide range of high-tech and emerging \nindustries--from electronics and lighting, to aircraft and automotive.\n  The Maine International Trade Center is Maine's small business link \nto the rest of the world. It is a public-private partnership between \nthe State of Maine and its businesses. The center's goal is to increase \ninternational trade in Maine and in particular to assist Maine's \nbusinesses in exporting goods and services. Clearly it sees in Elmet \nTechnologies the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that make \nMaine's small businesses so unique and successful.\n  Elmet Technologies' president and CEO, Jack Jensen, has summed up his \ncompany's philosophy quite simply: ``Listen. Create. Delight.'' Based \non the company's record of success and customer satisfaction, this \nmotto has served the company well in any language. I congratulate \neveryone at Elmet Technologies on their recent recognition and wish \nthem new and exciting export opportunities in the years to \ncome. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6182-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6182-S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              130TH ANNIVERSARY OF WORTHING, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Unfortunately, the Senate was not able to pass \nthe bill before the adjournment of the 110th Congress.\n  The Senior Executive Service, SES, is the most senior level of career \ncivil servants in the Federal Government. Senior executives are \nessential to an efficient and effective Federal Government in \nmanagement and operations. Over the next ten years, ninety percent of \nthe career SES will be eligible to retire. As agencies begin to \nconsider employees for SES positions, it is important that they develop \npipelines into highly qualified candidate pools that represent diverse \nbackgrounds, and ensure that applicants of all races, ethnicities, \ngenders, and abilities be equally considered. According to reports by \nthe Government Accountability Office, a diverse SES can bring a greater \nvariety of perspectives and approaches to policy development, strategic \nplanning, problem solving, and decision making.\n  A 2007 Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program report by the \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, showed that the percentage of \nminorities and women at senior pay levels in the Federal Government, \nincluding SES, is lower than in the total civilian labor force and the \nFederal workforce as a whole. According to a 2007 GAO report, only 15.8 \npercent of the SES was minorities compared to 32.8 percent of the \nentire workforce. The Senior Executive Service Diversity Assurance Act \ndirectly addresses this gap.\n  This legislation would require Federal agencies to submit a plan to \nOPM on how the agency is removing barriers to minorities, women, and \nindividuals with disabilities to obtain appointments in the SES.\n  The bill encourages agencies, to the extent practicable, to include \nminorities, women, and individuals with disabilities on their Executive \nResource Boards as well as other qualification review boards that \nevaluate SES candidates.\n  Furthermore, the legislation re-establishes the Senior Executive \nService Resource Office, SESRO, at OPM, which was dissolved during an \ninternal reorganization of OPM in 2003. This bill would restore SESRO's \nresponsibilities of overseeing and managing the corps of senior \nexecutives. SESRO would serve as a central resource for agencies and \nprovide oversight of agency recruitment and candidate development. \nAdditionally, it would be responsible for ensuring diversity within the \nSES through strategic partnerships, mentorship programs, and more \nstringent reporting requirements. For too long, ethnic minorities, \nwomen, and persons with disabilities have been under-represented and \nthis bill attempts to reform shortcomings in the system.\n  In America's workforce, we need leadership that reflects its varied \ncultures and backgrounds. A more diverse SES will better ensure that \nthe executive management of the Federal Government is responsive to the \nneeds, policies, and goals of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a demonstration project to examine \nwhether community-level public health interventions can result in lower \nrates of chronic disease for individuals entering the Medicare program; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Healthy Living, \nHealthy Aging Demonstration Project Act of 2009. This act will provide \nfor a demonstration project to examine whether community-level public \nhealth interventions can result in lower rates of chronic disease for \nindividuals who are about to enter the Medicare program. Prevention is \na key to health at any age, but especially later in life. I am proud to \nbe introducing a cornerstone of health care reform today.\n  American people and the U.S. Government need this prevention act for \ntwo main reasons. Health care costs continue to rise exponentially and \nchronic diseases are the number one cause of death and disability in \nthe U.S. One hundred thirty-three million Americans, representing 45 \npercent of the total population, have at least one chronic disease. \nChronic diseases kill more than 1.7 million Americans each year, and \nare responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths in the U.S. Furthermore, \nthe vast majority of cases of chronic disease could be better prevented \nor managed.\n  The World Health Organization has estimated that if the major risk \nfactors for chronic disease were eliminated, at least 80 percent of all \nheart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes would be prevented, and that \nmore than 40 percent of cancer cases would be prevented. In addition, \ndepressive disorders are common, chronic, and costly. The World Health \nOrganization identified major depression as the fourth leading cause of \nworldwide disease in 1990, causing more disability than even certain \ntypes of heart disease. Research shows that mental health screenings \nafter disease diagnosis for diabetic patients can be cost effective and \nimprove health.\n  The Healthy Living, Healthy Aging Demonstration Project Act of 2009 \nwill address these costly and chronic health problems before people \nenter the Medicare program. It calls for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to provide 5-year grants to community partnerships that \ninclude the state or local public health department and other community \nstakeholders such as health centers, providers, small businesses, and \nrural health clinics to fund evidence-based community-level prevention \nand wellness strategies. The types of community-based prevention \nstrategies we are looking at in this program include walking programs, \ngroup exercise classes, anti-smoking programs, programs to highlight \nhealthy dining options at restaurants, and expanding access to farmer's \nmarkets, nutritious foods, and other programs and services recommended \nby the Task Force on Community Preventive Services.\n  The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS and in partnership with the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC would \nimplement the demonstration program to test whether these public health \ninterventions targeting 55-64 year olds result in lower rates of \nchronic disease and reduce costs for the Medicare program. One \nassessment level of the act will measure the effects of adopting \nhealthy lifestyle strategies on specific individuals who enroll in \nprevention programs in their communities.\n  More specifically, program requirements in this act include an \nindividual\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nhealth screening conducted by the state or local public health \ndepartment or its designee. An individual health screening will include \nthe appropriate test for diabetes, high blood pressure, high \ncholesterol, obesity, and tobacco use. Insured individuals who screen \npositive for chronic disease will be referred for treatment and for \nmental health screening and treatment to their existing providers or \nin-network providers. Individuals identified with chronic disease risk \nfactors, such as high blood pressure or obesity, would be engaged in \nthe community health interventions funded through the demonstration, \nsuch as walking programs, group exercise classes, or anti-smoking \nprograms. Uninsured individuals who screen positive for chronic disease \nwould be referred to the pre-selected clinical referral source for the \ndemonstration site. Uninsured individuals who do not screen positive \nfor chronic disease will receive information on healthy lifestyle \nchoices and may also enroll in community level prevention \ninterventions.\n  This program will not only conduct community-based prevention \nstrategies, screenings and health assessments, but also help support \nfollow-up care for uninsured individuals identified with chronic \ndiseases, including determining eligibility for public programs.\n  I would like to thank Dr. Mary Polce-Lynch from Randolph-Macon \nCollege, who has been working in my office through the American \nPsychological Association and the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, and Daniella Gratale from Trust for America's \nHealth, for their work on this important prevention bill.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to \nhelp Americans adopt the healthiest lifestyles possible and to prevent \nchronic diseases in later life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Living and Health \n     Aging Demonstration Project Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and \n     disability in the United States. 7 in every 10 deaths are \n     attributable to chronic disease, with more than 1,700,000 \n     Americans dying each year. Approximately 133,000,000 \n     Americans, representing 45 percent of the Nation's \n     population, have at least 1 chronic disease.\n       (2) In 2007, the United States spent over \n     $2,200,000,000,000 on health care, with 75 cents out of every \n     dollar spent going towards treatment of individuals with 1 or \n     more chronic disease. In public programs, treatment for \n     chronic diseases constitutes an even higher percentage of \n     total spending, with 83 cents of every dollar spent by \n     Medicaid programs and more than 95 cents of every dollar \n     spent by the Medicare program going towards costs related to \n     chronic disease.\n       (3) Since 1987, the rate of obesity in the United States \n     has doubled, accounting for a 20 to 30 percent increase in \n     health care spending. Additionally, the percentage of young \n     Americans who are overweight has tripled since 1980. If the \n     prevalence of obesity was at the same level as it was in \n     1987, health care spending would be nearly 10 percent lower \n     per person, for a total savings of nearly $200,000,000,000.\n       (4) The vast majority of cases of chronic disease could be \n     better prevented or managed. The World Health Organization \n     has estimated that if the major risk factors for chronic \n     diseases were eliminated, at least 80 percent of all cases of \n     heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes could be \n     prevented, while also averting more than 40 percent of cancer \n     cases.\n       (5) Depressive disorders are also becoming increasingly \n     common, chronic, and costly. In 1990, the World Health \n     Organization identified major depression as the fourth \n     leading cause of disease worldwide, leading to more cases of \n     disability than ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular \n     disease. Research has shown that mental health screenings \n     following disease diagnosis for diabetic patients can improve \n     health while remaining cost-effective.\n       (6) A report by the Trust for America's Health found that \n     an annual investment of $10 per person in proven community-\n     based programs to increase physical activity, improve \n     nutrition, and prevent tobacco use and smoking could, within \n     5 years, save the United States more than $16,000,000,000 \n     annually, with savings of more than $5,000,000,000 for \n     Medicare and $1,900,000,000 for Medicaid, as well as over \n     $9,000,000,000 in savings for private health insurance \n     payers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Reforestation Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to \n     support and seek protection of tropical forests around the \n     world;\n       (2) tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits by--\n       (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and \n     terrestrial resources of Earth and providing habitats for an \n     estimated 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 plant and animal species, \n     including species essential to medical research and \n     agricultural productivity;\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\n       (B) playing a critical role as carbon sinks that reduce \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as 1 hectare of tropical \n     forest can absorb up to approximately 3 tons of carbon \n     dioxide per year, thus moderating potential global climate \n     change; and\n       (C) regulating hydrological cycles upon which agricultural \n     and coastal resources depend;\n       (3) tropical forests are also a key factor in reducing \n     rates of soil loss, particularly on hilly terrain;\n       (4) while international efforts to stem the tide of \n     tropical deforestation have accelerated during the past 2 \n     decades, the rapid rate of tropical deforestation continues \n     unabated;\n       (5) in 1923, over 60 percent of the land of Haiti was \n     forested but, by 2006, that percentage had decreased to less \n     than 2 percent;\n       (6) during the period beginning in 2000 and ending in 2005, \n     the deforestation rate in Haiti accelerated by more than 20 \n     percent over the deforestation rate in Haiti during the \n     period beginning in 1990 and ending in 1999;\n       (7) as a result, during the period described in paragraph \n     (6), Haiti lost--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent (approximately 11,000 hectares) of \n     the forest cover of Haiti; and\n       (B) approximately 22 percent of the total forest and \n     woodland habitat of Haiti;\n       (8) poverty and economic pressures are--\n       (A) two factors that underlie the tropical deforestation of \n     Haiti; and\n       (B) manifested particularly through the clearing of vast \n     areas of forest for conversion to agricultural uses;\n       (9) the unemployment rate of Haiti is approximately 80 \n     percent;\n       (10) the per capita income of Haiti is $450 per year, which \n     is barely one-tenth of the per capita income of Latin America \n     and the Caribbean;\n       (11) two-thirds of the population of Haiti depend on the \n     agricultural sector, which consists mainly of small-scale \n     subsistence farming;\n       (12) 60 percent of the population of Haiti relies on \n     charcoal produced from cutting down trees for cooking fuel;\n       (13) soil erosion represents the most direct effect of the \n     deforestation of Haiti, as the erosion has--\n       (A) lowered the productivity of the land due to the poor \n     soils underlying the tropical forests;\n       (B) worsened the severity of droughts;\n       (C) led to further deforestation;\n       (D) significantly decreased the quality and, as a result, \n     quantity of freshwater and clean drinking water available to \n     the population of Haiti; and\n       (E) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees \n     in Haiti;\n       (14) tropical forests provide forest cover to soften the \n     effect of heavy rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the \n     soil with their roots;\n       (15) when trees are cleared, rainfall runs off the soil \n     more quickly and contributes to floods and further erosion;\n       (16) in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne struck Haiti, killing \n     approximately 3,000, and affecting over 200,000, people, \n     partly because deforestation had resulted in the clearing of \n     large hillsides, which enabled rainwater to run off directly \n     to settlements located at the bottom of the slopes;\n       (17) research conducted by the United Nations Environmental \n     Programme has revealed a direct (89 percent) correlation \n     between the extent of the deforestation of a country and the \n     incidence of victims per weather event in the country;\n       (18) finding economic benefits for local communities from \n     sustainable uses of tropical forests is critical for the \n     long-term protection of the tropical forests in Haiti; and\n       (19) tropical reforestation efforts would provide new \n     sources of jobs, income, and investments in Haiti by--\n       (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling \n     programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable \n     agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber \n     harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services; \n     and\n       (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income \n     through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of \n     which exist on small scales in Haiti and in the rest of the \n     region.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     assistance to the Government of Haiti to develop and \n     implement, or improve, nationally appropriate policies and \n     actions--\n       (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in \n     Haiti; and\n       (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and \n     reforestation in a measurable, reportable, and verifiable \n     manner--\n       (A) to eliminate within 5 years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act any further net deforestation of Haiti; and\n       (B) to restore within 30 years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act the forest cover of Haiti to the surface area \n     that the forest cover had occupied in 1990.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to ensure that Low-income beneficiaries have improved access to \nhealth care under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nFinancial Stability for Beneficiaries Act of 2009.\n  This legislation would ensure that low-income Medicare beneficiaries \ncan access the benefits to which they are entitled through one of the \nMedicare Savings Programs, MSP, and/or the Part D Low-Income Subsidy, \nLIS.\n  More than 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have incomes below 150 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Level,\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nFPL, and are eligible for assistance with their Medicare costs. Another \n6 million have incomes under 200 percent FPL. These nearly 20 million \nbeneficiaries are poorer than other Medicare beneficiaries. They also \ntend to be sicker, more isolated and have limited educations. These \npopulations are more in need of medical and other health-related \nservices, and they benefit in both access and health outcomes from \nfinancial assistance with their out-of-pocket costs.\n  Although seniors and younger people with disabilities would benefit \ntremendously from greater access to needed health care services and \nfinancial savings, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nabout 67 percent to 87 percent of individuals eligible for various MSP \nservices do not receive benefits. Additionally, the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services state that more than 13 million \nindividuals are eligible for Part D LIS but only about 9 million are \nenrolled. Most of those 9 million get the subsidy automatically without \nhaving to apply, due to their eligibility for other programs.\n  The lives of low-income beneficiaries would improve significantly \nwith improved access to the financial assistance provided by these \nimportant programs. Barriers to enrollment in MSP and LIS include: lack \nof effective outreach, lack of knowledge of the programs, language \nissues, social and physical isolation, restrictive assets limits, \nincome and asset documentation complexities, and other daunting \napplication requirements. Another major barrier is the lack of \nalignment of eligibility rules and application processes between MSP \nand LIS, although both programs serve the same general population.\n  The Medicare Financial Stability for Beneficiaries Act of 2009 \ndecreases these barriers through:\n  1. Stabilizing programs by eliminating the recurring short-term re \nauthorizations of one of the MSPs--the Qualified Individual, QI, \nprogram and the roller-coaster eligibility/loss of eligibility some \nbeneficiaries face due to the effects of the subsidies on eligibility \nfor other benefits.\n  2. Increasing access to financial assistance for low-income \nbeneficiaries. Research supports the conclusion that financial \nassistance results in greater access and better health outcomes for \nlow-income beneficiaries. Currently full assistance is available only \nfor those beneficiaries with incomes up to 135 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Level, 135 percent FPL is $1218/month for an individual, and \nvery limited assets, about $8,000 for an individual); much more limited \nassistance is available for those with incomes up to 150 percent of \nFPL. People with low incomes but some savings may be disqualified \naltogether. Our bill increases income eligibility to 150 percent of FPL \nfor full benefits and 200 percent FPL for partial benefits and uses a \nsingle asset standard for all programs of $27,500 for an individual. \nIncreasing the asset test for both MSP and LIS and increasing income \neligibility levels will improve health outcomes for millions more \nseniors and younger people with disabilities.\n  3. Aligning the rules for MSP and LIS programs and authorizing cross-\ndeeming so that qualifying for one program would automatically qualify \nan individual for the other programs. Currently, income and asset \neligibility rules for MSP and LIS are similar, but not identical. \nIndividuals eligible for MSP benefits are deemed eligible for LIS, \nwithout having to apply or take any other action. The reverse, however, \nis not true. Greater alignment of the rules of both programs makes \ncross-deeming sensible, and ensures that individuals will receive both \nbenefits regardless of where they first seek assistance. The \nlegislation will also assist LIS beneficiaries in receiving \nSupplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, SNAP, food stamp, and vice \nversa.\n  4. Simplifying outreach and enrollment for low-income Medicare \nprograms by authorizing the Social Security Administration to have \naccess to Internal Revenue Service records to identify potentially \neligible beneficiaries; by making more materials, including \napplications, available in additional languages; and by other \nsimplifications of the application process. These provisions will \nbenefit the millions of Americans who desperately need assistance, and \nwill cut down on unnecessary and duplicative work for the Social \nSecurity Administration and for State Medicaid agencies.\n  There is strong support for this important legislation from many \norganizations including the American Association of Retired Persons, \nNational Senior Citizens Law Center, Medicare Rights Center, Center for \nMedicare Advocacy, Inc, Families USA, National Council on Aging, \nNational Patient Advocate Foundation, American Federation of Labor and \nCongress of Industrial Organizations, AFL-CIO, and the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nCollins, Lieberman and Harkin to introduce the Medicare Independent \nLiving Act of 2009. This legislation would eliminate Medicare's ``in \nthe home'' restriction for the coverage of mobility devices, including \nwheelchairs and scooters, for those with disabilities and expected \nlong-term needs. This includes people with multiple sclerosis, \nparaplegia, osteoarthritis, and cerebrovascular disease including acute \nstroke and conditions like aneurysms.\n  As currently interpreted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, the ``in the home'' restriction only permits \nbeneficiaries to obtain wheelchairs that are necessary for use inside \nthe home. As a result, seriously disabled beneficiaries who would \nprimarily utilize a wheelchair outside the home are prevented from \nreceiving this critical and basic equipment through Medicare. For \nexample, this restriction prevents beneficiaries from receiving \nwheelchairs to access their work, the community-at-large, place of \nworship, school, physician's offices, or pharmacies.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center in a report entitled ``Forced \nIsolation: Medicare's `In The home' Coverage Standards for \nWheelchairs'' in March 2004 notes, ``This effectively disqualifies you \nfrom leaving your home without the assistance of others.''\n  Furthermore, in a Kansas City Star article dated July 3, 2005, Mike \nOxford with the National Council on Independent Living noted, ``You \nlook at mobility assistance as a way to liberate yourself.'' He added \nthat the restriction ``is just backward.''\n  In fact, policies such as these are not only backward but directly \ncontradict numerous initiatives aimed at increasing community \nintegration of people with disabilities, including the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Ticket-to-Work Program, the New Freedom \nInitiative, and the Olmstead Supreme Court decision.\n  According to the Medicare Rights Center update dated March 23, 2006, \n``This results in arbitrary denials. People with apartments too small \nfor a power wheelchair are denied a device that could also get them \ndown the street. Those in more spacious quarters get coverage, allowing \nthem to scoot from room to room and to the grocery store. People who \nsummon all their willpower and strength to hobble around a small \napartment get no help for tasks that are beyond them and their front \ndoor.''\n  In New Mexico, I have heard this complaint about the law repeatedly \nfrom our State's most vulnerable disabled and senior citizens. People \nargue the provision is being misinterpreted by the administration and \nresults in Medicare beneficiaries being trapped in their home.\n  The Independence Through Enhancement of Medicare and Medicaid, ITEM, \nCoalition adds in a letter to CMS on this issue in November 25, 2005, \n``There continues to be no clinical basis for the `in the home' \nrestriction and by asking treating practitioners to document medical \nneed only within the home setting, CMS is severely restricting patients \nfrom receiving the most appropriate devices to meet their mobility \nneeds.''\n  My legislation would clarify that this restriction does not apply to \nmobility devices, including wheelchairs, for people with disabilities \nin the Medicare Program. The language change is fairly simple and \nsimply clarifies that the ``in the home'' restriction for durable \nmedical equipment does not apply in the case of mobility devices needed \nby Medicare beneficiaries with expected long-term needs for use ``in \ncustomary settings such as normal domestic, vocational, and community \nactivities.''\n  This legislation is certainly not intended to discourage CMS from \ndedicating its resources to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare system, as those efforts are critical to ensuring that \nMedicare remains financially viable and strong in the future. However, \nit should be noted that neither Medicaid nor the Department of Veterans \nAffairs impose such ``in the home'' restrictions on mobility devices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Independent Living \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF IN THE HOME RESTRICTION FOR MEDICARE \n                   COVERAGE OF MOBILITY DEVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS \n                   WITH EXPECTED LONG-TERM NEEDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395x(n) is amended by inserting ``or, in the case \n     of a mobility device required by an individual with expected \n     long-term need, used in customary settings for the purpose of \n     normal domestic, vocational, or community activities'' after \n     ``1819(a)(1))''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to items furnished on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1188. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto mental health services; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senators \nMurkowski and Whitehouse, the Community Mental Health Services \nImprovement Act. For decades, we have known that people suffering from \nmental illness die sooner--on average 25 years sooner--and have higher \nrates of disability than the general population. People with mental \nillness are at greater risk of preventable health conditions such as \nheart disease and diabetes. With this legislation, we are taking steps \nto address these disturbing trends.\n  We know that mental health and physical health are inter-related. Yet \nhistorically mental health and physical health have been treated \nseparately. This legislation would integrate care in one setting.\n  In a recent survey, 91 percent of community mental health centers \nsaid that improving the quality of health care is a priority. However, \nonly one-third have the capacity to provide health care on site, and \nonly one-fifth provide medical referrals off site. The centers \nidentified a lack of financial resources as the biggest barrier to \nintegrating treatment.\n  Accordingly, this legislation provides grants to integrate treatment \nfor mental health, substance abuse, and primary and specialty care. \nGrantees can use the funds for screenings, basic health care services \non site, referrals, or information technology.\n  This legislation also comprehensively responds to the well identified \nmental health workforce crisis by providing grants for a wide range of \ninnovative recruitment and retention efforts, including loan \nforgiveness and repayment programs, to placement and support for new \nmental health professionals, and expanded mental health education and \ntraining programs.\n  Finally, this legislation provides grants for tele-mental health in \nmedically-underserved areas, and invests in health IT for mental health \nproviders. These proposals address the twin goals of improving the \nquality of mental\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\nhealth treatment while expanding access to that treatment in rural and \nunderserved areas.\n  This bipartisan legislation has the overwhelming support of the \nmental health community. It has been endorsed by the National Council \nfor Community Behavioral Healthcare, the National Alliance on Mental \nIllness, Mental Health America, the Campaign for Mental Health Reform, \nand the American Psychological Association. I am especially grateful \nfor the support of the Rhode Island Council of Community Mental Health \nOrganizations, whose members treat close to 15,000 Rhode Islanders of \nall ages.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, I look forward to our upcoming work on reforming our nation's \nhealth care system--and including important improvements to prevent and \ntreat mental and physical illnesses and conditions. It is my hope that \nthis year we can truly begin to address the challenge of \ncomprehensively improving and expanding access to mental health \nservices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Mental Health \n     Services Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) almost 60,000,000 Americans, or one in four adults and \n     one in five children, have a mental illness that can be \n     diagnosed and treated in a given year;\n       (2) mental illness costs our economy more than \n     $80,000,000,000 annually, accounting for 15 percent of the \n     total economic burden of disease;\n       (3) alcohol and drug abuse contributes to the death of more \n     than 100,000 people and costs society upwards of half a \n     trillion dollars a year;\n       (4) individuals with serious mental illness die on average \n     25 years sooner than individuals in the general population; \n     and\n       (5) community mental and behavioral health organizations \n     provide cost-efficient and evidence-based treatment and care \n     for millions of Americans with mental illness and addiction \n     disorders.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to restrict any State or local jurisdiction from \nimposing a new discriminatory tax on mobile wireless communications \nservices, providers, or property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nWyden in reintroducing legislation that will stop the increasing \nfinancial burden being placed on wireless consumers by discriminatory \ntaxes. On average, the typical consumer pays 15.2 percent of his/her \ntotal wireless bill in Federal, State, and local taxes, fees and \nsurcharges--this is compared to the 7.07 percent average tax rate for \nother goods and services.\n  The Mobile Wireless Tax Fairness Act of 2009 would ensure that these \ntax rates don't increase further by prohibiting States and local \ngovernments from imposing any new discriminatory tax on mobile \nservices, mobile service providers, or mobile service property for a \nperiod of 5 years. The bill defines ``new discriminatory tax'' as a tax \nimposed on mobile services, providers, or property that is not \ngenerally imposed on other types of services or property, or that is \ngenerally imposed at a lower rate.\n  The wireless era has changed the way the world communicates. To date, \nthere are more than 270 million wireless subscribers in the United \nStates, and consumers used more than 2.2 trillion minutes of airtime \nfrom July 2007 to June 2008--that is more than 6 billion minutes per \nday! And with this growth, more people are using the cell phone as a \nprimary communication device as well as for data and Internet \nservices--approximately 20 percent of households have ``cut the cord'' \nand use cell phones exclusively. The increased mobility and access \nwireless communications provide have improved our lives, our safety, \nand the efficiency of our work and businesses. It is estimated that the \nproductivity value of all mobile wireless services was worth $185 \nbillion in 2005 alone.\n  However, as more consumers and businesses embrace wireless \ntechnologies and applications, more States and local governments are \nembracing it as a revenue source and applying these excessive and \ndiscriminatory taxes, which show up on consumers' bills each month. In \nfact, the effective rate of taxation on wireless services has increased \nfour times faster than the rate on other taxable goods and services \nbetween January 2003 and January 2007.\n  These excessive and discriminatory taxes discourage wireless adoption \nand use, primarily with low-income individuals and families that still \nview a cellular phone as a luxury when many Americans consider it a \nnecessity. By banning these taxes, we can equalize the taxation of the \nwireless industry with that of other goods and services and protect the \nwireless consumer from the weight of exorbitant fees, surcharges, and \ngeneral business taxes. We cannot allow this essential and innovative \nindustry as well as the consumers who benefit from its amazing services \nand applications to suffer excessive tax rates.\n  Placing a moratorium on new discriminatory wireless taxes will ensure \nthat consumers continue to reap the benefits of wireless services. \nCongress took similar action with the Internet--passing the Internet \nTax Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 last session--because of the \nincredible impact the Internet will continue to have on consumers and \nbusinesses alike. The future of wireless is just as bright and that is \nwhy we must ensure its continued growth.\n  It is confounding that telecommunications, one of the most essential \ncomponents of our economy and our daily lives, is one of the most \nhighly taxed sectors. That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues \njoin Senator Wyden and me in supporting this critical bipartisan \nlegislation so we can continue our efforts to curtail discriminatory \ntaxes on these vital services so that all Americans can leverage the \nbenefits they offer. I would like to thank Senator McCain for his past \nleadership on this issue and for cosponsoring this consumer-friendly \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1193. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance \naviation safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Klobuchar, to introduce legislation that I believe continues to \nbe crucial in the effort to improve aviation safety. Before I begin, I \nwant to recognize the deliberate and unflagging efforts of Senator \nKlobuchar, whose commitment to improve the safety of commercial \naviation in this country is so admirable.\n  We all remember last spring's news: a U.S. carrier continued flying \naircraft even though critical safety checks involving cracks in their \nfuselages had not been performed on approximately 50 jets. In fact, an \nindependent review concluded that these flights potentially endangered \nover six million passengers. What was the punitive or disciplinary \naction taken against the inspector who condoned--in fact, encouraged--\nthose aircraft to continue flying? Nothing. The PMI, or supervising \ninspector, continued in his role. Also, as many of you will recall, \nlast April, American Airlines cancelled nearly 2,000 flights in order \nto catch up on inspections of aircraft wiring--inspections that should \nhave been performed previously under its agreement with the FAA.\n  This startling news was compounded by a Department of Transportation \nInspector General's report in June disclosing so-called safety \ninspectors are turning a blind eye to violations. Now, according to a \nNew York Times article dated June 4, an inspector reported to his \nsuperiors that Colgan Air had been having trouble with their most \nrecent purchase, the Bombardier Q400. The same aircraft that crashed \noutside of Buffalo, New York this past March. What did his superiors do \nwith this information? They transferred the inspector to a different \njob, and reportedly buried the report.\n  The FAA's overarching role is to serve as a protector of the public \ntrust; not as a public relations and management tool for the commercial \nairlines. What I find most offensive throughout these reports is the \nwillingness by the FAA to ignore safety concerns or inspection \nviolations, to presume that due to the tremendous level of success \nregarding safety protections for so long, they no longer are required \nto follow the procedures that created that high level of safety, \ninstead, as the Inspector General's report indicated, they want to \n``avoid a negative effect on the FAA'' by enforcing those measures.\n  That is why Senator Klobuchar and I are committed to closing the \nrevolving door between the airlines and the FAA. We need to codify our \nsafety expectations into law and hold anyone who tries to undermine the \nintegrity of the safety process accountable. By establishing a cooling-\noff period so that FAA inspectors cannot immediately go to work for an \nairline they used to inspect, and demanding that the FAA establish a \nnational review team of experienced inspectors to conduct periodic, \nunannounced audits of FAA air carrier inspection facilities will \nguarantee that aircraft inspections are carried out in a rigorous and \ntimely fashion. The American people, not the airlines, are the primary \nresponsibility of the FAA. It is my hope that these provisions will \nassist in returning the FAA to their core mission: safety.\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 1194. A bill to reauthorize the Coast Guard for fiscal years 2010 \nand 2011, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, for countless communities around the \ncountry, our oceans are the heartbeat of their histories and economies. \nIn fact, according to a report by the Joint Oceans Commission, healthy \noceans and coasts are an important means of transportation, trade, and \nnational security. Ocean-dependent industries generate about $138 \nbillion and support millions of jobs in the United States' economy.\n  According to the National Ocean Economic Project, 30 U.S. coastal \nStates accounted for 82 percent of total population and 81 percent of \nall U.S. jobs in 2006. In my home State of Washington, the Port of \nSeattle's facilities and activities alone support 190,000 jobs, and the \nState has 3,000 fishing vessels that employ 10,000 fishermen.\n  There is no group that is more important to the health and safety of \nour ports, fishing industry, and maritime community than the U.S. Coast \nGuard. The brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard are charged with \nmany missions--from serving as our environmental stewards, performing \nsearch and rescue missions, and protecting us from terrorism, to \nhelping clean up oil spills and enforcing fisheries laws. They are \nlargely responsible for keeping these coastal economic engines running, \nand have proved time and time again that they are, as their motto says, \n``Always ready.''\n  But for the Coast Guard to do its job Congress needs to support those \nwho serve in its ranks. We have a responsibility to ensure the Coast \nGuard has the tools it needs to carry out the missions of today, while \nlooking ahead to the challenges of tomorrow.\n  The bill I am introducing today, The Coast Guard Authorization Act \nfor fiscal years 2010 and 2011, is designed to help the Coast Guard \nmove toward the future, and ensure our maritime industries remain the \nclean and safe economic engine our nation's coastal communities have \ndepended on for generations.\n  As the U.S. experiences major oil spills, tropical storms, \nhurricanes, and terrorism, our maritime economy faces ever-present \nthreats. Congress needs to uphold its end of the bargain and provide \nthe legislative backing the Coast Guard needs to do its job, and do its \njob well.\n  This bill gives the Coast Guard greater authority to work with \ninternational maritime authorities, get better access to global safety \nand security information, and work more cooperatively with other \nnations on law enforcement; allows the Coast Guard to rework its \ncommand structure and increase its alignment with other armed \nforces; better supports the men and women who serve in the U.S. Coast \nGuard by allowing greater reimbursement for medical-related expenses \nand allowing Coast Guard service-members to participate in the Armed \nForces Retirement Home system; and directs the Coast Guard to conduct a \nthorough cost-benefit analysis for recapitalizing its polar icebreaker \nfleet so the service can prepare for future mission demands in the \nArctic.\n\n  This bill also contains the most ambitious reform of its acquisitions \nprogram in the Coast Guard's history. The Coast Guard is struggling \nright now to replace their rapidly aging fleet of ships, aircraft, and \nfacilities. At a cost of $24 billion, the Deepwater program is the \nCoast Guard's largest and most complex acquisition program ever. \nCongress has a responsibility to ensure there is transparency and \noversight so this program is as efficient and effective as possible.\n  Unfortunately, the Coast Guard's Deepwater program has experienced \nmajor failures and setbacks. The program utilized a private sector lead \nsystems integrator, LSI, know as Integrated Coast Guard Systems, ICGS, \nto oversee acquisition of a ``system of systems.'' When the Deepwater \ncontract was originally awarded in 2002, the Coast Guard did not have \nthe personnel within their ranks to manage such a large contract. \nCongress was told that outsourcing that role to industry would save the \nCoast Guard time and money over the long run.\n  That approach, which may have seemed innovative at the time, has not \nproduced the promised results. Instead of cost and time savings, we \nhave seen cost overruns, schedule delays, less competition and \ninadequate technical oversight.\n  The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, IG, released \nthree reports in 2006 and early 2007 detailing some of the problems \nwith Deepwater, including problems with electronics equipment, crucial \ndesign flaws and cost overruns created by a faulty contract structure \nand lack of oversight, and serious issues with the 123-foot cutter \nconversion project.\n  This legislation wipes the slate clean and makes fundamental changes \nto the Coast Guard's acquisition program. It requires the Coast Guard \nto abandon the industry-led Lead Systems Integrator and get back to \nbasics--full and open competition for all future assets.\n  It requires a completely new ``analysis of alternatives'' for all \nfuture Deepwater acquisitions to ensure that the Coast Guard is getting \nthe assets best-suited for their needs.\n  It requires the Coast Guard to follow a rigorous acquisitions process \nto make sure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n  And, it gives the Coast Guard the tools it needs to manage \nacquisitions effectively, including requiring the Coast Guard to make \ninternal management changes to ensure open competition, increase \ntechnical oversight and improve reporting to Congress.\n  This legislation takes major steps towards getting the Coast Guard \nthe assets they need while ensuring responsible management of taxpayer \ndollars. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the \nchanges I am proposing today so we can get this program back on track \nand help the Coast Guard accomplish its missions.\n  If we fail to pass legislation, we are doing a major disservice to \nthose very people we depend on. We will do so as they continue to place \ntheir lives at risk while they perform the mission of the Coast Guard.\n  This bill is good for taxpayers, good for the Coast Guard, and good \nfor every American depending on them to be, ``Always ready.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out \nthe Philadelphia universal feeding pilot program until the last day of \nthe 2012-2013 school year of the School District of Philadelphia; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Department \nof Agriculture's decision to end the Philadelphia School District's \nUniversal Feeding Pilot Program and to introduce legislation extending \nthe program. While changes to the Philadelphia program may be \nnecessary, the appropriate time to consider these changes is during \ncongressional reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act. Senator Casey \nand I are seeking to extend the program through the 2012-13 school \nyear. This extension is necessary to ensure that thousands of children \nin Philadelphia's poorest schools are not deprived of the nutritional \nassistance they have relied on for over 17 years.\n  Recognizing the value of proper nutrition to successful learning, \nCongress, in 1946, passed the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct. This act provides the authority for the School Lunch Program, as \nwell as several other child nutrition initiatives. In 1966 Congress \nexpanded on its commitment to child nutrition by passing the Child \nNutrition Act, which authorized the School Breakfast Program. These \nprograms have continued to evolve through changing times and changing \ntechnologies to ensure that the goal of providing nutrition assistance \nto our Nation's school children is met.\n  In 1991 the Department of Agriculture worked with the Philadelphia \nSchool District to develop a more streamlined method of reimbursing the \nSchool District for meals served under the National School Breakfast \nand School Lunch Program, and ensuring all eligible students receive \nfree meals.\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\nThis new method eliminated paper applications for free school meals, \nand replaced them with a socioeconomic survey based method of \ndetermining reimbursement rates and eligibility.\n  Paper applications are costly, and parents too often fail to return \nthem. The socioeconomic survey based approach was chosen because it \nreduced administrative overhead costs and is thought to better ensure \nthat all eligible students are accounted for. In addition, by providing \nUniversal Service the stigma associated with receiving a free or \nreduced price school meal is eliminated. Indeed, during the first year \nof the Universal Feeding Pilot Program, the Philadelphia School \nDistrict saw a 14 percent increase in lunch participation in elementary \nschools, a 45 percent increase in middle schools and a 180 percent \nincrease in high schools. The Philadelphia Universal Feeding Pilot \nProgram has successfully increased student participation in the school \nmeal program. Should this program be ended, as the Department of \nAgriculture would have it, children in the Philadelphia School District \nwill have their ability to learn undermined by Washington, DC, \nbureaucrats.\n  The students and parents in 200 of Philadelphia's poorest schools \nhave not filled out paper applications for free and reduced priced \nschool meals in over seventeen years. It is almost certain that some \nparents will fail to return paper applications to the school district, \nresulting in the underreporting of eligible students. In fact, the \nSecretary of Agriculture tacitly acknowledges the ineffectiveness of \npaper applications by offering outreach assistance to the Philadelphia \nSchool District.\n  A decrease in the amount of students claiming free or reduced lunches \nwill lower the Department of Agriculture's reimbursement rate to the \nPhiladelphia School District. Reducing the school meal reimbursement \nrate will not only cause the Philadelphia School District budgetary \nproblems in relation to the school meals program, but because other \ngrant funding is often based on the percentage of low income students \nin a district, as determined by participation rates in the school meal \nprogram, the District could potentially lose millions of dollars in \nother state and Federal grant funding. Federal E-rate funding, for \nexample, which is used for educational technology, is based directly on \nschool meal program eligibility percentages.\n  Congress is expected to take up the Child Nutrition Act \nreauthorization later this year. Universal Feeding and the National \nSchool Breakfast and Lunch Program will be a part of this debate, and \nthis is an appropriate time and place to consider changes to the \nprogram. We know from experience that Congressional action is not \nalways as swift as planned, and that the legislative calendar changes \nfrom week to week if not from day to day.\n  Therefore, Senator Casey and I introduce legislation today to extend \nthe Philadelphia School District's Universal Feeding Pilot Program \nthrough the close of the 2012-2013 school year to ensure that \nPhiladelphia school children receive the necessary nutritional \nassistance until Congress can enact a new policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6215-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 168--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON WOMEN'S \n  SOFTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2009 NCAA WOMEN'S COLLEGE WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Nurses' Higher \n     Education and Loan Repayment Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Health Resources and Services Administration \n     estimates there is currently a shortage of more than 200,000 \n     registered nurses nationwide and projects the shortage will \n     grow to more than 1,000,000 nurses by 2020, 36 percent less \n     than needed to meet demand for nursing care.\n       (2) The shortage of qualified nursing faculty is the \n     primary factor driving the inability of nursing schools to \n     graduate more registered nurses to meet the Nation's growing \n     workforce demand.\n       (3) There continues to be strong interest on the part of \n     young Americans to enter the nursing field. The National \n     League for Nursing estimates that 88,000 qualified \n     applications, or 1 out of every 3 submitted to basic \n     registered nurse programs in 2006, were rejected due to lack \n     of capacity.\n       (4) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (in \n     this section referred to as the ``AACN'') estimates that \n     49,948 applicants were turned away specifically from \n     baccalaureate and graduate schools of nursing in 2008 and \n     over 70 percent of the schools responding to the AACN survey \n     reported a lack of nurse faculty as the number 1 reason for \n     turning away qualified applicants. Likewise, nearly 70 \n     percent of the associate's degree registered nurse programs \n     responding to the most recent American Association of \n     Community Colleges Nursing Survey reported a lack of faculty \n     to teach as the number 1 reason for turning away qualified \n     applicants.\n       (5) Large numbers of faculty members at schools of nursing \n     in the United States are nearing retirement. According to the \n     AACN, the average age of a nurse faculty member is 55 years \n     old and the average age at retirement is 62.\n       (6) The current nationwide nurse faculty vacancy rate is \n     estimated to be as high as 7.6 percent, including 814 vacant \n     positions at schools of nursing offering baccalaureate and \n     advanced degrees and, in 2006, as many as 880 in associate's \n     degree programs.\n       (7) Market forces have created disincentives for \n     individuals qualified to become nurse educators from pursing \n     this career. The average annual salary for an associate \n     professor of nursing with a master's degree is nearly 20 \n     percent less than the average salary for a nurse practitioner \n     with a master's degree, according to the 2007 salary survey \n     by the journal ADVANCE for Nurse Practitioners.\n       (8) The most recent Health Resources and Services \n     Administration survey data indicates that from a total of \n     more than 2,000,000 registered nurses, only 143,113 \n     registered nurses with a bachelor's degree and only 51,318 \n     registered nurses with an associate's degree have continued \n     their education to earn a master's degree in the science of \n     nursing, the minimum credential necessary to teach in all \n     types of registered nurse programs. The majority of these \n     graduates do not become nurse educators.\n       (9) Current Federal incentive programs to encourage nurses \n     to become educators are inadequate and inaccessible for many \n     interested nurses.\n       (10) A broad incentive program must be available to willing \n     and qualified nurses that will provide financial support and \n     encourage them to pursue and maintain a career in nursing \n     education.\n\n     SEC. 3. NURSE FACULTY LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       Part E of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 297a et seq.) is amended by inserting after section \n     846A the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 846B.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE PRECEDENTIAL \n                   EFFECT OF THIS TITLE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that unique harms are \n     associated with online cigarette sales, including problems \n     with verifying the ages of consumers in the digital market \n     and the long-term health problems associated with the use of \n     certain tobacco products. This title was enacted recognizing \n     the longstanding interest of Congress in urging compliance \n     with States' laws regulating remote sales of certain tobacco \n     products to citizens of those States, including the passage \n     of the Jenkins Act over 50 years ago, which established \n     reporting requirements for out-of-State companies that sell \n     certain tobacco products to citizens of the taxing States, \n     and which gave authority to the Department of Justice and the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to \n     enforce the Jenkins Act. In light of the unique harms and \n     circumstances surrounding the online sale of certain tobacco \n     products, this title is intended to help collect cigarette \n     excise taxes, to stop tobacco sales to underage youth, and to \n     help the States enforce their laws that target the online \n     sales of certain tobacco products only.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Washington softball team on their 2009 NCAA National \nChampionship.\n  On June 2, led by National Player of the Year Danielle Lawrie and \nhead coach Heather Tarr, the Huskies earned their first title in a \nthrilling 3-2 victory over the University of Florida.\n  The win caps an amazing 51-12 season that saw the team capture the \nhearts and minds of the entire region. Facing challenges and setbacks \nthroughout the season, the team found the courage and determination \nneeded to break through to highest achievement in college softball.\n  Following the game, National Player of the Year Danielle Lawrie added \nto her already lengthy resume when she was selected as the Most \nOutstanding Player of the College World Series. She was joined on this \nyear's First-Team All-America team by teammate Ashley Charters who \ncloses out her Husky career with her third All-America selection.\n  However, it was not individuals who won this championship; it was a \nteam. The commitment and passion of each and every player has turned \nthe University of Washington into one of the most feared softball teams \nin the Nation. This season marks the 16th straight postseason \nappearance by the Huskies. Competing in the indisputably toughest \nconference in America, the Pac-10, the University of Washington has \nsteadily climbed into the ranks of softball's elite.\n  At a time when budget shortfalls are forcing universities across the \nNation to eliminate athletic programs, the University of Washington \nsoftball team stands as a testament to the role of athletics in our \nschools. These are not superstars headed to lucrative paychecks; they \nare committed student-athletes who dedicate themselves every day on the \nfield and in the classroom. I reserve special praise for the league-\nleading seven Huskies named to the Pac-10 All-Academic team: Morgan \nStuart, Amanda Fleischman, Alyson McWherter, Ashlyn Watson, Ashley \nCharters, Marnie Koziol and Alicia Blake.\n  Congratulations once more to our newest national champions, the \nUniversity of Washington Huskies. Go Dawgs!\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 168) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n       Whereas on June 2, 2009, for the first time in university \n     history, the University of Washington Women Huskies won the \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association (``NCAA'') national \n     softball championship game with a 3-2 victory over the \n     University of Florida Gators;\n       Whereas University of Washington pitcher Danielle Lawrie \n     was named the Women's College World Series Most Valuable \n     Player and the USA Softball National Collegiate Player of the \n     Year;\n       Whereas the Huskies finished the 2009 season with an \n     impressive record of 51-12;\n       Whereas the members of the 2009 University of Washington \n     softball team are excellent representatives of a university \n     that is 1 of the premier academic institutions in Washington \n     State, producing many outstanding student-athletes and other \n     leaders; and\n       Whereas the members of the women's softball team have \n     brought great honor to themselves, their families, the \n     University of Washington, and the State of Washington: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the University of Washington softball \n     team for winning the 2009 Women's College World Series;\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, \n     students, and staff whose hard work and dedication helped the \n     University of Washington win the championship; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) Mark A. Emmert, president of the University of \n     Washington;\n       (B) Scott Woodward, director of athletics of the University \n     of Washington; and\n       (C) Heather Tarr, head coach of the University of \n     Washington softball team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/04/senate-section/article/S6229-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 8, 2009\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
