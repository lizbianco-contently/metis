Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Kathleen \nSebelius to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. There will be up \nto 8 hours for debate prior to a vote, with a 60-vote affirmation \nrequired for confirmation. That is by agreement.\n  I would indicate we have a few speakers on our side but not 4 hours \nworth. In fact, if we get up to an hour, it will be a surprise to me. \nSo we will yield back a lot of that time.\n  At 12 noon we will vote on passage of the Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 today for our weekly \ncaucus luncheons. Following the caucus recess, the Senate will resume \ndebate on the Sebelius nomination, with the vote expected sometime \nlater in the afternoon or evening.\n  Last night, the budget conferees filed a conference report \naccompanying the budget resolution. We expect to consider the \nconference report sometime tomorrow.\n  Finally, I expect the Senate to begin consideration of housing \nlegislation this week. We have not finalized that with the \ndistinguished Republican leader and members of his caucus, but I think \nwe are getting very close. What we anticipate--I have filed, under rule \nXIV, the House-passed bill minus the bankruptcy provision. It is \ncontemplated that the first amendment will be offered by Senator \nDurbin, to put the bankruptcy provision back in the bill. Then after \nthat, we would take a look at the bill to see if anything else needed \nto be done. But the Durbin amendment would include just the bankruptcy \nlanguage. There are issues in this dealing with FDIC and other things \nwe are told the banking community and financial world needs, and we \nwill take a look at that. That is how we will get to that legislation. \nWe hope to do that within the next 24 hours or something like that.\n  I have indicated to the Republican leader that the next nomination we \nare concerned about is Tom Strickland, the Chief of Staff of the \nSecretary of Interior. I had good conversations with Senator Bunning \nlast week. He has some questions he wants answered. He put that in \nwriting to the Secretary. That has been all taken care of. Senator \nBunning said he was not worried about delaying the vote but he wants an \nopportunity to be able to speak in regard to him, and I think there are \nother Senators who feel the same way, so hopefully we can work that \nout.\n  Then we are going to the credit card legislation, which was reported \nout of the Banking Committee. That is something that will not be real \neasy to do, but polling numbers indicate that almost 90 percent of the \nAmerican people want us to do something with credit cards so it is \nsomething we have to do.\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nI have talked with the Republican leader about other things we wish to \ntry to accomplish before we leave here during this spring period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4766-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tomorrow night in Berlin, Attorney \nGeneral Holder is scheduled to deliver a speech about the \nadministration's plan to shut down the detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay by the arbitrary deadline of January 2010.\n  Many Americans are skeptical of the administration's decision to \nclose Guantanamo before it has a plan to deal with the 240 terrorists \nwho are currently housed there. And Americans were rightly alarmed by \nrecent news reports that the administration is considering releasing \nsome Guantanamo detainees into the U.S.--not to detention facilities, \nbut directly into our neighborhoods.\n  Aside from the question of why the Attorney General thinks a German \naudience should hear about the administration's plans for Guantanamo \nbefore the American people do, there are a number of questions about \nthe administration's plan for releasing terrorists into the United \nStates that I hope the Attorney General will address tomorrow night.\n  Queston No. 1: What is the legal basis for bringing these terrorist-\ntrained detainees to the United States, given that Federal law \nspecifically forbids the entry of anyone who endorses or espouses \nterrorism, has received terrorist training, or belongs to a terrorist \ngroup? That is U.S. law.\n  Question No. 2: Can the administration guarantee the safety of the \nAmerican people, particularly in the neighborhoods where these terror-\ntrained detainees will live?\n  Question No. 3: Will the residents of the communities where these men \nwill be released be made aware of it?\n  Question No. 4: Will these trained terrorists be allowed to travel \nfreely anywhere in the United States?\n  Question No. 5: What will their status be? Will they be allowed to \nstay here permanently? Will they be eligible for citizenship? Will they \nreceive or be eligible to receive taxpayer funding? Why did no other \ncountry agree to accept them? What threat do these men pose of \nreturning to terrorist activities and what threat assessments have been \nconducted to evaluate whether these men will attack U.S. troops on the \nbattlefield or Americans at Embassies abroad?\n  There are now less than 300 days until the President's Executive \norder mandates the closure of the secure detention facility at \nGuantanamo and the transfer or release of its remaining detainees. I \nrecognize the difficulty of the challenge these detainees present, but \nwe shouldn't let an arbitrary deadline and a desire to appease critics \noverseas lead to decisions that make American citizens less safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4766-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Kathleen Sebelius, of \nKansas, to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 8 hours of debate equally divided and controlled between the \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate confirmed the first member of \nPresident Obama's Cabinet more than 3 months ago. Today, we are here to \nfinish the job.\n  It has taken some time to get here. But now we have a great nominee \nto be Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Today, we will vote to confirm the nomination of Governor Kathleen \nSebelius to be Secretary of HHS. She is the right person for the job.\n  Governor Sebelius comes to us with a long list of qualifications. She \nis a true public servant. For more than 6 years, she has served as \nGovernor of Kansas. For 8 years, she served as the Kansas Insurance \nCommissioner. And for 8 years before that, she served in the Kansas \nState Legislature.\n  Governor Sebelius has devoted a career to serving the public. She \nunderstands the legislative process. She understands the administrative \nprocess. And she has experience working with the private sector, too. \nGovernor Sebelius has earned the respect of Republicans and Democrats \nalike.\n  Governor Sebelius knows a lot about health care. She is committed to \nprotecting people and getting them the health care that they need. As \nGovernor, she worked hard to make sure that Kansans--especially kids--\nhad access to quality health insurance that they could afford. And as \nInsurance Commissioner, Governor Sebelius blocked a merger that would \nhave made insurance unaffordable.\n  In addition to protecting consumers, Governor Sebelius also \nrecognizes the need to bring businesses together to make our health \ncare system work.\n  As Governor, she worked hard to make health care costs more \nmanageable for businesses. And she worked to get more small businesses \nto offer health insurance coverage. Governor Sebelius doubled the small \nbusiness tax credit.\n  Governor Sebelius' record shows that she approaches problems from all \nsides. She is prepared to try creative solutions. She is forward-\nthinking. She is willing to work with everyone. And she is not afraid \nto lead--even when faced with difficult choices and resistance to \nchange. That is just the kind of leadership that we need in the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Governor Sebelius has proven that she is willing to work hard and it \nis a good thing because we have a lot of work to do.\n  Our health care system is broken. We spend more than any other \ncountry on health care--more than $2.4 trillion annually--and we don't \neven cover all Americans.\n  Forty-six million Americans lack health insurance, and another 25 \nmillion Americans are underinsured--they have some coverage but not \nenough to keep their medical bills manageable. That is why medical debt \ncontributes to half of all bankruptcies--affecting about 2 million \npeople a year.\n  American families are struggling to keep up with the high costs of \nhealth care. And American businesses are straining to absorb these \nrising costs while trying to stay competitive at home and abroad.\n  The path that we are on is not sustainable. We must inform our health \ncare system and we must do it now. Failure to address problems in the \nhealth care system will undermine our efforts to restore the economy.\n  We need a health care system that meets all of our needs. A high-\nperforming health care system would guarantee all Americans affordable, \nquality coverage no matter their age, health status, or medical \nhistory.\n  Health care reform will help to stabilize our economy and it will \nmake sure that we are prepared to handle our long-term fiscal \nchallenges.\n  Congress has made a good start toward reform. But there is still a \nlong way to go.\n  Last year, we in the Finance Committee started the process by holding \nten different health reform hearings. We learned about the problems in \nour current system and started to develop solutions.\n  In June, along with my colleague Chuck Grassley, I hosted a day-long \nhealth care summit for the Finance Committee at the Library of \nCongress.\n  We engaged our colleagues in the process early on. In November, I \nreleased a white paper, ``A Call to Action,'' to outline my vision for \nhealth care reform. Since then, I have been\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nworking closely with Senator Grassley and the Senators on the Finance \nCommittee. I have been working with other Senators as well, especially \nSenator Kennedy and the HELP Committee, to come up with meaningful, \ncomprehensive health reform legislation we could pass this year.\n  Last week, the Finance Committee held the first of three roundtables. \nWe discussed delivery system reform. Tomorrow we are walking through \nsome policy options. In the coming weeks, we will have two more \nroundtables and work through other policy options in other areas.\n  Senators will weigh the options. They will contribute to the process. \nBy June, we will be ready for a Finance Committee markup. We are \nworking together to make good progress, but Congress cannot do this \nalone. Congress needs a strong partner at HHS to pass comprehensive \nhealth reform.\n  We are developing a framework that will change how health care is \ndelivered. But we need a first-class Secretary and team at HHS to help \nget reform off the ground and to make it work. I look forward to \nworking with Governor Sebelius to make sure our bill can be \nimplemented. I wish to make sure we send the Secretary a product that \nsets the rules of the game. We wish to make sure we also give the \nDepartment and agencies the flexibility they will need to play their \npart effectively.\n  It will be a long and iterative process, with a lot of back and \nforth. I am pleased we will be able to get started quite soon.\n  Governor Sebelius is the right person for the job. She has political \nexperience, determination, and a bipartisan work ethic to get the job \ndone. She has been an insurance commissioner, and she knows the nuts \nand bolts of the health care system. She has been a Governor, so she \nknows how to work with Democrats and with the Republicans; that is her \ninclination anyway.\n  I have no doubt Governor Sebelius will continue to show her \ncommitment to public service as Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nand the American people will benefit from her service. Let us finish \nthe job in confirming President Obama's Cabinet. Let's place a fine \npublic servant in office, and let's confirm Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to \nbe Secretary of HHS.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, for him to speak when he can get recognition. \nPending that recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Baucus.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGov. Kathleen Sebelius for Secretary of Health and Human Services. Mr. \nPresident, let me say at the outset how grateful all our Senate \ncolleagues are for your leadership on the terribly important issue of \nhealth care reform.\n  As we think about economic recovery, I think most Members of the \nSenate realize there will not be true comprehensive economic recovery \nin this country unless we can also take on the massive challenge of \nreforming our health care system. The current costs of our health care \nsystem, $2.4 trillion and rising, are costs that are not sustainable \nover the long term.\n  I applaud the President's activities in this effort and his efforts \nto try to bring about the kind of bipartisan consensus on health care \nreform the Nation so desperately needs. That is why I think it is so \nimportant that later today the Senate act rapidly in the confirmation \nof Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.\n  I have had the opportunity to get to know Governor Sebelius during my \ntenure as Governor of Virginia. I have worked closely with her on a \nrange of issues, particularly issues revolving around Medicaid reform. \nThere is no issue that confronts States across the country more than \nthe rising cost of Medicaid.\n  As we take on health care reform at the Federal level, reform of \nMedicaid is a critical component, and Governor Sebelius has a long \nrecord of working with other Governors all across the country, from \nboth parties, in this important area.\n  As the Presiding Officer laid out, she brings a unique set of skills \nto the challenge: Former State legislator, former State insurance \ncommissioner, and now a two-term Governor of Kansas. As we strive in \nthis body to try to reach bipartisan consensus on this terribly \nimportant issue, no one brings a better record of working across the \naisle to reach that bipartisan consensus than Governor Sebelius.\n  Governor Sebelius has a legislature that is overwhelmingly of the \nopposite party, but her overwhelming reelection and her ability to show \ntangible efforts in the area of health care reform in Kansas gives her \nthe appropriate background to take on this challenge in the national \ndebate.\n  For example, Governor Sebelius worked with her legislature and her \nsmall business community to significantly increase tax benefits to \nsmall business for healthcare; employees in this area of our economy \nare oftentimes left behind. Governor Sebelius recently worked with her \nlegislature as well on a dramatic expansion of the SCHIP program, a \nlegislative initiative that was actually introduced by the Republican \nlegislative leadership. Again, she worked in concert with the opposite \nparty.\n  As we move forward on the issue of health care reform, which I know \nthe Presiding Officer will take the leadership on in the Senate, we \nneed, and President Obama needs, someone who has a long-term record of \nbuilding bridges between parties.\n  Health care reform is too important not to have this kind of \nconsensus-building activity. Governor Sebelius has the background. \nGovernor Sebelius has the track record in health care. I can speak, \npersonally, that she has the temperament to work to try to bring both \nsides together.\n  I would also add, I think most of us in these last few days have not \nbeen able to pick up a newspaper or talk to our constituents back home \nwithout hearing about growing concern about the possibility of a swine \nflu pandemic.\n  This challenge has already paralyzed the country of Mexico and is one \nthat we all are following very closely, particularly the possible rise \nof cases in the United States. This challenge, potentially confronts \nour Nation in a very dramatic way.\n  It is essential for the health of the Nation that President Obama has \nin place, and the Nation has in place, a strong Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to make sure our Federal efforts on this potential \npandemic are ably coordinated--one more reason why it is critical this \nbody moves quickly to confirm the nomination of Governor Sebelius. I \nknow we will act on this later today.\n  But I believe, from a personal standpoint, Kathleen Sebelius will be \na great addition to President Obama and to his Cabinet and will be a \ngreat partner to you, Mr. President, and our colleagues in making sure \nwe bring about health care reform quickly, rapidly, and properly this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask that the time of the quorum \ncall be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, over the past 8 weeks, there has been a \nSenator in here who has struggled with the birth of twin granddaughters \nborn at 30 weeks, to a first-time mom, his son's wife, and went through \na struggle that was near death multiple times.\n  But yet today, I am pleased to announce that those two baby girls are \nat home with their parents, thriving, thriving now, life held in the \nbalance, brought out of that balance by modern medicine. Now they will \nbe successful, contributing citizens, with potential that will be \nmanifested in millions and millions of ways that we can all look \nforward to and accept as a natural response to our procreative \nabilities.\n  Why do I bring that up? There was not anybody in this room, and \nprobably\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nanybody listening, who did not smile when we talked about the potential \nof two new young children, two new young girls who are going to make an \nimpact, maybe just locally, maybe just in their family, maybe \nnationally. But the fact is we have joy when we see that kind of \noutcome.\n  The reason I tell that story is because it fits who we are as human \nbeings. It fits with our idea of the pursuit of life, of liberty, and \nof happiness. That right is guaranteed to us under the Constitution.\n  Kathleen Sebelius is, undoubtedly, a public servant to be honored for \nher years of commitment in the roles she has held. But I believe she \nhas a drastic and fatal character flaw and it is this: She still \nbelieves that if a woman came with those twins at 30 weeks, to a doctor \nin Kansas, and she wanted to abort them, even though they are viable, \nthat would be fine.\n  Now we are about to put someone in charge of Health and Human \nServices of this Nation who has this vital flaw of not recognizing the \nvalue of these two young children's lives. What does it say about where \nwe are going to go? What does it say about the judgment process under \nwhich we applaud her service but do not recognize this one critical \nflaw that says: Individuals can decide what individuals have life.\n  We do that collectively under the law. But we do not do it \ncollectively and discriminately on the basis of making decisions that \nsomeone ought not to have life at the very beginning.\n  I believe that is a disqualifier. I believe as we embrace more and \nmore people into leadership roles in our Government who walk away from \nthis very basic characteristic of human existence, this very basic \nnecessity that recognizes the value--we are not talking about a first-\ntrimester abortion, we are talking about snuffing life from viable \nchildren.\n  I am also unsettled as to her beliefs under the conscience protection \nfor health care providers. If, in fact, you think it is OK to take a \n36-week child in the womb who is an inconvenience for someone and that \nwe, as a society, can't handle that, our choice is to snuff it out, how \nfar does it go before we require the provider community to snuff it \nout? There were no assurances given in her testimony that that will not \nhappen. We have already seen the Obama administration work to look at \nreversing the guidelines from the last administration clarifying \nparticularly what the providers' roles are. It says a lot about where \nwe are as a society, about our misplaced values.\n  The other problem I have--it is one I have never voiced before from \nthis Chamber--is the idea that we as politicians embrace somebody for a \nposition because they are a politician, because they have spent years \nbeing a career politician, and that that qualifies them, the Governor \nof a very small State population-wise, to handle and lead on all these \nareas of health care. It does not recognize the complexities of the \nmanagement organization at HHS, the difficulties they have in terms of \ncarrying out their charges. It recognizes past performance in a \npolitical arena and equates that as capability in a management arena. \nIf we continue to measure political success and confuse it with the \nability to have management success, we will continue repeating the same \nmistakes in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  My largest worry is not in the short term, it is in the long term. \nWhat our country lacks today, what it yearns for today, what it \ndeserves today is courageous, moral leadership, not political \nleadership. It is OK to have a debate about the controversies society \nfaces. It is not OK for us to run because we are going to get hit by \nthe press because we take a position that is different from that that \nis politically correct but is based on moral certitude that all life \nhas value. Yet we run from the debate, the true Lincoln-Douglas type \ndebates that held open the soul of America, so we can decide not on the \nbasis of opinion but on the basis of historical fact. The basis of \nhistorical fact is this: When societies quit valuing life, societies \nfail to flourish.\n  We have a nominee who, for whatever reason, vetoes a bill that says: \nIf you are a doctor, you ought to explain yourself if you are going to \ntake the life of a 26-week infant in utero. You should have to get a \nsecond opinion. You ought to demonstrate that you are doing what is in \nthe best interest of the mother and child.\n  It is hard to demonstrate a best interest for a child when you turn \nit around in the womb, deliver it two-thirds of the way out, and then \ndestroy it. That is a debate we ought to have. It doesn't just apply to \nthe issue of abortion and unwanted pregnancy; it is a barometer of the \nsoul of the Nation. We offer no excuse that can be recognized as \nvaluable for the betterment of society when we don't have that \nfundamental debate.\n  There is a flaw, a critical defect in this nominee. If you are going \nto be charged with the health and services that relate to health and \nhumans in this society, that you are confused on this issue about \ntransparency and accountability of taking the life of an unborn child \nis a nonstarter with me, not because I dislike Kathleen Sebelius. She \nis a wonderful lady. But she lacks part of the moral clarity that is \nrequired to lead this Nation in the future and to correct where we are \noff course on so many issues. Her ability from the start, the first day \nshe is sworn in, will be compromised by her position on this issue. The \nconfidence she will require of the Members of Congress who relate to \nthis foundational principle of liberty as an inalienable right and life \nas an inalienable right will undermine her from the start.\n  I have no doubt she will be approved today. I mark it as another \nsignpost on the way to oblivion as a nation when we empower those who \ndon't recognize the value of life in positions that should be guarding \nthat very precept and foundational principle of the Republic. My hope \nis that the American people, who by 88 percent think this is an \natrocious procedure and should never be done, no matter what parameters \nare put on it, will wake up and say: What are we doing? What are we \ndoing?\n  For those reasons, and those reasons alone, I will vote against the \nnomination of Kathleen Sebelius.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \nunder the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a nomination \ndiscussion, and that takes place in the midst of a health care \ndiscussion. Last night, the House and Senate conferees struck an \nagreement on the budget resolution that will clear the way for final \nvotes later this week, but it includes reconciliation instructions for \nhealth care and student loan forms which are quite controversial. We \nare told the reconciliation would not be used until after October 15, \nand some might find that reassuring. I am not one of those who does \nbecause if we are going to deal with the health care problem, we must \nrecognize that it is enormously complex.\n  Health care spending is projected to be 17.6 percent of our GDP, \nwhich is nearly one-fifth of our economy, and a bill dealing with that \nis going to have to be scored by the CBO before any committee can \nreport it out. At the moment, there is only one bill with respect to \nhealth care that has received a CBO score. It is the bill offered by \nSenator Wyden and myself, along with 12 cosponsors, known as the \nHealthy Americans Act. It has been scored by the CBO as revenue-neutral \nduring its first 2 years and then saving money for the Federal \nGovernment thereafter. With 12 cosponsors--a mixture of both \nRepublicans and Democrats--it would seem to me that this would be the \nbill from which we begin our discussions in a truly bipartisan manner, \nand it would not require the straitjacket of reconciliation to make it \npossible for the majority to move ahead. We have a score. We have a \nframework. We have language. It is not perfect. Even some of the \ncosponsors have indicated that in its present form they might vote \nagainst it, but at least it is a place to\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nbegin. It is a place to start the conversation. We do not need the kind \nof enforcement of majority rights that reconciliation would give us.\n  To start over again fresh with a proposal from the administration \nwould mean that a bill has to be drafted--something we have already \ndone; the bill would have to be referred to CBO--something we have \nalready done; CBO would have to go through the difficulties of scoring \nit--an enormous challenge. I don't believe they would be able to get \nall that done in a timely fashion. Then we would be told on the floor: \nWell, we have run out of time. We have to deal with health care so we \nare going to move to reconciliation as the way to jam the thing through \nin a hurry. Let's understand right here in the beginning that that kind \nof activity is not required.\n  Let's turn to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and her role with respect to the \nhealth care debate. My normal pattern has always been to say that the \nPresident has the right to whomever he wants, and I have not voted \nagainst Presidential nominees unless I felt they were completely \ninappropriate or incapable of carrying out their duties.\n  I have respect for Governor Sebelius. I think she is a valuable and \npotentially productive appointment for the President, but I have \nreluctantly come to the conclusion that she is the wrong appointee for \nthis particular assignment. She has backed a partisan process for \nhealth care reform. She refuses to support patient safeguards and \ncomparative effectiveness research, and, perhaps most strongly for me, \nshe has already endorsed a Government-run public health care plan, \nsomething I would have to vote against. I think most of my colleagues--\nif not all of my colleagues on the Republican side--would vote against \nit, not for partisan reasons but for the flat fact that it doesn't \nwork. We have seen examples of that throughout the world, and we \nunderstand it doesn't work.\n  I have constituents who have relatives and friends in Canada who come \nto me and say: Based on our experience with our relatives and friends \nin Canada, we absolutely do not want a Canadian system. This is just an \nanecdote, but it is illustrative of the kind of thing that goes on in \nthe Canadian system where they ration care by delay. They don't ration \nit by regulation, they simply ration it by delaying the ability of \npeople to get access. As has been reported to me, if you can \ndemonstrate as you go into the Canadian system that there is some \nproblem related to heart disease, you get moved to the head of the \nline. So some of my constituents have told me that their relatives in \nCanada have discovered that if they go to see a doctor with a cold or \nwith the flu or with some other problem, they always say, ``And this \nthreatens my potential for heart disease'' in an effort to get ahead of \nthe line and move forward in the Canadian system that would otherwise \ndelay their access to a doctor. If you haven't learned that trick, you \nwait for 3 months, 6 months, whatever. This is the kind of Government-\nrun public health plan Governor Sebelius has indicated that she would \nsupport.\n  There is also the troubling problem that she failed to disclose \nrelevant information to the Finance Committee with respect to her \ntaxes. We have had that happen with other Cabinet nominations, and it \nhas become something of a cause celebre with many Americans who are \nfollowing this. It has become the butt of jokes on the late-night talk \nshows. It is unfortunate that she has fallen a victim to that as well.\n  She has also been less than forthcoming with respect to her \nrelationships with some of her political donors. She had a political \nrelationship with a doctor who was involved in partial-birth abortions \nand was obviously anxious to see to it that he had access to public \nofficials who would support him in that. That is an issue which carries \na great deal of influence with my constituents, and it is another one \nthat troubles me.\n  So while I think Governor Sebelius might be well qualified for some \nother position, I do not intend to support her for this position. As we \ndeal with health care problems, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices is a key player in helping us solve this problem, and I \nbelieve she carries a little bit too much baggage for this particular \nassignment.\n  So once again we have the framework for a bipartisan solution. It can \nbe the beginning point of the discussion. A bill has been written \naround it, and it has been scored by the CBO. Why don't we start with \nthat instead of threatening reconciliation for a whole new program that \nmight start with the administration?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New York \nwishes to be recognized for 5 minutes, so I ask unanimous consent that \nI be recognized for 10 minutes following the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for 5 minutes and that Senator Gregg be recognized \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Sojourner Truth\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today is a very special day for me. \nAs a woman and a New Yorker, it thrills me that today we are honoring \none of the earliest and greatest figures in the history of women's \nrights and civil rights: Sojourner Truth. We are placing a statue of \nSojourner Truth in Statuary Hall today--the first African-American \nwoman to have a statue in the Capitol. She will be the 12th woman \ndepicted in works of sculpture among the 92 sculptures of our male \nleaders. From this day forward, Sojourner Truth's groundbreaking work \nadvancing the basic rights of women will be given its due prominence \nbeside so many other great Americans in the seat of our democracy.\n  Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree as a slave in 1797 who \nnever learned to read or write, yet became an all-important messenger \nfor truth and equality. Although beaten and branded, she responded with \ndignity and faith rather than hatred and violence. Her views were \nshaped not only by her personal hardships--enslavement, daily beatings, \ngrueling work, and seeing her 13 children kidnapped and sold away--but \nalso from an innate understanding that equality is an inalienable \nAmerican right and should not be ascribed based on gender or color.\n  Once freed from bondage in 1817, she changed her name to Sojourner \nTruth, telling her friends that the spirit had called her to speak the \ntruth for justice. She then traveled our Nation speaking honest words \nabout the shortcomings of the American dream--the stain that slavery \nand injustice imposed on America's life and laws and noting for all to \nsee where the reality failed to reflect the noble tenets of our \nFounding Fathers. She dedicated her life, indeed, she risked her \nfreedom, to oppose the trappings of injustice and prejudice.\n  Despite being born into slavery, stripped of any legal standing, \nprotection, or property, and denied any access to education, Sojourner \nTruth understood that freedom and equality are fundamental rights. \nEmbracing our greatest traditions and arguing with simple passion that \nneither gender nor color could overpower justice, she demonstrated a \ncourage and a conviction that compels us to act today, almost 125 years \nafter her death.\n  Sojourner Truth raised her voice without a chorus of women behind \nher. Most abolitionists questioned her determination to link women's \nrights with the abolition of slavery. She rejected their concerns, \nasking them the direct question they couldn't avoid: ``And ain't I a \nwoman?'' With those few words, she refused to parse justice. With those \nfew words, she forced audiences past and present to recognize that \nhuman dignity and respect are part and parcel of who we are as \nAmericans--male or female, African-American or Caucasian, educated or \nnot. Sojourner Truth represents the courage that the American ideal \nimparts and calls all of us to action.\n  As we honor this bold, daring New Yorker today, I am also proud that \nNew York has time and time again helped to foster those who have chosen \nto carry on her fight. Today, I can think of at least two others \ncommitted\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nto justice who, though from very different backgrounds, continually \nrisk themselves for justice and human rights.\n  The battles fought by Sojourner Truth were not left only as lessons \nof history, but they stood as a beacon of hope for the next generation \nto carry the torch one mile further. One of the next in our history to \ncarry on the cause for equal justice was Eleanor Roosevelt.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt could have been content with a life defined by \nprivilege and limited education. But like Sojourner Truth, she \ntravelled the nation and indeed the world to fight for equality and \nhuman rights. Like Sojourner Truth, Eleanor Roosevelt raised her voice \nto attack segregation and gender bias. Like Sojourner Truth, she risked \nher life to practice what she preached and to hold us accountable when \nwe wanted to turn our back on justice and American ideals. Like \nSojourner Truth, Eleanor Roosevelt told us that we ``must hazard all we \nhave'' to make the American dream real. She told us that employment, \nhousing, education, health care policies that favored the privileged \nundermined us all, that women had a critical role and responsibility, \nand encouraged women to run for office, to organize, to get out the \nvote, and to reach across party, gender, and racial lines to get the \nwork done.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt took this same determination with her to the United \nNations where, like Sojourner Truth, she used strength and grace to \nadvance the recognition of equal rights. Embracing her responsibility \nas the only woman on the American delegation and one of the few women \ndelegates to the General Assembly, she played an instrumental role in \ndrafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, especially \nthe concept as stated in article 1, that ``all human beings are born \nfree and equal.''\n  Just as Sojourner Truth had done in a century before and Eleanor \nRoosevelt had done decades earlier, the cause was enlisted by another \ngreat woman. Recognizing that equality had not yet been achieved, \nHillary Clinton stood and fought for the rights of women. As first \nlady, Hillary Clinton understood the political costs of speaking out \nforthrightly for women's rights and human rights. Yet like Sojourner \nTruth and Eleanor Roosevelt before her, she would not ignore the rights \nand needs of women despite the possible diplomatic repercussions.\n  She travelled to China in 1995 and stood before the world to oppose \ninjustice and to proclaim that ``once and for all, women's rights are \nhuman rights and human rights are women's rights.''\n  How Sojourner Truth must have relished that moment. From Akron, OH, \nBeijing, China--from newspapers to the Internet and C-SPAN--their \nmessage spanned the globe.\n  Hillary Clinton played an instrumental role in the dedication we \ncelebrate today. Hillary Clinton and Sheila Jackson-Lee were inspired \nby the efforts of Dr. C. Delores Tucker, former chair of the National \nCongress of Black Women, to formally recognize Sojourner Truth in the \nU.S. Capitol. They felt that the unfinished portion of the monument to \nsuffragists was surely intended to hold the image of Sojourner Truth. \nAfter long consideration, it was determined to carve a unique place for \nSojourner Truth--appropriately so as the first statue in Emancipation \nHall.\n  And now it stands erect in the Capitol Visitors Center for all to \nsee. As the Senator from their home state, I am so grateful to be here \ntoday to honor Sojourner Truth. Her courage and her vision are timeless \nand bold and brave--Her statue will be a constant reminder that our \nrights must never be take for granted and that with these rights come \nthe responsibility to enforce them.\n  To honor Sojourner Truth and all women before us, we continue that \nstruggle as there is still much to do. Today the fight is for equal pay \nand recognition in the workplace. Even in 2009, for every dollar a man \nearns, a woman makes just 78 cents. And the disparity is even worse for \nwomen of color, with Latino women earning only 53 cents and African-\nAmerican women earning 62 cents on the dollar. Working women and their \nfamilies stand to lose $250,000 over the course of their career because \nof pay inequity. It is unacceptable, and it needs to change. The \nPaycheck Fairness Act introduced by then-Senator Hillary Clinton and \nRep. Rosa DeLauro is an important step towards that goal. I proudly \njoin in helping carry Secretary Clinton's work towards equality here in \nthe Senate.\n  These steps towards equality for all are our duty. As Eleanor \nRoosevelt often said, ``we are all on trial to show what democracy \nmeans.'' We have made such important strides, but we still have a long \nway to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the soon to be \npending issue of the budget. We are told that the Democratic membership \nof the House and Senate reached agreement last night on the budget \nproposal. They didn't seek our advice or counsel on it. It is pretty \nmuch the outline of the budget as requested by the President.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about whether the President \ninherited a terrible situation. I think he did, from a fiscal \nstandpoint. He has had difficult issues to confront relative to \nstabilizing our financial industry and trying to get the economy going \nand addressing the issues which most Americans are concerned about, \nwhich is their jobs, the value of their homes, the ability to pay their \nbills, and to send their kids to college.\n  What the President inherited is important, but what he is bequeathing \nto the next generation is even more important. This budget he proposed \nis an outline of where he sees the Government going and where he sees \nthis Nation going.\n  Regrettably, the budget as proposed by the President, which has been \nworked on here by the Senate Democrats and the House Democrats, puts \nforward a picture that basically almost guarantees our children will be \ninheriting a nation with a government that is nonsustainable. The \nPresident's budget proposed a trillion dollars of deficit, on average, \nfor the next 10 years. That is a number that is hard to comprehend. But \nto try to put it into perspective, the effect of that number is that \nthe debt of the United States will double in 5 years and triple in 10 \nyears. If you want to put it in another perspective, take all the debt \ncreated since the founding of our Nation, from George Washington \nthrough George W. Bush--all that debt that has been added to the backs \nof the Nation's people--and President Obama's budget doubles that debt \nin 4 years, which is a staggering event.\n  The implications are pretty dramatic for the next generation. The \npublic debt of the United States will go to 80 percent of GDP fairly \nquickly under this proposal. The historic public debt of this country \nhas been 40 percent of GDP. That means the amount of debt out there in \nrelation to the size of the economy will have doubled.\n  That has dramatic ramifications. For example, at that level of public \ndebt through the economic activity in our country, we as a nation would \nnot be allowed to enter the European Union because we wouldn't meet \ntheir standard for fiscal responsibility. Countries such as Latvia, \nLithuania, and Ukraine, which all have very serious issues, might \nqualify for the European Union, but we would not because of the fact \nthat our debt was so high as a percentage of our economy. It means our \npeople, who have to pay that debt, will have to pay an inordinate \namount of taxes in one of two ways to pay that debt off. Either they \nwill have to pay more taxes because the Federal Government will inflate \nthe money supply in order to pay off this debt, which is the worst tax \nthere is--inflation--because it takes away the savings of all of the \nAmerican people or you will have to significantly increase taxes on \nevery American, not just the high-income Americans, as was represented \nby this President that he wants to do, and the Democratic Congress and \nSenate said they want to do; all taxes will have to go up \nastronomically in order to pay for the debt.\n  What is driving this massive expansion of debt our children and we \nare going to have to pay as a result of this budget that is proposed by \nthe President? Well, it is spending. Very simply, it is spending. The \nPresident proposed, and the Democratic Congress will bring forward, a \nbudget that significantly increases the spending of the Federal \nGovernment. Historically, the spending\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nof the Government has been about 20 percent of the GDP. Under this \nbudget, it goes to 22 percent, 23 percent, 24 percent, 25 percent--it \ngets up to levels that have never been seen, except during the time of \nWorld War II. They are unsustainable levels of spending. It is being \ndone with a pure purpose, which is, I guess, to Europeanize the \nAmerican economy and the American Government, to basically have the \nGovernment become the largest and most significant player in our \neconomy and to dominate all aspects of our economy because of its size.\n  The President is very forthright about this. He says he believes that \nby growing the Government significantly, he can create more prosperity. \nThose on our side of the aisle disagree with that. We believe a \ngovernment has to be affordable for a nation to have prosperity. We \nalso think prosperity doesn't come from the Government, it comes from \nindividuals who are willing to take risks and go out and create jobs by \ntaking those risks. This is a fundamental disagreement. This budget \nlays that out precisely.\n  We are going to hear from the other side of the aisle the most \ndisingenuous discussions about how they have been much more responsible \non the budget, while they claim they are doing exactly what the \nPresident is doing in his budget. The reason they make that statement \nis because they cook the books. At least the President was forthright \nand he came forward with a budget--except in the area of defense--which \nset forth in a reasonably honest way what the costs to the Government \nwere going to be and, as a result, it reflected the fact that because \nof his huge commitment in new spending programs, the cost of Government \nwas going to be extraordinary, and the amount of debt that was going to \nbe added to the books of the Government and the backs of the American \npeople was going to be untenable and unsustainable.\n  The other side of the aisle, I guess because they recognize they are \ngoing to be up for election before the President, doesn't want to have \nthose numbers out there. So they have gone back and played a lot of \ngames with the numbers the President sent up. For example, the \nPresident honestly represented the fact that we are not going to get \nrevenues from the alternative minimum tax, because every year we \nbasically limit the amount of applicability of the AMT. But the \nbaseline reflects a huge income of the AMT. It says 20 million people \nare going to pay it. But we are not going to allow that to happen, \nbecause it wasn't designed to affect 20 million people but the top \nincome producers in this country--probably less than a million people. \nSo every year we basically change the law so that for that year the AMT \ndoesn't apply. The President was forthright and said I know that will \nhappen and I am not going to account for this revenue that never comes \nin. So he scored the AMT fairly. The other side of the aisle games that \nnumber.\n  In the area of the doctors' fix, every year we know we are going to \nhave to pay doctors a reasonable amount for their services under \nMedicare. Unfortunately, we have a law in place that keeps cutting that \namount. This year it will be cut almost 20 percent over the baseline, \nin an arbitrary and foolish way. We should fix this permanently, but we \ndon't have the courage to do it because of the effects on the budget. \nSo we have used all sorts of gimmicks over the years--and everybody \nadmits to this--so that we didn't have to fix that over a long period \nof time and correct that problem, even though we know every year we are \ngoing to adjust and make that payment to doctors.\n  Well, the President was forthright and he said, listen, that is not \nfair, honest accounting. We are going to tell you exactly what the \ndoctors' fix costs, and we are going to account for it in the budget.\n  What does the other side of the aisle do? They hide that number \nagain. They go back to the old rules. Those two items alone represent \n$100 billion of annual spending, which is being put under the rug. The \nPresident was honest enough to talk about it, but this Democratic \nCongress and Senate, in an attempt to obfuscate the issue for the \nAmerican people, because they don't want to tell the people how much \nmoney they are spending, they stick that $100 billion under the rug.\n  Then there is the health care reform. At least the President--even \nthough I disagree with some of his philosophies, and I hope we can have \na bipartisan approach, and I support the Wyden-Bennett bill floating \naround this Congress--at least the President, in proposing his health \ncare reform, said he was going to account for paying for half of it--\n$600 billion he put into the budget to pay for his health care reform. \nHe acknowledges that is about half the cost of a $1.2 trillion program \nover the time of his budget.\n  What does the other side of the aisle do when they bring this budget \nforward? They don't account for any of it--none of it. It disappears \noff the books. Not only is the $1.2 trillion not there, the $600 \nbillion is not there. How outrageous, to claim they are going to bring \nthe deficit down to 3 percent of GDP in 2014, when they have basically \nhidden under the rug the AMT cost, the doctors' fix cost, and the most \nsignificant fiscal issue, health care reform. It is so disingenuous, it \nis almost unbelievable. But they are going to do that, and I suspect it \nwon't be covered in any depth. To claim they are going to cut the \ndeficit in half, which is a classic example of language over substance, \nwill be the mantra of the day. They say they are going to cut the \ndeficit in half. They claim they are going to cut it by 75 percent, \nbecause they are going to take a $1.8 trillion deficit and allegedly \ncut it to $550 billion in 4 years.\n  Let me point out to you that $550 billion is too big. It is like \nsaying we are going to take six steps backward and two steps forward \nand claim we are moving in the right direction. Of course they are not. \nEqually important, the $500 billion number is a total fraud. It is a \nfraud on the American people brought forward in this budget.\n  Please, please, please do not subject the American people to this \nsort of disingenuousness. At least have the integrity the President had \nwhen he presented the budget of accounting for what we know are real \nnumbers, such as AMT, the doctors fix, and the health care reform \ninitiative proposed by the President and supported by the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  That is the substantive problem with this budget; that it creates all \nthis debt, all this spending. It takes the Government of the United \nStates and lurches it to the left. It Europeanizes our Nation, for all \nintents and purposes, and passes on to our kids a government that is \nnot sustainable.\n  It is ironic that we hear from the Budget chairmen, both in the \nSenate and the House, that the outyear numbers are unsustainable under \nthis budget. The outyears are so unsustainable under their budget that \nthey eliminated the last 5 years of the budget. The President sent up a \n10-year budget to have some integrity around here. The other side of \nthe aisle said: My goodness, we can't tell the American people what is \ngoing to happen to them over the second 5 years. It is bad enough what \nwe are going to do to them in the first 5 years. We are going to \neliminate the second 5 years and do a 5-year budget and not tell them \nabout the second 5 years.\n  Both Democratic chairmen of both committees in the House and Senate \nhave said we are on an unsustainable path. What do they do about the \nunsustainable path? They hide the numbers under the table, they do not \nadmit to the spending, they allow the spending to go up radically, and \nthere is absolutely zero--zero--savings on the spending side of the \nledger, especially in the entitlement accounts which is at the core of \nwhat is driving the outyear problem.\n  Ironically, a couple of the ideas the President sent up to save money \nwere dropped, simply dropped. For example, he proposed some savings in \nthe agriculture accounts which were very reasonable. They disappeared. \nHe proposed some savings in the Medicare accounts which were very \nreasonable. They disappeared. But that is a minor story compared to the \ntrillions of dollars of new debt that is going to be put on the backs \nof our children.\n  By the time this budget has run its course, it will have added well \nover $9 trillion, under the President's calculations, to the debt of \nthe United States. Who is going to pay that? Who is going to pay that? \nFirst off, who is going to lend us the money? At some point, the \ncountries that are lending us this\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\nmoney, the international community that looks to us and lends us money \nso we can run these massive deficits, is going to say: Why? Hold it. We \ndon't know if they can pay off all this debt. At that point, the value \nof the dollar is at risk. At that point, the ability of us to sell debt \nis at risk. At that point, our Nation starts a downward fiscal spiral \nwhich will be extraordinarily disruptive and dangerous for us as a \nnation. This is not a good path to be on.\n  There are also a couple technical points that should be pointed out \nbecause they are procedural points that have massive policy \nimplications. First, of course, is this really pyrrhic claim they are \nusing pay-go as a disciplining mechanism. How many times have we heard \nthat pay-go is going to be used to discipline spending. My goodness, in \nthe last Congress, which was dominated by the Democratic Party, if I \nrecall correctly, the House and Senate both being democratically led, \npay-go, which was supposed to discipline the fiscal process around \nhere, was waived almost 20 times--either waived, avoided or \ncircumvented almost 20 times. Those exercises cost us almost $400 \nbillion in spending that should have been offset. So pay-go became \n``Swiss cheese-go.'' It had no value and was a worthless purpose, other \nthan to make a political speech and claim on the stump: Oh, I am for \nfiscal discipline. I am for pay-go. Of course, when you voted in the \nSenate over the last 2 years, if you made that speech and up for \nreelection and you were a Democrat, you basically waived pay-go, \ncircumvented pay-go or avoided pay-go to the tune of $400 billion in \nnew spending.\n  Now we have the House Blue Dogs saying: We are going to get tough \npay-go language back in place. I have to explain something to the House \nBlue Dogs: They didn't get it. They didn't give it to you. The budget \nthat is going to come to the floor of this Senate is going to have \nstructural changes which allow pay-go to be avoided for up to $2.5 \ntrillion, at least that is what the House budget had in it, and the \nSenate budget was pretty close. Mr. President, $2.5 trillion will \ncircumvent pay-go.\n  The most egregious exercise will be in the health care area, where \nthey have formally ended pay-go's applicability during the first 5-year \nwindow. They basically say openly: We are not going to comply with pay-\ngo on health care.\n  Health care is going to be the single biggest fiscal event this \nCongress has probably taken up in the last 20 years, maybe 30 years, \nmaybe 40 years, maybe ever. Restructuring the health care of this \ncountry is a pretty doggone big exercise since it represents 17 percent \nof our economy. To say they are not going to apply pay-go to that \nexercise, to that effort, to that undertaking is to drive a hole \nthrough the pay-go concept that is so big it becomes not ``Swiss \ncheese-go'' but a great big, huge onion ring; there is basically \nnothing left but air in pay-go.\n  When the Blue Dogs on the other side of the aisle start marching \naround: We have pay-go, we have pay-go, somebody ought to point out to \nthem that their banner does not have a flag on it. Pay-go was taken \ndown under health care rules and under the rest of this bill. It may \nmake for a good press release, but it sure as heck doesn't have any \nsubstance to it.\n  The second procedural event, of course, is this issue of \nreconciliation, which is a major issue for us on our side of the aisle, \nand it should be for the Senate. When the Senate was constructed, when \nour constitutional form of Government was put together, the idea was to \nhave balance so we had a House of Representatives where things might \nhappen quickly, but when it got to the Senate, there would be an \nairing, a hearing, consideration, and there would be due diligence on \nissues. That is why it was George Washington who described the House as \nthe cup with the hot coffee in it and the Senate as the saucer into \nwhich the hot coffee is poured so it can be cooled down a little bit.\n  The Senate is institutionally and constitutionally structured to be \nthe place where we have debate, we have discussion, and we have \namendments. That is the whole concept behind the Senate, especially on \nissues of massive public policy implications, and there is probably \nnothing we are going to take up on the domestic side of the ledger that \nhas a bigger public policy implication than the rewriting of our entire \nhealth care system.\n  Yet what is being proposed is that this rewrite of the entire health \ncare system be done in a way that allows the Senate only 20 hours of \ndebate, with essentially no amendments and with an up-or-down vote, yes \nor no, on something that affects 17 percent of the gross national \nproduct of this country, that affects every American in every walk of \nlife in a very significant way, and that is how is their health care \nsystem delivered.\n  Why wouldn't we want to have a full and clear, hopefully, and \nsignificant discussion of what we are doing to the American public and \nwhat the policy implications of health care reform are on the floor of \nthe Senate? If we are going to get a good piece of legislation, we are \ngoing to have to have bipartisanship and going to have to have the \nAmerican people believe it is fair. You cannot pass something as \nsignificant as health care and do it in a crammed-down manner, in a \nmanner where it is totally partisan. Yet reconciliation is structured \nto accomplish just that.\n  You have to have every stakeholder at the table. Granted, we are not \ngoing to win all our points, but we may have some points that are \nconstructive to the debate. Let us at least be at the table and make \nthose points on the floor of the Senate through the amendment process. \nDon't shut this Senate down and don't make us into the House of \nRepresentatives and don't essentially convert our constitutional form \nof Government, which is checks and balances, into a parliamentary form \nof Government, where there are essentially no checks and balances on \nthe majority once it has an overwhelming position. That is what is \nbeing proposed in the bill when it pushes reconciliation as an option \nfor the majority party in the area of health care reform. It is \nunfortunate.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls during debate on the \nSebelius nomination be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Merkley  pertaining to the introduction of S. 911 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the order of business? Are we in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the Sebelius \nnomination.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have a statement that will take about \n15 minutes on Governor Sebelius.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nnomination of Governor Kathleen Sebelius to serve as our next Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services. I will not be able to \nsupport Governor Sebelius's nomination to this position and will be \nvoting no. I wish to take a few minutes to explain my opposition to her \nconfirmation.\n  First, I have always been pro life. I believe that life begins at \nconception and that every life is precious. I believe that we, as a \nsociety, have a responsibility to protect those who cannot protect \nthemselves and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. That\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nis why I am so strongly opposed to abortion. Abortion kills the most \nfragile, most vulnerable, and most needy among us. These children \ncannot defend themselves, so they desperately need us to protect them.\n  To me, abortion is about whether defenseless babies have a right to \nlive. The answer, clearly, is, yes, they do. I don't understand how \npeople can come away with any other conclusion than that one. \nUnfortunately, too many people do. According to the National Right to \nLife, there have been more than 49 million abortions in the United \nStates since 1973, with about 1.2 million in 2005, the year they have \nthe most recent data. These numbers are staggering and saddening.\n  I cannot support the nomination of someone to be the leader of our \nHealth and Human Services Department who does not respect human life. \nThat is why I will be voting against Governor Sebelius. Her record as \nGovernor of Kansas on abortion issues is dismal. She has vetoed \nmultiple pieces of legislation passed by the Kansas legislature dealing \nwith abortion, including bills in 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008. In fact, \nlast week she vetoed yet another bill.\n  These were commonsense bills that I think most Americans could agree \nwith, such as creating standards for abortion clinics that require \nclean and sterilized rooms and equipment, counseling before and after \nabortion, and medical screening for patients. Several of the bills \ndealt with changes to the Kansas late-term abortion laws, including one \nvetoed last week. That bill required certain information to be reported \nto the State when doctors perform late-term abortions, including the \nspecific medical reason the abortion was performed. Another bill would \nhave given women about to undergo an abortion the opportunity to listen \nto the baby's heartbeat and see an ultrasound of their child, along \nwith several other provisions. Governor Sebelius vetoed all of these \nbills.\n  I am also greatly concerned about Governor Sebelius's relationship \nwith Dr. George Tiller, an abortion doctor from Wichita, who \nspecializes in late-term abortion. On Dr. Tiller's Web site he says \nthat his clinic has ``more experience in late-term abortion services \nover 24 weeks than anyone else practicing in the Western Hemisphere, \nEurope, or Australia.'' This is not something to be proud of.\n  I know that pro-abortion supporters like to make the argument that \nunborn babies are a clump of cells and not yet a human being. They \ncouldn't be more wrong. These unborn babies are developing, growing, \ncan feel pain, and certainly have the will to live. Let me briefly give \na description of the development milestones that babies reach as they \ngrow to 24 weeks. This is according to the Mayo Clinic's Web site--the \nMayo Clinic: At 5 weeks, the heart begins to beat. At 8 weeks, eyelids \nare forming, along with the ears, upper nose, fingers, lips, and toes. \nAt 9 weeks, the baby begins to move. At 12 weeks, fingernails and \ntoenails are forming. At 16 weeks, the baby's eyes are sensitive to \nlight. At 18 weeks, the ears start working and the baby can be even \nstartled by loud noises. At 19 weeks, the kidneys are working. At 20 \nweeks, most mothers can feel their babies move. At 22 weeks, taste buds \nare forming. At 23 weeks, the baby begins to practice breathing so she \nwill be ready once she is born. At 24 weeks, the baby weighs about a \npound and a half, has footprints, and fingerprints, and starts to have \nregular waking and sleep cycles.\n  The Web site says that babies formed at 24 weeks have a 50 percent \nchance of survival. And this is where Dr. Tiller steps in and aborts \nthe baby. How can you hear these development milestones and believe \nthese babies are expendable; that these babies' lives are less \nimportant than someone else or that they simply can be killed and \nthrown away?\n  Think of the difference between two babies at 24 weeks--one is \nwanted, one is not. For the child born early, whose parents love and \nwant her, she would be rushed to a neonatal intensive care unit after \ndelivery, where she would be given round-the-clock intensive medical \ncare until she was big and strong enough to go home. Every day in this \ncountry, premature babies cling to life and fight for survival. I think \nmost of the parents of premature babies would tell you that their \nchild's will to live is courageous and inspiring.\n  For the poor babies who have parents who choose to abort them, their \nlife is about to end. According to Planned Parenthood, a procedure \ncalled dilation and evacuation--or D and E--is generally performed in \npregnancies over 16 weeks. Let me read how the National Right to Life \norganization describes this procedure:\n\n       Forceps with sharp metal jaws are used to grasp parts of \n     the developing baby, which are then twisted and torn away. \n     This continues until the entire baby is removed from the \n     womb. Because the baby's skull has often hardened to bone by \n     this time, the skull must sometimes be compressed or crushed \n     to facilitate removal.\n\n  That is disgusting, and anyone who tries to justify it should be \nashamed. Abortion and the callous disregard for human life in this \ncountry is a real tragedy. George Tiller's work greatly concerns me. \nGovernor Sebelius's ties to George Tiller greatly concern me. The late-\nterm abortion doctor has donated tens of thousands of dollars to \nGovernor Sebelius, and she has even honored him at the Governor's \nmansion in Kansas.\n  Governor Sebelius hasn't always been upfront about their relationship \nas well. In answering questions before the Finance Committee, Governor \nSebelius originally said that Tiller had donated about $12,000 to her. \nA few days later, she had to go back to revise that amount because \nsomewhere an additional $23,000 in donations from the abortion doctor \nhad been overlooked and not accounted for. While she said this was an \ninadvertent omission, it seems to me that you would remember that sum \nof money from one of your most controversial donors.\n  I certainly realize that President Obama would not nominate someone \nto be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services who is \npro life. However, Governor Sebelius's record on right-to-life issues \nalong with her ties to the late-term abortion Dr. Tiller cannot be \noverlooked. The leader of the Department of Health and Human Services \nshould be balanced and reasonable. There is nothing in Governor \nSebelius's record that makes me think she is either when it comes to \nprotecting the life of the unborn.\n  The second major reason I am opposing this nomination is that I don't \nbelieve Governor Sebelius has the experience to be Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. HHS is an enormous \nbureaucracy, responsible for everything from the Medicare Program to \nthe National Institutes of Health, to the Food and Drug Administration. \nThe Department has 11 operating divisions, over 64,000 employees, and a \nbudget of $707 billion. According to HHS's Web site, it allocates more \ngrant dollars than all of the other agencies combined. This is a \ntremendous responsibility, and the Department needs someone with hands-\non experience.\n\n  As Governor of Kansas, she appointed someone to run their health and \nhuman services department and was not directly responsible for the day-\nto-day operation. As Congress considers major health care reform \nlegislation this year, we need someone with extensive experience in \nsetting health policy for the entire country.\n  I fundamentally disagree with Governor Sebelius on life issues, and I \ndo not believe she has the experience to lead such a large department. \nI will be voting no on her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nnomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be Secretary of HHS. I do so \nenthusiastically. I do so as a personal friend of Kathleen's. I do so \nas a fellow public servant who has observed her considerable public \nservice to her State of Kansas and to the people of this country.\n  A dozen years ago--a little more; it was actually about 14 years \nago--she was elected, unusually, as a Democrat in Republican Kansas, to \na statewide office known as insurance commissioner. It is a little-\nknown and thankless job but one that has traditionally been under the \nthumb of the insurance industry. She came out of the Kansas \nLegislature, so she had a good schooling in the art of political craft. \nIndeed, that started long before she ever entered the Kansas \nLegislature because her dad was the Governor of Ohio. So it\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nis in her genes. Her father-in-law was the longtime Republican \nCongressman from Kansas. In that very Republican State, they elected a \nDemocrat as the insurance commissioner. It was not a close election, \nbut it was one in which, once she was installed as insurance \ncommissioner, she started showing people who was boss. The elected \nrepresentative of the people of Kansas was going to administer the laws \nwith regard to the protection of consumers, which is the purpose of \nhaving an insurance advocate for the people.\n  Only a few States continue to elect their insurance commissioner. It \nis known as the office of the revolving door since most of the \ninsurance commissioners are appointed. The revolving door starts with \nthe insurance industry having a representative who is appointed by the \nappointing authority, usually the Governor, because someone who is \nknowledgable about insurance has to be insurance commissioner. But, \nindeed, the door continues to revolve, and the average time of service \nfor an appointed insurance commissioner is less than 1 year. As a \nresult, as you watch the door revolve, they come in from the insurance \nindustry, become the top regulator of the insurance industry, and on \nthe average, in less than a year, the door revolves and they are out \nthe door and they are back in the very industry from whence they came. \nThat is not the smartest way to have an insurance regulator.\n  Kathleen Sebelius defied that model. As the elected insurance \ncommissioner of Kansas, she stood up for consumer rights and she \ncracked the whip to get the insurance companies to offer this product \nthat has now become a necessity, not a luxury. Why? You can't drive a \ncar without insurance. You can't own a home, if you have a mortgage, \nwithout insurance. You better have some life insurance if you are \nplanning for your family.\n  By the way, we have not even talked about health insurance. A huge \npercentage, well over a majority of the people in this country, get \ntheir health insurance through their employer. As we approach the issue \nof health care reform, what to do about insurance is going to be front \nand center, and Governor Sebelius is uniquely qualified to address this \nissue. We have 47 million people in this country who do not have health \ninsurance, but they get health care. Where do they get health care? \nThey get it from the most expensive place, which is the emergency room, \nand they get it at the most expensive time, which is when their \nsymptoms have turned into a full, raging emergency. Therefore, because \nthey did not have health insurance, they were not seeing a doctor for \npreventive care, and all of this additional cost, plus the additional \ncosts of being treated in an emergency room--guess who pays. All of us \npick up that tab. That, additionally, is plowed back into the costs we \npay for health care, in large part through the insurance premiums we \npay.\n  Governor Sebelius is someone who has been there, she has done that. \nShe knows how this insurance system operates. She knows the parameters \nin which you have to offer health insurance to people in order to make \nit work. She understands the financing behind it. She is uniquely \nqualified for this position of Secretary of HHS.\n  Since I have the privilege of being a personal friend, I have known \nher over these 14 years in our capacities as elected insurance \ncommissioners, she from Kansas and me from Florida, and then as I have \ncontinued to see her in her public service, then having gone from \ninsurance commissioner to Governor, she comes at a time when this \nNation is begging for health care reform. The President has chosen \nKathleen in this exceptionally important position to not only use her \nskills as a former regulator where she can crack the whip but to use \nher skills as a person who can bring people together, who can \nreconcile, who can build consensus--which she has honed over the years \nand I suspect honed those skills at the knee of her father as she was \ngrowing up. She honed those skills as a public servant--as a \nlegislator, as an elected statewide official, as the Governor, and now \nshe will be the right person at the right time whom this Nation needs--\na very good Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume consideration of S. \n386, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 386) to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, \n     securities fraud, financial institution fraud, and other \n     frauds related to federal assistance and relief programs, for \n     the recovery of funds lost to these frauds, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have on the Senate floor a piece of \nlegislation that has broad bipartisan support and that addresses an \nurgent national need.\n  Our country has seen a wave of white-collar fraud that has undermined \nthe financial and housing markets and shaken our entire economy.\n  In recent years, there simply haven't been enough cops on the beat in \nthe mortgage and financial markets. After 9/11, the Department of \nJustice, the FBI, and other agencies shifted their attention away from \nfinancial fraud investigations to focus on other important concerns. At \nthe same time, we saw financial deregulation, the boom in subprime and \nexotic mortgages, and the evolution of mortgage-backed securitized \ninstruments. These developments created a wealth of opportunities for \nfraudsters to rip off hard-working Americans.\n  We know now that there is a wave of fraud sweeping the country. The \nTreasury Department is receiving 5,000 mortgage fraud allegations per \nmonth. The FBI now has more than 530 open corporate fraud \ninvestigations, and FBI officials report that their fraud caseload is \ngrowing exponentially. And Americans have been stunned by recent \nrevelations of massive Ponzi schemes and the manipulation of financial \nmarkets. It is simply unacceptable for this Congress to stand idly by \nand watch these fraudsters rip off the American people. We need to act. \nAnd we have a bill on the floor of the Senate right now that would take \nstrong and effective steps to catch the perpetrators of these frauds \nand protect the taxpayers.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, sponsored by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley, is carefully crafted and widely \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  The bill makes important improvements to the criminal fraud statutes. \nThese provisions will strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat fraud \nin the mortgage and financial markets. The bill also puts more cops on \nthe beat in the financial markets. It authorizes the hiring of hundreds \nof FBI and SEC investigators to focus on mortgage and financial fraud. \nIt provides $100 million for new white-collar prosecutors in U.S. \nattorney offices, and it bolsters the resources of the Criminal, Civil \nand Tax Divisions of the Department of Justice.\n  These investments in enforcement are likely to pay off in more ways \nthan just catching criminals. They will lead to increased restitution \npayments, criminal and civil fines, and monetary recoveries for victims \nand taxpayers. The Justice Department estimates that for every dollar \nspent to prosecute fraud at the Criminal Division, more than $20 is \nordered in restitution and fines for victims and the government. So \nthis bill will pay for itself and then some.\n  The legislation also includes a key provision from a bill that \nSenator Grassley and I introduced earlier this year to update the \nFederal False Claims Act. The False Claims Act is known as Lincoln's \nLaw. It was signed by President Lincoln in 1863, and since then it has \nenabled the Federal Government and whistleblowers to work together to \nprevent waste, fraud, and abuse of Government funds. The False\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nClaims Act has been a powerful antifraud tool. Since 1986, the Federal \nGovernment and whistleblowers have recovered over $22 billion in monies \nthat were fraudulently taken from Government programs. The bill before \nus corrects several court decisions that have misinterpreted the False \nClaims Act and limited its scope. This legislation will help keep \nLincoln's Law strong for the 21st century.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the antifraud legislation we are considering. \nIt is going to pass this body by a wide margin, and it is going to help \nthe American people. But it has been held up by a small number of \nSenators from across the aisle. These Senators have delayed a vote on \nfinal passage of this bill, because they want to offer amendments that \nhave nothing to do with the bill. Why are these Senators standing in \nthe way of legislation that will fight fraud in our markets and curb \nwaste in Government programs? I can't understand it, and I don't think \nthe American people can understand it.\n  These Senators should be cosponsoring this legislation, not blocking \nit. Are these Senators aware of the mortgage rescue scams that are \ncatching more and more Americans every day? Do they know that con \nartists are out there right now promising that they can help families \nwho are facing foreclosure save their homes--all for a supposedly small \nupfront fee? Desperate homeowners are tricked into paying these con \nartists, who then skip town and leave the family worse off than before. \nAre these Senators aware of the financial scams being perpetrated on \nsenior citizens and military families? What about the investors who \nhave lost their life savings to Ponzi schemes and market manipulators? \nShouldn't we put more cops on the beat to catch these crooks? Shouldn't \nwe bolster our enforcement agencies so they can prosecute these cases \nand get restitution for the victims? I think we should.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act takes important steps to help \nlaw enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute the financial fraud \nthat has surged in recent years. It will also deter those who might \ncommit fraud in the future. This measure will help restore confidence \nin our economy and restore millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains to \nvictims and taxpayers.\n  I hope we can vote quickly on final passage of this bill. America \nneeds it, and we need to pass it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we finally come to a vote on final \npassage of the bipartisan Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, \nS. 386. It has taken longer to arrive at this point than it should \nhave, and we have had to consider too many extraneous issues that would \nhave been better suited for another debate. We nonetheless stand ready \nto make real progress. This bill is a step toward holding accountable \nthose who have caused so much damage to our economy. It should help \nprotect our economic recovery efforts from the scourge of fraud.\n  Our bill will strengthen the Federal Government's capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of financial frauds that have so \nseverely undermined our economy and hurt so many hard-working people in \nthis country. These frauds have robbed people of their savings, their \nretirement accounts, their college funds for their children, their \nequity, and costs too many their homes. These are serious matters that \nshould not be delayed. The bill will help provide the resources and \nlegal tools needed to police and deter fraud and to protect taxpayer-\nfunded economic recovery efforts now being implemented.\n  I end as I began by commending Senator Grassley, our lead cosponsor, \nfor his leadership in helping to write this legislation and to manage \nit on the floor. He has once again proven his dedication to protecting \ntaxpayer funds by deterring, investigating, and prosecuting fraud.\n  I thank our many cosponsors for their steadfast support for this \neffort. Senators Kaufman and Klobuchar have worked particularly hard to \nensure that this important fraud enforcement bill becomes law, and I \nthank them for their efforts. Senator Kaufman has spoken and written \nabout the need for fraud enforcement all year. Senator Klobuchar, a \nformer prosecutor as I am, understands how important it is to have \nsufficient resources on the ground committed to deterring and \ndiscovering these devastating crimes. We have been joined by a growing \nbipartisan group of cosponsors that now stands at 27.\n  And I thank the majority leader and our underappreciated cloakroom \nand floor staff for all that they have done to bring us to this moment. \nThe majority leader had to file for cloture to even proceed to this \nbipartisan fraud enforcement bill last week, and then had to file a \nsecond cloture petition late Thursday night when Republicans would not \nagree to a finite list of amendments to be considered in order to \ncomplete action on the bill. A matter like this should not require one \ncloture vote, let alone two. A matter like that that is designed to \nhelp law enforcement and protect the savings of Americans should be \nacted upon by the Senate without partisanship, delay, and obstruction.\n  Mortgage fraud has reached near epidemic levels in this country. \nReports of mortgage fraud are up 682 percent over the past 5 years and \nmore than 2800 percent in the past decade. And massive, new corporate \nfrauds, like the $65 billion dollar Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard \nMadoff, are being uncovered as the economy has turned worse, exposing \nmany investors to massive losses. We can now finally take action to \nbetter protect the victims of these frauds. These victims include \nhomeowners who have been fleeced by unscrupulous mortgage brokers who \npromise to help them, only to leave them unable to keep their homes and \nin even further debt than before. They include retirees who have lost \ntheir life savings in stock scams and Ponzi schemes, which have come to \nlight as the markets have fallen and corporations have collapsed. They \nalso include American taxpayers who have invested billions of dollars \nto restore our economy and who expect us to protect that investment and \nmake sure those funds are not exploited by fraud.\n  Federal law enforcement needs this legislation now to combat fraud \neffectively. In the last 3 years, the number of criminal mortgage fraud \ninvestigations opened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, has \nmore than doubled, and the FBI anticipates that number may double yet \nagain. Despite this increase, the FBI currently has fewer than 250 \nspecial agents nationwide assigned to financial fraud cases, which is \nonly a quarter of the number the Bureau had more than a decade ago at \nthe time of the savings and loan crisis. At the current levels, the FBI \ncannot even begin to investigate the more than 5000 mortgage fraud \nallegations referred by the Treasury Department each month.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress responded to the collapse \nof the federally insured savings and loan industry by passing \nlegislation similar to the bill we consider today, to hire prosecutors \nand agents. While the current financial crisis dwarfs in scale to the \nsavings and loan collapse, we are poised to once again take decisive \naction.\n  At its core, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act authorizes the \nresources necessary for the Justice Department, the FBI, and other \ninvestigative agencies to respond to this crisis. In total, the bill \nauthorizes $245 million a year over the next 2 years to hire more than \n300 Federal agents, more than 200 prosecutors, and another 200 forensic \nanalysts and support staff to rebuild our Nation's white collar fraud \nenforcement efforts. While the number of fraud cases is now \nskyrocketing, we need to remember that resources were shifted away from \nfraud investigations after 9/11. Today, the ranks of fraud \ninvestigators and prosecutors are drastically understocked, and \nthousands of fraud allegations are going unexamined each month. We need \nto restore our capacity to fight fraud in these hard economic times, \nand this bill will do that.\n  Fraud enforcement is an excellent investment for the American \ntaxpayer. According to recent data provided by the Justice Department, \nthe Government recovers more than $20 dollars for every dollar spent on \ncriminal fraud litigation. Strengthening criminal and civil fraud \nenforcement is a sound investment, and this legislation will not only \npay for itself but will bring in money for the Federal Government.\n  In addition, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act makes a number of \nstraightforward, important improvements to fraud and money laundering\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nstatutes to strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat this growing wave \nof fraud. It also strengthens one of the most potent civil tools we \nhave for rooting out fraud in Government--the False Claims Act. The \nFederal Government has recovered more than $22 billion using the False \nClaims Act since it was modernized through the work of Senator Grassley \nin 1986, but this bill will make the statute still more effective.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act has broad bipartisan support, \nas well as the strong backing of the Justice Department and the Obama \nadministration. As explained in the Statement of Administration Policy: \n``The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386. Its \nprovisions would provide Federal investigators and prosecutors with \nsignificant new criminal and civil tools and resources that would \nassist in holding accountable those who have committed financial \nfraud.''\n  Strengthening fraud enforcement is a key priority for President \nObama. During the campaign, President Obama promised to ``crack down on \nmortgage fraud professionals found guilty of fraud by increasing \nenforcement and creating new criminal penalties.'' And the President \nmade good on this promise in his budget to Congress by calling for \nadditional FBI agents ``to investigate mortgage fraud and white collar \ncrime,'' as well as hiring more Federal prosecutors and civil attorneys \n``to protect investors, the market, and the Federal Government's \ninvestment of resources in the financial crisis, and the American \npublic.'' The initial Senate-passed recovery package included \nadditional money for the FBI for this purpose, but it was cut during \nthe negotiations that led to its passage. This bill, the bipartisan \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, is our chance to authorize the \nnecessary additional resources to detect, fight, and deter fraud that \nrobs the American people and American taxpayers of their funds.\n  This is and has been bipartisan legislation. Our cosponsors come from \nacross the political spectrum--Democrats, Republicans, and an \nIndependent. What we share is a commitment to fight fraud and the \nhorrible costs it is imposing on hard-working Americans. I believe that \nour efforts are supported by most Americans. No one should want to see \ntaxpayer money intended to fund economic recovery efforts diverted by \nfraud. No one should want to see those who engaged in mortgage fraud \nescape accountability. We need to pass this bill and give law \nenforcement the resources and tools they desperately need.\n  During these first months of the year, the Judiciary Committee has \nconcentrated on what we can do legislatively to assist in the economic \nrecovery. Already we have considered and reported this fraud \nenforcement bill, the patent reform bill, and worked to ensure that law \nenforcement assistance was included in the economic recovery \nlegislation.\n  The recovery efforts are generating signs of economic progress. That \nis good. That is necessary. But that is not enough. We need to make \nsure that we are spending our public resources wisely and that they are \nnot being dissipated by fraud. We need to ensure that those responsible \nfor the downturn through fraudulent acts in financial markets and the \nhousing market are held to account. That is why we need to enact the \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act.\n  Two decades ago we responded during the savings and loan crisis by \nhiring more agents, analysts, and prosecutors and allocating the \nresources needed to catch those who took advantage to profit through \nfraud. We need to do so again.\n  The bill has also received the support of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National \nAssociation of Assistant United States Attorneys, the Association of \nCertified Tax Examiners, and Taxpayers Against Fraud. It was strongly \nendorsed by an editorial in The New York Times on April 18, 2009.\n  I thank Senators for joining with us to take decisive action to \nprotect American families and our economy from fraud by passing this \ncommonsense bill now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act of 2009, and today I vote for its enactment into law. \nIn these difficult economic times, this bill is needed to strengthen \nthe Federal Government's ability to combat mortgage, securities, and \nother types of financial fraud.\n  This act would put more fraud investigators, regulators, and \nprosecutors on the beat. It would authorize increased funding to the \nDepartment of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Postal Service, the HUD \ninspector general, and the Secret Service. It would also ensure that \nthe public will be able to see the results of these investments by \nrequiring the agencies to submit a joint report to Congress on amounts \nspent on fraud investigations, as well as amounts recovered.\n  This act would also make clear that Federal mortgage fraud laws cover \nmortgage brokers and their agents--some of whom have wreaked a terrible \ntoll in my State of Michigan and the country. Their misconduct has \nincluded misrepresenting mortgage terms to borrowers, convincing \nfamilies to refinance their homes with mortgages that would leave them \nworse off financially, reaping hidden fees, and even obtaining \nfraudulent mortgages and stealing the funds. It is long past time to \nclarify and strengthen the laws that punish such wrongdoing.\n  The act would strengthen taxpayer protections by ensuring that moneys \nexpended through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP, are \nprotected by the Federal fraud statute. In addition, it would expand \nsecurities antifraud provisions to cover fraud involving options and \nfutures contracts for commodities.\n  The act would strengthen our antimoney laundering regime. The current \nmoney laundering statute outlaws financial transactions using the \nproceeds from certain listed unlawful activities. This act would add \ntax evasion to that list. The threat of criminal liability for money \nlaundering is a powerful tool for prosecutors to use in their battles \nwith those who dodge their tax obligations.\n  Additionally, recent court decisions have misdefined the term \n``proceeds'' from the money laundering statute to mean only the net \nreceipts from unlawful activities. By defining that term so narrowly, \nthese court decisions have reduced the efficacy of the statute: \npreventing prosecutions for numerous crimes. This act will fix these \ndecisions and explicitly define ``proceeds'' to include not only net \nbut gross receipts from unlawful activities. This small modification \nwill restore the money laundering statute to its rightful place as a \ncritical tool in the battles against fraud and illicit activity.\n  These provisions are useful additions to Federal antimoney laundering \nstatutes, but we should not stop here. We should also make sure that \nour antimoney laundering laws apply to all of the entities that may be \ninvolved in money laundering. I look forward to working with the Senate \nto update our antimoney laundering requirements, and continue the \nefforts to stop fraud, illicit activity, and tax evasion.\n  This act will make an important contribution to ongoing efforts to \nroot out fraud--against individuals and against our Government. It is \nan important part of the effort to help put our country back on solid \neconomic footing, and I commend the bill sponsors for their work on \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\n       (1) The United States is currently facing an unprecedented \n     economic crisis, with massive losses of jobs in the United \n     States and an alarming contraction of economic activity in \n     the United States.\n       (2) The United States Government has pledged, committed, or \n     loaned more than $9,000,000,000,000 as of February 2009 in an \n     attempt to mitigate and resolve the economic crisis and \n     trillions of dollars more may well be necessary before the \n     crisis is over.\n       (3) The economic crisis reaches into, and has impacted, \n     almost every aspect of the United States economy and \n     significant parts of the international economy.\n       (4) Any thorough and complete study and investigation of \n     this complex and far-reaching economic crisis will require \n     sustained and singular focus for many months.\n       (5) A study and investigation of this size and scope \n     implicates the jurisdiction of several Standing Committees of \n     the Senate and, if it is to be done correctly and timely, \n     will require a degree of undivided attention and resources \n     beyond the capacity of the Standing Committees of the Senate, \n     which are already over-burdened.\n       (6) Adding such a significant study and investigation to \n     the duties of the existing Standing Committees of the Senate \n     would make it difficult for such committees to get their \n     regular required work accomplished, particularly when so much \n     attention and so many resources are appropriately devoted to \n     responding to the ongoing economic crisis.\n       (7) Dozens of important investigations have been conducted \n     with the creation of a select committee of the Senate for a \n     specific purpose and a set time.\n       (8) The American public has a right to get straight answers \n     on how this economic crisis developed and what steps should \n     be taken to make sure that nothing like it happens again.\n\n     SEC. 202. SELECT COMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATION OF THE ECONOMIC \n                   CRISIS.\n\n       There is established a select committee of the Senate to be \n     known as the Select Committee on Investigation of the \n     Economic Crisis (hereafter in this title referred to as the \n     ``Select Committee'').\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, many of my colleagues and countless \nAmericans across the country recognize today as Equal Pay Day, a solemn \nreminder of the enduring wage gap that separates women from men. We \nmark this inequity on a day in late April because it has taken many \nwomen from January 2008 until now to earn what their male counterparts \nbrought home in 2008 alone. This is simply not acceptable. At a time of \nwidespread economic uncertainty, the disparity is more troubling than \never. We can and must do better.\n  In 1963, this body passed the Equal Pay Act which was signed into law \nand represented a triumph for America's workforce. That legislation \nlaid the groundwork for significant progress. It established a set of \nprinciples that declared the United States of America as a nation that \ndoes not discriminate based on gender. It was an important first step. \nNearly 50 years have passed since that day.\n  It is clear that we have more work to do.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act, which I am proud to cosponsor, would \nupdate the original Equal Pay Act and bring the law in line with our \nNation's other important civil rights laws. The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics tells us that in 2007, women with full-time employment \nearned roughly 78 cents for every dollar men earned. This represents \nmodest progress compared to 2006, when the ratio stood at slightly less \nthan 77 cents on the dollar. Sadly, women of color earn significantly \nless, even when they have the same qualifications as men they work \nalongside. Over the course of a 40-year career, women can lose as much \nas $1 million to the gender age gap. Nationwide that means roughly $200 \nbillion of lost income every single year. With families across America \ntightening their belts and working harder than ever to make ends meet, \nit would be a serious failure on the part of this Congress to ignore \nthis call to action.\n  With this in mind, we must move swiftly to pass the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. This comprehensive bill would encourage employers to follow the \nlaw by creating substantial incentives and strengthening penalties for \nequal pay violations, aligning it more closely with civil rights \nlegislation. It would close loopholes. It would prohibit employer \nretaliation, improve Federal outreach, and strengthen enforcement \nefforts. The bill would also draw on a measure already enacted in the \ngreat State of Illinois to fix the established requirement clarifying \nreasonable points of comparison between employees to determine their \nfair wages. All of this, together with increased training, education, \nand research, means the Paycheck Fairness Act would invigorate the \nlandmark equal pay legislation of the 1960s and provide much needed \nupdates for the 21st century.\n\n  In all of my years of public life, I have had the privilege of \nwitnessing firsthand the progress our Nation has made over the past \nhalf century. The stubborn barriers of race and gender known to my \nparents' generation have been shattered. Even in my own lifetime, I \nhave seen changes few could have imagined. But for all the progress we \nhave made, there is still a very long way to go. It is this slow, \nsteady march toward our highest aspirations--the active progress of \nperfecting our Union--that defines the shared destiny of all Americans: \nBlack and White, male and female, from all walks of life, and every \ncorner of the globe.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act represents a concrete step in closing the \ngender wage gap and another powerful stride in the march to equality. \nIt is a measure that stands for common sense, good governance, and \nequal opportunity. I am proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act, \nand I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting women in the \nworkforce.\n  It is my hope we will soon commemorate Equal Pay Day not as a grim \nreminder of the gender pay gap but as a day we took decisive action to \nstop discrimination in its tracks. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort and to adopt the Paycheck Fairness Act without delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is Workers Memorial Day, which has \nbeen established for many years in this country, a day when we honor \ninjured workers. It is a day that is particularly important for the \nfamilies of some 5,000 Americans every year who are killed on the job. \nIt is hard to believe that in our country that is about 100 workers a \nweek. Some 15 workers every single day in our country are killed in a \nworkplace accident, some of them union, most of them nonunion workers, \nworkers who say goodbye to their spouse or to their children or to \ntheir mother or father and go off to work expecting just another day at \nthe job and they never come home.\n  Workers are killed in all kinds of construction accidents. That \nnumber of 5,000--some 5,500, actually, in the year 2007--does not even \ncount people who die from workplace acquired diseases, workers who \nmight be sickened by Diacetyl, the popcorn lung disease that workers in \nOhio have contracted.\n  Today, under the chairmanship of Senator Murray, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing to commemorate \nWorkers Memorial Day: Dr. Celeste Monforton, Jim Frederick, and Tammy \nMiser. Tammy Miser's brother was\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nkilled on the job, I believe, in Indiana. The three of them talked \nabout how important Workers Memorial Day is. But, more importantly, \nthey talked about how important it is that workers have better \nrepresentation than provided by the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration; that the families of victims or workers injured or \nkilled on the job don't have the input into the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration they should have. In fact, those workers \ncomplain--as did people who represented them today at this committee \nhearing--that too often during the last few years there has been a \nvoluntary kind of compliance through OSHA, and voluntary compliance \ndoesn't work to save lives and make the workplace safer. So I applaud \nwhat Secretary Solis is doing, and I applaud what Senator Murray is \ndoing.\n  I close with this: One of my first Workers Memorial Days was in \nLorraine, OH, arranged by local labor organizations. I was given this \npin I wear. It is a depiction of a canary in a bird cage. The mine \nworkers, as we know, 100 years ago used to take a canary down in the \nmines with them. If it died from lack of oxygen or toxic gas, the miner \nknew he had to get out of the mine immediately. In those days there \nwere no unions strong enough to protect them, and they had no \ngovernment that cared enough to protect them. Those days are behind us.\n  Back in 1970, the Occupational Health and Safety Agency was set up by \nthe Government. It has made a huge difference, but nonetheless 100 \npeople in this country show up for work and die on the job every single \nday on the average, and that is not counting workplace diseases.\n  So we have a lot of work to do so that by April 28 of next year we \ncan commemorate Workers Memorial Day with significantly fewer workplace \ninjuries and significantly fewer workplace deaths.\n  I yield the floor and thank the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4782-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF KATHLEEN SEBELIUS TO BE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN \n                          SERVICES--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of our nominee for \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. I have \nknown her for over 20 years. I believe she is an excellent nominee, one \nwho brings a wealth of knowledge and skill to the position at a time \nwhen we need it the most.\n  As our country and the world begins to battle a very serious outbreak \nof the swine flu, we need Governor Sebelius's leadership now. Over 100 \ndeaths have been reported in Mexico, and here in America we have \nconfirmed cases in 5 States. It is urgent we have a leader in place at \nHealth and Human Services who can respond to this threat.\n  Governor Sebelius is that person. She recognizes the need to work \nwith experts and scientists on a global scale to make key public health \ndecisions. Our citizens need and deserve to know that our Government is \ndoing everything it possibly can to protect the public and to control \nthis outbreak. We simply cannot afford to delay action in filling this \nimportant Cabinet post.\n  Also, as we embark on national health care reform, we need a leader \nwho appreciates the importance of health care security to everyday \npeople. Kathleen Sebelius is a commonsense leader who understands the \ncomplexities of our health care system. Through her experience as \nGovernor of Kansas, State insurance commissioner, and President of the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, she has a broad and \ndeep understanding of health care and will be an outstanding leader as \nwe work to fix our broken system.\n  Governor Sebelius has worked tirelessly to improve the quality and \naffordability of health care for the people of Kansas, and she will do \nthe same for all Americans.\n  As a former Governor, I understand the pressures of balancing a \nbudget and working across party lines to get things done, and I commend \nGovernor Sebelius for her track record of success. Upon taking office, \nshe faced a projected $1 billion deficit. So she implemented a top-to-\nbottom audit of State government that produced significant savings and \nefficiencies. Under her leadership, Governor Sebelius expanded health \ncare for children and worked to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. \nWorking across the aisle, she was able to reorganize State health care \nprograms to make health care more affordable by creating an independent \nState agency to control spending on health care and simplify the \nprocess of obtaining health care for her constituents.\n  Undoubtedly, Governor Sebelius brings a wealth of knowledge and \nleadership experience that will be critical in her new role as the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting nominee Kathleen \nSebelius for Secretary of Health and Human Services. She is the right \nchoice at a time when we desperately need leadership at the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nconfirmation of Governor Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  This nomination comes at a transformational moment and at a \nmonumental time--as the American people look to the Federal Government \nto achieve systemic change to ensure that all have affordable access to \nhealth care. The Senate Finance Committee, of which I am a member--\nalong with the HELP Committee--is working mightily to craft reforms to \naddress the current unacceptable reality of 70 million Americans \nlacking adequate coverage, and the increasingly unsustainable costs \nthat undermine the health security of all Americans.\n  At the same time, our Nation faces the most severe economic distress \nwe have witnessed since the Great Depression, with more than 2.6 \nmillion jobs lost last year. And it is the Department of Health and \nHuman Services that stands at the forefront of helping to mitigate the \nconsequences through our health and poverty programs. Therefore, there \ncan be no doubt of the necessity for sound executive leadership at HHS.\n  Indeed, given both its prominence and its status as one of the \nlargest departments in the Federal Government--which also oversees \nprograms upon which nearly 1 in 3 Americans rely for their health \ncare--our next Secretary of Health and Human Services should be a \ntalented public official possessing a depth and breadth of experience \nas both a skilled administrator and manager, and a professional \ncommitted to systemic health reform. In that light, as former Kansas \nState Insurance Commissioner and now as Governor--and with her \nexperience in tackling health care issues in her State--I believe \nGovernor Sebelius possesses the knowledge and skills to meet the \npressing demands facing our next leader of HHS.\n  In her work as Kansas State Insurance Commissioner she rightly \nrecognized a takeover of her State's largest\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nhealth plan as a threat to affordable coverage and fought vigorously \nand successfully to maintain its independence. As Governor, she worked \nto reduce State government spending, and resisted tax increases until \nthe Kansas State Supreme Court mandated a new school financing program. \nThat is significant as, for health reform to succeed, we must ensure \nthat every American is assured of affordable access to quality health \ncoverage--but, of equal importance, we must reform health care to \ndeliver better value and that requires a Secretary who will look first \nto cost savings and delivery reforms before we consider new revenue.\n  Moreover, HHS will be well-served by a Secretary who is committed to \nbuilding the bipartisan consensus necessary to pass the best possible \nhealth reform legislation that will have the greatest level of \ncredibility with the American people. And on that note, it is telling \nthat Governor Sebelius was the first Democrat elected Kansas State \nInsurance Commissioner in more than 100 years, that in her \ngubernatorial campaigns she has twice chosen a Republican running mate, \nand that Time Magazine ranked her in 2005 as one of the five best \nGovernors.\n  Given her history, I think the Governor understands the hazards of a \npolitically polarized environment. Indeed, today, some propose that we \ncraft the most significant health legislation in our history by \nundermining the very rules of the Senate which help ensure that this \nChamber creates broad consensus--through the application of the budget \nreconciliation process. But to craft a complex reform of health care \nwith this approach would be wholly inappropriate, as any bill it would \nproduce would lack the broad support necessary to both enact and \nsustain such a momentous initiative. We should not be drawing lines in \nthe sand up front in this debate. It is neither constructive nor \nconducive to the process, and Governor Sebelius should recognize that \nreconciliation threatens to simply increase polarization.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S4783, April 28, 2009 the Record reads: It is neither \nconstructive or conducive . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: It is neither \nconstructive nor conducive . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I also note that, while the Governor has enjoyed notable successes in \nKansas, she has also experienced disappointments in her efforts to \nexpand coverage, so she certainly comprehends the nature of the \ndifficulties ahead. Certainly, there will be an intense struggle by \nmyriad interests to protect the status quo. But the reality is clear. \nUnless we achieve an equitable, balanced approach, we cannot achieve \nsustainable health security for all.\n  That should mean a level playing field with regard to the competitive \nenvironment. We must ensure there is proper regulation and oversight--\nand at the same time, we must assure that real competition and \ninnovation are facilitated among health plans--just as it exists \nbetween health care providers, and producers of drugs and medical \ndevices. The creation of a public plan option certainly is no panacea \nto the problems of health coverage--it simply does not address the \nfundamental market reforms required. In her Finance Committee \nconfirmation hearing, I questioned Governor Sebelius on this issue, and \nshe noted that proper standards and regulation, similar to the approach \nI have taken with Senator Durbin in the Small Business Health Option \nProgram Act, SHOP, to reform the small group market, is critical to \nmaking insurance markets work. I was pleased to see her willingness to \nexamine this issue, as she noted, ``It may be at the end of the day \nthat the standards are effective enough that the competition from a \npublic plan is not a valuable asset.'' I look forward to working with \nGovernor Sebelius to develop solutions to ensure that insurance markets \ndo work effectively so we attain both the competitive pricing and \nchoices in coverage which are so valued by Americans.\n  I know that several of my colleagues will oppose Governor Sebelius' \nnomination over the issue of abortion rights in general and over \ncampaign contributions from one doctor in particular. In that vein, \nGovernor Sebelius has rightly noted that she should have consolidated \nreporting of all contributions from the doctor, his practice, and his \nfamily, both to her campaign and political action committees. \nConcurrently, it is important to note that all of these contributions \nwere disclosed. And, in my view, there is no reason to believe this \nregrettable oversight was anything but unintentional.\n  Moreover, it would be unrealistic to deny that sharp divisions exist \nin our Nation regarding reproductive rights, and I certainly respect \nthere are deeply held views on both sides. At the same time, it should \nnot be surprising that a nominee of our current President would hold \nthe views she has espoused and, in my view, that must not unduly \ndetract from a thorough and comprehensive analysis of her \nqualifications.\n  Finally, the fact is that in this time of historic challenges--and \nespecially given the concerning developments of this week, as we face \nthe threat of an influenza epidemic--HHS should have a Secretary to \nlead the Department. While various units from CDC to the Department of \nHomeland Security have worked together to coordinate efforts and \nmarshal resources to combat this outbreak, HHS leadership is vital to \nachieving optimal coordination of its agencies and effectively \ncommunicating to the public.\n  Today, Governor Sebelius comes before us as an individual who is \nhighly capable, eminently qualified, and managerially prepared to \nassume the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services. She is \nfully cognizant of the daunting challenges ahead, and she will be an \nasset to this administration. I look forward to working with her this \nyear to achieve health security for all Americans, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to join with me in supporting the Governor's confirmation.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S4783, April 28, 2009 the Record reads: . . . capable, \nimminently qualified, and . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . capable, \neminently qualified, and . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the nomination \nof Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be the next Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, HHS. I reached this decision after examining her \nqualifications and positions on matters important to the health and \nwell-being of the American public. I did not treat this decision \nlightly, only reaching it after very careful deliberation.\n  The next Secretary of HHS is expected to oversee an effort to \noverhaul our Nation's health care system in the coming year, and \nAmericans need to know that their rights as patients will be respected \nand protected by Washington. While I appreciate Governor Sebelius's \nefforts to respond to some of my concerns about different health care \nproposals that the administration supports, her responses did not offer \nthe assurances that I sought. Namely, I am concerned over her responses \nto questions posed to her by the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, HELP, Committee and Finance Committee members on the role of \npublic health plans in health reform and over the role of comparative \neffectiveness and its potential role in dictating medical practice \npatterns.\n  I believe that our Nation's health system is broken and in order to \nfix it, we must address health insurance as part of the overall reform \neffort. However, I believe that reforms should invigorate the free \nmarket system and promote competition among health insurance plans to \ncover every individual. I do not think that our Nation can afford, as \nGovernor Sebelius and President Obama suggest, a government-run health \nplan included in a National Health Insurance Exchange. Such a plan \nwould have many unfair advantages over private plans, including having \nthe weight of the Federal Government to potentially administratively \nset prices. Additionally, and more importantly, a recent Lewin Group \nstudy estimated that about 120 million Americans could lose their \nemployer-based coverage and be pushed into a government-run plan--\ncontradicting then Candidate Obama's promise that if Americans like the \ninsurance they have today, nothing will change. My fears that a public \nplan would be unfairly advantaged and be the start to a single-payer \nsystem were unfortunately not alleviated by Governor Sebelius's \nresponses.\n  I strongly oppose a European style approach to health care where care \nis effectively rationed. Americans deserve the best health care system \nin the world--and with appropriate reforms we can continue to assure \neveryone access to quality health care. I also understand that today's \nmedical research is increasingly focused on an individualized treatment \napproach for patients, and I believe that this treatment trend is \nthreatened by efforts to embrace comparative effectiveness research. \nWhile I believe that comparative effectiveness research can provide\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\npatients and doctors with the vital information necessary to make the \nright decisions in an individual's medical case, I am greatly concerned \nover how this research could be used by the Federal Government. One \nonly need look at Great Britain where centralized authorities--rather \nthan a patient's doctor--decide whether cancer patients can receive \nlifesaving care and which patients are denied access to beneficial \ntreatment options to see why so many of us are alarmed. While Governor \nSebelius said that the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 prevented \nusing comparative effectiveness research for coverage decisions, the \nNational Institutes of Health appears to be moving in that direction by \nfunding comparative effectiveness research that includes treatment cost \ncomparisons. This trend is alarming and should be of concern to all \nindividuals in vulnerable populations, such as minorities, women, or \nindividuals with multiple conditions, who could be forced into a one-\nsize-fits-all treatment model.\n  Overseeing health reform will be a herculean task and Americans need \nto be assured that they will not lose the private health coverage that \nthey want to keep or that their treatment options will have to be \napproved by a government bureaucrat. Mr. President, while I respect the \nright of President Obama to nominate Governor Sebelius to be the next \nSecretary of HHS, she has failed to provide us with those assurances, \nand I regret that I cannot support her confirmation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination \nof Governor Kathleen Sebelius as the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. As U.S. Senators, one of our most important responsibilities \nis confirming qualified, and, hopefully, superior nominees to lead our \nexecutive agencies. I am one of several Senators with strong \nreservations regarding the nomination of Governor Sebelius, and it is \nimportant to take this time to explain my opposition to this \nappointment.\n  In order to fulfill our responsibilities under the advice and consent \nclause properly, this institution has a process for vetting \nPresidential nominees. The nominee is required to complete a host of \npaperwork to the authorizing committee, in this case the Senate Finance \nCommittee, accompanied by a sworn affidavit. I was very disappointed to \nlearn that Governor Sebelius amended her paperwork to the Finance \nCommittee as a result of unpaid taxes and understated campaign \ncontributions.\n  The HELP Committee held a hearing on Governor Sebelius' nomination \ndue to the high number of health and early learning statutes and \nprograms that fall under the committee's jurisdiction. During this \nhearing, I asked Governor Sebelius her thoughts on using reconciliation \nto advance comprehensive health care reform legislation. Her response \nwas to keep all options on the table.\n  I couldn't disagree more. But unfortunately it appears that is the \ndirection health care reform will take this year. This week the Senate \nwill vote on a conference agreement for the fiscal year 2010 budget \nresolution that includes reconciliation for health care reform. Using \nbudget shortcuts--known inside the beltway as reconciliation--is the \nexact opposite of keeping all options on the table because it shuts out \nmembers of the minority party. It will also shut out many centrist \nDemocrats, who want to see health care reform based on a competitive \nprivate market, which is fully paid for. That is not a formula for \nbipartisan success. An open, transparent process with a full debate is \nthe best way to achieve a bipartisan product.\n  At both the Member and staff level, Senators on both sides of the \naisle continue to meet regularly to discuss health care reform, and \nspecifically what shape it will take. I believe that if we continue to \nnegotiate in good faith, this process can lead to a bipartisan health \nreform bill that will enjoy broad bipartisan support now and in the \nfuture.\n  Ensuring access to affordable, quality and portable health care for \nevery American is not a Republican or a Democrat issue--it is an \nAmerican issue. Our health care system is broken, and fixing it is one \narea where I hope my 80 percent rule comes into play so commonsense \nreforms can be made. People who have worked with me over time know that \nthe 80 percent rule is one of the main philosophies I follow to get \nthings done. In applying this rule, I try to focus on the 80 percent of \nthe issues the Senate generally agrees upon, while not fixating on the \nremaining 20 percent, which are divisive and can sometimes overwhelm \nthe majority of issues that we agree on.\n  The next Secretary of HHS will undoubtedly have a critical seat at \nthe table in the health care reform debate. For these reasons it is \nimportant to have a Secretary in place who supports an open, \ntransparent process without the distraction of tax issues, misreported \ncampaign contributions, and questionable affiliations.\n  I respect that the President is entitled to staff the executive \nbranch with individuals of his choosing. We may not always agree on \nevery issue. I am and will remain staunchly pro-life, and will continue \nto advocate for legislation to protect the rights of the unborn. \nHowever, if Governor Sebelius is confirmed, I will diligently work with \nher to overcome obstacles standing in the way of solutions to the \nhealth care problems facing America.\n  Prior to her hearing, I met with Governor Sebelius and we discussed \nthe unique challenges that face rural and frontier states. People \nliving in rural areas in Kansas, similar to those in Wyoming, face \ndifficulties in access to primary care physicians and preventive \nservices. Rural and frontier areas struggle to attract and retain \ndoctors and other health care providers. In the 10-steps health care \nreform bill I introduced last year, I emphasized the importance of \naccess to affordable health care for people in rural and underserved \nareas. Governor Sebelius understands the challenges in this area--and I \nhope we can work together to find solutions for this common priority.\n  In closing, while I intend to vote no on this nomination, it is my \nhope and expectation that we will put aside our differences to find \nmeaningful solutions that will make a positive difference in people's \nlives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here again to speak \nin support of the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this bill so we can pass this important \nlegislation. I cosponsored this bill because I believe that we need to \ndo something to show the American people that we are taking their tax \ndollars seriously and committed to rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse \nof Government programs.\n  The fraud enforcement tools and resources provided in this bill will \nhelp Federal agents and Federal prosecutors devote more resources to \ninvestigations into financial and mortgage frauds. The criminal fraud \nlaw updates in this bill will also help send a message to individuals \nin the future that fraud against homeowners and investors won't be \ntolerated. While it is true the criminal law provisions can't apply \nretroactively to conduct that led us the current financial and housing \ncrises, they will help prosecutors in the future and will help to deter \nfuture criminal conduct.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this bill makes critical \namendments to the Federal False Claims Act that will ensure those who \nrip off the Government can't hide behind judicial loopholes created in \nthe law. These edits to the False Claims Act are important to ensure \nthat the Justice Department and individual qui tam whistleblowers \naren't blocked by some procedural hurdle put in place by judges. When I \nauthored the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act, I couldn't \nimagine the types of decisions we have seen from courts. These courts \nhave read all sorts of new procedural and intent requirements into the \nfalse claims that were never imagined nor were they intended by \nCongress. These amendments will help restore the original intent of the \nFalse Claims Act and keep it working into the future so it can continue \nto add to the $22 billion already recovered under this powerful law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation so we can show the taxpayers we are serious about fighting \nfraud against homeowners, investors, and the Federal Government.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof Kathleen Sebelius to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I am pleased that the Senate today will finally confirm Governor \nKathleen\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nSebelius as the new Health and Human Services Secretary. Governor \nSebelius brings much needed policy and management expertise to the job \nas our Nation Faces serious public health challenges. Our immediate \nconcern is the effective coordination of our Nation's public health \nresources to combat the emerging swine flu pandemic. Sebelius and her \nteam must immediately respond to contain this very serious threat.\n  I look forward to working with her as she helps fulfill President \nObama's promise to enact comprehensive health reform. Governor Sebelius \nwill add urgency, substance, and know-how to pass complicated health \nlegislation that will benefit American families and businesses.\n  Govenor Sebelius will serve as the effective CEO of HHS and ensure \nits agencies are well run and consumer focused. She has the difficult \ntask of not only restoring the public's confidence in our Nation's \nhealth agencies, but also building the trust of HHS' committed \nworkforce. Special effort must be made to listen and learn from the \nscientists at FDA who lacked effective leadership during the previous \nadministration. Governor Sebelius' immediate leadership also will help \nguide the implementation of the economic recovery act that included \nseveral important health initiatives--particularly the development and \nadoption of interoperable health information technology standards. I am \nconfident she will meet the intent and deadlines enacted by Congress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Just a few moments ago at lunch, we were briefed by Secretary \nNapolitano and a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control \nabout the swine flu epidemic. It is a serious issue, much more serious \nin Mexico and other places than the United States, but it is being \ntaken very seriously and watched closely by those in charge of our \npublic health in America. That is why it is so important for us to fill \nthis particular spot in the President's Cabinet. It is the last spot to \nbe filled. The nominee, the Governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius, is \nan extraordinarily good choice for this post of Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  We consider so many health care issues. In fact, when the people of \nthis country are asked about the priorities they identify, their \nhighest priority is health care, as it should be. If we do not have our \nhealth, not much else matters.\n  We have tried during this Congress with this new President to do that \nwhich is important to address the public health concerns of Americans. \nWe passed a children's health bill to provide health care coverage, \ninsurance coverage for an additional 4 million kids. We passed an \neconomic recovery package that provides States with the resources they \nneed to provide health care services to millions of low-income families \nand seniors on Medicaid. We passed a new law to help working families \ncontinue to pay for health insurance even after they lose their jobs. \nWe also provided money in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act to fund \ninvestments in health information technology which can save the Nation \nbillions of dollars and avoid costly and deadly medical errors. It has \nalso provided assistance to community health centers, a resource in my \nhome State of Illinois which is exceptional. It provides health care \nfor those who have nowhere else to turn. It is some of the best care in \nAmerica. In the Omnibus appropriations bill, we provided billions of \ndollars for medical research, infant and maternal health, and other \nhealth services for those least able to afford the care they need. We \nhave a lot more to do, and that is why we need to fill this spot.\n  The current economic crisis has made health care reform more \nimportant. More than 47 million Americans, including 9 million American \nkids, do not have health insurance. Those families woke up this morning \nwith children in their houses without the peace of mind that if there \nis an accident, a diagnosis, or some illness, they would have health \ninsurance to guarantee they have quality care, good doctors and \nhospitals to turn to. A third of Americans under the age of 65 have \nexperienced a period without health insurance in the past 2 years. That \nis one out of three Americans under the age of 65. Families and small \nbusinesses work harder than ever to provide health insurance, and the \ncosts just keep going up.\n  As unemployment has reached 8.5 percent nationwide, this rate has \ntroubled us. In some areas, it is much higher. It is 9.1 percent in \nIllinois. With each 1 percent rise in the Nation's unemployment rate, \nthe number of uninsured Americans increases by 1.1 million people.\n  One of the biggest worries I found among unemployed workers in \nIllinois is health insurance. I recently visited Richland Community \nCollege in Decatur. I sat down with a number of young men and women who \nlost their jobs, many of them with children. That was the first thing \nthey brought up, whether their spouse was working and had health \ninsurance, whether there was somewhere else they could turn. A growing \nnumber of businesses are backing away from health insurance because it \nis expensive.\n  We cannot wait for the economy to improve before tackling this health \ncare issue. Too many Americans have needs that cannot wait.\n  There are no easy fixes to this, but I believe President Obama is \nright by stepping up and nominating Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee approved her nomination. \nEarlier this month, I had the opportunity to sit down with her and talk \nabout the issues firsthand. Her commitment to this issue is not just \nlipservice. She has shown an ability to overcome partisan politics in \nher home State for her people and represent the best interests we need \nin America.\n  During her two terms as Governor, Governor Sebelius and her \nadministration have been notably bipartisan. She was elected to her \nfirst term with a former Republican businessman as her running mate. \nShe ran a second time with the former State Republican chairman on her \nticket. In a State where the opposition party holds strong majorities \nin both chambers, the Democratic Governor has been able to reach across \nthe aisle to solve problems and help the people of Kansas.\n  Before being elected Governor, she was Kansas insurance commissioner \nfrom 1994 to 2002. During this time, she refused campaign contributions \nfrom insurance companies. She protected the people of her State from \nincreases in premiums by blocking the sale of Blue Cross Blue Shield to \nan out-of-State company. She helped draft a proposed national bill of \nrights for patients and served as the president of the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. This critical experience \nprepares her well in her new role on the President's Cabinet dealing \nwith health care reform, Medicare, and Medicaid. While she has also \ndealt with these broader health coverage issues, she has not lost sight \nof the role that prevention and public health must play in any health \nreform effort.\n  Through her Healthy Kansas initiative, Governor Sebelius encouraged \nKansans to increase fiscal activity, choose a healthier diet, and avoid \nusing tobacco products. As Governor, she made investments to help women \navoid unintended pregnancies, increase health services for pregnant \nwomen, and provide support services for families. These are goals that \nI think most of us can certainly agree on.\n\n  We discussed the issue of food safety, which is very important, with \nthe Food and Drug Administration under her supervision, when she is \nconfirmed in this process, and she understands there is a parade of \nconcerns, whether it is salmonella in peppers and peanut butter, \nmelamine-spiked pet food and milk products from China, E. coli in \nspinach, and the list goes on and on. We can do better. Secretary of \nAgriculture Vilsack and Kathleen Sebelius, once she is confirmed, can \nwork together to bring us the very best in food safety in America and \nto protect families who count on their Government to do the job.\n  I commend President Obama for his leadership on this issue, but with \nthese two spots filled, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nand Agriculture, then we can step forward and get something done.\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n  There is also a big question about this issue of comparative \neffectiveness, which has been raised by some on the other side in \nrelation to this nomination. Congress and President Obama are committed \nto expanding America's access to high quality health care, and that is \nwhy we have made comparative effectiveness research a high priority. \nThrough the economic recovery package, we committed over $1 billion to \nfunding research to compare the relative clinical risks and benefits of \ndifferent treatments for the same illnesses.\n  Some of my colleagues argue this research should only focus on \nclinical effectiveness, without taking into account the cost of a \ntreatment or procedure. However, I think addressing cost is a major \nconcern of everyone, not just in Government but of the American people. \nThey believe health care costs are too high and they are interested in \nany steps we can take to reduce waste and use health care dollars more \nefficiently. That effort is an important part of health care reform. We \ncan't continue to spend as much as we have on health care without \nbreaking the bank, leaving deficits for our children and basically \nbankrupting the American Treasury.\n  Part of the solution to our health care reform is reducing \nunnecessary cost and waste. Research may show that there are some \ntreatments genuinely less effective than others in comparable \npopulations. No one should be afraid of looking at the solid factual \nevidence to make these comparisons. Some of my colleagues oppose \ncomparative effectiveness research and argue that Washington \nbureaucrats shouldn't interfere with a patient's right to choose \ntreatment or substitute the Government's judgment for that of a \nphysician. I don't argue with that premise, but let's get to the bottom \nline. When a decision is made about an illness affecting you or a \nmember of your family, you want the most effective treatment. You want \nto be certain it is going to work. You want to have confidence that the \nperson providing it is making the right choice.\n  We have a right to ask whether there is a more economical choice, one \nthat can reach the same result without the same cost; whether it is the \nuse of generic drugs, for example, which have been proven to be \neffective and lower cost than many brandname drugs, or whether it is a \nprocedure that is going to have a lot more chance of success. Why are \nwe afraid to look at this information? Some on the other side are. They \nshouldn't be. This is common sense that we would ask these questions \nand come up with this information so we can make the right decision.\n  I would add that Kathleen Sebelius has proven, as the executive in a \nmajor state in America, that she understands the responsibility of \nleadership and the accountability of those in leadership. Few \nchallenges we face in America are as grave as our health care system \nand its need for reform, but it is an effort we must undertake. \nUnsustainable health care costs are the one primary threat to our \neconomic security.\n  The President said it: We are draining our Federal budget and placing \nat risk the financial well-being of America if we don't look at the \nreal cost of health care. It is time for reform, and the first real \nstep is to confirm Governor Kathleen Sebelius as our Nation's chief \nhealth official. Americans deserve someone they can trust to see this \ncommitment through. She has shown this in her service in Kansas and her \ncommitment to public life.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in supporting her \nnomination today. There are some who have raised a myriad of different \nissues that concern them; some are even beyond the reach of Kathleen \nSebelius in her role as Governor. She was given Federal Court cases and \nFederal laws to follow, and she did as she was bound to do by her oath \nof office. But we should give her a chance now at the Federal level to \nhelp lead this country into a new day of health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Governor Sebelius is a talented public \nservant. Nonetheless, I will oppose her nomination for several reasons.\n  Others have emphasized her relationship with Dr. George Tiller, so I \nwill address another matter--my concerns about the use of comparative \neffectiveness research under the administration's proposed health care \nplan to ration health care.\n  Comparative effective research is currently used to evaluate the \nstrength and weaknesses of various medical interventions. If structured \nappropriately, it can be a great help to both physicians and patients, \nto help them make health care decisions. But without the appropriate \nsafeguards, the Government can misuse it to deny or delay patient \ncoverage and services based on factors such as age, relative health, or \nthe number of people ahead in line for a particular treatment.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Sebelius's answers to my questions made clear \nthat the administration and Health and Human Services under her watch \nwould be unwilling to support patient safeguards. She did not provide \nany assurance that Health and Human Services, Federal health care \nprograms, or any new Government entity, such as the Federal \nCoordinating Council, will not use this tool to ration or deny care. \nThis should be a matter of concern for every American.\n  We must not enable a panel of Washington bureaucrats to decide who is \neligible for a particular treatment or when they can get it. In \ncountries that have government-rationed health care, patients sit on \nlong waiting lists to have procedures such as an MRI or dental surgery \nor hip replacement, to name a few.\n  I recently read an article in the Wall Street Journal by Nadeem \nEsmail, Director of Health System Performance Studies at the Fraser \nInstitute in Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, entitled: ``Too Old For Hip \nSurgery.'' The article recounted stories of our neighbors in Canada who \nroutinely wait months and even years for a specialist's care. Many \ncross the border to see U.S. doctors to get the immediate treatment \nthey need. Lawsuits tied to Canada's health care rationing system often \nwind up decided by their courts. Is this what we want in America?\n  Governor Sebelius's answers about comparative effectiveness research \nrelied on two points, which were inaccurate and contradicted one \nanother, raising more doubt rather than providing assurance. Let me \nbriefly address those points.\n  When Governor Sebelius stated during her hearing, ``The law prohibits \nMedicare from using comparative effectiveness research to deny \ncoverage,'' she was referencing the 2003 drug bill which applies only \nto prescription drugs and not to any other aspect of medical treatment. \nSo she is factually wrong to suggest that could be a future limitation \non health care generally. Of course, the fact that we so limited it in \nthe 2003 prescription drug bill makes the point that it does need to be \nlimited.\n  In this regard she also said: ``When authorizing comparative \neffectiveness research in both the Medicare Modernization Act and the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress did not impose any \nlimits on it.'' That statement is true. It also is precisely the \nproblem.\n\n  The National Institutes of Health is already taking the steps \nnecessary to make cost-based research a priority and to use it to \nration health care. A recent National Institutes of Health project \ndescription states:\n\n       Cost effectiveness research will provide accurate and \n     objective information to guide future policies that support \n     the allocation of health resources for the treatment of acute \n     and chronic conditions.\n\n  Allocation of health resources is, of course, a euphemism for denying \ncare based on cost. And Governor Sebelius will not agree to terminate \nthis project.\n  There is no question that health care reform is badly needed, and I \nwant to work toward that goal. All Americans, especially those who are \nunemployed or who work for a business that doesn't provide health \ninsurance or who have a preexisting condition deserve a better \napproach. But rationing based on cost is neither a practical nor \nsatisfactory route to achieve it; it will delay access to treatment \nthat may be urgently\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nnecessary and discourage the kind of research that leads to promising \nnew treatments.\n  I believe every American has the right to choose the doctor, \nhospital, and health plan that best fits his or her needs. Flexibility \nis essential in medicine, and each patient should be cared for as an \nindividual, with a treatment regimen crafted and tailored by his or her \nown physician, not by a Washington bureaucrat. So I oppose the \nnomination of Governor Sebelius to head the Health and Human Services \nDepartment, because I do not believe she is sufficiently committed to \nthese same principles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Sebelius \nnomination. And before he leaves the floor, I also want to say to my \nfriend from Arizona that I think he knows I share many of his \nsubstantive concerns about what it is going to take to get bipartisan \nhealth reform legislation. For example, a key component of it will have \nto be malpractice reform. It will have to include the areas the Senator \nfrom Arizona has touched on--the question of comparative effectiveness. \nAnd I think in both of these areas there is a long way to go to get it \nright. It is my interest, particularly this afternoon, to assure the \nSenator from Arizona that there is going to be an effort to pull out \nall the stops to make this a bipartisan effort here in the Senate to \nfix America's health care, and I want to tell him I am looking forward \nto working with him on that.\n  To pick up on this point, many Senators have come to the floor to \ndiscuss the needs of tackling health care issues in the kind of \nbipartisan fashion that Senator Kyl has talked about and I have \nmentioned. I strongly support the Senators who are making this a \nspecial focus of this discussion today when we consider Governor \nSebelius's candidacy to head the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  For a bit of background, Senator Bennett and I, in particular, have \nbeen working for several years in talking to most Members of the \nSenate. I personally have gone to see about 85 Senators in their \noffice, to listen to them, to get their views about health care reform, \nall with an idea to make the issue of reconciliation on health care \nirrelevant. What we wish to do, Senator Bennett and I, working closely \nwith the chairs and ranking minority members of our key committees, is \nto find a way to get a very substantial bipartisan vote here in the \nSenate for health care reform. I think we are well on our way to doing \nthat. I believe there is literally a philosophical truce on health care \nwithin the grasp of the Senate.\n\n  When one looks at this debate, both political parties have had valid \npoints to make. My party, for example, is right on the idea that we \ncannot fix health care unless all Americans get good-quality, \naffordable coverage. The reality is, we cannot begin to organize the \nmarket for health care unless we get everybody covered. Without \ncovering everybody, there is too much cost shifting, there is not \nenough focus on prevention and wellness, and we have a real question \nabout what to do about clogging up hospital emergency rooms--which is \nan issue in Colorado and Oregon and across the land.\n  So Democrats have been right on the point of saying to fix American \nhealth care all Americans have to have good-quality, affordable \ncoverage. But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and \nSenator Bennett has championed this; Senator Grassley has championed \nthis--have been right in saying there needs to be a significant role \nfor the private sector in American health care as well. It is going to \nbe important not to freeze innovation, to steer clear of price \ncontrols, to have a wide berth for the private sector to innovate and \noffer private sector choices as part of the solution to this challenge \nof fixing American health care. So we meld together these two points of \nview--Democrats who have been right on the idea that we have to cover \neverybody, Republicans who have had a valid point with respect to a \nrole for the private sector--and, in my view, we are on our way to 68, \n70, 72 votes in the Senate for comprehensive health reform.\n  So we very much need to tackle this in a bipartisan way. In my view, \nthere are a few words that speak volumes about Governor Sebelius's \noutlook on the need for having bipartisanship in the health care arena. \nThose words were spoken by a former leader in the Senate, Bob Dole. I \nwant to quote for the Senate a couple of the remarks made by Senator \nDole when he came before us on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Senator Dole said:\n\n       For more than 20 years, Kathleen Sebelius has served the \n     State of Kansas as a legislator, insurance commissioner and \n     Governor. All of her accomplishments required bipartisan \n     approaches. Her work has earned her the respect of Democrats \n     and Republicans. . . .\n\n  Senator Dole goes on to note that one of our most respected former \ncolleagues, Nancy Kassebaum Baker, has actually written Members of the \nSenate with respect to her support for Governor Sebelius.\n  Then Senator Dole goes even further, and he says:\n\n       Governor Sebelius and I are from different parties. We have \n     different views on different issues, some highly \n     controversial. But that is not the issue here today. \n     Candidate Obama is now President Obama and gets to make the \n     Cabinet selections. He has determined that she is well \n     qualified and that she understands the importance of the \n     enormous task before her when confirmed by the entire Senate. \n     I agree and that's why I am here to support her nomination. \n     We need a Secretary of Health and Human Services--\n\n  Said Senator Dole--\n\n     who has the skills, experience and courage to shape and guide \n     this historic legislation through Congress. It will not be \n     easy but I know Governor Sebelius will never stop trying.\n\n  Those were the words of former Senator Dole, somebody to whom I look \nagain and again for counsel on health care. I think it is fair to say a \ngreat many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle look to him \nfor counsel on health care.\n  Those who know Governor Sebelius best, such as Senator Bob Dole, \nhave, in my view, said it better than any of us could. They know her, \nthey have worked with her, they have watched her try to forge \ncoalitions. As insurance commissioner, she has been a leader nationally \nin the insurance field with the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners. I think she is going to be a pragmatic coalition builder \nwho is going to work with a very specific focus toward trying to bring \nthe Senate together to tackle this critical issue.\n  We know there are some particularly important challenges ahead of us. \nI have said one of the first priorities in health reform is to make \nsure those who have coverage today--in Colorado and Oregon and across \nthe country--see that health reform works for them. Some writers have \ncalled that group the ``contentedly covered,'' the people who already \nhave health care coverage in America today.\n  I think there are four important priorities for the Congress to \naddress in making sure those who have health care coverage today see \nthat the system works for them. Those priorities are, first of all, \nmaking sure they can keep the coverage they have. We have written it \ninto the Healthy Americans legislation. Chairman Baucus has it in his \nwhite paper. It has to be a matter of law. Sometimes people joke about \nit: We can put it in the Pledge of Allegiance. It is vitally important \nthat people be able to keep the coverage they have.\n  The second factor that is so important is to make sure people who \nhave coverage have options to save some money on their health care in \nthe future. They want to contain costs because they know right now they \nare not even getting an increase in take-home pay because health care \ngobbles up everything in sight. So let's make them wealthier in the \nprocess of health reform, and let's say that, if you want to have one \nof the additional choices, the private sector choices that are offered \nin health reform, and you can save some money by choosing one of those \nchoices rather than keeping what you have, you get to keep the \ndifference. That is something I think will be attractive to those who \nhave coverage.\n  The third area we ought to zero in on is making sure folks with \ncoverage have the opportunity to be healthier. I think it is well \nunderstood that much of American health care is more sick care than \nhealth care. So let's get some incentives in place so everybody has a\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nnew focus on wellness. I personally would like to see those who are on \nMedicare who lower their blood pressure and lower their cholesterol get \nreduced premiums. It is called Outpatient Care, Part B premiums. Let's \ngive them a lower premium when they lower their blood pressure and \nlower their cholesterol.\n  When there is a parent in Oregon or Colorado or across the country \nwho enrolls a youngster in a wellness or prevention program--let's say \nfor a weight problem--let's give the parent a reduction in their \npremium, again, to reward prevention. So we let people keep the \ncoverage they have. They are going to be wealthier and they are going \nto be healthier.\n  Finally, one last big challenge for those who have coverage. If \nindividuals want to leave their job or their job leaves them, let's \nmake sure their coverage is portable, that they can take it from place \nto place to place. I think we understand that this economy is real \ndifferent than what we had in the 1940s, when somebody went to work \nsomewhere and stayed put for 30 years until they received a gold watch \nand a big retirement dinner.\n  The typical people in our States, Western States, now change their \njob 11 times by the time they are 40 years old, and they need portable \nhealth coverage. So let's make sure that coverage is something that \nfits the modern economy--again, consistent with an approach that let's \nthem keep what they have and puts more money in their pocket and gives \nthem the opportunity to be healthier.\n  I think that is a vision for bipartisan health reform. It certainly \nhas been largely shared by Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, and \nSenator Bennett and I have talked about it in our efforts as well. But \nit is going to take somebody with the kind of talent that Bob Dole just \ndescribed, in the words I have offered today, once again, before the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  There is a reason that after 60 years of debate on health care reform \nin America that it has not actually gotten done. This is hard work, in \nterms of building a coalition. I put 6 years of my life into just the \nmost recent effort and have visited with most of the Senate on it. I \nthink there is a clear desire, given the importance to our economy.\n\n  The fact is, we cannot fix the economy unless we fix American health \ncare. Most of the experts are saying a lot of these budgets we are \ndealing with right now, the various bailouts--those bailouts are going \nto look like a rounding error compared to American health care if we \ndon't get on top of these escalating costs. It has to be done, both in \nterms of fixing the economy, ensuring quality of life for our people, \nand because now the country is looking to the Congress to work in a \nbipartisan way. They have watched a lot of the past squabbles, they \nhave watched a lot of the bickering over issues in the past, and here \nis an opportunity, as Senator Dole has described, of having a person \nwho wants to work in a bipartisan way around a number of the ideas that \nI have mentioned this afternoon.\n  I hope colleagues will support Governor Sebelius. I hope they will \nreflect on the words of Senator Dole because I think he said it best \nwhen he came before us on the Senate Finance Committee. I think there \nis an opportunity now for the Senate to show a country--and a country \nthat is legitimately skeptical about Washington's ability to tackle big \nissues--the Senate now has an opportunity to show that on health care, \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together. We are going to come \ntogether with individuals, leaders such as Governor Sebelius, who have \nshown the talent to work in a bipartisan fashion; and I, particularly, \nhaving listened to many of our Republican colleagues on the floor today \ntalking about the Sebelius nomination, want to assure them that I agree \nwith much of what they have said with respect to the need to avoid \napproaches that are partisan and jam one side or another.\n  In fact, I have devoted much of the last 6 years to making those \nkinds of approaches irrelevant, to making reconciliation irrelevant.\n  I think Governor Sebelius will work with us in a constructive way \ntoward exactly that kind of result. Bob Dole has spoken about her \nability to do just that before the Finance Committee, and I hope this \nnomination will now be approved expeditiously and Democrats and \nRepublicans can work together tackling the premier domestic issue of \nour time: fixing American health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire, what is the business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business before the Senate is the \nnomination of the Governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius, to be the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to, if I may, spend a few minutes addressing \nthat issue.\n  I rise in strong support of Governor Sebelius.\n  Let me thank the people of Kansas. This is a remarkable nominee. I \nknow she has served the people of Kansas well during her tenure as \nGovernor, insurance commissioner, State representative, and we are \nfortunate indeed that President Obama has asked the Governor of Kansas \nto come to our Nation's Capital to serve as the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  We owe her a debt of gratitude as well for being willing to accept \nthis responsibility at a time that, with the exception of some 15 years \nago, only the second time in more than half a century, this institution \nand this city will grapple with one of the compelling issues of our \nday; that is, to deal with a national health care crisis in America. \nGovernor Sebelius has demonstrated a willingness to take on a very \nlarge issue which is highly complicated and brings out passionate \nresponses from people across the political spectrum. So we are \ngrateful. I am grateful to her for taking on this challenge. I am \nappreciative of the President for asking her to do so. I would hope our \ncolleagues would come together.\n  There is always too much delay in a lot of nominations. I have been a \nMember of this body for many years. I think I can count on one or two \nhands the number of times, in more than two decades, that I have \nopposed nominees of either party. I have always been of the view that \nPresidents and elections mean things. If you are elected President of \nthe United States, then a President ought to have an opportunity to \ncarry out the mandates or the promises they have made as a candidate.\n  So those of us who are in the opposition from time to time, other \nthan disagreeing with or deciding to vote against someone because maybe \nthere is some serious problem that underlies that nomination--but I \nhave never felt the views of a nominee ought to necessarily decide my \nvote in favor of or against them; that Presidents ought to be able to \nhave people they believe will help carry out their wishes and campaign \npromises; that if we in the opposition try to guarantee that people who \nshare our views are going to be in the Cabinet, that seems to be \ncontrary to the will of the American people who have made a different \nchoice on election day. I know that is disappointing to people from \ntime to time. I know that when I have supported various nominees of \nPresident Reagan, President Bush, No. 41, and George Bush, his son, No. \n43, voted in support of those nominees, there were those who were \ndisappointed that I would cast a ballot for the nominee. But my answer \nalways was that they were elected--obviously a very controversial \nelection in the case of George W. Bush in 2000, but nonetheless \nultimately he was the choice to be our President and as such deserved \nto be able to have the nominees in his Cabinet, the people he thought \nwould best serve the country. There were occasions when I did vote \nagainst some nominees but never on the basis of what their views were. \nThere may have been some other disqualifying factor, but there were \nvery few over the years.\n  So at this hour, it has been since March 2 that the President \nnominated Kathleen Sebelius to be the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. We are now ending the month of April and\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\ngoing into the month of May. We have been told as a nation over the \nlast several days that we are now potentially facing a pandemic issue \nin the swine flu problem. Having a Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, which is the job that would necessarily coordinate and lead \nthe efforts both at home and working with Secretary of State Clinton \nand others, coordinate the effort internationally on this matter--it is \ntime to move along.\n  While I know there are those who have very strongly held views about \nvarious matters that will come before the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, elections have consequences. President Obama won the \nelection. This is his choice to lead that agency and to deal with the \nmyriad of other problems we must grapple with as a country. I think it \nis time for this body to discuss these matters over the appropriate \nperiod of time and then to move along and to not delay for as long a \ntime as we have seen already a nomination of this importance.\n  The HELP Committee, on which I serve--the Health Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee--and the Finance Committee held hearings on \nGovernor Sebelius back at the end of the last month, and the majority \nleader attempted to get unanimous consent to move her nomination almost \na week ago. Those efforts have been blocked by the minority party here. \nNow we find ourselves in the midst of what appears to be a global \ncrisis, as I mentioned, and for no apparent reason that I can \ndetermine, other than maybe some politics, we still do not have the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services confirmed.\n  I believe most Americans, regardless of political party, would like \nto see someone leading this agency and helping us grapple with these \nissues. I do not think they are going to be pleased, even if they \ndisagree with the politics of the nominee, to have that spot vacant at \na time when we need leadership, particularly someone as highly \nqualified as Governor Sebelius is.\n  Again, I commend the Obama administration for its handling of the \nswine flu threat so far. It is clear that the various agencies in \nGovernment are working closely and collaboratively. As a result of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, we were able \nto pass and fund what was called the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act and the predecessor bioterrorism legislation. The \ncountry as a whole has made great strides in surveillance, \ncoordination, communications, and treatment capabilities.\n  Let me specifically thank several of our colleagues, because I was \ndeeply involved in those negotiations on that legislation many years \nago--well, several years ago. They include Richard Burr of North \nCarolina, a Republican Member, our colleague, who is deeply involved in \nthe issue; then-Majority Leader Frist of Tennessee was very involved; \nSenator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and myself are the four, along \nwith Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, involved from time to time in trying \nto craft that legislation dealing with the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act and some of the bioterrorism legislation. My \ncolleagues, on a bipartisan basis, put that together. Richard Burr was \nvery deeply involved in that question, and we ought to thank him for \nhis insistence so many years ago. So we have been involved in these \nissues on a bipartisan basis, and I would hope, again, this nomination \ncan go forward on a similar basis.\n  The U.S. response to this current global threat is evidence that \nthose efforts taken some years ago are paying off. But the lead agency \nin all of this, and other possible health threats, is the Health and \nHuman Services Department. That Department lacks a leader today, and \nthat is the reason we are still here a week later debating whether this \nnominee of incredibly impeccable credentials is being held up for as \nlong as she is.\n  Having served on the so-called HELP Committee for many years, I \ncannot recall another time when the challenges facing the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services were so complex. I have already addressed \nsome of those issues. Our economy is in the worst shape it has been in \nfor decades. We have a health care system that is broken, impacting \nfamilies, businesses, and our competitiveness as a nation.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services and the agencies within \nits purview are in need of attention and leadership. It is critical \nthat the Department once again base its decisions on the best available \nscience, not the political ideology of the moment. President Obama has \nalready made tremendous progress in this respect with the signing of an \nExecutive order overturning the previous administration's harmful \nrestrictions on embryonic stem cell research and the signing of a \nPresidential memorandum on scientific integrity. I commend him for it.\n  He has moved quickly to appoint highly qualified candidates such as \nGovernor Sebelius to key positions within the Department, such as the \nFDA Commissioner and the head of the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.\n  Governor Sebelius brings a wealth of experience I have referenced \nalready, working in a bipartisan fashion to improve the lives of \nfamilies in her State. The outpouring of support, on a bipartisan \nbasis, ought to be welcome and celebrated. Rarely do you see someone \nbring that much support across the political spectrum that Governor \nSebelius has to this, the nomination to head this Department.\n  The knowledge and expertise she gained as Governor, the insurance \ncommissioner of her State, and the State representative will be \ninstrumental in achieving comprehensive health care reform--reform that \nat long last will bring affordable quality health care, we hope, to all \nAmericans.\n  The case for reform of our health care system has never been stronger \nor more urgent, and I happen to be one who is optimistic about the \nprospects of achieving health care reform this year under the \nleadership of Max Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee; \nSenator Ted Kennedy, the chairman of the HELP Committee; and the \nrespective leadership on the House side along with, obviously, \nPresident Obama; the participation of other people--our colleagues, \nsuch as Orrin Hatch, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, certainly Chuck Grassley, \nthe Republican former chairman of the Finance Committee, now the \nRepublican ranking member, and many others with whom we have had \nextensive meetings already trying to achieve what our majority leader \nhas called for, and that is a strong, bipartisan effort here to put \ntogether a national health reform package. So a lot of good people are \nalready buying in, trying to achieve that result. What we have been \nmissing in all of this is the head of the Health and Human Services \nDepartment, to help pull that piece of the puzzle together for us as \nwell.\n  We are in such a different place than we were 15 years ago on this \nissue. Then we had a host of opposition lined up. Today, those who \norganized to torpedo those efforts 15 years ago, frankly, are at the \ntable today anxious for us to share and put together a proposal that \nwould enjoy that kind of support I mentioned a moment ago.\n  The economics of our country are certainly in a much different place \nthan they were in 1993 and 1994. Today, health care accounts for over \n16 percent of the gross domestic product of our country--health care \ncosts. According to the Office of Management and Budget, by the year \n2018--not that far away--national health spending, if unabated, could \naccount for a fifth, more than 20 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. There are those who believe that within 10 years that figure \nof 16 percent could double to more than 30 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. That is unacceptable.\n  If you are not motivated by the morality and ethics of having 45 \nmillion Americans without any health care, of which 9 million in that \nnumber are children, today we rank among the lowest scores or the worst \nscores of infant mortality among industrialized nations. There are \n100,000 people a year who die in this country from avoidable medical \nerrors. Those are not the kinds of statistics we want to associate with \nour great country. So, in addition to the moral, the health care \nissues, the ethical questions, the economics of this issue demand \nattention.\n  If you are not impressed by any other motivation on why we ought to \nachieve universal, quality, affordable health care, founded on the \nnotion of prevention, then the economic justification\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nought to persuade you. The health care system we have today puts \npersonal finances at risk, threatens our global competitiveness. \nGeneral Motors, to give you one example, estimates that health care \ncosts add over $1,500 to the selling price of each automobile it \nproduces, and it paid $5.2 billion in health benefits in 2004. That is \nmore than it paid for steel. That will give you an idea why that \ncompany is facing as much pressure as it is, as well as other \nautomobile manufacturers.\n  Look at the foreclosure issue. There are 10,000 people today who will \nbe at risk of losing their homes. That is true every day in our country \nin the midst of this major economic crisis. There are 20,000 people a \nday, on average, who are losing their jobs in the United States. So \nwhen you are losing your job, you may lose your home and retirement. \nRemember this: Almost half of all of those foreclosures that will occur \ntoday are partly caused by the financial crisis stemming from medical \ncosts. I will repeat that. Almost half--50 percent of those 10,000 \nforeclosures that will occur today are partly caused by the financial \ncrisis stemming from health care costs.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee and a 26-year veteran on the \nHELP Committee, I share the President's belief that fixing the health \ncare crisis is essential to fixing our economy.\n  We can talk about all the other issues dealing with availability of \ncredit and what is happening to banks and to the financial stability of \nthe Nation, but we cannot have a conversation about all that and \ndisregard the issue of health care. Twenty-eight million Americans who \nwork for small businesses are without health care. Premiums on average \nare 18 percent higher than they were a few years ago. In Connecticut, \npremium costs have gone up 42 percent in 8 years. Imagine what that has \ndone at a time when wages and salaries have not increased anything \nremotely close to that. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs for health \ncare and individuals continue to skyrocket.\n  Chairmen Kennedy and Baucus of the respective HELP and Finance \nCommittees are working closely together on this process, trying to \nfashion a timeline and policy that will fit together. Both chairmen \nhave stated a shared goal of marking up health care legislation in \nearly June. I strongly believe that timetable is achievable. But we \nneed to have a Secretary of Health and Human Services, if we are going \nto mark up a bill in June. We have had this nomination pending for more \nthan a month, have spent a week debating it, and we are in the month of \nMay. Most Americans want the petty politics put aside and the people in \nplace we need to lead this effort. They care about health care. They \nunderstand what happens: When one loses their job, they lose their \nhealth care.\n  Last year one in three Americans, between 2007 and 2008, had a gap \nwhere they had no health care for one reason or another. Lord forbid \nsomeone is in that gap and something happens to them or their spouse or \na child and they end up having to pay out-of-pocket expenses for the \ncare of that individual. That is a fear everyone has who faces that \npossibility or is in that situation today.\n  I say this respectfully. It is time to get the people in place who \ncan help us get this job done. Delaying this nomination because you \ndon't agree with everything that Kathleen Sebelius says or supports is \nnot justification for denying this administration and, more \nimportantly, the American people a leader at the Department of HHS to \nmove forward.\n  I wish to say a quick word about the comparative effectiveness \nresearch which has been mentioned as a reason for holding up the \nnomination. This effort is about expanding Americans' access to health \ncare, not restricting it. We also want to give patients and their \ndoctors the tools they need to make the right decisions about care. \nThat is what comparative effectiveness research is all about, \nempowering patients and medical providers. It is not about rationing \ncare. Comparative effectiveness research is about helping patients and \nproviders figure out together which therapies and treatments work best \nfor them. It is not about restricting or limiting health care options \nbut, rather, about helping them understand their health care better and \nmore accurately chart a course of treatment. The President has made \nsuch research a high priority by having invested in it through the \nrecovery act's $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health and \n$1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research.\n  I support the President and Governor Sebelius in this effort to \ninform patients and providers. This is the moment for health care \nreform. Failure is not an option for our Nation. I look forward to \nworking with Governor Sebelius to make meaningful, lasting change to \nour Nation's health care system.\n  While health care reform is a top priority, I also wish to address \nquickly another vitally important issue to the responsibility of the \ndepartment; that is, early childhood education and development. This is \nan issue that has long been near and dear to my heart, since 1981, when \nI started the children's caucus in the Senate almost 30 years ago with \nArlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who was a new Senator as well that year, \nalong with people such as Patrick Moynihan, Bob Dole, and Bill Bradley. \nEach brought a deepening interest in what was happening to one out of \nfour Americans who are children. As a result of our efforts over the \nyears, we have made a difference.\n  I am encouraged by the commitment of President Obama to early \nchildhood education. I look forward to working on new proposals as well \nas strengthening current programs such as Head Start and the CCDBG for \nchildcare to benefit children and families. An investment in our \nyoungest Americans pays off in their readiness for school, their \nhealth, and job creation now and in the future and the need for fewer \nsocial services later in the child's life.\n  Now is the time to put partisan politics aside, confirm Governor \nSebelius so we can have the kind of leader most Americans are looking \nfor and provide the guidance the Department of Health and Human \nServices will need if we are going to succeed in this effort.\n  I urge confirmation of this remarkable individual who has offered her \nservices to the country, who is making the kind of sacrifice to come \nforward and serve our Nation at a critical moment. That is to be \ncelebrated. That is patriotism. I hope my colleagues will quickly \nconfirm this nominee and allow us to begin the critical work of \nfashioning a national health care reform package.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of an \nincredibly gifted public servant. I don't normally stand up and sing \nthe praises of Kansas. I am not a huge fan of Kansas. I am a \nMissourian, and we have issues between Kansas and Missouri--usually \nbetween our basketball teams and our football teams.\n  During the last decade, I have had an opportunity to get to know \nKathleen Sebelius as a person, as a mother, as a wife, as a Governor, \nand as a friend. I want my colleagues to know that they are voting to \nconfirm an extraordinary individual who will do an excellent job as \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in the United States.\n  Kathleen Sebelius has shown courage and guts many times in her \ncareer. Frankly, running for Kansas's Governor as a Democrat shows guts \nand courage. We are talking about a State that is not warm and fuzzy \nabout Democrats. We are talking about a State that is as red as \nDorothy's ruby slippers. But she ran for Governor after she had served \nas commissioner of insurance in Kansas. So why was it that all these \nRepublicans got excited about voting for Kathleen Sebelius? It was \nbecause she demonstrated, when she was commissioner of insurance in \nKansas, that she was about fighting for them. It happened over an \ninsurance company. Everyone needs to realize this is an experience she \nhas had that relates directly to what we need right now as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services as we embark upon the most aggressive and \nambitious health care\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nreform agenda this country has ever faced.\n  When the largest health insurance company in Kansas wanted to sell--\nthis was a mutual company owned by the policyholders of Kansas and \ncovered 70 percent of Kansans--all Kathleen Sebelius, the insurance \ncommissioner, had to do under the law was sign off on it and say no \nharm would be done. But she took a look at it and said, wait a minute, \nI don't think the test should be that no harm is going to be done. I \nwant to know what this sale is going to do to make things better for \nKansans. She took on a titan--a big, huge insurance company. That is \nwhat we need right now, someone willing to take on the calcified silos \nof profit in our health care system and blow them up in order to \ndeliver a better product. She said: I want to make sure this sale is \ngoing to reflect a better environment for health insurance for the \npeople of Kansas.\n  She fought them all the way to the Supreme Court of Kansas and \neventually she won and was able to block the sale of this company. She \nsaid at the time that bigger is not always better, and unless they \ncould show how this was going to be better for the people of Kansas, \nshe would continue to fight them toe to toe. It was that kind of \nfighting spirit on behalf of regular people who don't have the tools to \nfight big insurance companies that uniquely qualifies her to be at the \nhead of this important agency as we embark on the health care reform \nagenda.\n  Not only did she have the guts to run for Governor--she won, which \nwas remarkable. Here is an even more remarkable part. She went to \nTopeka, the capital, and began working with the Republicans. As \nPresident Obama has said over and over again, she said: I want to work \nwith you. And she did. She wrestled with a senate and a house that was \ndominated by the Republican party in Kansas and, at the end of 4 years, \nwhat did the people of Kansas do? Did they say they were sick of the \ngridlock and didn't want this liberal Kansas woman anymore from the \nDemocratic party as Governor? Oh, no, they did not; they reelected her \nby a wide margin.\n  It is a remarkable thing, when you think about it, because this is a \nState that our former President won by 20, 30 points. Yet the people of \nKansas realized they had a fighter. They looked past the party label to \nher courage, integrity, intelligence, and her willingness to go toe to \ntoe with the big guys for them. I am proud she has been nominated. I \nknow there have been some distortions about her record. I can assure my \ncolleagues that she will make us all proud in this job. She will work \nwith every one of us to try to find that common ground. She will leave \nno opinion behind as they consider the best way to move forward on this \nhealth care reform agenda.\n  I am pleased to be able to stand for a few minutes and tell everyone \nin America to celebrate today, because we are about to confirm a \nfighter--someone who will fight for you and deliver the kind of health \ncare in America that we deserve, at a price we can afford.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for up to 10 minutes, \nmaybe slightly longer, about the nomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius \nto be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. I \nwish to speak on behalf of the Governor because I think she is such an \noutstanding candidate for this particular job.\n  As I look across the country, as many of my colleagues, and think who \ncould fill this position, I have to say I was very pleased with the \nPresident's action to tap her for this important position because right \nnow this Secretary is going to be charged with fulfilling the \nPresident's idea that all Americans should have health coverage. This \nis an idea that other Presidents have shared and about which many \nleaders in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have thought. It \nwould be remarkable and wonderful for our country, the extraordinarily \ndeveloped Nation that we are, to find a way--a cost-effective way, in \nmy view; hopefully, a market-based approach--to solving one of the \ngreat challenges of our time, which is to provide health insurance, \ngood coverage, for workers in the most productive Nation on Earth.\n  It really is a failing, in my view, of our organized society and our \nGovernment that we have not in over 240 years been able to accomplish \nthat. We have accomplished so many things that are a credit to our \ncountry, but this has eluded us.\n  When President Obama ran in his campaign, and as I heard him speak \neven here and in the House Chamber for a joint session, he again \nexpressed his passion for trying to find a solution. One of the first \nsteps to finding a solution is finding a leader who has a good record \nof finding solutions on their own, a good record of working across \nparty lines to get difficult jobs done. So in his action to achieve \nthis goal, he has made a great first step to at least present to the \nSenate for our consideration a person who does not have a weak record \nbut a strong record in this effort.\n  I submit that as a Democratic Governor of Kansas, you have to be \npretty good as a Democrat, first of all, to get elected in Kansas \nbecause, like Louisiana, it tends to be a more conservative State on \nsome issues. Obviously, I think this Governor has demonstrated over and \nover, as insurance commissioner and as Governor of Kansas, the ability \nto get the job done. She was tapped before she was Governor by a \nGovernor of Kansas to help actually implement and lead the children's \nhealth program. Her record is clear in the success of this program.\n  She, as insurance commissioner, had a great deal of interaction with \nhealth insurers in that State and others that indicates to us she has \nthe experience and the ability to do this. Working with the Federal \nGovernment during her time as Governor on all of these health care \nmatters leads me to the conclusion that she is the right person to help \nus get this job done. The sooner we confirm her the better.\n  I was very impressed to hear--I do not serve on this committee--that \nat her hearing, Senator Roberts, our colleague who is of the other \nparty, spoke in her favor and voted for her. Even more impressive to me \nwas that former Senator Bob Dole testified for her.\n  This is not at all a typical partisan appointment. This is a person \nwho has demonstrated through her leadership for many years in the State \nof Kansas the ability to tackle the toughest jobs and bring people from \nvarious viewpoints together. That is the kind of leadership I think \nAmerica is looking for right now.\n  I might add that in the most recent days, the outbreak of the swine \nflu in our country should compel the Members of this body to know this \nis not a job that should have a vacancy sign on the door right now. \nThere could potentially be a pandemic. The Government is hoping for the \nbest but preparing for the worst. While Secretary Napalitano has been \ncharged with the task to coordinate Federal agencies, frankly I do not \nfeel very comfortable having this job vacant. The faster we can get her \nin this position with her extraordinary credentials the better.\n  I would like to make a few other points. As the chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee, I have to say again for the record--and I think \nSenator Snowe from Maine, my ranking member and long-serving member of \nthis committee, would say the same thing if she were here--that no \nmatter what we call a meeting on in the Small Business Committee--it \ncould be on procurement, it could be a hearing on credit markets, it \ncould be a hearing, which we have had, on the Small Business \nAdministration itself, as I am standing here, every small business \nperson, almost to the man or woman, will say: Senators, before I leave, \nor, Senators, I know this isn't the subject of this hearing, but could \nI please say I can't afford my health insurance; can I please say that \nit is very important for this country to find a way for small business \nentrepreneurs to get health insurance.\n  Just for the record, for small businesses that employ the vast \nmajority of people in this country, the percentage of coverage has \ndropped in the last\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\n7 years from 68 percent of those businesses providing coverage down to \n59 percent. I know in my personal experience dozens of people who would \nsay: You know, Mary, I would like to start a business. I think I have a \ngood idea, and actually I have some money to start it, but I can't give \nup my health insurance because I have a preexisting condition or I have \na son with leukemia or I have a daughter who has a compromised immune \nsystem.\n  I cannot tell you how strongly I feel that our country is actually \nnot only throwing cold water but almost freezing water on the \nentrepreneurial spirit because we can't seem to figure out how to \nprovide health insurance--and not just for big companies but for medium \ncompanies and for emerging companies--and to have that coverage be \nportable and available when people want to leave a company and take a \nrisk. They might risk their business, but they are not going to risk \ntheir life. That is a little too much risk to ask in order to start a \nbusiness. You may risk your home, you may risk your fortune, but to ask \npeople to risk their life is a little ridiculous. Yet that is where we \nare. So the faster we can get someone in this position who can help put \ntheir shoulder to the wheel and help our small businesses come up with \na way, the better off we will be.\n  Finally, I wish to mention two issues briefly. We concentrate a lot \nin this department on health care and that, of course, is the \nPresident's priority and it is our priority, but I don't want to fail \nto mention that I believe this Governor would be an extraordinary \nadvocate for foster care children. There are 500,000 of these children, \nmany of them with 4.0 grade point averages, amazingly. Many of them are \nthe most extraordinary children. I have gotten to meet many of these \nyoung people as chairman of the Adoption Caucus and an advocate for \nfoster care. This is despite the fact that some of them have spent \nseveral years of their youth living in an automobile.\n  One of these children said to me one day that she got so hungry she \nwould just eat paper. The only thing that made it edible was that she \nwould pour salt on it, just to try to put something in her stomach. \nThese 500,000 children and young people need someone such as Governor \nSebelius because these are people in the custody of the Government. The \nU.S. Government, along with partners in our 50 States, have an \nobligation to these children for their health, for their education, and \nto try to help them launch successfully in life. Once we have \nterminated their parental rights--in many instances for good cause--we \nthen have an obligation to be their parents and to reconnect them \nthrough adoption, if possible, or to long-term guardianship. We need \nsomebody in this position who can do that.\n  I know of Governor Sebelius's heart for foster care, for orphans, and \nfor adoption. I think she will be a wonderful advocate to keep our \nadoption tax credit in place and to help Senator Grassley and I--we \nhave been working on this with many other Members--find a way to reform \nthe financing mechanism and the way we fund our foster care adoption \nsystem in this country, which right now funds the system and not the \nchild. We want the money to support the decision of that good, solid \njudge who has a plan for the child. The problem is there is no money \nfor the child because we are giving the money to the system instead of \ntying the money to the child. Senator Grassley and I have a vision to \nmake that better.\n  I hope we can confirm Governor Sebelius, knowing she has a proven \nrecord of governing her State, which is not easy for a Democrat, and \nremained very popular. That takes a great deal of effort in this day \nand age, given the partisan nature of our politics. We need to have a \n``position filled'' sign as opposed to a ``vacancy'' sign in this \nposition, and we need somebody who understands the commonsense \npractical approach to governing that is going to deliver for this \nPresident and for us--for the American people--a health care system we \ncan depend on, that we can afford, and that promotes risk-taking and \nentrepreneurship, which is the founding principle, in many ways, of \nthis wonderful country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak on behalf \nof the Governor, and I urge my colleagues to not wait any longer and to \nconfirm this nominee and give her the support she needs. Do not apply \nany litmus test on any particular issue, but give her the chance I \nthink she wants to have--I am confident she wants to have--to do a good \njob for us all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 15 minutes on the \npending nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Governor Sebelius, who has been nominated \nto be Secretary of Health and Human Services, testified before the \nSenate Finance Committee that she would not refuse to use certain \ncomparative effectiveness research as a tool to deny or delay American \ncitizens' access to health care. Said another way, a concern about \ncomparative effectiveness research, $1.1 billion of which was funded in \nthe stimulus program, can be used both for benign purposes, purposes \nthat are completely understandable, as well as those most Americans \nwould find repugnant; that is, for rationing of access to health care.\n  Comparative effectiveness research is the comparison of various \ntreatments or approaches to garner better data on what works best and/\nor what costs the least. Comparative effectiveness research can be \nhelpful and beneficial if it is used to inform health care decisions \nand individual health care decisionmaking and as a guide to evidence-\nbased medicine. Without appropriate safeguards--and these were the \nsafeguards Governor Sebelius refused to embrace--the Government could \nactually use comparative effectiveness research to delay treatment and \nto deny care based on a one-size-fits-all approach to health care.\n  The economic stimulus package included $1.1 billion for comparative \neffectiveness research. This research should only be used to better \ninform individualized decisionmaking; that is, a patient talking to \ntheir doctor and deciding what is in that patient's best interests. It \nshould not be used for the Government to say: Patient, we will not pay \nyour doctor for that procedure unless it meets our cookbook medicine \nmodel that is generated by comparative effectiveness research. Despite \nassurances that the stimulus money would not be used to evaluate the \nrelative cost effectiveness of various medical treatments, the National \nInstitutes of Health is already undertaking steps to use the stimulus \nmoney to conduct that kind of cost-based research.\n  As I indicated, Governor Sebelius was asked before the Finance \nCommittee how she plans to use comparative effectiveness research. As \nSecretary of HHS, she will be in the driver's seat in large part to \ndetermine how the policies of this administration and of this Congress \nwill be implemented. My colleague Senator Kyl from Arizona expressed \nhis concern before the Finance Committee vote in these words, with \nwhich I agree:\n\n       Unfortunately, Governor Sebelius' answers made it clear \n     that the Administration is unwilling to support pro-patient \n     safeguards. She left me with no assurance that HHS, federal \n     health care programs, or any new entity--such as the Federal \n     Coordinating Council--will not use comparative effectiveness \n     research as a tool to deny care. And this should be of \n     concern to all of us.\n\n  Instead of allowing the Federal Government to intrude further into \npersonal decisionmaking and medical care, I believe that health care \nreform should enhance the individual relationships between doctors and \ntheir patients. I am concerned that using comparative effectiveness \nresearch to justify treatment denials based on cost will significantly \nlimit patients' ability to choose health care services for individual \nneeds. It will also reduce--and this is important--medical innovation \nand quality of care.\n  When asked, Governor Sebelius did not have any convincing answers to \nwhat is one of the most important questions in the health care debate,\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nand that is, how do we contain rising health care costs, something that \nis going to render the Medicare Program insolvent in the next decade? \nAs any employer will tell us, it makes it increasingly more difficult \nfor employers to provide health care to their employees.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, spending on health care \nwill account for nearly 17 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States. In 2009, that will be as much as $2.6 trillion. America \nspends more than twice what other industrialized nations spend per \ncapita on health care. Can we claim our health care product is twice as \ngood as anywhere else in the world based on this increased spending? I \ndoubt it, even though American health care is very good. But I don't \nthink we could say we get our money's worth by spending twice as much \nas any other industrialized nation per capita on health care. Health \ncare insurance premiums have risen much faster than workers' wages in \nrecent years which means lower take-home pay for American workers. \nHealth care reforms must ensure that this trend is reversed or we will \nhave failed in one of the most important missions of health care \nreform.\n  In the Finance Committee, I asked Governor Sebelius her specific \nideas, other than delaying treatment and denying care, on how to \ncontain costs. In my office I asked her, what about health care \nliability reform which, in my State of Texas, has made health care much \nmore accessible by moderating the growth of medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums, providing a more level playing field when it comes \nto doctors and hospitals being sued. She basically did not have much of \nan answer for whether that should be included. I happen to believe it \nis one of the cost drivers in health care cost and has to be addressed. \nI submit, with no little modesty, that the State of Texas has \nexperience in this regard that the Federal Government could learn from. \nWhile I don't doubt some of the cost containment proposals in her \nanswers could be worthy of pursuing, Governor Sebelius failed to prove \nthat they will provide substantial savings in a $2.4 trillion health \ncare system. The Congressional Budget Office is also skeptical that the \nproposals she mentioned will result in any substantial savings.\n  Finally--and this should cause all of us to be concerned about \nwhether there actually will be cost containment or cost savings in \nhealth care reform--I am puzzled by the fact that President Obama's \nbudget actually asks for more money, $634 billion. That is not the \ntotal price; that is for a downpayment. In my State, as well as the \nState of the Presiding Officer, before people are accustomed to making \na downpayment, they usually want to know what they are buying. But the \nbudget proposal by the President called for $634 billion of additional \nspending as a downpayment in order to control costs in the long run, \nwhich is based on nothing more than hope, and that is hardly a \nstrategy.\n  We know we are already facing an unprecedented level of national \ndebt. Unfortunately, Congress, under the new administration, has \ncontributed greatly to the fact that we have seen more spending in the \nlast 90 days than we have seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in Hurricane \nKatrina recovery. We know we have $36 trillion more in unfunded \nliabilities in the Medicare Program alone. So at a time when we need to \nfigure out how we deal with unfunded obligations of the Federal \nGovernment, how do we more efficiently spend the 17 percent of gross \ndomestic product that makes us spend twice as much as any other country \nin the world per capita, we are ignoring some of the huge unfunded \nliabilities of the Federal Government, and we are asked to take as a \nmatter of faith that these proposals will result in savings without any \nconcrete plan which can be analyzed and evaluated in the light of day.\n  I firmly believe this country is spending enough money on health care \ntoday. What we need are innovative ideas about how to spend it more \nwisely. I have not heard any innovative ideas from Governor Sebelius or \nthe current administration.\n  What causes me even more concern is Governor Sebelius has made it \nclear that she supports a new government-run ``public plan'' for health \ncare that is unequivocally a gateway to a single payer system. A new \ngovernment-run public plan option will devastate private insurance \nmarkets by acting as a competitor, regulator, and funder. How in the \nworld can the private market compete when the Federal Government comes \nin and sets prices which will cause employers to give up their \nemployer-provided health insurance coverage to allow their employees to \nget coverage under the public plan? Indeed, the public plan, much like \nMedicare today, can be relied upon to use denial or delay or treatment \nrationing of health care in order to contain costs.\n  The independent Lewin Group analysis found that a new public plan \ncould mean that 118 million Americans will lose their current health \ncare coverage, and 130 million Americans could end up on a government-\nrun health care plan. That is what I mean as a ``gateway'' to a single \npayer system through this so-called innocuous sounding public plan \nwhich will run competition out, will undercut it, and make it \nimpossible to have the benefits of a competitive market, as we have \nseen on Medicare Part D, the prescription drug coverage plan, which \nactually, in an amazing feat, has a high public satisfaction and came \nin under proposed cost, mainly through a market-based mechanism that \ncreates a market for insurance companies to provide prescription drug \ncoverage. That is the kind of model we should be looking at to learn \nfrom in order to contain cost, not by Government delaying or denying \naccess to health care under the guise of a ``public plan.''\n  The Wall Street Journal recently wrote:\n\n       Because federal officials will run not only the new plan \n     but also the ``market'' in which it ``competes'' with private \n     programs--like playing both umpire and one of the teams on \n     the field--they will crowd out private alternatives and \n     gradually assume a health-care monopoly.\n\n  A public plan will also increase the cost of private health care. A \nreport by the actuary Milliman estimated the ``hidden tax'' commercial \npayers pay to subsidize the costs of Medicare and Medicaid equals \nroughly $88.8 billion per year. This means that the average health care \npremium is $1,512, or 10.6 percent, more annually per family than it \nwould be without the cost shift. A new so-called public plan option, \nwhich is a government-run program, would exacerbate the cost shift and \ndrive up the cost of private health care at a time when we must seek to \nlower health care costs.\n  Then there is the Washington Post that wrote on April 27:\n\n       [President Obama's] nominee for secretary of health and \n     human services, Kathleen Sebelius, said that she wants a \n     public plan to ``challenge private insurers to compete on \n     cost and quality'' but ``recognizes the importance of a level \n     playing field between plans and ensuring that private \n     insurance plans are not disadvantaged.''\n\n  The Washington Post said:\n\n       We disagree. It is difficult to imagine a truly level \n     playing field that would simultaneously produce benefits from \n     a government-run system.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Throughout the campaign last year, the President promised \nAmericans care such as Members of Congress receive. The irony is that \nMembers of Congress do not have access to a public plan. As a matter of \nfact, we don't need one because there are private plans that provide \nthe coverage we receive.\n  I am concerned that Governor Sebelius is not up to the challenge of \nfinding--and this is my final point--more than $90 billion of waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Medicare-Medicaid Program each year.\n  There are some who have said that what we need is Medicare for all. \nWell, right now Medicare, as I indicated, and Medicaid have roughly $90 \nbillion in fraud, abuse, and waste. I hope that is not what they mean--\nthat we need to carry over that kind of waste, fraud, and abuse into a \nMedicare or a single-payer system. According to an article in the \nWashington Post last year, more than $60 billion is lost each year to \nMedicare fraud alone. That is just Medicare--$60 billion of money that \ncould go to provide services to Medicare recipients that is lost to \npeople\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\nwho cheat and steal the Federal taxpayer. Medicaid services last year \nwere estimated to be about $32.7 billion similarly lost to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. Medicare and Medicaid fraud drive up the cost of \nhealth care and, I believe, represent an unacceptable mismanagement of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  When I asked Governor Sebelius about how she planned to fight fraud \nin our public programs, she only gave the vaguest of answers to my \nquestions. Additionally, her record as Governor tells me that she is \nnot yet ready to tackle that kind of fraud, waste, and abuse as \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The Kansas State Legislature is planning to have hearings on whether \nGovernor Sebelius was involved in a decision to provide more than \n$700,000 in ``extraordinary'' Medicaid funds to an organization linked \nto a number of her supporters. An article by the Kansas Health \nInstitute said that:\n\n       Regardless of the Medicaid question, which isn't likely to \n     be answered any time soon, many believe [the Medicaid \n     Director's] decision was based on the political connections \n     of those most closely involved.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Some Kansas officials are debating whether State oversight \n     of [Kansas'] Medicaid program was strong enough. The debate \n     focuses on the inspector general's office, created in 2007 \n     within the Kansas Health Policy Authority to ferret out \n     potential problems in Medicaid. The first inspector general \n     left in October and has told legislators the authority \n     hindered her work . . . The scrutiny came after a legislative \n     audit described $13 million in ``suspicious claims'' paid by \n     Medicaid in 2005 and 2006, before the authority took over the \n     bulk of the program. In one case, auditors said the program \n     paid a doctor $941 for a Cesarean section when the patient \n     was an 8-year-old boy.\n\n  Republicans and, indeed, all of us, I believe, want a new HHS \nSecretary to be someone committed to work with them to reform the \nhealth care system in a bipartisan process that will reach the best \nresult for the American public. Unfortunately, with a sense of \nforeboding, I read accounts that Democratic leadership wants to use the \nbudget reconciliation process to jam a partisan health care reform bill \nthrough on an expedited basis without adequate debate or deliberation. \nI think that would be the worst of all possible outcomes. This is a \nserious enough issue that we need true bipartisan buy-in and \ncontribution to workable health care reform.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Sebelius backed a highly partisan process for \nhealth care reform that excludes representatives of 50 percent of the \nAmerican people: the use of budget reconciliation that I mentioned. \nGovernor Sebelius refused to say that she would not support the use of \nreconciliation to pass health care reform. In her response to committee \nquestions, she wrote:\n\n       There are many tools available and none of those tools, \n     including reconciliation, should be taken off the table.\n\n  I am very concerned that using a partisan procedural trick to reform \na system that comprises 17 percent of our gross domestic product is not \nin the best interests of the American people. The American people \ndeserve open and full and honest debate about how to improve our health \ncare system, not this kind of partisanship.\n  Then, finally--and this is my final point--Governor Sebelius failed \nto disclose relevant information to the Finance Committee during the \nconsideration of her nomination. Not only was there the matter of her \ntax returns--something that, unfortunately, has become a trend, it \nseems, in this administration's nominees--she also failed to disclose \ncontributions from a controversial abortion provider until pressed by \nthe media.\n  The Associated Press wrote that:\n\n       When the discrepancy became public Sebelius acknowledged \n     getting an additional $23,000 from Tiller and his abortion \n     clinic beyond the $12,450 she initially reported.\n\n  While I appreciate her apology and her mention that it was only an \ninadvertent error, I am concerned that a Cabinet Secretary should be \nheld to a much higher and more transparent standard.\n  So I am sad to say I will not be able to support Governor Sebelius's \nnomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 27, 2009]\n\n                         Reforming Health Care\n\n       Of the many possible issues that could snarl health-care \n     reform, one of the biggest is whether the measure should \n     include a government-run health plan to compete with private \n     insurers. The public plan has become an unfortunate litmus \n     test for both sides. The opposition to a public plan option \n     is understandable; conservatives, health insurers, health-\n     care providers and others see it as a slippery step down the \n     slope to a single-payer system because, they contend, the \n     government's built-in advantages will allow it to unfairly \n     squash competitors.\n       For liberals, labor unions and others pushing to make \n     health care available to all Americans, however, the fixation \n     on a public plan is bizarre and counterproductive. Their \n     position elevates the public plan way out of proportion to \n     its importance in fixing health care. It is entirely possible \n     to imagine effective health-care reform--changes that would \n     expand coverage and help control costs--without a public \n     option.\n       President Obama has said that he favors a public option but \n     has been sketchy on details. His nominee for secretary of \n     health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, said that she \n     wants a public plan to ``challenge private insurers to \n     compete on cost and quality'' but ``recognizes the importance \n     of a level playing field between plans and ensuring that \n     private insurance plans are not disadvantaged.''\n       The argument for a public plan is that, without the need to \n     extensively market itself or make a profit, it would do a \n     better job of providing good health care at a reasonable \n     cost, setting an important benchmark against which private \n     insurers would be forced to compete. Even in a system where \n     insurers are required to take all applicants, public plan \n     advocates argue, incentives will remain for private plans to \n     discourage the less healthy from signing up; a public plan is \n     a necessary backstop. Moreover, if the playing field is \n     level, public plan advocates argue, private insurers--and \n     those who extol the virtues of a competitive marketplace--\n     should have nothing to fear.\n       We disagree. It is difficult to imagine a truly level \n     playing field that would simultaneously produce benefits from \n     a government-run system. While prescription drugs are not a \n     perfect comparison, the experience of competing plans in the \n     Medicare prescription drug arena suggests that a government-\n     run option is not essential to energize a competitive system \n     that has turned out to cost less than expected. Insurers and \n     private companies have been at least as innovative as the \n     federal government in recent years in finding ways to provide \n     quality care at lower costs. Medicare keeps costs under \n     control in part because of its 800-pound-gorilla capacity to \n     dictate prices--in effect, to force the private sector to \n     subsidize it. Such power, if exercised in a public health \n     option, eventually would produce a single-payer system; if \n     that's where the country wants to go, it should do so \n     explicitly, not by default. If the chief advantage of a \n     public option is to set a benchmark for private competitors, \n     that could be achieved in other ways, for example, by \n     providing for the entry of a public plan in case the private \n     marketplace did not perform as expected.\n       Maybe we're wrong. Maybe it's possible to design a public \n     option that aids consumers without undermining competition. \n     If so, we certainly wouldn't oppose a program that included a \n     public component. But it would be a huge mistake for the left \n     to torpedo reform over this question.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the hole we have inherited is a deep one. We \nare all in it together, and together is the only way we will be able to \nclimb out of it.\n  One step that will put us back on the path to prosperity is reforming \nour broken health care system.\n  We will soon begin debating the best way to give all Americans the \naccess to quality, affordable health care that they deserve. We will \nbegin to lay the groundwork for creating health care jobs that not will \nnot only improve the health of our economy but of Americans everywhere.\n  It will not be an easy task. It will take the cooperation of both \nRepublicans and Democrats. It will take the collaboration of both the \nWhite House and the Congress. But right now, the President is playing \nshorthanded.\n  Governor Sebelius will be a key player on his team. President Obama \nwill benefit from having her experience and temperament in his Cabinet, \nand all Americans will benefit from her extraordinary leadership.\n  Governor Sebelius has worked hard for the people of Kansas for more \nthan 20 years--the first 8 in the State legislature, then as the \nState's insurance commissioner for another 8 years. It is safe to say \nshe knows a thing or two about the complexities of insuring all \nAmericans and the urgency with which we must do so.\n  On her way to becoming insurance commissioner, Kathleen Sebelius \nrefused to take campaign contributions from insurance companies. Once \nshe got there, she made her mark by cracking down on HMOs and saving \ntaxpayers money.\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\n  For the last 6 years, she has served as the Democratic Governor of a \nbright red State. One doesn't succeed--let alone get reelected--in that \nenvironment without knowing how to put people ahead of partisanship. \nGovernor Sebelius did just that--she expanded health care for children \nand made both health care and prescription drugs more affordable for \neveryone.\n  Her integrity is beyond reproach, her expertise is essential, and her \nconfirmation is long overdue.\n  The only way for our economy to fully recover is by making the \ncritical investment of reforming health care. The stakes are too high \nand the cost of inaction is too great.\n  If we are going to start digging out of this hole, we must start by \nfilling the hole over at HHS. And if we are going to fix our broken \nhealth care system, who is better equipped to lead that effort than \nKathleen Sebelius?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to convey this afternoon some \nbrief remarks on the new strategy of the United States for Afghanistan \nand Pakistan announced by President Obama last month. I applaud his \nstatement, and I applaud the sharpening of focus this new \nadministration has brought to our mission in this critical region of \nthe world. For too long, our policy in both Afghanistan and Pakistan \nhas drifted--overly reliant on support for individual leaders, \nexcessively ambitious in our goals for the region, and, finally, \nlacking any constraints or accountability for the billions of tax \ndollars of the United States spent in both countries.\n  President Obama made clear during the campaign last year that we \ncould no longer pair grandiose rhetoric with paltry resources when it \ncomes to U.S. policy toward those two nations.\n  Accordingly, in one of his first national security decisions, he \nestablished a 60-day comprehensive review of our entire policy. He \nasked the respected Bruce Riedel to take leave from the Brookings \nInstitution and oversee this review.\n  The policy review is now complete. With the full support of Admiral \nMullen and General Petraeus, the President is dispatching an additional \n4,000 troops to train and advise the Afghan Army as it grows in size \nand scope to shoulder the burden of securing Afghanistan on its own.\n  The President is dramatically increasing our civilian presence in \nAfghanistan, recognizing that we cannot win this conflict on military \nterms alone but must provide a robust development and diplomatic \ncapability to complement our brave fighting men and women.\n  Finally, the Obama administration recognizes we cannot separate \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, to pretend as if they were two separate \nchallenges. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Following the successful offensive of the United States in \nAfghanistan in 2001 and 2002, hard-line Taliban and al-Qaida elements \nsuccessfully relocated to western Pakistan. From there, they have \ncreated a sanctuary to attack troops of the United States, to \ndestabilize eastern and southern Afghanistan, and to launch attacks on \nPakistani military units and civilian installations.\n  Moreover, these radical elements are beginning to move westward \nwithin Pakistan, threatening the stability of the Pakistani state. I am \nextremely concerned by the speed with which the Taliban is gaining \nground, especially in the areas close to Islamabad, the capital. I know \nthe administration is working with our partners in Pakistan to prevent \nthe situation from deteriorating even further. We must continue to work \nwith the Government of Pakistan to prevent these radical groups from \ndestabilizing the Pakistani State and the region. As we all know, \nPakistan has a nuclear arsenal which would pose a grave threat should \nit fall under the control of extremists.\n  The recent gains of the Taliban show how interrelated the threats in \nPakistan and Afghanistan are. The threat in Afghanistan feeds off the \nthreat in Pakistan and vice versa. We must treat this for what it is: \none theater that requires a unified approach.\n  The President laid out, in vivid terms, why this is so important that \nwe achieve success in our mission in both countries. Let me quote from \nhis speech laying out the new strategy. I am quoting President Obama:\n\n       Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that Al Qaeda \n     is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its \n     safe-haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan government falls to \n     the Taliban--or allows Al Qaeda to go unchallenged--that \n     country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill \n     as many of our people as they possibly can.\n\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\n\n  It gets no clearer than that. The very people who attacked us on 9/11 \nare plotting future attacks on us in Afghanistan and the border region \nin Pakistan. We must disrupt and neutralize these groups before they \nstrike again.\n  A theme I have emphasized in recent weeks is that the President, \nsupported by his Cabinet officers and top aides, must continue to \nengage the American people on why our mission in Afghanistan and \nPakistan is so essential to our national security. In other words, it \nis not enough to have one Presidential speech on our strategy and then \nto ignore the issue. I know this President, and I understand he will \nnot do that. Instead, he will continue to talk about the importance of \nthe sacrifices being made by our fighting men and women in that \ntheater. He will lay out a series of benchmarks to measure progress by \nthe Afghan and Pakistani Governments and then give us clear indications \nas to how they are doing. The American people will support their \nCommander in Chief but only provided they are given updates on the \nprogress achieved at regular intervals.\n  Let me conclude with one final observation. During the lead up to and \nthe early execution of the Iraq war, the Congress was rightly \ncriticized for being missing in action. Tough questions on our mission \nand our strategy were not asked often enough. Administration assertions \nwere too often taken at face value. We cannot allow that to happen \nagain, not in a military conflict so vital to the security of the \nAmerican people.\n  I support the President wholeheartedly, but that support is neither \nblind nor unthinking. I happen to chair the Senate Foreign Relations \nsubcommittee responsible for the Middle East and South Asia. \nAccordingly, Afghanistan and Pakistan fall within my subcommittee's \njurisdiction. I intend to hold hearings later this year to review the \nadministration's implementation of the strategy it announced recently, \nwith a special focus on the promised benchmarks for success in both \ncountries.\n  Effective congressional oversight is essential if the United States \nis to have unity of purpose and unity of will to, as the President has \nsaid, disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan and to prevent their return to either country in the \nfuture.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4796-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4796-S4799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BANKRUPTCY CODE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, later this week, probably tomorrow or \nThursday, we will consider an amendment which I will offer relative to \nthe Bankruptcy Code. I can remember not that many years ago, when we \nreformed the Bankruptcy Code, I was a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--a new member--and the ranking chairman of the Subcommittee \non Bankruptcy was Senator Grassley of Iowa. He had worked on this for \nquite some time.\n  I looked around the Senate Judiciary Committee and reflected on my \ncolleagues, many of whom had served for years in the Senate and on that \ncommittee. But when it came to the issue of bankruptcy, 10 years ago, I \nrealized something that was a little amazing. By virtue of the fact \nthat I had taken a course in bankruptcy at Georgetown Law School 30 \nyears before--a 3-hour, one-semester course--and had been appointed a \ntrustee in bankruptcy in the Federal court in Springfield, IL, over a \nbankrupt gas station, I had more experience in bankruptcy than any \nmember of the committee.\n  Nevertheless, we embarked on this reform of the Bankruptcy Code--a \nmassive undertaking. It took years before it was finally accomplished, \nand during the course of that a lot of amendments were offered. Of \ncourse, I viewed bankruptcy then and now as the last resort of \ndesperate people. But, sadly, many millions of Americans have found \nthis to be the only thing to which they can turn. They have reached \nsuch a point in their lives and in their economic experience where they \nhave no choice but to turn to bankruptcy court and try to wipe the \nslate clean and to start over.\n  The major reasons people go into bankruptcy are pretty obvious--the \nloss of a job; the No. 1 reason, of course, is health care bills. \nPeople end up with bills that aren't covered by insurance and have no \nplace else to turn. Sometimes a bitter divorce will end in bankruptcy \ncourt. It is rare that people turn to it. I think many of the critics \nof bankruptcy think people are just looking for any opportunity to go \nto bankruptcy court. I don't think that is the case with the majority \nof those petitioners who file for bankruptcy.\n  So here I am again, some 10 years later, looking at the Bankruptcy \nCode, but this time in a different context altogether. At this point in \ntime, more and more Americans are headed for bankruptcy court for a new \nreason. They are losing their homes. They fell behind in their payments \non their mortgages, became delinquent, and now face foreclosure. You \nknow what I am talking about--people who have lost their jobs, people \nwho signed up for mortgages that were very misleading, people who ended \nup in a circumstance where the mortgage they signed ends up triggering \na new interest rate they can't sustain. So the most important asset \nthey have on Earth--their home--is about to be lost, and they are \nheaded to bankruptcy court to try to salvage something out of their \nlives.\n  Now, if the person headed for bankruptcy court facing foreclosure on \ntheir home is well off and has other real estate, such as a vacation \ncondo in Arizona or Florida, it is interesting what the bankruptcy \ncourt can do. The person who comes in filing for bankruptcy facing \nforeclosure on two pieces of real estate, the home and the vacation \ncondo, finds out that the court treats them totally different.\n  When it comes to the vacation condo, the bankruptcy judge sits down, \ntakes a look at the assets of the person filing for bankruptcy, and \ntries to determine whether at the end of the day they can ever make \nanother mortgage payment. For some, it is hopeless; they have lost a \njob and they are so far behind it will never work. But for others, they \nare right on the edge. So the bankruptcy judge has the power, when it \ncomes to the vacation condo, to rewrite the terms of the mortgage that \nis being foreclosed upon because the judge concludes that the person \ncan make a mortgage payment, if in fact the person is given a new \ninterest rate or a new term for the mortgage.\n  That is what they can do with the vacation condo. But what can the \nbankruptcy judge do when you file for bankruptcy facing foreclosure on \nyour home? The answer is nothing. There is nothing the court can do. \nThere could literally be a circumstance where a person could have a \nrestructured mortgage coming out of bankruptcy to save that condo in \nFlorida but lose their home. That is the way the law is written.\n  The same is true when it comes to farms and ranches. Not long ago \nsome of the critics of my amendment were pushing in Congress and in the \nSenate a revision in the bankruptcy law which said, if someone goes \ninto bankruptcy facing foreclosure on their farm, then we ought to let \nthe bankruptcy judge see if they can rewrite the terms of the mortgage. \nWe passed that into law. The same thing applies to ranches--farms, \nranches, second homes, and vacation condos. The bankruptcy court has \nthat power. But when it comes to your home it does not.\n  How do you explain that? Why in the world could someone turn to the \nbankruptcy court for relief for every piece of property but the most \nimportant one in life? The answer is that it is the law, and that is \nwhat the Durbin amendment would change.\n  Of course, there are some who do not like this change--the banks. \nThey don't like this change because it means at the end of the day, if \nthey will not sit down with someone facing foreclosure to try to work \nout and renegotiate the terms of the mortgage--at the end of the day \nthat person may go to bankruptcy court and end up having a judge do it. \nThat is the court of last resort when one is facing foreclosure under \nmy amendment. So that is why many of the banks resist it. They don't \nwant to sit down and renegotiate the terms of the mortgage.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\n  Now let's take a look at where we are in America today. This is not \nthe first time I offered this amendment. I offered it last year to give \nthe bankruptcy court this power. When I offered it, the critics said: \nWe don't need it. Mortgage foreclosure is not that big of a problem.\n  When I offered this amendment last year, we estimated that 2 million \nAmerican homes would be lost to foreclosure. Since then things have \nchanged dramatically. The best estimate now from Moody's, a group that \nmost people trust when it comes to making economic forecasts, is that \ninstead of losing 2 million homes to foreclosure in America we are \nlikely to lose more than 8 million homes to foreclosure in America.\n  What would 8 million homes in foreclosure represent? It would \nrepresent one out of every six home mortgages in America.\n  Visualize your own street you live on or the building in which you \nlive. Imagine how many people are paying a mortgage payment on that \nstreet. Now imagine that one out of six loses their home. What impact \ndoes that have on you as a neighbor? It is not good. The value of your \nhome goes down if there is a foreclosure in your neighborhood. Even \nworse, your neighborhood could change.\n  A foreclosed home, 99 percent of the time, goes back to the bank. It \nis not sold on the market and reoccupied. It sits there. I have seen \nthem. I have seen them in Chicago, and I have seen them in Springfield, \nIL. These are homes that are boarded up with plywood. The lots in front \nof them look like a trash heap. Many times vandals come in and rip out \nthe plumbing if they can get some copper pipe out of it, and sometimes \nit ends up becoming a haven for criminal activity and drug trafficking. \nIt can literally destroy a neighborhood, and I have seen that happen--\none foreclosed home.\n  Why? The banks can't do anything with it. They can't sell it on this \nmarket. They certainly do not put the time in to maintain the home as \nyou would your own home in that same neighborhood. And everybody \nsuffers as a result of it.\n  In addition, the banks that go through mortgage foreclosure end up \nspending $50,000--that is about the average of what it costs a bank to \nhave a home foreclosed upon.\n  It looks as if there are a lot of losers in this process I have just \ndescribed. A family loses their home, a neighborhood sees a decline in \nvalue of all the real estate around it, and there is an eyesore at \nleast, and maybe worse, and the bank ends up with a $50,000 debt. One \nwould think under those circumstances that banks would be anxious to \ntry to figure out if they could keep a person in their home.\n  I told a story last night which I think illustrates it. A flight \nattendant on a flight back to Chicago pulled me aside and said: I am a \nsingle mom with three kids. I have a home in the suburbs. My mortgage \nrate is too high. I can't make the payments anymore. I don't want to \nlose the home. If I could just renegotiate now to the lower interest \nrate I can make the monthly payments, and I could save my home. But \nwhat am I supposed to do?\n  And the answer I had to tell her was, basically: Beg the bank, and if \nthey won't go along with renegotiating the mortgage, you are in a \npretty sorry situation. You are facing delinquency, default, and \nforeclosure in a credit situation that is going to be absolutely \nhorrible.\n  So we wrote this bill, not just to give the bankruptcy court the \npower to renegotiate the terms of the mortgage but also to set up \nconditions. Here are the conditions: The first one is, if someone is \nanticipating going to bankruptcy court, they are required to present to \ntheir lender, the bank with their mortgage, at least 45 days in advance \nof filing bankruptcy, the legal documentation of their economic \ncircumstances: an indication of their income, a balance sheet on their \nassets and liabilities so the bank can take a look at them and see if \nthere is a way to save this person who might otherwise face \nforeclosure.\n  I think about that flight attendant. She could prove that she has a \nsteady job. She goes to work every day. She has been a model citizen, \nbut she got caught in a bad mortgage, and when the ARM reset she \ncouldn't keep up with it. At that point, if the bank offers her a \nrenegotiated mortgage where she is paying at least 31 percent of her \ngross income as the mortgage payment--if the bank makes that offer, \nthen this flight attendant and others, if they do not take the offer, \ncannot ask for the bankruptcy court to change the terms of the \nmortgage.\n  It is pretty basic. We put a limit on how much of a house someone can \ntake into this process. It is about $729,000. We also say that only \nloans that originated before January 1 of this year are eligible for \nmodification. The loans must be at least 60 days delinquent before they \nare eligible for modification, and only loans for which a foreclosure \nnotice has been sent are eligible. So it is an emergency, a pretty \ndrastic circumstance before a person would exercise these rights, go to \na bank, put their documentation on the table and see if they could get \na renegotiation of their mortgage.\n  I think it is a reasonable way to stop some of the mortgage \nforeclosures, and I think this is essential if we are going to turn \nthis economy around. This recession started in the mortgage market, and \nit will not end until we straighten out that same market.\n  Unfortunately, there were a lot of smooth operators out there. Let me \ntell you the story of one woman in Chicago, and I think this is such a \nclassic illustration. This lady had worked her whole life at a little \nfactory, and she had saved up a little bit of money but she was \ncounting on Social Security. She had basically paid off the house in \nwhich she lived and she was in retirement. She had the Social Security \nchecks coming in and, of course, she believed she was in a secure \nsituation.\n  A knock comes on the door, and a person says: Mrs. So-and-So, I just \nwanted to let you know you aren't living on one lot, you are living on \ntwo lots. You see, it turns out there are two parcels here. Your \nbackyard is a separate real estate parcel and you have failed to pay \nthe taxes on it and it has been sold at a tax sale.\n  This is a woman, a wonderful woman who worked her whole life. She \nwasn't a lawyer or an accountant or a real estate expert, and she went \ninto a panic, to think that somebody was going to build something in \nher backyard.\n  She said: What can I do?\n  They said: You have to come up with money to buy back from the tax \nsale for the real estate taxes that went unpaid.\n  It turned out they had been mailing the notices of the taxes to \nanother address. She wasn't aware of it.\n  So she looked around and saw on television an offer for a home \nrefinancing. She called the 800 number, and the next day somebody \nshowed up at her house and said: We can take care of this. This poor \nlady, 48 hours later, was brought into an office of a mortgage broker \nin Chicago. This is all happening in 72 hours. They sat her down at a \ntable without asking for any evidence of her income or her net worth \nand handed her a stack of papers and said: Just sign these papers.\n  If you have ever been through a real estate closing, have you ever \nfelt so hopeless in your life as with that stack of papers? As a lawyer \nI used to sit there and think: I hope I have looked through everything \nthat is in there because it is page after page of small print, most of \nit in terms most people wouldn't understand.\n  She signed all of these documents. They gave her the money to buy the \nlot back from the tax sale, and they said we will give you a little \nextra money on the side. She thought everything worked out. The monthly \npayment was something she could handle.\n  Then came the reset. In a matter of a year or two the reset on the \nmortgage, this adjustable rate mortgage, drove the monthly payment up \nto the point where they were taking 80 percent of her Social Security \ncheck. She was about to lose her home, the whole thing now, because of \nwhat she had signed up for.\n  That is when I met her in this desperate circumstance, where she \nturned to people and said: Is there anybody who can help me out of this \nmess? She was in her late sixties and just beside herself to think that \nshe would have to give up this home that she had hoped to live in for \nthe rest of her life.\n\n  Thank goodness a bank did step forward, refinanced the whole project \nat a reasonable interest rate, and she was\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nable to stay in the home. But her story is not unlike a lot of others \nwhere people got into a circumstance with a mortgage broker and a bank \nand ended up signing up for a mortgage they couldn't handle. It \nhappened to a lot of people.\n  These mortgage brokers--incidentally, many of them were engaged in \npredatory lending; that is breaking the law--fraud, misleading people \nbecause it was a hot market. Boy, if you could move a mortgage as \nquickly as possible, the next thing you knew it was part of a big \nsecurity arrangement off with some big bank somewhere.\n  When I talked to the banks about giving people a second chance facing \nmortgage foreclosure, the banks told me: These people made a big \nmistake. Why should we bail them out of their mistake? Why should we \nfeel any responsibility to them for the mistakes they made?\n  It is a pretty heartless argument. It is even worse nowadays because \nthe very same banks, such as the American Bankers Association, and the \ncommunity banks--not as many of those, I might add, but the very same \nbanks that are saying these people have to pay a price for bad \ndecisions, many of these banks were in line to receive millions if not \nbillions of Federal dollars because of the same mistakes they made. \nWhen they made a business mistake, they ended up turning to the \nGovernment and our taxpayers. All of us ended up trying to help our \nbanks get out of the mess they created with these subprime mortgages \nand the instruments that followed.\n  So the same banks that made these terrible mistakes, built these \nrotten portfolios, facing bankruptcy themselves, about to go out of \nbusiness, happily took the money in from the Federal Government and \nnow, when we say to them: What about the victims on the south side of \nChicago or Albany Park or near Midway Airport--what about them? Can we \ngive them a second chance? No, sir. Don't you understand what a moral \nhazard is? People have to pay the price for bad mistakes.\n  Bankers, obviously, don't believe they have to pay the price. Sadly, \nthe situation is one that will be manifest in the vote we are about to \ntake in just a few hours--maybe in the next day or two--on the Senate \nfloor. I have been working on this for 2 years. I thought this was \nunfair at the start, that the bankruptcy court could not sit and rework \nthis mortgage as it can for so many other pieces of property. I didn't \nrealize when I started this journey that 2 years later we would still \nbe talking about millions of homes facing foreclosure and people \ndesperate for it.\n  America is going to be a different place if 8 million homes face \nforeclosure. Unfortunately, a lot of towns are going to be different \nand a lot of neighborhoods are going to be different and these bankers \nare counting on the fact that at the end of the day, Uncle Sam will \nkeep sending them money, trying ways to buy them out because they are \ntoo big to fail. The banks are too big to fail. These financial \ninstitutions, they know at the end of the day they are going to get a \nhelping hand from this Government. But when we asked them to give a \nhelping hand to people facing foreclosure, they walked away from the \ntable. They walked away from the table. They would not negotiate with \nus, even though we put in reasonable requirements for people to do the \nright thing. They walked away from it. They feel no responsibility \ntoward these people. That is unfortunate. It is unfortunate for the \nvictims. It is unfortunate for our Nation.\n  This is not the last time we are going to visit the issues involving \nbanks. I have learned the hard way that they are a pretty powerful \nlobby. One would think after what we have been through with this real \nestate bubble--the subprime mortgage mess with a lot of these banks, \npeople trying to run away with multimillion-dollar bonuses in the midst \nof taking money from the Federal Government--one would think with all \nof that, the bankers wouldn't have the political clout in the Senate, \nbut they do.\n  It is going to be a real test to see if we can come up with the 60 \nvotes we need in the Senate to change this law and give these \nhomeowners a fighting chance. I am not sure we can, but I think it is \nworth the effort.\n  I might say to the bankers, if you beat me this week--I hope you do \nnot but if you do--hang on tight; we are coming back at you next week.\n  Do you know what we are going to talk about next week? Credit cards. \nWe are going to talk about what these banks do with credit cards to \nconsumers and families and businesses across America. And you know what \nI am talking about, situations where people face interest rates that \nall of a sudden mushroom overnight for no apparent reason.\n  I have had this happen. Send your payment in a day late. Watch what \nhappens. You not only get a penalty for being a day late, they charge \nyou interest on the penalty, and then interest again the following \nmonths. It just keeps coming at you.\n  You start adding it up and you think to yourself, this is an outrage. \nAnd it is an outrage. Time and again what these banks have done with \ntheir credit cards is to put people in a credit trap.\n  They had a feature on NOVA that I watched last year analyzing the \ncredit card industry. It had this one fellow in there who is considered \nthe wizard of credit cards. This man was the greatest mind in the world \nwhen it came to credit cards. A curious thing about him, though, they \nwould not identify where he lived. They made a point of saying, he \nwould only agree to an interview if we did not disclose where he lived. \nVery unusual, right.\n  Well, this man, in his infinite genius, came up with the following: \nHe came up with the idea that the minimum monthly payment, instead of \nbeing 4 percent, should be 2 percent. Do you know why? Because if you \npay 2 percent a month you will never, ever get out of debt. You are \nstuck. The minimum monthly payment is a guarantee that the interest is \ngoing to eat up everything you pay by the next month.\n  During the bankruptcy debate here, I had a simple little amendment. \nThe amendment said this: If you have on your monthly statement a \nminimum monthly payment on the credit card, the bank issuing the credit \ncheck has to put below that minimum monthly payment: And if you make \nthe minimum monthly payment, it will take you X months to pay off the \nbalance and you will pay X dollars in interest.\n  The credit card companies refused to put that information on the \nmonthly statement. And you know what they said to me: It is impossible \nto calculate that. Sure it is. It is impossible to calculate it, \nbecause they know if the average borrower, the person with that credit \ncard, knew what that monthly minimum payment meant, they would think \nlong and hard about whether that is all they are going to send in.\n  It is tough love in a way. Some people did get overextended in \ncredit. But these credit card companies milked it for every penny it \nwas worth. Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut is going to bring us this \ncredit card reform bill. The House of Representatives is about to pass \none this week.\n  So next week, I would say to my friends at the financial institutions \nand the banking industry: Hold on tight. We are coming at you again. \nAnd this time we are going to try to help out the consumers across the \ncountry, to help out the families who are being ripped off by credit \ncards every day, every single day.\n  In a tough economy, people who turn to these credit cards in \ndesperation sometimes are the most helpless victims. I think it ought \nto go beyond that. I would not stop there. I have legislation which \ndoes something that has not been done in a long time in this country. \nIt establishes a usury rate. Usury used to be the established ceiling, \nthe maximum, that you can charge for interest. We got away from that a \nlong time ago. We said, we will let the market decide.\n  Well, I put in a bill that said: The maximum you can charge for \ninterest for any 1-year period is 36 percent. That would be for \nmortgages, that would be for credit cards, basic loans. The reason I \npicked that number was that a few years ago we decided that members of \nthe U.S. military and their families were being exploited so badly by \nthe pay-day loans and title loans and installment loan operations that \nwe put a limit on the interest rate that can be charged to our military \nand their families of 36 percent. Why? Because a lot of soldiers \nborrowing money, their family borrowing money, got so deeply in debt \nand could not get out of it, they had to leave the military service. \nAfter being trained and\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nready to serve our country, they could not continue. So we put this \nprotection in of 36 percent.\n  If that is good enough to protect our military, why is it not good \nenough to protect every American? I think 36 percent is reasonable. But \nI learned something as soon as I introduced that bill. It is amazing \nthat this industry, like the title loan business, and the pay-day loan \nbusiness, it is amazing what they will come in, sit down in your office \nand say to you with a straight face. I said to this group in Chicago: \nWell, how much do you charge in interest at these pay-day loans and \ntitle loans?\n  The fellow said: Senator, you know it is the circumstance.\n  I said: How much do you charge?\n  Well, you know, on an annual basis somewhere between 58 and 358 \npercent.\n  What--58 and 358 percent?\n  Yes, but those are circumstances.\n  It gets down to the bottom line. Those people should not be in \nbusiness. These poor people who think they are borrowing money are \nnever going to get out of that hole. And we make it legal in this \ncountry. If you did it as part of some gangland activity, it would be \nextortion, and it might lead to criminal prosecution. But if you do it \nwith a certain sign in front of your business, it is considered the \nfree market at work. Well, I think it is the free market run amok. That \nis why I think it needs to be changed.\n  So we are going to face this vote this coming week. It is a very \nimportant one. It is one I hope will change the landscape. I hope that \nmore homes will be spared from foreclosure. And I hope we can start \nstabilizing the real estate market.\n  I think when we do, we are going to find our way out of this \nrecession. Until we do, we are going to keep looking for the bottom. \nHow many homes will go in foreclosure? How many will sit vacant? And \nhow low can the value of our homes go for those of us paying our \nmortgages every month?\n  That is what we are up against. We have not found that bottom yet, \nbecause the banks are not prepared to step forward and support any \nlegislation that gives those people a fighting chance. They will have \ntheir opportunity this week in the Senate to speak.\n  Members of the Senate, tomorrow, I will go through State by State and \nshow you what some of these States are facing. Mortgage foreclosures \nare bad in Illinois. Some parts of Chicago are horrible. But in some \nStates it is devastating.\n  I think Nevada is a classic example of a State where mortgage \nforeclosures are out of hand at this point. We have got to do \nsomething. We have got to step forward. The President supports this \nproposal I am bringing to the floor. I hope we can find some Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, particularly on the Republican side of the \naisle, who will join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4799-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        STATUTORY TIME-PERIODS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that yesterday the Senate \npassed the Statutory Time-Periods Technical Amendments Act of 2009, \nH.R. 1626. This good-government bill creates a more consistent and \nstandard method for lawyers and judges to calculate court deadlines. It \nis a small but important bipartisan bill that will improve the \neffectiveness of our judicial system.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives passed this bill on their \nsuspension calendar. The Senate has given its unanimous support to this \nlegislation, and I look forward to the President signing this bill.\n  Last month, I introduced an identical measure in the Senate with \nSenators Specter, Whitehouse, and Sessions. In the last few weeks, I \nhave worked with many others in the House and Senate to ensure that \nthis legislation proceeded quickly through both Chambers of Congress. \nRepresentative Hank Johnson has worked especially hard to move this \nbill through the House. We have a strong bipartisan bill that will \nresult in significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness \nof our judicial system.\n  This legislation incorporates the full recommendations of the \nJudicial Conference of the United States to alter deadlines in certain \nstatutes affecting court proceedings to account for recent amendments \nto the Federal time-computation rules. It provides judges and \npractitioners with commonsense deadlines that are less confusing and \nless complex than current deadlines and also ensures that existing time \nperiods are not shortened.\n  After much study and significant public comment, the Judicial \nConference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and \nthe Advisory Committees on Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal \nRules arrived at proposed new rules intended to provide predictability \nand uniformity to the current process of calculating court deadlines. \nThe proposed rules respond, in part, to findings from the Judicial \nConference that the current time-computation process is confusing and \ncan lead to missed deadlines and litigants' loss of important rights. \nUnder the current time-calculation rules, weekends and holidays are not \ncounted when calculating court deadlines of less than 30 days but are \ncounted for calculating court deadlines longer than 30 days. The \nproposed new rules simplify this process by counting holidays and \nweekends regardless of a court deadline's time period. According to the \nJudicial Conference, these proposed changes would respond to \npractitioners' complaints and concerns from judges.\n  This legislation amends a number of Federal civil and criminal \nstatutes affecting court proceedings and harmonizes them with the \nproposed rules. First, this remedial bill alters certain statutory \ncourt deadlines to counterbalance any shortening of the time period \nresulting from the ``days are days'' approach. For example, the bill \nchanges 5 days to 7 days, and 10 days to 14 days, to prevent time \nperiods from becoming shorter when a practitioner counts all days, \nincluding weekends. This change would, in effect, maintain the same \ntime periods in the statutes. In addition, if a time period ends on a \nholiday or a weekend, the time period would be extended to the next \nbusiness day. The bill also changes some statutory deadlines that would \notherwise be inconsistent with the amended rules deadlines and lead to \nconfusion.\n  Both the Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference urge swift \nconsideration of this proposal on or before December 1 of this year, \nthe date the Judicial Conference's amendments to the rules take effect. \nI am pleased that we are able to accommodate their request.\n  Passing this bill is the right thing to do. I know that the legal \ncommunity will benefit from the uniform court deadlines that this \nlegislation provides. American citizens will have their rights more \nfully protected by court deadlines that are clear and unambiguous. Even \nmore, public confidence in our justice system can only be strengthened \nwhen court procedures operate in a manner that is free of any \nunnecessary confusion.\n  I thank the Department of Justice and the wide array of legal and bar \norganizations that have supported the Judicial Conference's \nrecommendations incorporated in this bill, including of the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers, the Council of Appellate Lawyers, and the \nAmerican Bar Association's Section of Litigation and Criminal Justice \nSection. I am especially grateful to the Administrative Office of the \nCourts which, on behalf of the Judicial Conference, sent us those \npolicy recommendations from the Federal judiciary. Those \nrecommendations are included in this bill, and I commend them for their \nhard work and attention to this issue.\n  Only a few months into a new administration and a new Congress, it is \nincumbent upon us to continue to focus on the requirements of the \nFederal judiciary that our citizens and our Republic need and deserve. \nThe measure we passed yesterday is a positive step in the right \ndirection.\n  I look forward to President Obama promptly signing it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4799-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4799-S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SHAP SMITH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the remarkable leadership of Mr. Shap Smith who represents \nthe towns of Elmore, Morristown, Woodbury, and Worcester, and who is \nnow the current speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives.\n  Having recently assumed the role of speaker at the beginning of this \nlegislative session in January, Mr. Smith\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nhas already made his mark as a fair-minded and seasoned leader. He has \ndriven the successful passage of several pieces of legislation, \naddressing Vermont's sexual abuse response system and legalizing same-\nsex marriage, among other important issues. Marcelle and I recently had \ndinner with Shap and his wife Dr. Melissa Volansky. We are both \nimpressed with his commitment to Vermont.\n  I am looking forward to watching Shap Smith continue to lead the \nVermont Legislature and build a record of fiscal and social \nresponsibility. I wish him luck as he undertakes this challenging job \nduring these difficult times.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an April 20, 2009, Rutland \nHerald article about Mr. Smith be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Apr. 20, 2009]\n\n                    Smith Leads With Grinning Style\n\n                            (By Susan Allen)\n\n       Montpelier.--Each speaker of the Vermont House has his or \n     her own leadership style.\n       Ralph Wright growled.\n       Michael Obuchowski boomed.\n       Walt Freed ruled.\n       Gaye Symington analyzed.\n       And Shap Smith . . . well, he grins.\n       ``I'm a friendly guy,'' said House Speaker Smith, new to \n     the post this session, when asked last week about his style. \n     Smith, himself a Democrat, reaches across the political aisle \n     to work with Republicans, Progressives and Democrats alike.\n       But don't think he's a pushover.\n       ``People know I take the issues pretty seriously,'' added \n     Smith, a University of Vermont and Indiana University School \n     of Law graduate who handles intellectual property, insurance \n     coverage and civil litigation with the firm Dinse/Knapp/\n     McAndrew during the off-session. ``I can go toe-to-toe in \n     debating issues.''\n       Looking at the speaker, opponents might be tempted to \n     underestimate his political skills. With a wiry frame from \n     running, cross-country skiing and other athletic activities, \n     and his wire-rimmed glasses, Smith looks about 25. He is, in \n     fact, 43.\n       And anyone who thought he might be too young to lead need \n     look no further than the recent House vote to override the \n     governor's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. Smith needed \n     100 members to support the override, and going into the vote, \n     the outcome was far from certain.\n       As he announced the final tally to the House floor--to the \n     surprise of many, the needed 100 voted with the speaker and \n     same-sex marriage would become law in Vermont--Smith stepped \n     away from the podium briefly and appeared emotional.\n       ``I have friends and colleagues to whom and for whom this \n     bill meant a great deal,'' he said during a conversation last \n     week in his window-lined Statehouse office. ``I am very \n     pleased we were able to do it. It was a great achievement.''\n       Shap is actually Shapleigh Jr., a name that came from his \n     grandmother, who was adopted into the Shapleigh family from \n     the town of Shapleigh, Maine. His grandmother grew up in West \n     Lebanon, N.H., where ``there were all these Shapleighs,'' he \n     added.\n       ``I went to high school in Morrisville. I always wanted a \n     different name,'' Smith said. ``Dave or Tim would have been \n     just fine. Shapleigh is not a usual Vermont name.''\n       Smith had an eye on public service since serving in student \n     government in school. He followed politics closely in the \n     1990s while living in New York City and working for a law \n     firm there, and started becoming more serious about a run \n     after moving to Morrisville in 1999.\n       In 2002, with 2-month-old son Eli at home but an open \n     legislative seat calling, he took the plunge, becoming what \n     he described as the ``Stealth'' candidate knocking on doors, \n     re-acquainting himself with friends from childhood and their \n     families, and quietly winning the seat under the radar.\n       As all legislative leaders discover, juggling the pressing \n     Statehouse agenda and a home life is challenging (he has two \n     young children, and wife Melissa is a general practitioner).\n       ``I go home almost every night,'' he said, adding that he \n     tries to arrive in time to read to his children or at least \n     put them to bed. ``I'm the one that gets them up in the \n     morning, which is a real reality check.''\n       Things are less clear at the Statehouse, where Smith is \n     focusing on his legislative agenda:\n       (1) Repairing and maintaining Vermont's transportation \n     system--the roads and bridges;\n       (2) Expanding and improving telecommunications (computer \n     broadband) in rural areas;\n       (3) Strengthening Vermont's public education system; and\n       (4) Trying to close the gap in educational performance \n     between students on the lower economic scale and their \n     wealthier peers--a disparity consistently documented in \n     national and state school test scores.\n       Hanging over those priorities is the staggering challenge \n     of trying to balance the state budget in dire economic times, \n     with the state hemorrhaging red ink. It is, he said, a task \n     that ``keeps me up at night.''\n       ``How do you balance being fiscally responsible with \n     meeting the needs of the state?'' he asked rhetorically. And \n     while not completely unexpected, the economic challenge has \n     been ``worse than some of us thought it would be.''\n       Returning to the place he was raised, meeting and re-\n     meeting neighbors, old friends and classmates, and watching \n     his children grow up in the same area he did seems to drive \n     Smith's political vision.\n       ``I want to make sure we put in place policies that allow \n     the next generation to have the opportunities that I did,'' \n     he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4800-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING AL MYERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am both proud and saddened today to \nsalute Mr. Al Myers, a beloved teacher at Williston Central School in \nVermont who recently passed away after being injured while working on \nthe set of a school play. Mr. Myers was best known as a popular \neducator who was remembered by former school principal Lynn Murray as \nbeing ``brilliant with children.'' As a U.S. Senator, I remember Mr. \nMyers bringing students to Washington, DC every year. He truly wanted \nthem to understand the importance of living in the world's greatest \ndemocracy.\n  In memory of Mr. Myers, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nmemorial article, by Matt Ryan of the Burlington Free Press, be printed \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 27, 2009]\n\n                          Myers' Death Mourned\n\n                             (By Matt Ryan)\n\n       Williston.--Parents, students and teachers at Williston \n     Central School are mourning the death of a popular educator \n     who fell from a ladder and suffered a severe head injury \n     while working on the set of the school's production of ``The \n     Wizard of Oz.''\n       Al Myers was found in the auditorium Friday morning and \n     transported to Fletcher Allen Hospital where he underwent \n     surgery. He died Saturday morning, according to the school.\n       Julie Longchamp, the producer of the school play, worked \n     with Myers for 20 years.\n       ``He was an extraordinary man with a lot of passion,'' \n     Longchamp said. ``Everyone has come together and we're going \n     to be putting Al's show on.''\n       Longchamp prepared for the play near Myers' desk, in their \n     office at the school Sunday evening. In the auditorium, \n     parents and students quietly worked on the play's set and \n     costumes, the Emerald City and Glinda's pink dress. Tickets \n     for the show, which is scheduled for this weekend, sold out \n     April 1.\n       ``The play the Wizard of Oz will go on as scheduled under \n     the direction of Julie Longchamp,'' principal Walter Nardelli \n     wrote in an e-mail to parents. ``Al and his family would have \n     wanted it that way.''\n       Counselors will be available today for students, and staff \n     will attempt to keep the day as normal as possible, Nardelli \n     said. He encouraged children to go to school. Students were \n     on break last week.\n       The school was coordinating with Champlain Valley Union \n     High School to support former students who worked with Myers, \n     Nardelli said.\n       Myers had directed many theater productions over the years. \n     Former students and parents of students posted thoughts about \n     the teacher on several Facebook pages dedicated to his \n     memory. They wrote about working with Myers on plays like, \n     ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and \n     ``Macbeth,'' and catching his infectious love for music and \n     theater.\n       ``Mr. Myers was a wonderful teacher who took me under his \n     wing as he did to so many others,'' David Stephens of \n     Burlington wrote. ``I remember the sing-a-longs that he had \n     in class where he would pull out his guitar and would have \n     100 percent participation because it was so much fun. I can \n     still remember a bunch of the songs we would sing, `Feeling \n     Groovy,' `Blowin' in the Wind.'

Madam President, I rise today to recognize that the month \nof April is designated as American City Quality Month. Through the \ncontinued efforts of the American City Planning\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nDirectors' Council and the American City Quality Foundation, ACQF, the \nApril 2009 theme is appropriately labeled, ``Support Planning and \nAction for Better Quality Communities.'' For many years the emphasis \npromoted by the ACQF and its numerous professional organizations and \nsupporters has been to call attention to the vital need for improving \nAmerican cities through quality planning--via coordinated efforts to \nproduce effective decisions, design, development, management, and \naction.\n  As our country's population growth projections appear to reach an \nadditional 34 million people by the year 2020, the importance of proper \nurban planning as it relates to area surroundings, land conservation, \nand quality of life becomes a crucial component of the United States' \nstrategy to halt urban sprawl and the waste of both human and fiscal \nresources. Subsequently, through the devoted work, development, and \nplanning of the ACQF and interested parties, the recognition has \nsurfaced--that coordinated efforts on the part of city, State, and \nFederal governments, and the private sector need to be exacted more \nthan ever. Such a critical mission must continue until there is \nmainstream coordination throughout the nation to improve our country's \nurban settings in terms of cultural, practical, and land conservation \namenities.\n  Therefore, through the efforts of the American City Planning \nDirectors' Council, the American City Quality Foundation, and other \ninterested parties, I thank all who have joined together to address the \nchallenges posed by our burgeoning cities, as the integration of \nefforts has and will continue to provide us with a plan and hope for \nthe future that assures quality growth for our Nation's urban settings. \nThe ACQF's mission toward reaching that goal has secured both the \nattention and admiration of the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4801-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL ROBERT E. PEARY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of ADM Robert E. Peary's discovery of the North Pole--a \ntruly exceptional accomplishment. It was a hundred years ago this month \nthat Peary and his men completed their epic journey through the \nAtlantic and placed the American flag on the North Pole, marking the \nhistoric discovery. And as we commemorate this landmark occasion, the \nState of Maine has much to celebrate with the lasting legacy of Admiral \nPeary and all that he has done for our State, Nation, and the world.\n  Born in Cresson, PA, in 1856, Peary hailed from a long line of Maine \nlumberman and spent most of his formative years in southern Maine with \nhis mother, following the passing of his father. In 1877 he graduated \nfrom Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME, after studying as a civil \nengineer. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Civil Engineer Corps of \nthe Navy in 1881, he went on to complete projects in Florida and \nNicaragua, gaining an expertise that developed his love for the Arctic. \nPeary made his first expedition to Greenland in 1886 and for the next \n23 years, he honed his skills and refined a deft intellect and acumen \nfor the north seas, preparing him for his quintessential journey.\n  Although there are myriad contributions we could recognize, it is his \nadventure begun on July 6, 1908, that we most honor as Peary and his \nmen sailed northbound in his ship, the Roosevelt whose plans he \ndeveloped on Eagle Island in Casco Bay and which was built in \nBucksport, ME. I might add! Having arrived at Ellesmere Island with 23 \nmen, 133 dogs, and 19 sleds, on March 1, 1909, Peary set off for the \nfinal leg of his journey. For 37 days, they rode by sledge through one \nof our planet's most hostile environments. And it was on April 6, 1909, \nwhen Peary achieved his lifelong dream and history was made as he and \nhis five colleagues were the first to step foot on the barren North \nPole.\n  Although it may be easy to forget some of the challenges that Peary \nand everyone on his expedition endured, organizations such as the \nFriends of Peary's Eagle Island and the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum \nat Bowdoin College have captured this storied history, providing \ncrucial educational tools for all of our citizens, young and old, as we \nseek to learn more of the expedition's triumphs on this centennial \nanniversary. Indeed, the State of Maine and her people have much cause \nfor pride as we celebrate Admiral Peary's contributions this month, \nhonoring a phenomenal milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4801-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4801-S4803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My husband and I both work out of the home. He is a biology \n     teacher at a high school in Nampa, and I work part-time for a \n     utility company. I work because I have to, but I work as \n     little as I can because raising moral children is the better \n     thing to do. We love Boise! Our home is about equal distance \n     from our jobs, but in opposite directions. I go east; he goes \n     west. Recently, I have approached my employer to allow me to \n     work three full days a week instead of five shorter days. \n     This is solely to save on the expense rising gas prices have \n     on our budget. With the costs of gas, food, electricity going \n     up, we are in a tough spot. I have been with my employer for \n     8.5 years, and my pay is maxed out. I must rely on a cost-of-\n     living adjustment at the beginning of the new year, but since \n     that is never a guarantee, it is not included in our \n     budgeting plans until it happens. My husband is in his fourth \n     year of teaching, and teachers' pay? Well, you know how bad \n     that is. He will receive an increase in his yearly salary of \n     $750 this year (for a total salary of just $31,750), hardly \n     enough to compensate for those rising costs previously \n     mentioned. (What is been most troublesome to me lately is \n     that an individual my father associates with gets $36,000 a \n     year in Social Security benefits for ``psychological'' \n     reasons--most likely a result of years of drug use--and she \n     spends $50/day on marijuana. So while the state government \n     does not even pay my husband enough to provide for a family, \n     they are giving an extra $4,000/year to support another \n     person's drug abuse.)\n       The situation regarding higher gas prices is leading us to \n     look into carpooling, keeps us from going out as much, and is \n     a deterrent to buying a mini-van (we will try to squeeze \n     three car seats into the back of our sedan when our third \n     child is born). Several months ago, I considered biking to \n     work; but with the traffic in Boise, I am fearful that I \n     might be hit, and do not want to leave two children \n     motherless. I would like to see more people carpool, or take \n     other forms of transportation. Americans take energy for \n     granted and in the past, have not been the least bit \n     concerned about the impact of their selfish choices. I also \n     looked into a bus route, but none runs very close to our \n     home. In fact, the nearest pick-up is still several miles \n     away.\n       What should America do? I do not know. Several months ago, \n     I thought a gas ration would force conservation. Sometimes \n     people need to be made to do what they will not willingly do \n     themselves. Nuclear? I am concerned about the waste. Our own \n     sources of oil? I guess I view them like I view my savings \n     account--a reserve for emergencies. Using more of our own \n     resources is a resort if/when we find that conservation is \n     not effective enough. Conservation incentives? Seems that it \n     would be rather hard to enforce, and many do not have the \n     money to buy efficient upgrades. However, building \n     requirements allowing only the construction of energy \n     efficient homes might be a good start. If I am not mistaken, \n     they generally use about 30% less power than a non-energy \n     star home.\n       I think the only solution is a combination of solutions on \n     a combination of problems. Sometimes you just have to fix \n     everything at once--it is drastic, but the only way to make \n     real change--even for the government. I do not have all, or \n     even any of the answers, but a few brilliant minds, or even a \n     few people who care, could figure it out together.\n     Cheris, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       You wanted to know how the rising cost of fuel is affecting \n     me and my family. We, as of\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\n     March, bought a window covering franchise servicing Nampa, \n     Caldwell, Star, Middleton, Mountain Home, while we live in \n     East Boise. Our business is to take the choices to the \n     customer in their home so we are on the road constantly. If \n     the problem of rising fuel on a mobile business is not \n     obvious, I can draw a picture. My costs of doing business \n     increases with gas prices, with will affect me and the value \n     my customers can receive. If this continues, it will make \n     doing business very, very challenging. It is especially \n     frustrating knowing that the reserves are available in this \n     country and our elected officials are toying with our lives \n     the way you are. Caps and windfall taxing is not the answer; \n     get serious!\n       On another issue, I had to get into my own business because \n     after 24 years at Micron my mid-management level job was \n     eliminated to off-shore outsourcing, which again, our \n     government has set the stage to make doing business overseas \n     more attractive than doing business at home.\n       Good luck. I think if the [conservatives] would make more \n     noise in the public about real solutions the public would \n     force the liberals to made positive productive energy \n     solutions occur. ``We the people'' are not stupid. Get the \n     issues in front of us and those holding up progress will be \n     removed.\n     Ken, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       [My hometown] is based around farming. I can tell you that \n     my son did work for a farmer locally and was laid off. The \n     farmer could not afford to pay him or even raise his normal \n     crop this year due to fuel prices, which has forced my Son to \n     become dependent on me. I have no choice but to retire from \n     my job next year due to poor health. With my loss of income \n     to the household and the ever-rising fuel costs putting a \n     hardship on everything, I see my middle-class family and me \n     selling off everything and moving to skid row and being on \n     welfare since fuel costs are driving down employment and \n     raised the cost on most everything in this area. There are \n     lots of stories like this one around here. And a lot of \n     people in this community feel that the government is doing \n     next to nothing to help. I see our nation in serious trouble \n     if action is not taken now to solve soaring fuel costs.\n       I do not know if I have a specific or particular story \n     about the impact of gas prices on me and my family. I am \n     retired and on a fixed income. You talk about the impact of \n     gas prices, and I say yes, I have become $50 a month poorer \n     and will soon be $100, without any increase in income. but it \n     is not just about my personal use. There is a financial \n     impact in a hundred other ways. All food and other services \n     are going up at the rate of 8 cents per item per week. As \n     trucking firms and truckers go out of business and we have \n     heard that a third of the nation's truckers have, we will see \n     costs continue to increase. I used to consider myself to be \n     middle-income but am now in poverty. I cannot afford to heat \n     or cool my home buy good food, enjoy entertainment or visit \n     friends anymore. If I was spending any money and someone was \n     making some, that will stop. It seems that everyone's only \n     solution is to raise prices causing us to buy less and less.\n       This is going to spiral into another great depression. [We] \n     have got to open up our oil reserves. Allow states to get the \n     oil we know we have. I am for a clean environment but none of \n     those environmental lobbyists is going to vote you out of \n     office because you allow drilling. There are way more people \n     who want fuel. We know that cheap fuel sources are just \n     around the corner. I guess I am just lucky I have a Geo to \n     drive or I could not go anywhere. which reminds me I cannot \n     drive my comfortable cars trucks and definitely not my motor \n     home. I cannot sell them either as no one can afford fuel for \n     them. I guess that means we can just scrap \\3/4\\s of American \n     vehicles just like that because no one can invent a better \n     one and no one can afford to buy it if they did.\n       Thanks.\n     Zack, Burley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Well I suppose I am one of those few, but, hopefully, \n     growing renegades who believes that $4 a gallon is one of the \n     best things to happen to the environmental world in recent \n     history.\n       Cars and oil-run machines are here and we need them. But \n     this increase in fuel costs has spurred all kinds of new \n     ideas and technologies that need money and research. I hope \n     that some of these new technologies will wean us away from \n     the old fossil fuel standbys, and guide us toward new, \n     sustainable fuel sources.\n       I recently heard a few, very promising things about algae \n     farms that produce clean bio-fuels. They would not decimate \n     the food source or encourage more soybean crops in the Amazon \n     rain forest. Wind farms are growing and solar energy is \n     actually being talked about. Here in Idaho, as you know, the \n     wind blows and the sun comes out in late May and does not go \n     back in until mid-September. These alternatives will not \n     supply 100 percent of our power needs but 30 percent? 40 \n     percent? I keep hearing all or nothing--we need something \n     that will be omnipresent. But in the summer if we reduced 30 \n     percent or 40 percent of our power needs would not that cut \n     our fossil fuel needs too? Solar and wind also work in the \n     winter--and if these industries received some of the huge \n     subsidies that oil companies keep getting, would not they be, \n     perhaps with more research, more sensitive and more \n     productive?\n       I have read where most domestic oil drilling would not \n     start producing anything for another ten years. Just imagine \n     what ten years of research and development of alternatives \n     could produce with all the energetic imagination that is \n     going on right now. In ten years we might not even need that \n     oil and those newly drilled areas would all be for not. And I \n     think with all those profits the oil companies seem to be \n     making, they could spare a few bucks of subsidies.\n       Locally, I still see all these expensive houses high in the \n     hills of the Treasure Valley baking in the sun with hardly a \n     solar panel to be found. The transportation situation is \n     stagnant with a growing population and no alternatives to \n     avoid vehicles. There is no interstate train service to or \n     from here, and the public transportation in this valley is \n     rather pathetic. The legislature keeps voting down any kind \n     of local option tax and the possibility for any kind of \n     light-rail seems like decades away.\n       I ride my bicycle just about everywhere, here in Boise. I \n     see so many more people riding bikes and I think that is so \n     cool. I have also been getting pretty excited by all the \n     innovations I am starting to see out there, glimpses of new \n     and wonderful alternatives to fossil fuels. But I keep \n     hearing the big voice of government saying it will not work, \n     this cannot be done and that cannot be done. But the idealist \n     in me says it can. We are a smart enough country to deal with \n     this in a wise and imaginative way. I know that if we start \n     to let go, a little, of what we have been beholden to for so \n     long, and open our minds to all possibilities then good \n     things will start to happen.\n     Jay, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Simply put, I believe we should begin additional drilling \n     immediately off our coasts, in the Rocky Mountains and ANWR. \n     I also support flex fuels/bio diesel alternatives. We need to \n     build nuclear power plants right away (I support doing this \n     in Idaho; it would be nice if Idaho was energy independent \n     and exporting power to other nearby states!) Please pass on \n     the urgency of doing this expeditiously as it is essential to \n     our national security.\n       Thank you for the ``i-meeting'' town-hall forum as it helps \n     Idahoans save gas and conserve as well as participate in this \n     very important process! As a voting Idahoan, I also believe \n     in conservation, thrift, and responsible stewarding of our \n     beautiful state.\n     Teresa.\n                                  ____\n\n       We own a small business here in Idaho. We were looking \n     forward to having our SBA loan paid off this year. The SBA \n     payment has been as high as $2,200 per month, which at times \n     has been a struggle, but we have managed to pay it off in the \n     ten-year time frame. We are now fearful that we will be \n     switching from paying an SBA loan payment to just paying for \n     gas to survive. Our gas bill used to be $300 to $500 per \n     month. It has now soared to over $2,000 per month. Tell us \n     how we are going to stay in business? By the way, I have \n     heard that the wind generators by Mountain Home are not \n     working. Is this true and why?\n     Stephen and Terry, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is not so much that the prices have risen. I understand \n     the supply/demand concept. But what really irks me is that \n     fact that the big oil companies are recording record profits \n     and using the excuse that this will get them through the hard \n     times or they need it for research to find more efficient \n     fuel sources. I do not believe this. It has been quietly \n     insinuated in the past of oil companies buying out any new \n     fuel idea to keep their monopoly on the industry. They really \n     do have a monopoly on the U.S. economy fuel source, and we \n     have no recourse except to try and minimize our fuel use. We \n     have done this by cancelling vacations and even short trips \n     in the area. We also are going to the store less, planning \n     each trip so that we can accomplish the most in one driving \n     trip. The people with lots of money will feel the effects \n     minimally but the middle to lower class are taking the brunt \n     of this crisis. I do not think those with money (higher \n     elected officials) have any idea the difficulties that we are \n     encountering because they do not live that life. Walk in the \n     shoes of some of us for a month and then see what is \n     important and what is not.\n       I really do not see how drilling for more oil (like in \n     Alaska) will make any difference when the oil companies use \n     the excuses listed above. They are still going to get the \n     highest dollar amount they feel they can get away with. The \n     only way the price will change is if demand drops below what \n     is on the market. But then, the oil companies can determine \n     what is on the market (hold back their product) to keep the \n     prices higher. Unless they are regulated in some way, they \n     can do whatever they want.\n     Terrie.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just got back from a vacation in Yellowstone National \n     Park, and the traffic was the worst I have ever seen in about \n     50 trips to the park. It was probably more due to timing than \n     anything, but it still indicates that gas prices are \n     relatively low for the middle class. I am more concerned \n     about the affect of energy prices on lower income \n     individuals.\n       In the long run, we need to focus on other issues, and \n     improved energy costs will probably be an important side \n     effect. The issues I would focus on are:\n       1. Too much traffic on our highways and city streets.\n       2. Too much crime in our cities.\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\n       3. Too much environmental impact from mining, drilling for \n     oil and gas, and wind farms.\n       4. Too many farms being subdivided to build houses.\n       5. The ``nuclear waste problem'' and ``nuclear \n     proliferation problem'' are not being addressed \n     realistically.\n       If we take the obvious actions to solve these problems, \n     there will be less pressure on energy prices:\n       1. Invest in public transportation. The federal government \n     has spared no expense in improving highways over the past 50 \n     years. Imagine the effect of an equal investment in train and \n     bus service. I have ridden on buses all of my life, and it \n     can be a nice way to travel or commute. The few trains I have \n     ridden were also very comfortable and convenient. This has \n     much more potential to save energy than hybrid cars or \n     hydrogen powered fuel cells. A small van has the potential to \n     provide hundreds of passenger miles per gallon of gas. \n     Buses and trains should do even better.\n       2. Invest in ride sharing and car pooling.\n       3. Invest in nice cities. People should be able to live \n     comfortably, with no fear of crime, within walking distance \n     to work.\n       4. Invest in maintaining farm land as farm land instead of \n     using it to create sprawling suburbs full of oversized \n     houses.\n       5. Put a limit on the tax break for a first home. Eliminate \n     the tax break for a second home. For one thing, I am sick and \n     tired of hearing how rich celebrities are so ``green'' and \n     have such a small ``carbon footprint'' when I know most of \n     them own multiple, grossly oversized, tax-subsidized homes.\n       6. Invest in nuclear power. The public should be demanding \n     better performance from the nuclear industry just like they \n     do from the airline industry. We want airlines to operate on \n     schedule, cost effectively, and operate safely, even with the \n     security concerns raised by 9/11. We should be demanding \n     similar performance from the nuclear industry and stop \n     fretting about perceived problems.\n       With respect to the ``nuclear waste problem'', there is no \n     reason to relate performance requirements to the half-life of \n     long lived radionuclides. There is no reason to treat \n     plutonium contamination as fundamentally different from other \n     toxic metals such as lead, which have infinite half-life. In \n     reality the biggest nuclear waste problem is probably our \n     700,000 metric tons of depleted uranium hexafluoride \n     currently stored in corroding carbon steel cylinders. This \n     volatile ``waste'' material is a serious environmental \n     hazard, but should be managed as a major resource. It could \n     be transmuted into plutonium in nuclear reactors and used to \n     produce all the energy we need for the next 500 years. No \n     mining, drilling, or refining would be needed. This would \n     help eliminate the fantasy that we need to cover our \n     landscape with windmills that do not even work most of the \n     time.\n       With respect to nuclear proliferation, the only way to go \n     is forward. The USA needs to lead the way in developing cost \n     effective nuclear energy technology, so that less stable \n     countries have no reason to develop their own technology. \n     Then we will not need to worry about whether they are \n     producing weapons grade materials. Improved technology should \n     include reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. We should reprocess \n     it instead of trying to bury it. Currently, it is self-\n     protecting due to high radioactivity, but it will not be in \n     about 200 years. We should not leave this hazard for future \n     generations.\n       The public needs to be educated about energy. The general \n     public has virtually no understanding of nuclear power, and \n     they seem to be generally illiterate with regard to energy \n     issues. Hydrogen-powered vehicles are unrealistic and do not \n     make thermodynamic or economic sense. Windmills and solar \n     panels have limited potential to reduce energy costs and \n     major environmental impact if we try to push them beyond \n     their potential.

Madam President, I wish to speak today to honor \nthe 90th birthday earlier this month of my friend, Chief David Bald \nEagle of Takini, on the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota. \nChief Bald Eagle was born on April 8, 1919, on the west banks of Cherry \nCreek in west central South Dakota. He is the grandson of Chief White \nBull who fought Custer's 7th Cavalry in the Battle of Greasy Grass \nCreek, better known as the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Having a \nwarrior spirit in his blood, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was just \nbeing discharged at the beginning of World War II. He reenlisted, and \nserved as a sergeant with the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1944, he was \namong those brave soldiers who jumped from planes on D-day as a U.S. \nArmy paratrooper. Chief Bald Eagle was shot four times that day, and \nhis story is recounted in ``Blue Stars: A Selection of Stories from \nSouth Dakota's World War II Veterans'' compiled by Greg Latza.\n  Upon return, Chief Bald Eagle went on to travel as a performer and \nhas acted in at least 18 movies to date. While in Hollywood, Chief Bald \nEagle worked alongside some of the most recognizable actors and \nactresses of that time: Clark Gable, John Wayne, and Marilyn Monroe. \nAll the while he managed to stay connected to his home. For more than \n60 years, Chief Bald Eagle has annually participated in the Days of '76 \nparade and rodeo in Deadwood, SD, providing the many thousands of \npeople who attend the annual event a level of understanding and \neducation about the Native American culture and heritage and the great \nimpact\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nof the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota people on the region. He is recognized as \nan honorary member of the Days of '76 Committee because of his \ncontributions to their events. In 2008, he was honored by the South \nDakota State Legislature with a House Commemoration honoring his life, \ncharacter, and achievements.\n  Madam President, Chief David Bald Eagle is a dear friend, and I \nappreciate being among those special people that he keeps in his \nprayers. I will never forget that he gave me my Lakota name several \nyears ago in a special ceremony, ``Wacante Ognake,'' which means holds \nthe people in his heart--a name I cherish and will never forget its \nimportance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4804-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4804-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/28/senate-section/article/S4804-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives, delivered by Mrs. Cole, \none of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1746.

A bill to provide Federal assistance to States, local \njurisdictions, and Indian tribes to prosecute hate crimes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, hate crimes harm innocent victims, \nterrorize entire communities, and threaten the very fabric of our \nnation. They send a poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be \nvictimized solely because of who they are or who they are perceived to \nbe. Hate crimes offend the fundamental ideals on which Nation was \nfounded. They can not be tolerated in any free society, and it is long \npast time to enact legislation to correct the deficiencies in the \ncurrent federal hate crimes statute.\n  For far too long, law enforcement has been forced to investigate hate \ncrimes with one hand tied behind its back. Now is the time to change \nthis. This bill strengthens the Federal Government's ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. It removes the excessive \nrestrictions currently existing in federal law. It offers Federal \nassistance for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes to State and \nlocal law enforcement. It provides training grants for local law \nenforcement to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles.\n  The first Federal hate crimes statute was passed over 40 years ago in \n1968, soon after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It \nauthorized the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute crimes \ncommitted against individuals because of their race, color, religion, \nor national origin. The original statute was a major advance in the \nmarch of progress, but it is now a generation out of date.\n  The time has come to stand up for all victims of hate crimes--victims \nlike Matthew Shepard, for whom this bill is named. Matthew died a \nhorrible death in 1998 at the hands of two men who singled him out \nbecause of his sexual orientation. Since Matthew's murder, his mother \nhas worked courageously to make sure that we never forget the suffering \nthat her son endured, and to remind Congress that it has a \nresponsibility to protect individuals like her son. Yet today, more \nthan 10 years after Matthew's death--10 years--we still have not \nmodernized our hate crimes laws. How long are we going to wait?\n  The bill we are introducing today expands the current hate crimes \nstatute\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nand gives Federal, State, local, and tribal authorities greater ability \nto investigate and prosecute hate crimes effectively. The bill closes \nflagrant loopholes in the current statute that prevent or undermine the \nprosecution of the individuals who commit these vicious crimes.\n  This bill broadens the original Federal hate crimes statute by \nprohibiting crimes based on a victim's actual or perceived sexual \norientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.\n  According to FBI statistics, hate crimes based on sexual orientation \nmake up approximately 17 percent of all hate crimes. Considering that \ngays and lesbians make up approximately 3 percent of the population, \nthe FBI statistics suggest that gays and lesbians are victimized at a \nrate approximately 6 times higher than that of the average American. \nResearch suggests that hate-motivated violence against gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, and transgender citizens is particularly extreme. As these \nstatistics and the research make clear, hate crimes are a very real \ndanger to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender citizens. We must \nact--without further delay--to correct these unacceptable deficiencies \nin current law and protect all citizens from these brutal crimes.\n  Our bill also increases the Federal Government's ability to prosecute \nhate crimes. It removes the prerequisite that a victim be engaged in a \n``federally protected activity'' before the Federal Government can \nprosecute an offender under the statute. This restrictive provision is \noutdated, unwise, and unnecessary, particularly when one considers the \nunjust outcomes that can result from limiting prosecution to offenders \nto target victims participating in one or more of the following 6 \nnarrow categories of federally protected activity: attending or \nenrolling in a public school or public college; participating in a \nbenefit, service, privilege, program, facility or activity administered \nby a state or local government; applying for or working in private or \nstate employment; serving as a juror in a state court; using a facility \nof interstate commerce or a common carrier; or enjoying public \naccommodations or places of exhibition or entertainment. We know that \nindividuals may be victimized while engaging in activities that are not \nincluded in this list of activities--they could be victims while \nengaging in routine activities, going about their normal day. Americans \nshould be protected from hate crimes in everything they do. There \nshould be no distinction between hate crimes occurring while a victim \nis engaged in a routine activity or one of the six specified federally \nprotected activities described above.\n  This bill corrects a gap in the current hate crimes statute that \nlimits prosecution to offenders who interfere with a victim's \nparticipation in certain federally protected activities. In June 2003, \nsix Latino teenagers went to a family restaurant on Long Island. The \nteenagers knew one another from involvement in community activities and \nhave come together to celebrate a birthday. As the group entered the \nrestaurant, three men who were leaving the bar assaulted the teenagers, \npummeling one boy and severing a tendon in his hand with a sharp \nweapon. During the attack, the men yelled racial slurs and one \nidentified himself as a skinhead. Two of the men were tried under the \ncurrent Federal hate crimes law and were acquitted. The jurors said \nthey acquitted the offenders because the Government failed to prove \nthat using a restaurant was a federally protected activity. The result \nin this case is just one example of the inadequate protections provided \nunder current law. The bill we introduce today will eliminate the \nfederally protected activity requirement and give jurors greater \nability to convict all perpetrators of hate crimes.\n\n  The bill modernizes the Federal Government's ability to prosecute \nhate crimes, but it fully respects the primary role of state, local, \nand tribal law enforcement authorities in responding to hate crimes in \ntheir jurisdictions. The bill protects these local interests with a \nstrict certification process, which requires the Federal Government to \nconsult with state and local officials before prosecuting a Federal \ncase. In accord with certification, it is our belief that the vast \nmajority of hate crimes will continue to be prosecuted at the State and \nlocal level.\n  In addition, our bill authorizes the Justice Department to increase \nthe number of Department personnel to prevent and respond to hate \ncrimes. This increase will enable Federal authorities to develop the \nmanpower necessary to act effectively to prevent and respond to hate \ncrimes.\n  The bill also authorizes the Justice Department to provide needed \ninvestigative resources to state and local law enforcement during these \nchallenging economic times. This expansion of federal assistance is \nmeant to supplement, not supplant, the efforts of state and local law \nenforcement authorities, so that hate crimes can be effectively \ninvestigated and prosecuted in the future.\n  Hate crimes investigations tend to be expensive, requiring \nconsiderable law enforcement effort, and extensive use of grand juries. \nThe bill expands the Justice Department's opportunity to provide \nsupport for these expenses. It authorizes the Attorney General to offer \ngrants of up to $100,000 to help state, local, and tribal law \nenforcement officials manage the high costs of investigating and \nprosecuting hate crimes. It also authorizes the Justice Department to \naward grants to State, local, and tribal authorities for programs that \ncombat hate crimes committed by juveniles, including programs designed \nto train local law enforcement officers in identifying, investigating, \nprosecuting and preventing hate crimes. These measures will help ensure \nthat state and local authorities have the resources necessary to \nsuccessfully combat and prosecute hate crimes.\n  Collecting data on hate crimes is important for analyzing crime \ntrends and tailoring effective criminal policy. Our bill increases the \nFederal Government's ability to monitor hate crimes by requiring the \nFBI to increase the statistics it collects about such crimes. \nCurrently, the FBI collects hate crimes data on race, religion, sexual \norientation, ethnic background, and disability. Our bill requires the \nFBI to collect new statistics on hate crimes based on an individual's \ngender or gender-identity, and hate crimes committed by juveniles. By \nincreasing the amount of data collected by the FBI, we will be able to \nbetter understand the gravity of the hate crimes committed in our \ncommunities.\n  Hate crimes are a festering problem, causing terror in neighborhoods \nacross America. According to the most recent statistics released by the \nFBI, there were at least 9,527 victims of hate-motivated crimes in \n2007. Based on that number, an average of 26 victims per day were \nterrorized as a consequence of their race, religion, sexual \norientation, ethnic background, or disability. The FBI's statistics \nreveal that race-related hate crimes are the most common type of hate \ncrimes, comprising approximately 50 percent of all hate crimes reported \nto the FBI. That said, crimes based on religion, sexual orientation, \nand ethnic background occur with alarming frequency as well.\n  These hate crimes statistics are disturbing, but they represent only \nthe tip of the iceberg of hate crimes occurring in America. The \nSouthern Poverty Law Center, the Human Rights Campaign, and the US \nBureau of Justice Statistics agree that the FBI's hate crimes numbers \ndo not reflect the actual number of hate crimes occurring in our \ncommunities each year. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that \nthe annual number of hate crimes committed in the U.S. is close to \n50,000. In addition, the Human Rights Campaign states that a hate crime \noccurs every 6 hours. Survey data from the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics' biannual National Crime Victimization Survey estimates that \nan average of 191,000 hate crime victimizations take place each year. \nBased on this survey, over 540 people are victimized each day, based on \ntheir race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic background, or \ndisability--more than 22 victims per hour. These statistics are not \njust shocking--they are shameful. It is time for Congress to \nspecifically address the serious problem of hate crimes in America.\n  In addition to the legal impact of this bill, its symbolic impact is \nequally important. This bill emphasizes the devastatingly unique nature \nof hate crimes. It says we recognize that hate crimes provide \naggressors with the means to attack an entire community\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nthrough a single act of violence, and send a message of fear that \nvastly transcends the immediate crime and its victim. It shows we \nunderstand that hate crime offenders should be prosecuted for \ncommitting a crime against an entire community. After so many years of \ninaction, we in Congress have an obligation to demonstrate that we \nunderstand how hate crimes affect our nation's communities.\n  It takes only a brief survey of any major news outlet to find \nhorrifying stories of hate crimes and the inability of law enforcement \nto prosecute offenders for their acts of hate. The 1999 murder of four \nwomen in Yosemite National Park graphically illustrates the need to \ninclude gender in our hate crimes statute. These four women were \nmurdered by a man who admitted having fantasized about killing women \nfor most of his life. These women lost their lives for one reason--\nbecause they were women. We need to send a clear message that we will \nnot accept such acts of hate. Without this bill, however, such a crime \ncannot be federally prosecuted as a hate crime.\n  Gender identity must also be included in our definition of those \ncharacteristics protected by a hate crimes statute. Many are familiar \nwith the story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and beaten in Humboldt, \nNebraska in 1993 by two male friends after they discovered that he was \nliving as a male but was anatomically female. The local sheriff refused \nto arrest the offenders, and they later shot and stabbed Brandon to \ndeath.\n\n  A more recent, less well-known incident occurred when Fred C. \nMartinez Jr., a Navajo transgender youth, was murdered while walking \nhome from a party. Fred was killed for one reason alone--because he was \na transgender youth. By passing this bill, the Senate will send a \nstrong message that hate crimes based on sexual identity are \nunacceptable and perpetrators of such crimes will face tough criminal \npenalties under Federal law.\n  Hate crimes against disabled Americans are very disturbing and \ndeserve protection at the Federal level as well. In October 2002, two \ndeaf girls, one of whom was wheelchair bound due to cerebral palsy, \nwere harassed and sexually assaulted by four suspected gang members in \na local park. The girls were attacked because they were disabled and \nunable to defend themselves. Although the alleged perpetrators were \nprosecuted, the assaults could not be charged as hate crimes because no \nState or Federal protections for disability-based hate crimes existed \nin Federal or State law. This must change.\n  These are only a few examples of the hate perpetrated against \nindividuals in America based on their sexual orientation, gender, \ngender identity, and disability. We can no longer allow any of these \ncommunities to live in fear. Crimes based on an individual's sexual \norientation, gender, gender identity, or disability must be prosecuted \nfor what they are--crimes of hate.\n  Individuals should not only be protected from hate crimes because of \ntheir actual characteristics; they must also be protected from hate \ncrimes based on the inaccurate perceptions of others. Last year in \nBrooklyn, New York, Jose Sucuzhanay was walking arm in arm with his \nbrother, Romel Sucuzhanay, after attending a church party. According to \nofficials, about half a block from Jose's home, a black sports utility \nvehicle drove by and the two men in the vehicle began shouting what \nwitnesses described as vulgarisms against Hispanics and gay men. The \ncar stopped and one of the two men approached Jose and smashed a beer \nbottle over the back of his head. The other man then took an aluminum \nbaseball bat from the rear of the vehicle and repeatedly struck Jose on \nhis shoulder, ribs, and back. Once Jose fell to the ground, he received \nseveral full-forced, crushing blows to his head with the aluminum \nbaseball bat. Jose, a father of two and local real estate agent, died 5 \ndays later because of the hate-motivated attack. He did not deserve to \nlose his life because he was perceived to be gay. That is why the bill \nwe are introducing today criminalizes crimes based on the perceived \ncharacteristics of a victim.\n  We also know that hate crimes covered by current Federal law--based \non race, religion, national origin, and color--still occur and must be \nprosecuted. Following the 2008 presidential election, three men in New \nYork went on a rampage attacking African-American residents of Staten \nIsland in response to the historic election of President Barack Obama. \nThe men attacked one 17-year-old African-American man with a metal pipe \nand collapsible baton. They attacked another African-American man by \npushing him to the ground. They assaulted still another man, whom they \nmistakenly believed was African-American, by mowing him down with a car \nwhile yelling racial epithets at him. Clearly, this demonstrates that \nrace-based violence is continuing at an unacceptable level, and we must \nact to help law enforcement more vigorously deal with hate crimes.\n  Hate crimes legislation has the support of President Obama, a \nmajority of Congress, 26 State Attorneys General, and a broad coalition \nof law enforcement, civic, religious, and civil rights groups. Recent \nhistory shows that Congress is ready to make hate crimes legislation \ninto law. In 2007, the Senate voted 60 to 39 in support of a similar \nhate crimes bill. An equally powerful statement was made by the House \nwhen it voted 237 to 180 for the hate crimes bill introduced that year. \nAs a Senator, President Obama voted to support hate crimes legislation. \nNow, as President, he has included the expansion of hate crimes in his \ncivil rights agenda. The political will of our Nation is clear--it is \ntime for this bill to become law.\n  Over 300 law enforcement, civil rights, civic, and religious \norganizations have endorsed our bill, including the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs Association, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Anti-\nDefamation League, the Human Rights Campaign, and the Interfaith \nAlliance. All these diverse groups have come together to say that now \nis the time for us to protect our fellow citizens from the brutality of \nhate-motivated violence. They strongly support this legislation because \nthey know it is a balanced and sensible approach that will bring \ngreater protection to our citizens, along with much-needed resources \nfor local and State law enforcement fighting hate crimes.\n  Passing this bill will send a message, loud and clear, that those who \nvictimize individuals because of their race, color, religion, national \norigin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability will \ngo to prison. In addition, passing this bill will provide Federal, \nState, local, and tribal authorities with stronger means to prosecute \ncrimes of hate. It has been over 10 years since Matthew Shepard was \nleft to die on a fence in Wyoming because of who he was. It has also \nbeen 10 years since this bill was initially considered by Congress. In \nthose 10 years, we have gained the political and public support that is \nneeded to make this bill become law. Today, we have a President who is \nprepared to sign hate crimes legislation into law, and a Justice \nDepartment that is willing to enforce it. We must not delay the passage \nof this bill. Now is the time to stand up against hate-motivated \nviolence and recognize the shameful damage it is doing to our Nation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is National Crime Victims' Rights \nWeek--a time when communities in Vermont and across the Nation \nrecognize the needs of crime victims, and work together to promote \nvictims' rights and services. There is no more important time than now \nto renew our commitment to address the needs of crime victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Today, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy, Senator Collins, and \nmore than 30 other Senators from both sides of the aisle to reintroduce \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. This is a \nbipartisan bill designed to combat crimes that have long terrorized \ncommunities and remain a serious problem in this country. This \nlegislation is a matter of simple justice. It is past time for Congress \nto enact this bill and strengthen the Federal Government's role in \npreventing and punishing crimes motivated by hate.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership over the last decade in \nworking to expand our Federal hate crimes law, and I am proud to once \nagain be an original cosponsor of this legislation. A bipartisan \nmajority of\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\nthe Members in the House of Representatives voted to pass this \nlegislation in the last Congress. Unfortunately, there were partisan \nattempts to filibuster and prevent passage of the Senate bill. The \nmeasure was ultimately attached to the Department of Defense \nAuthorization bill with the bipartisan support of 60 Senators. While I \nam disappointed that the hate crime provision was taken out of that \nbill at conference, I am hopeful that our efforts to enact this civil \nrights measure into law will be successful this year.\n  Violent crimes motivated by prejudice and hate are tragedies that \nhaunt American history. From the lynchings that plagued race relations \nfor more than a century, to the well-publicized slayings of Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr., in the 1990s, this is a story that we have \nheard too often in this country. Unfortunately, in my home state of \nVermont, there have been two attacks in recent years that appear to \nhave been motivated by the victims' religion or sexual orientation.\n  Perhaps the most persuasive evidence that hate crimes are becoming \nmore prevalent and more nationalized is a leaked copy of the Department \nof Homeland Security report on violent extremism in the United States. \nThe report is nothing short of chilling.\n  The DHS report found that ``the economic downturn and the election of \nthe first African American president present unique drivers for \nrightwing radicalization and recruitment'' and these elements in turn \nhave the potential to drive hate groups to carry out violence. It also \nfound that anti-immigrant fervor by organized hate groups ``has the \npotential to turn violent.'' The DHS report concluded that the ``advent \nof the Internet'' has potentially made ``extremist individuals and \ngroups more dangerous and the consequences of their violence more \nsevere.''\n  Of course, these findings comport with a recent Southern Poverty Law \nCenter, SPLC, report on hate group activity in the United States \nentitled ``The Year in Hate.'' The SPLC repot found that activity by \nknown domestic hate groups has increased by 50 percent since 2000, from \n602 hate groups in 2000, to 926 hate groups in 2008. The recent and \nrapid growth in hate group activity is simply astonishing.\n  It remains painfully clear that as a Nation, we still have serious \nwork to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in \nensuring equal rights for all our citizens. While the answer to hate \nand bigotry must ultimately be found in increased tolerance, \nstrengthening our Federal hate crimes laws is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 improves \nexisting law by making it easier for Federal authorities to investigate \nand prosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national \norigin. Victims will no longer have to engage in a narrow range of \nactivities, such as serving as a juror, to be protected under Federal \nlaw. This bill also expands Federal protections to include the problem \nof hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual \norientation, gender, gender identity, or disability, which is a key and \nlong-overdue expansion of protection. Finally, this bill provides \nassistance and resources to state, local, and tribal law enforcement to \naddress hate crimes.\n  This bill strengthens Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a \nback-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. \nStates will still bear primary responsibility for prosecuting most hate \ncrimes, which is important to me as a former state prosecutor. In a \nsign that this legislation respects the proper balance between Federal \nand local authority, it has received strong bipartisan support from \nstate and local law enforcement organizations across the country.\n  Moreover, this bill accomplishes the critically important goal of \nprotecting all of our citizens without compromising our constitutional \nresponsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts and threats of \nviolence motivated by hatred and bigotry. But it does not target pure \nspeech, however offensive or disagreeable. The Constitution does not \npermit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply \nbecause we disagree with it. To paraphrase Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, the Constitution protects not only freedom for the thought and \nexpression we agree with, but freedom for the thought that we hate. I \nam devoted to that principle, and I am confident that this bill does \nnot contradict it.\n  We crafted this legislation after long and thoughtful consultation \nwith many of the advocates who work so hard to promote civil rights and \nwith Justice Department attorneys in the field who work on hate crimes \nprosecutions every day. It contains changes to Federal hate crime law \nthat will improve the law's operation and implementation. I want to \nthank the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Human Rights First, \nand the more than 300 law enforcement, civil rights, religious, and \nother professional organizations for their assistance with and support \nfor this legislation, and for their tireless work on behalf of hate \ncrimes victims in the United States.\n  The crimes targeted in this bill are particularly pernicious crimes \nthat affect more than just their victims and those victims' families. \nThey inspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim other \nthan a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. That \nis wrong. All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where \nthey choose. In the past we have responded as a Nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for nearly 150 years.\n  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that great \nand honorable tradition, and brings us one step closer towards ensuring \nan America that values tolerance and protects all of its people. I hope \nall Senators will support passing this important bipartisan bill this \nyear.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wish today to support the Matthew Shepard Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act of 2009. I want to thank and commend my friend \nand colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership and dedication on \nthis important issue. It is long past time that we move to bring \nexisting Federal hate crimes law into the 21st century.\n  I have been an original cosponsor of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act \nsince it was first introduced in the Senate over a decade ago.\n  And I am proud to join today with my colleagues--Senators Kennedy, \nLeahy, Specter, Collins, Snowe, Schumer, Durbin, and others--to \nreintroduce this legislation, which will once and for all send a \nmessage: We will no longer turn a blind eye to hate crimes in this \ncountry.\n  This legislation is a crucial step toward prosecuting crimes directed \nat thousands of individuals who are the targets of brutal and senseless \nviolence.\n  The current Federal hate crimes law simply does not go far enough. It \ncovers only crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, color, \nreligion or national origin.\n  This bill improves the current Federal hate crime law by including \ncrimes motivated by gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and \ndisability.\n  Specifically, the Matthew Shepard Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 \nexpands on the 1968 definition of a hate crime.\n  Under current Federal law, hate crimes only cover attacks based on \nrace, color, religion, and national origin.\n  Under the proposed bill, hate crimes will include: gender, gender \nidentity, sexual orientation, and disability.\n  The bill enables States, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes to \napply for Federal grants in order to solve hate crimes and provides \nFederal agents with broader authority to aid State and local police.\n  Additionally, the bill amends the Hate Crime Statistics Act to allow \nlaw enforcement agencies to gather additional data on violent crimes \ncommitted out of hate.\n  The bill also includes a ``Rule of Construction'' to ensure that it \ndoes not intrude on first amendment protected rights to freedom of \nspeech.\n  I believe that it is time for Congress to expand the ability of the \nFederal Government to investigate and prosecute anyone who would target \nvictims because of hate. In States that have already enacted hate \ncrimes laws, the Federal Government must provide the resources to \nensure that those crimes do not go unpunished. We can and must do more.\n  Across the Nation, horrific instances of violence are occurring that \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nwould work to fight against. I would like to share just a few examples:\n  In February 2008 in Oxnard, CA, Lawrence ``Larry'' King, a 15-year-\nold boy was shot and killed by a fellow classmate at his junior high \nschool. Larry, who had told his classmates he was gay, had long been \nharassed and bullied at school. The way he was treated is unacceptable, \nand his death was a tragic and poignant reminder of why it is so \nimportant to stop bullying and violence in our schools.\n  In Laurel, DE, earlier this month, three teenagers were charged with \nrobbing and assaulting a 31-year-old developmentally disabled man. The \nvictim was walking home one Friday evening from his brother's house in \nthe Laurel Village Mobile Home Park and was dragged into a wooden area, \nbeaten, and robbed of his wallet and keys. The victim's mother later \nfound him and took him to the hospital where he was treated for a \nconcussion.\n  Lastly, one of the most well-known cases in California happened in \nWest Hollywood to actor Trev Broudy in 2002. The night of the attack, \nTrev Broudy was hugging a man on a street. Three men with a baseball \nbat savagely attacked the actor and left him in a coma for \napproximately 10 weeks. As a result of the attack, Trev suffered brain \ndamage, lost half of his vision, and has experienced trouble hearing.\n  The crimes are brutal. The attackers targeted their victims because \nof who they are. Yet, none of these crimes can be prosecuted as a \nFederal hate crime.\n  These are not isolated instances.\n  These crimes occur all too often.\n  According to the latest FBI statistics, there were almost 7,700 hate \ncrime incidents in the United States in 2007. Of those, 1,789 occurred \nin California, with 15 percent of those based on sexual orientation.\n  Nationally, approximately 50.8 percent were motivated by racial bias, \n18 percent were motivated by religious bias, 17 percent were motivated \nby sexual orientation, and 13.2 percent were motivated by ethnicity or \nnational origin bias. One percent involved a bias against a disability.\n  Even more disturbing is the fact that these FBI statistics show only \na fraction of the problem because so many hate crimes are unreported.\n  The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization located in \nMontgomery, AL and internationally known for its tolerance education \nprograms, estimates that the actual number of hate crimes committed in \nthe United States each year is closer to 50,000 as opposed to the \nnearly 8,000 cases reported to the FBI.\n  A close analysis of hate crimes rates demonstrates that groups that \nare now covered by current laws--such as African Americans, Muslims, \nand Jews, report similar rates of hate crimes victimizations as gays \nand lesbians--who are not currently protected.\n  Every person's life is valuable. Congress must act to protect every \nindividual who is targeted simply because of who they are.\n  We must also stop the way that hate crimes terrorize communities. \nWhen people are targeted because of who they are, they often live in \nfear and communities suffer from tension and a lack of trust. These are \ncrimes that damage our social fabric, and we must send a clear message \nthat we cannot tolerate this kind of intimidation in the United States.\n  This is not a new bill. It was first introduced in 1998. It has \npassed the Senate numerous times: in 2000, 2002, and 2004 as an \namendment to the Department of Defense, Authorization bill. It has also \npassed the House in 2007 as a stand-alone bill and in 2006 as an \namendment to the Adam Walsh Act. But still, it has not been enacted \ninto law.\n  In addition, last Congress, this body passed this legislation \nfavorably as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, but the \namendment was removed from the final version of the bill that the \nPresident signed.\n  This legislation is bipartisan and has broad coalition support. It is \nsupported by 26 State attorneys general and over 300 law enforcement, \nprofessional, educational, civil rights, religious, and civic \norganizations.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting it and working \nto enact it into law in this Congress.\n  Let us send a message to all Americans that we will not turn a blind \neye to hate crimes and will instead support the values of tolerance and \ncommunity that unite us as Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY:\n  S. 911. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit \nprepayment penalties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation to address the very heart of our economic crisis--the \nhousing market and the deceptive lending practices that have placed \nmillions of homes at risk of foreclosure.\n  In the last few years, millions of families were led into \nunsustainable home mortgages that pushed our country into an economic \ncrisis unprecedented in our lifetimes. Instead of fulfilling a dream \nand contributing to a secure financial future, home mortgages have too \noften become a check for stripping wealth from working Americans.\n  These two bills, the Transparency for Homeowners Act, S. 911, and the \nPromoting Mortgage Responsibility Act, S. 912, will put an end to \ndeceptive and unfair mortgage practices that played a pivotal role in \ntricking American families to accept risky and unsustainable mortgages.\n  Two key factors drew families into these mortgages that paved the way \nfor this recession. First, steering payments.\n  Steering payments were paid to brokers who enticed unsuspecting \nhomeowners into deceptive and expensive mortgages. These secret bonus \npayments, often called yield spread premiums, turned home mortgages \ninto a scam. A family would go to a mortgage broker to get advice in \ngetting the best possible loan. The family would trust the broker to \ngive advice because, quite frankly, they were paying the broker for \nthat service. But what the borrower did not realize is that the broker \nwould earn thousands of bonus dollars from the lender if the broker \ncould convince the homeowner to take out a high-priced mortgage, such \nas one with an exploding interest rate, rather than a plain vanilla 30-\nyear fixed rate mortgage.\n  The second factor is prepayment penalties. Prepayment penalties added \ninsult to injury. After the homeowners realized they had been steered \ninto an unsustainable mortgage, they soon discovered that a large \nprepayment penalty made it too costly for them to refinance to a more \naffordable loan. They were locked into that first destructive loan they \ndid not fully understand when it was presented.\n  This scam has had a tremendous impact. A study for the Wall Street \nJournal found that 61 percent of the subprime loans that originated in \n2006--that is 61 percent that originated in 2006--went to families who \nqualified for prime loans. More than half the borrowers who qualified \nfor a prime loan ended up with a subprime loan because of these \nsteering payments, putting millions of American families at risk. This \nis simply wrong--a publicly regulated process designed to create a \nrelationship of trust between families and brokers but that leaves \nborrowers unaware of payments that take place, putting them into \nexpensive and destructive mortgages.\n  I call your attention to a New York Times editorial published on \nApril 9 entitled ``Predatory Brokers.'' This editorial highlighted the \nproblem. The Times concluded that:\n\n       The first step must be to outlaw the kickbacks that lenders \n     pay brokers for steering clients into costlier loans.\n\n  The editorial went on to say that:\n\n       The most clearly unethical form of payment is the so-called \n     yield-spread premium.\n\n  My friends, it is difficult to overstate the damage that has been \ndone by these practices. An estimated 20,000 Oregon families will lose \ntheir homes to foreclosure in 2009. Nationwide, an estimated 2 million \nfamilies will lose their homes this year. And the total of foreclosed \nfamilies is predicted to reach 9 million by 2012.\n  The legislative solutions I propose are very simple. The bills I am \nintroducing today will ensure these practices do not again haunt the \nmortgage business in America. First, the Transparency For Homeowners \nAct ends the secret steering payments to lenders who lead homeowners \ninto deceptive mortgages they cannot afford over the long term. Second, \nthe Promoting Mortgage Responsibility Act prohibits\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nlenders from issuing costly financial penalties that prevent homeowners \nfrom refinancing into a more affordable loan.\n  It is simple: an end to steering payments and an end to prepayment \npenalties. We should recognize that not only have these practices \ndamaged the financial foundations for our families and millions of \nfamilies at the retail level--turning the American dream of home \nownership into an American nightmare--but these practices, which \nresulted in a huge surge in subprime lending, set the stage for the \ndisaster that would come and is still unfolding on Wall Street and \ncrippling economies around the world.\n  My legislation will restore transparency to the mortgage lending \nprocess and help make home ownership a stable investment for families \nonce again. The time has come for us to make sure that secret steering \npayments and paralyzing prepayment penalties never again haunt American \nfamilies. Let us restore the American dream of home ownership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 913. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nworkplace health incentives by equalizing the tax consequences of \nemployee athletic facility use; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Workforce Health \nImprovement Program Act of 2009, otherwise known as the WHIP Act. This \nbipartisan bill I introduce today is the same legislation I introduced \nin the 110th Congress. I am very pleased to be joined again by my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, who shares my commitment to \nhelping keep America fit.\n  Public health experts unanimously agree that people who maintain \nactive and healthy lifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of \ncontracting chronic diseases. And as the government works to reign in \nthe high cost of health care, it is worth talking about what we all can \ndo to help ourselves. As you know, prevention is key, and exercise is a \nprimary component in the prevention of many adverse health conditions \nthat can arise over one's lifetime. A physically fit population helps \nto decrease health-care costs, reduce governmental spending, reduce \nillnesses, and improve worker productivity.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the \neconomic cost alone to businesses in the form of health insurance and \nabsenteeism is more than $15 billion. Additionally, the CDC estimates \nthat more than \\1/3\\ of all US adults fail to meet minimum \nrecommendations for aerobic physical activity based on the 2008 \nPhysical Activity Guidelines for Americans. With physical inactivity \nbeing a key contributing factor to overweight and obesity, and \nadversely affecting workforce productivity, we quite simply need to do \nmore to help employers encourage exercise.\n  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe Congress \nhas a duty to create as many incentives as possible to get Americans \noff the couch, up, and moving.\n  With this in mind, I am introducing the WHIP Act.\n  Current law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site \nworkout facilities, which are provided for the benefit of employees on \na pre-tax basis. But if a business wants or needs to outsource these \nhealth benefits, they and/or their employees are required to bear the \nfull cost. In other words, employees who receive off-site fitness \ncenter subsidies are required to pay income tax on the benefits, and \ntheir employers bear the associated administrative costs of complying \nwith the IRS rules.\n  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the tax code to the \nbenefit of many smaller businesses and their employees. Specifically, \nit would provide an employer's right to deduct up to $900 of the cost \nof providing health club benefits off-site for their employees. In \naddition, the employer's contribution to the cost of the health club \nfees would not be taxable income for employees--creating an incentive \nfor more employers to contribute to the health and welfare of their \nemployees.\n  The WHIP Act is an important step in reversing the largely \npreventable health crisis that our country is facing, through the \npromotion of physical activity and disease prevention. It is a critical \ncomponent of America's health care policy: prevention. It will improve \nour Nation's quality of life by promoting physical activity and \npreventing disease. Additionally, it will help relieve pressure on a \nstrained health care system and correct an inequity in the current tax \ncode.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an independent Cures Acceleration Network \nagency, to sponsor promising translational research to bridge the gap \nbetween laboratory discoveries and life-saving therapies, to \nreauthorize the National Institutes of Health, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today \nwould authorize the establishment of the Cures Acceleration Network, \nCAN. This new $2 billion agency would provide funds to translate \nresearch discoveries from the bench to the bedside and would operate as \nan independent agency. It would not be part of the Department of Health \nand Human Services. The CAN would make awards outside of the \ntraditional funding stream to accelerate the development of cures and \ntreatments including but not limited to drugs, devices, and behavioral \ntherapies. The CAN would have a flexible expedited review process to \nget monies into the hands of the grantees as quickly as possible. These \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nfunds would complement the research dollars provided to the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, and would not compete or take monies away \nfrom the NIH.\n  The bill also would raise the authorization level of the National \nInstitutes of Health to $40 billion in fiscal year 2010, elevate the \nCenter for Minority Health and Health Disparities to Institute status, \nand implement a new conflict-of-interest provision.\n  While the NIH funds much of the basic biomedical research at \nuniversities across the country, the CAN would take those findings \nfound through basic research and provide funding to fill the gap \nbetween laboratory discoveries and life-saving medical therapies. This \nfunding gap--often referred to as ``the valley of death'' arises after \nFederal basic-science support ends and before investors are willing to \ncommit to a promising discovery. Very often finding funds to fill this \ngap is a daunting challenge, especially during a period of economic \ndownturn, when investors have fewer resources to invest. This has had a \nsevere impact on America's biotechnology industry.\n  The need for the CAN is clear: Capital raised by America's \nbiotechnology companies fell 55 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Also \nrelative to 2007, 90 percent of small public biotechnology companies \nare now operating with less than 6 months of cash on hand. In the last \n5 months alone, at least 24 U.S. public biotech companies have either \nplaced drug development programs on hold or cut programs altogether. \nThese companies have postponed clinical trials to treat melanoma, \ncervical cancer, lupus, chemotherapy side effects for breast cancer \npatients, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and atherosclerosis, drug trials \nto treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testing of pandemic flu vaccine, \ntrials to treat plaque psoriasis and heart disease, and a treatment for \nmesothelioma.\n  In short, without adequate funding--these companies will be unable to \ntake these products to the development stage, the basic research done \nby the NIH will be lost, and many patients will die waiting for drugs \nand devices to give them a better quality of life.\n  The CAN would fund two types of grant awards, each with an \nauthorization of $1 billion in the first year and additional funds in \nsucceeding fiscal years.\n  The Cures Acceleration Grant Awards will provide grant awards of up \nto $15 million per year per project with out-year funding available. \nThese awards would be available to applicants who do not have access to \nprivate matching funds.\n  The Cures Acceleration Partnership Awards also would provide grants \nfor up to $15 million per year per project with additional funds \navailable in the out-years. However, grant awards would require a match \nof three Federal dollars to one grantee dollar, as a way to partially \noffset development costs.\n  For both grant types, the CAN Board may waive the award limitation as \nwell as modify the matching requirement.\n  Eligible grantees would include public or private entities such as \ninstitutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology \ncompanies, universities, patient advocacy organizations, pharmaceutical \ncompanies and academic research institutions.\n  To provide for expedited FDA approval, the grantees must also \nestablish protocols that comply with FDA standards to meet regulatory \nrequirements at all stages of development, manufacturing, review, \napproval and safety surveillance of a medical product.\n  The provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act would apply.\n  The CAN grant proposals would be evaluated by a 24-member board \ncomprised of experienced individuals of distinguished achievement, and \nrepresentative of a broad range of disciplinary interests including: \nventure capitalists and business executives with experience in managing \nscientific enterprises; scientists with expertise in the fields of \nbasic research, biopharmaceuticals, drug discovery, drug delivery of \nmedical products, bioinformatics, gene therapy or medical \ninstrumentation, regulatory review and approval of medical products; \nand representatives of patient advocacy organizations.\n  The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the CAN shall be appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. The term of office \nof each member of the Board shall be 2 years. The CAN board also will \ninclude ex-officio members representing the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Defense, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Science Foundation. \nThe CAN board will meet four times each calendar year, with 12 board \nmembers and representatives of the ex-officio members present at each \nmeeting. The board will be supported by an executive director and other \nemployees that the Board deems necessary to ensure efficient operation \nof the CAN.\n  The Chairman of the CAN shall have authority to enter into an \ninteragency agreement with the Center for Scientific Review at the \nNational Institutes of Health to utilize advisory panels to review \napplications, and to make recommendations to the CAN.\n  The increases that have been made in medical research over the past \n20-30 years have dramatically improved the survival rates for many \ndiseases--deaths from coronary artery disease declined by 18 percent \nbetween 1994 and 2004. Stroke deaths also fell by 24.2 percent during \nthat same time period. The five-years survival rates for Hodgkin's \nlymphoma have increased from 4 percent in the 1960s to more than 86 \npercent today. Survival rates for localized breast cancer have \nincreased from 80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. Over the \npast 25 years, survival rates for prostate cancer have increased from \n69 percent to almost 99 percent. So we are seeing real progress. But \nfor many other maladies, the statistics are not so good.\n  These medical advances do not happen overnight. It takes time and \nmoney for research institutions to develop scientists skilled in the \nlatest research techniques and to develop the costly infrastructure \nwhere research takes place.\n  Regrettably, Federal funding for NIH has steadily declined from the \n$3.8 billion increase provided in 2003--when the 5-year doubling of \nthat agency was completed. Had we provided sustained increases of $3.5 \nbillion per year, plus inflation since 2003, we would have $23 billion \nmore in funding for today. The shortfall due to inflationary costs \nalone is $5.2 billion. This flagging investment in medical research, \nmany believe, served to discourage bright young investigators from \nentering this field of study.\n  The $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health that was \nincluded in stimulus package provided an immediate infusion of new \nresearch dollars for medical research. While these funds will only make \nup for a portion of what was lost since 2003, it is a step in the right \ndirection. But much remains to be done. Additional dollars must be \nfound for the 2010 appropriation and beyond.\n  The $40 billion contained in the legislation that I am introducing \ntoday will help to re-energize our investment in medical research, \nsupport a new generation of young scientists and invest in the health \nof our Nation.\n  The bill also contains a provision which requires the Director of NIH \nto enforce conflict-of-interest policies, requiring primary \ninvestigators with financial interests to provide a detailed report how \nthe grant recipient will manage the investigator's conflict-of-\ninterest.\n  The legislation also elevates the National Center for Minority Health \nand Health Disparities to Institute status, a designation that will \nlead to more resources to address the health status of minority and \nother medically underserved communities.\n  While some might argue that at a time when our economy is struggling \nwe cannot afford to invest more in medical research. The fact is that \nresearch offers the only hope of saving lives, allowing our citizens to \nlead longer, more productive lives and saving billions of dollars in \nhealth care cost. To those critics I would say we cannot afford not to \ninvest in medical research. This is not simply good social policy; it \nis good economic policy as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n                                 S. 914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill provide assistance to Pakistan under certain \nconditions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nprovides the President with extraordinary, but critical authority under \nsection 451 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to \nassistance for Pakistan.\n  Specifically, the bill allows the President to reprogram up to \n$500,000,000 of previously appropriated foreign operations funds for \nassistance for Pakistan if the President determines that it is in the \nvital national security interests of the U.S. to do so.\n  The President must still report promptly to Congress on the exercise \nof this authority, and it is my expectation--although not legally \nbinding--that reprogrammed funds will be reimbursed in subsequent \nannual or supplemental appropriations bills.\n  Extended until September 30, 2010, this authority is required because \nof the increasingly dire situation in Pakistan and alarming news \nreports of territorial gains by extremists. While I do not pretend to \nhave the answers to Pakistan's myriad challenges, I do know that the \nadministration lacks the necessary authority to reprogram significant \nfunds to respond to further political and economic deterioration in \nthat country. Should the government of Pakistani President Zardari \ncollapse, the administration will need maximum flexibility in its \nresponse.\n  I can anticipate some may have a knee jerk reaction to the provision \nof such extraordinary authority. In response, I would remind my \ncolleagues that regardless of their opinions of Pakistan's messy \npolitical situation, events in Pakistan directly impact Afghanistan--\nand our troops on the ground there.\n  Of course, this is in addition to the impact that destabilization \nwould have on Pakistan's nuclear complex, specifically the combination \nof dozens of nuclear weapons, untested security systems, and a surplus \nof Islamic militants in the area. These issues are at the forefront of \nour security interests in the region and would exacerbate exponentially \nthe impact of destabilization.\n  It might interest my colleagues to know that current law limits \nsection 451 reprogram authority to $25,000,000. In contrast, the \nsupplemental budget request seeks $4,000,000,000 in special transfer \nauthority for the Department of Defense to meet emerging requirements. \nSurely, the State Department should also have increased flexibility to \nreact promptly to the economic and security needs of Pakistan should \nthe worst case scenario transpire.\n  I urge the relevant Committee to consider and act upon this \nlegislation quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 919. A bill to amend section 1154 of title 58, United States Code, \nto clarify the additional requirements for consideration to be afforded \ntime, place, and circumstances of service in determinations regarding \nservice-connected disabilities; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am today introducing the proposed \nClarification of Characteristics of Combat Service Act of 2009. This \nlegislation is designed to address concerns which have been noted \nduring the Committee's oversight visits to VA regional offices. From \nthe review of claims folders as part of ongoing oversight, Committee \nstaff has noted that VA adjudicators often fail to factor in the \nexistence of common occurrences when considering claims from combat \nveterans because there is no formal evidence on the matters in question \nin the claimant's official military records.\n  When common hazards exist in particular areas where our armed forces \nhave or are serving, a means must be established to determine whether a \nparticular veteran's claim of exposure to such hazard or matter is \nconsistent with the circumstances of service in that area, even without \nevidence in individual official records. This proposed bill would \nestablish a mechanism by requiring VA to promulgate regulations that \nwould include standards that VA adjudicators would use for evaluating \nthe consistency between lay evidence and claimed matters, such as \nexposure to factors common to servicemembers serving in particular \ncombat areas.\n  This proposed bill is intended to result in recognition by VA that, \nwhere there is evidence of common events, a veteran's testimony, if \nconsistent with other evidence, would be accepted without requiring \nspecific, formal evidence of individual exposure to the event. By law, \nlay testimony is currently recognized in claims where a veteran served \nin a military unit which participated in combat. While this bill is not \nintended to provide a presumption of service-connection for any \nparticular disability, it should improve the accurate adjudication of \nclaims in those cases where a veteran served in an area where certain \nevents or exposures are widespread.\n  For example, there is widespread agreement that those who have served \nin Iraq since the start of the conflict there have been exposed to \nimprovised explosive devices--IEDs. However,\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nbased on Committee oversight, it appears that it often happens that, \nwhen a veteran applies for compensation for disabilities related to IED \nexposure, such as tinnitus, the claim may be denied if the veteran's \nservice medical record does not show treatment for tinnitus in service \nor otherwise documents exposure to an IED. Since it would be highly \nunusual to find documentation of treatment where a veteran in a combat \nzone has consulted with medical personnel for a relatively minor \ncondition, such as exposure to an IED which did not cause acute \nobservable injury, the formal records would not be of use to the \nclaimant. The regulations required by the legislation I am introducing \nwould likely include provision for conceding exposure to an IED in \nclaims brought by veterans who served in Iraq.\n  Another example of the problems that the legislation is designed to \naddress involves claims from Korean war veterans, many of whom were \nexposed to extreme cold, but whose records may not have documentation \nof treatment for a cold injury or information on the actual temperature \nto which they were exposed. I would anticipate that the regulations \nrequired by this legislation would provide for VA to concede exposure \nto subfreezing temperatures in such cases if consistent with the \nlocation where the veteran served.\n  I expect that this measure should speed the processing by claims, by \nnot requiring each veteran to individually establish by official \ngovernment records, which often do not document individual \nparticipation, exposure to one or more events which are well \nestablished as circumstances involving the place and type of the \nveteran's service.\n  In closing, I note that this legislation has been developed in \nconsultation with VA and with a variety of individuals and groups \ninterested in VA claims but I do not view it as a final approach. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee and in the \nSenate, as well as with those with an interest in this issue, to \nimprove this bill so that combat veterans of the current conflicts and \nof earlier conflicts who allege exposure to well-recognized events will \nnot be burdened by requirements of acquiring official evidence of \nindividual participation in such events. This should help veterans \nreceive the benefits they deserve in a timely manner. I urge support \nfor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 11317 of title 40, United States \nCode, to improve the transparency of the status of information \ntechnology investments, to require greater accountability for cost \noverruns on Federal information technology investment projects, to \nimprove the processes agencies implement to manage information \ntechnology investments, to reward excellence in information technology \nacquisition, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills, S. \n920 and S. 921, that I believe could represent the most sweeping \nreforms of government information technology management reform we've \nconsidered in some time.\n  I would like to start by addressing the IT Investment Oversight and \nWaste Prevention Act.\n  Every year, agencies spend billions of dollars on IT investments that \nthey believe will increase productivity, reduce costs, or improve \ncustomer service. But agencies often fail to properly plan and manage \ntheir investments. Rather, nearly one third of all Federal IT \ninvestments are considered by OMB to be ``poorly planned.'' Many of \nthese investments will be delivered over budget, behind schedule, and \nnot performing up to agencies' original expectations.\n  Some might say that we just shouldn't make these kinds of \ninvestments. But many of them are critical to agency missions.\n  My colleagues and I on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, which I \nchair, have held four hearings on the issue of troubled IT investments \nnow, including one today. And what we've learned is that some agencies \ncan't keep the expected cost of their investments down or deliver them \non time as promised. Nor do these agencies, in many cases, have \nqualified IT experts they can turn to before a project spirals out of \ncontrol. The bill I have put forward today along with a number of my \ncolleagues addresses these issues.\n  Our bill starts by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to \nincrease the transparency of funded IT investments on a public website. \nOMB created such a website, known as VUE-IT, this past July following \none of our subcommittee hearings. Our bill would ensure that VUE-IT or \nwhatever similar site the new Obama team creates has the cost, \nschedule, and performance necessary for Congress and the general public \nto know if a project is a success or should be scrapped.\n  Our bill also requires that agency plans for new IT systems must \ncontain a clear business case and provide complete and accurate \ninformation before the OMB approves the investments. Although this \nsounds like a simple concept, it doesn't always happen. And OMB has \nhistorically been unwilling to turn down an agency IT request.\n  To correct this, our bill also empowers OMB and agency Chief \nInformation Officers to take action if they realize a project isn't \ngoing as planned, before it spirals out of control. This action could \nbe the assignment of highly-trained IT experts who could help bring \nprojects back on track.\n  Lastly, our bill recognizes that there are a lot of innovative and \nhardworking federal employees that deserve recognition for the work \nthey do in information technology. Our bill requires the Office of \nPersonnel Management to provide agencies guidance on programs that can \nbe set up to reward employees for their excellence.\n  Now, I would like to discuss my next bill titled the United States \nInformation and Communications Enhancement Act of 2009.\n  Everyday, massive amounts of information are transmitted across the \nglobal information infrastructure. Some of this information is routine \nemail between friends and family. Much of it, however, consists of \nhighly sensitive military information, however, or commercial secrets.\n  As all of us can attest to, increasing global interconnectivity has \ngreatly increased our productivity and ability to communicate. However, \nit has also increased our responsibility to make sure this information \nis protected.\n  The Federal Government stores within its databases some of our \nnation's most critical military, economic, and commercial secrets. \nGreat harm could be caused if it were to fall into the\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\nwrong hands. Knowing this, hackers, criminal organizations, and even \nother countries are spending a good deal of money and time trying to \naccess it.\n  In fact, just last week we learned that someone had gone online and \nstolen our military's most advanced jet fighter plans with the stroke \nof a button. The cost to the American taxpayer for this single incident \nis approximately $300 billion worth of research and development, and an \nincalculable amount if the information were to ever be used against us.\n  Unfortunately, many agencies have not done as much as they should be \ndoing to prevent these cyber intrusions. Instead they have been led to \nbelieve that producing plans about cyber security is equivalent to \nactually monitoring and protecting their networks. My bill will correct \nthis.\n  First, my bill recognizes that there needs to be a coordinating \noffice to oversee the multiple agencies that have a hand in cyber \nspace. Today, the NSA and the Departments of Homeland Security and \nDefense all have different roles when it comes to securing cyber \nnetworks in the federal government and the private sector. Their \nefforts are largely uncoordinated and ineffective. This bill creates a \nWhite House office with a director confirmed by the Senate whose major \nresponsibility would be to rectify this situation\n  My bill also ensures that agencies are spending scarce resources \neffectively. Instead of agencies wasting precious resources producing \nsecurity plans that are outdated as soon they are printed, my bill \nrequires agencies to continuously monitor their networks for cyber \nintrusions and malicious activities, take steps to address their \nvulnerabilities, and then regularly test whether the steps they are \ntaking to secure their networks are effective.\n  My bill also requires the General Service Administration to harness \nthe significant purchasing power of the federal government to purchase \nmore secure hardware and software. This is the model the Air Force used \na few years ago with Microsoft and it led to a savings of approximately \n$98 million in one year and an enhanced security posture. This is a \nsuccessful model that we should continue throughout the federal \ngovernment.\n  Lastly, my bill recognizes that the Department of Homeland Security \nhas taken the lead among civilian agencies in protecting the perimeter \nof the federal government but lacks some of the necessary authority and \ntechnical people necessary to realize a more secure civilian cyber \nspace. Therefore, our bill will require agencies to develop policy and \nguidance for coordinating with US-CERT and give the Director of US-CERT \nthe ability to hire the personnel needed to defend our national \nsecurity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these important \nand necessary reforms enacted before it's too late. I think everyone \ncan agree that computers, the Internet, and cutting-edge technology \nhave greatly benefited our government and our society. But we also need \nto recognize that it has greatly increased the threats we face on a \ndaily basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator Carper in \nreintroducing a bill that will improve agency performance and \nCongressional oversight of major federal information-technology, IT, \nprojects. We introduced this bill last Congress and offer it for \nconsideration again because it will strengthen oversight of technology \ninvestments to help prevent the waste and misuse of taxpayer dollars.\n  The well-publicized cost and performance problems with the Census \nBureau's handheld computers for the 2010 Census--with its troubling \nimplications for the next House reapportionment and for the allocation \nof Federal funds--represent only the most recent and conspicuous \nfailure in a long trail of troubles that also includes critical IT \nprojects like the FBI's Virtual Case File initiative.\n  The 2010 Census is notable among projects that have drawn our \nattention, not only because of its great scope and expense, but because \nof its history of unheeded cautions. For years, warnings of potential \ndangers came from experts sought out by the Census Bureau itself and \nfrom the Commerce Department's own Inspector General.\n  The implications of this lack of proper planning and oversight are \nevident in the burgeoning estimate for the life-cycle cost of the 2010 \nCensus. The Bureau initially estimated that the 2010 Census would cost \nthe taxpayers about $11.3 billion dollars; today, the estimated cost is \nmore than $14 billion.\n  Another example is the Department of Homeland Security's, DHS, \nefforts since 2004 to integrate its financial management systems. DHS \nspent approximately $52 million on one failed attempt before abandoning \nthe project nearly two years later. According to GAO, this attempt \nlikely failed because DHS had not developed an overall financial \nmanagement transformation strategy that included financial management \npolicies and procedures, standard business processes, a human capital \nstrategy, and effective internal controls. DHS spent approximately $52 \nmillion and now has little, if anything, to show for it.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is now attempting another \nconsolidation of its financial information technology systems. It is \nessential that, this time, the Department sufficiently plan and monitor \nits cost, schedule, and performance targets.\n\n  During the 108th Congress, the Committee on Governmental Affairs \ninvestigated the botched automated record-keeping project for the \nfederal employees' Thrift Savings Plan, TSP. This project was \nterminated in 2001 after a four-year contract produced $36 million in \nwaste that was charged to the accounts of TSP participants and \nbeneficiaries. A second vendor needed an additional $33 million to \nbring the system online, years overdue and costing more than double its \noriginal estimate.\n  In a 2004 letter from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board \nto the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Board characterized the \nproject as ``ill-fated,'' and acknowledged the importance of careful \nplanning, task definition, communication, proper personnel, and risk \nmanagement--all of which were lacking on that project.\n  Large IT project failures have cost US taxpayers literally billions \nof dollars in wasted expenditures. Perhaps even more troubling is the \nfact that when Federal IT projects fail, they can undermine the \ngovernment's ability to defend the nation, enforce its laws, or deliver \ncritical services to citizens. Again and again, we have seen IT project \nfailures grounded in poor planning, ill-defined and shifting \nrequirements, undisclosed difficulties, poor risk management, and lax \nmonitoring of performance.\n  Unfortunately, as the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \ncontinues to report, Federal IT projects still fall short in their use \nof effective oversight techniques to monitor development and to spot \nsigns of possible trouble.\n  The GAO reported that the Federal Government spent over $71 billion \nin fiscal year 2009 on IT projects. Most of that spending was \nconcentrated in two dozen agencies that have approximately 800 major \nprojects underway.\n  When the GAO reviewed a random sampling of these major Federal IT \nprojects, they found that 85--nearly half the sample--had been \n``rebaselined.'' Eighteen of those projects have been rebaselined three \nor more times. For example, the Department of Defense Advanced Field \nArtillery Tactical Data System has been rebaselined four times; a \nVeterans Affairs Health Administration Center project has been \nrebaselined 6 times.\n  Rebaselining can reflect funding changes, revisions in project scope \nor goals, and other perfectly reasonable project modifications. But as \nthe GAO notes, ``[rebaselining] can also be used to mask cost overruns \nand schedule delays.'' All major federal agencies have rebaselining \npolicies, but the GAO concludes that they are not comprehensive and \nthat ``none of the policies are fully consistent with best practices.''\n  The bill that Senator Carper and I are introducing will go far toward \naddressing the weaknesses identified by the GAO and will reduce the \nrisks that important Federal IT projects will drag on far beyond \ndeadlines, fail to deliver intended capabilities, or waste taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Our bill will improve both agency and Congressional oversight of \nlarge Federal IT projects. For all major investments, the bill requires \nagencies to track the Earned Value Management index, a key cost and \nperformance measure, and to alert Congress should that measure fall \nbelow a defined threshold.\n  The bill requires additional reports to Congress as well as specific \ncorrective actions should those same indicators continue to worsen. \nFurther, because the bill's performance thresholds are based on \noriginal cost baselines, rebaselining can no longer serve as a tactic \nto hide troubled projects. Where severe shortfalls remain uncorrected, \nagencies are prohibited from committing additional funds to the project \nuntil the required corrective actions are taken.\n  Our bill would not make Congress a micro-manager of Federal \nprojects--especially in so complex a field as information technology. \nBut it will ensure that, for these important investments, agencies will \nbe required to track key performance metrics, inform Congress of \nshortfalls in those metrics, and provide Congress with follow-up \nreports, independent cost estimates, and analyses of project \nalternatives when the original projects have run off course.\n  The bill also provides that each covered agency identify to Congress \ntheir top mission-critical projects. Those ``core investments'' would \nbe subject to additional upfront planning, reporting, and performance \nmonitoring requirements. This will help ensure that agencies apply \nextra vigilance to these projects at the planning stage, and not just \nwhen execution begins.\n\n  In addition to tracking cost and schedule slippage, agencies making\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\ncore IT investments must provide a complete ``business case'' that \noutlines the need for the project and its associated costs and \nschedules; produce a rigorous, independent, third-party estimate of the \nproject's full, life-cycle costs; have the agency CIO certify the \nproject's functional requirements; track these functional requirements; \nand report to Congress any changes in functional requirements, \nincluding whether those changes concealed a major cost increase.\n  To help agencies deliver IT projects on time and on budget, the bill \nalso provides two new support mechanisms.\n  First, agency heads would be required to establish an internal IT-\nmanagement program, subject to OMB guidelines, to improve project \nplanning, requirements development, and management of earned value and \nrisk.\n  Second, the Director of OMB and its E-Gov Administrator would be \nrequired to establish an IT Tiger Team of experts and independent \nconsultants that can be assigned to help agencies reform troubled \nprojects. In addition, the E-Gov Administrator can recommend that \nagency heads mentor or replace an IT project manager, reinforce the \nmanagement team, terminate the project, or hire an independent \ncontractor to report on the project.\n  These and other provisions will help improve project planning, avoid \nproblems in project execution, provide early alerts when problems \narise, and promote prompt corrective action.\n  In projects where difficulties persist, our bill provides strong \nremedies. For projects that exhibit a performance shortfall of 20 \npercent or more, the agency head involved must not only alert Congress \nbut also provide a summary of a concrete plan of action to correct the \nproblem. If the shortfall exceeds 40 percent, agencies have six months \nto take required remedial steps or else suspend further project \nspending until those steps are completed.\n  If the provisions of this bill had been in force during the past \ndecade, early indicators of trouble and prompt warnings to Congress \nmight have helped prevent much of the added cost, decreased \nfunctionality, and increased anxiety we now see surrounding the \nhandheld computers that were intended to streamline the 2010 Census. \nThe additional scrutiny of plans and costs required by this bill might \nhave saved some of the billions wasted on other IT projects that \nultimately landed on high-risk lists.\n  I urge every Senator to support this much-needed and bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER:\n  S. 921.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The development of an interconnected global information \n     infrastructure has significantly enhanced the productivity, \n     prosperity, and collaboration of people, business, and \n     governments worldwide.\n       (2) The information infrastructure of the United States is \n     a strategic national resource vital to our democracy, \n     economy, and security.\n       (3) The Federal Government must increasingly rely on a \n     trusted and resilient information infrastructure to \n     effectively and efficiently communicate with and deliver \n     services to citizens, enhance economic prosperity, defend the \n     Nation from attack, and recover from natural disasters.\n       (4) Since 2002 the Federal Government has experienced \n     multiple high-profile breaches that resulted in the theft of \n     sensitive information amounting to more than the entire print \n     collection contained in the Library of Congress, including \n     personally identifiable information, advanced scientific \n     research, and prenegotiated United States diplomatic \n     positions.\n       (5) On March 12, 2008 witnesses testified before a hearing \n     held by the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, \n     Government Information, Federal Services, and International \n     Security of the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate that--\n       (A) implementation of the Federal Information Security \n     Management Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296; 116 Stat. 2135) \n     wastes agency resources on paperwork exercise instead of \n     security;\n       (B) agencies do not fully understand what information they \n     hold, who has access to that information, and whether the \n     information has been compromised; and\n       (C) agencies lack effective coordination for mitigating and \n     responding to cyber-related incidents.\n       (6) The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-296; 116 Stat. 2135) needs to be amended to \n     increase the coordination of agency activities to enhance \n     situational awareness throughout the Federal Government using \n     more effective enterprise-wide automated monitoring, \n     detection, and response capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF FEDERAL INFORMATION POLICY.\n\n       Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subchapters II and III and inserting the following:\n\n                 ``SUBCHAPTER II--INFORMATION SECURITY\n\n     ``Sec. 3551.
