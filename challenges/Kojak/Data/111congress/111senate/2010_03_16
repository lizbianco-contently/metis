Madam President, the President recently noted that \neverything there is to say about health care has already been said. \nWhen it comes to the substance of the legislation, this may be true. I \nsuspect that is why an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose it. \nAmericans know exactly what is in this bill, and they have rejected it. \nThey do not want this bill to pass.\n  But there is still a lot to be said about the process Democrats are \nusing to force this bill through. That won't change whether they get \ntheir votes this week or not. The fact is, the die has already been \ncast on this Congress. Democratic leaders have been imploring Members \nto make history--make history, they say--by voting for this bill. But \nthis Congress is already guaranteed to go down in history--not for any \npiece of legislation but for the arrogant way it has dictated to the \nAmerican people what is best for them and for the ugly way in which it \nhas gone about getting around the will of the American people. \nDemocratic leaders have made it perfectly clear that they view their \nconstituents as an obstacle, particularly on the issue of health care. \nAt every turn, they have\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nmet fierce public opposition, and every time they have tried to come up \nwith a way to get around that fierce public opposition. It has become a \nvicious cycle: the harder Democrats try to get around the public, the \nmore repellent their proposals become and the more egregious their \nefforts become to get them through anyway.\n  We watched last summer as they forced their partisan health care bill \nthrough the committees. We watched as they tried to sell it to the \npublic as something other than what it was. We watched as they wrote \nthe final bill behind closed doors, then wheeled and dealed to get the \nlast few votes they needed to squeeze it through both Chambers on a \nparty-line vote. We saw the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Louisiana \npurchase,'' ``Gator Aid,'' and all the rest. But as ugly as all this \nwas, as distasteful as all these deals have been, they were child's \nplay--child's play--compared to the scheme they have been cooking up \nover in the House just this week.\n  The plan Speaker Pelosi has hatched for getting this bill through is \nto try to pull the wool over the eyes of the public, and it is jaw-\ndropping--it is jaw-dropping--in its audacity. Here is their plan: \nSpeaker Pelosi can't get enough of her Democratic majority to vote for \nthe Senate version of the bill, so she and her allies have concocted a \nway to pass it without actually casting a vote on it. They are \nconcocting a way to pass it without actually casting a vote on it--the \nso-called Slaughter solution in which the Senate bill is ``deemed'' to \nhave passed. This way, they will claim they never voted for it, even \nthough they will vote to send it to the President for his signature.\n  This ``scheme and deem'' approach has never been tried on a bill of \nthis scope, according to today's Washington Post. This is how they will \ntry to keep their fingerprints off a bill that forces taxpayers to \ncover the cost of abortions, cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, raises \ntaxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion, raises insurance premiums, creates a brand \nnew government entitlement program at a time when the entitlement \nprograms we already have are on the verge of bankruptcy, and vastly \nexpands the cost and reach of the Federal Government in Washington at a \ntime when most Americans think government is already entirely too big.\n\n  As Speaker Pelosi put it, ``Nobody wants to vote for the Senate \nbill.'' But anyone who believes they can send this bill to the \nPresident without being tarred by it is absolutely delusional. Anybody \nwho thinks this is a good strategy isn't thinking clearly. They are too \nclose to the situation. They don't realize this strategy is the only \nthing for which they or this Congress will be remembered. Anyone who \nendorses this strategy will be forever remembered for trying to claim \nthey didn't vote for something they did. They will be forever \nremembered by claiming they didn't vote for something they did vote \nfor. It will go down as one of the most extraordinary legislative \nsleights of hand in history. Make no mistake, this will be a career-\ndefining and a Congress-defining vote. Make no mistake, this will be a \ncareer-defining and a Congress-defining vote.\n  Most of the time, the verdict of history is hard to predict. In this \ncase, it is not. Anyone who endorses this strategy will be remembered \nfor it. On the other hand, anyone who decides in a moment of clarity \nthat they shouldn't, that they should resist this strategy, will be \nremembered for standing up to party leadership that lost its way.\n  Democratic leaders continue to advance the false argument that this \neffort is somehow akin to certain legislative efforts of the past. \nThere is no comparison. First of all, the good programs they are \nreferring to were far more modest. They enjoyed broad support from both \nparties in Congress. Most importantly, they enjoyed broad support of \nthe American people.\n  By contrast, there is no bipartisan consensus about this bill in \nCongress. It aims to reshape no less than one-sixth of our entire \neconomy at a moment when our economy is already suffering and our \nexisting debts threaten to drown us in a sea of red ink. Most \nimportantly, Americans overwhelmingly oppose it. If you need any \nevidence of that, look no further than today's Washington Post, which \ncalls this process unseemly, or the Cincinnati Enquirer, which calls it \ndisgusting. Look no further than the President's own pollster, who is \ntelling the White House that the chicanery the Democrats have used to \nadvance this measure is a serious problem.\n  This entire effort has been a travesty, but the latest solution to \ngive House Members a way out by telling them they can pretend they \ndidn't vote for something they will, in fact, be voting for has sealed \nits fate. The latest solution to give House Members a way out by \ntelling them they can pretend they didn't vote for something they will, \nin fact, vote for has sealed the fate of this legislation with the \nAmerican public.\n  It is time for rank-and-file Democrats to pull the fire alarm--pull \nthe fire alarm--and save the American people from this latest scheme \nand this unpopular bill. The process has been tainted. It is time to \nend the vicious cycle, start over, cleanse the process, and work on the \nstep-by-step reforms the American people really want. It is time to \nrecognize that constituents are not obstacles--constituents are not \nobstacles--to overcome with schemes and sweetheart deals. Fortunately, \nit is not too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1566-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there are many reasons why the Senate is \nknown as one of the world's greatest deliberative bodies. This Chamber \nhas seen some of the most important debates and votes since the \nbeginning of our Republic. As a freshman Senator--I know my colleague, \nthe Presiding Officer, is also a freshman Senator and soon we will be \njoined by a series of freshman Senators and my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, is here as well--I think we have all been struck by how \nmuch history has been made in this very Chamber.\n  I am reminded, as we saw last evening some of the exchanges between \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader, there is still an awful \nlot that I at least feel, as a newcomer, I have to learn. But one thing \nhas become clear to me since being sworn in a little over a year ago. \nSome of the very safeguards that were created to make this a serious \nand responsible deliberative body have been abused in a way that \ndamages this institution. In some instances, this abuse also runs \ncontrary to our national interest.\n  This became very clear to me several weeks ago during the nomination \nand voting on Justice Barbara Keenan. Senator Jim Webb, my colleague, \nand I had the honor of nominating Virginia Supreme Court Justice \nBarbara Milano Keenan to the Federal Appeals Court for the Fourth \nCircuit. She is one of the most highly regarded jurists in Virginia. \nShe received a unanimously ``well qualified'' rating from the ABA. She \nwas reported by the Judiciary Committee unanimously last October, and \nthen her nomination ground to a halt, first for weeks and then for \nmonths. In fact, her nomination was filibustered, if you can call it \nthat. I recall in school thinking the filibuster\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nwas something that was only going to be used on rare occasions of \nissues of national concern to make sure minority rights were protected.\n  Justice Keenan was filibustered, in effect, because one Senator \nplaced a hold on her. Consequently, cloture had to be filed. That was \ndespite the strong endorsement Justice Keenan had received from our new \nRepublican Governor, Governor McDonnell. I appreciate his support of \nJustice Keenan.\n  A funny thing happened when we forced the vote both on cloture and \nthe nomination: She was confirmed unanimously. Filibustering a nominee \nwho gets a unanimous vote, something is not right with that. That is \nnot the way this body is supposed to work.\n  This experience was truly an eye-opener for me. I see dozens of \nexecutive branch nominees caught up in this web. My understanding is, \nright now, in the second week of March, literally the Obama \nadministration has 64 nominees pending. These are nominees where, \ndespite overwhelming committee votes, they have languished on the \ncalendar for months, often because one Senator has a completely \ndifferent gripe about a completely unrelated issue.\n  The Presiding Officer knows, she and I were both Governors, we were \nboth CEOs. I think it is incredibly important, whether you are a \nGovernor, whether you are a CEO of a private company, and particularly \nif you are the President of this great country, you ought to be able to \nhave your management team in place, clearly, 14 months after the \ninauguration of President Obama.\n  I certainly do not believe the Senate should be a rubberstamp for \nnominees. Far from it. In cases where there is legitimate disagreement \nabout qualifications of any particular nominee, I am all for having a \ndebate and then a straight up-or-down vote. But that has not been the \ncase. It has not been the case with Justice Keenan, and I am going to \ncite one other individual today, and I know my other colleagues are \ngoing to be citing others.\n  The individual I wish to talk about is Michael Mundaca. He has been \nnominated by President Obama to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury \nfor Tax Policy--a very important job in crafting tax and revenue \npolicies. He is both highly qualified and well respected, having worked \npreviously at high levels of the Treasury Department and in the \ninternational tax department of Ernst and Young. He has a law degree \nfrom UC Berkeley School of Law and was executive editor of the \nCalifornia Law Review.\n  As I understand it, Mr. Mundaca's nomination was approved \noverwhelmingly, 19 to 4, in the Senate Finance Committee before \nChristmas. Since then, he has been denied a vote in this body, not over \nany substantive concerns. If there is a concern about Mr. Mundaca's \nqualifications, a Senator ought to come and make that case, and we \nought to have a debate. No, that is not the reason. It is because one \nSenator or group of Senators has decided to try to leverage this \nnomination to some other end. To me, that is simply not fair.\n  This morning--I see my colleagues starting to arrive--many Senators \nwho are relatively new to the body will take to the floor. We are the \nnew guys and gals, the freshmen and the sophomores. Maybe we do not \nunderstand all the rules and traditions. We basically spent our first \nyear trying to learn those rules and traditions.\n  But one of the issues that has united us in all coming here this \nmorning is because the nomination process is broken, and we are asking \nall our colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--to come together, not as \npartisans but as Americans.\n  In the last four Presidential terms, there have been two Democrats \nand two Republicans holding the White House. I am confident we would be \nhere regardless of who occupies the White House because a President \ndeserves his or her management team to be in place 14 months after \ninauguration. If there are problems with their nominees, they ought to \nbe debated and brought to the floor and discussed, not simply left in \nlimbo. We need to start doing our job and start voting up or down on \nthese nominees who are languishing on the Senate calendar.\n  I see my colleague who is much more experienced than this freshman, \nmy good friend, the Senator from Rhode Island. I now yield 4 minutes to \nmy friend, Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  The last 2 years have seen the American economy on the brink of \ncollapse, battered by an economic maelstrom not seen since the Great \nDepression and now slowly--too slowly--recovering its strength. \nPresident Obama's Recovery Act led the way, and we have seen its \nbenefits over the last year with job losses slowing significantly. He \ninherited an economy losing, I think, 700,000 jobs a month, and it is \nnow back to nearly break even.\n  An essential element of this recovery has been encouraging thriving \nexport markets. Last week, President Obama laid out his plan to double \nexports in 5 years, an initiative which could create up to 2 million \njobs. As the President said: ``In a time when millions of Americans are \nout of work, boosting our exports is a short-term imperative.''\n  But for international trade to function, our government must \nparticipate fully in international trade negotiations, advocating fair \nand open trading rules that allow American businesses to compete and \nexport.\n  Yet a single Senator, the Republican Senator from Kentucky, has \nblocked the President's nominees for two key trade positions--nominees \nwho cleared the committee with strong, positive votes. Michael Punke, \nnominated as Deputy Trade Representative to Geneva, and Islam Siddiqui, \nnominated to be Chief Agricultural Negotiator, deserve an up-or-down \nvote in the Senate.\n  In this economic crisis, why in the world would a Senator hold up \nsuch important appointments for our exports and for our economy, \nhobbling this administration's ability to fully participate in \ninternational trade talks?\n  The Senator from Kentucky has told us why: to try to force U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Ron Kirk to file a complaint regarding Canada's recently \npassed antismoking law. Yes, believe it or not, the Senator from \nKentucky is blocking the appointment of critical U.S. international \ntrade officials to try to force the administration to put pressure on \nCanada to change its antismoking law.\n  I am sure the tobacco industry is important in the Senator's home \nState, and protecting home State jobs is important. But hampering our \nability to negotiate our trade agreements in this time of economic \ndistress is not the way to do it. The Senator's hold is particularly \nironic and unproductive, since trade officials, such as these nominees, \nare the ones charged with negotiating resolutions to trade issues such \nas the one that appears to motivate the Senator from Kentucky. \nAmbassador Kirk recently commented that the absence of these officials \nis having a significant impact and indicated the situation is causing \nsome countries to question our commitment to serious trade talks. ``We \nwould be greatly advantaged not only just from the manpower and \nintellectual strength these two individuals bring, but I think it would \nhelp us regain some of our credibility,'' is what Ambassador Kirk said.\n  Let's be clear. The Senator from Kentucky has said he does not have \nany objection to these nominees. He is only blocking the nominations as \nleverage against the President and Ambassador Kirk. That is pure \nobstructionism.\n  It is these kinds of political power plays--one Senator actually had \n70 nominees on hold--that lead to such cynicism in the country about \nour ability to work together and get things done. When a Senator blocks \nbasic governmental action--action that all agree is of national \nimportance--for purely parochial and political reasons, the public \nrightly wonders what is going on.\n  If the Senator from Kentucky disagrees with the Canadian Legislature, \nfine, he should voice that disagreement publicly and try to persuade \nthe President of the merits of his point of view. He is welcome to do \nthat. Instead, he has chosen to add to the obstructionist tactics that \nare poisoning this Chamber and preventing the Government of the United \nStates from doing its business. That may serve the immediate political \ngoals of his party, but it is wrong for our country and it is wrong for \nall Americans who depend on an effective U.S. Government. I urge the \nSenator from Kentucky to release his holds.\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\n  I yield the floor back to Senator Warner from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of Senator \nWhitehouse and his pointing out one more example of a qualified nominee \nwho needs to be voted on up or down.\n  I now call upon my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator \nBurris.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Virginia and \nthe distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. It is a pleasure for me to \njoin in this very important discussion in the Senate.\n  I am proud to join my Democratic colleagues on the floor this morning \nto discuss some of the obstructionism we have seen from the other side \non a number of Presidential nominations. It is the duty of this Senate \nto provide advice and consent on more than 2,000 government officials \nappointed by the President of the United States. These individuals \nrange from Cabinet level officers to agency administrators, \nambassadors, Federal judges, and more. They are tasked with leading \nimportant agencies and offices such as the Transportation Security \nAdministration, our diplomatic missions around the world, and various \nlaw enforcement organizations.\n  These nominees generally make it through committee on near-unanimous \nbipartisan votes. They are extremely dedicated public servants who \nstand ready to defend our national security, advance our shared \ninterests, and carry out the important work of the American people. But \nwhen these nominations come out of the committee, they invariably hit a \nroadblock. They hit a stone wall. They are stalled the moment they come \nto the Senate floor. That is because my Republican friends are holding \nup dozens of these nominations.\n  Scores of important offices remain vacant because of the same \npartisan tactics of distraction and delay that we have seen time and \ntime again from the other side. It is not that my Republican colleagues \nhave any problems with the qualifications of the nominees themselves. \nThey enjoy bipartisan support in committee. They carry the high esteem \nof both Democrats and Republicans. When we are finally able to break \nthe filibuster and have an up-or-down vote, these individuals are \nalmost always confirmed unanimously, as the judge from Senator Warner's \nState of Virginia was, with a vote of 99 to 0. It was senseless for \nthat nomination to be held up for that long.\n  But thanks to the same old political games, it is difficult to get \ncloture on these nominations so we can get a floor vote in the first \nplace. The same Republican Senators who vote in favor of these nominees \nin committee--the same Senators who later support them on the floor--\ntry to keep us from moving forward as a full Senate. This is \nobstructionism at its worst. This is pure politics at the expense of \nthe American taxpayers.\n  This is a waste of our time and effort, and the American people \ndeserve better. They sent us to Washington to solve big problems--to \ncreate jobs, to reform health care, to strengthen our educational \nsystem. But my Republican friends are not interested in working \ntogether to confront these challenges. Instead, they drag their feet on \nnoncontroversial things such as Presidential nominations in hopes of \nscoring political points. They bring this body to a standstill just so \nthey can advance a partisan agenda. Meanwhile, dozens of important \nFederal agencies are without leadership at the highest levels. \nThousands of government employees are working without the public \nservants who have been appointed to lead them--all because of \nRepublican political games.\n  So I would ask my good friends from the other side of the aisle to \nabandon these tactics of distraction and delay. Let's have a \nsubstantial debate about the issues, not an argument over procedure. \nLet's stop wasting time and start working together to solve the \nproblems we face. In the meantime, let's confirm these nominees so they \ncan take up their appointed offices and begin to serve the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues from the \nfreshman and sophomore classes to point out the obstruction that we are \nseeing from the other side of the aisle in holding up these executive \nbranch nominees. It is unfortunate, with so many challenges facing this \ncountry, that we have to be on the floor of the Senate today talking \nabout obstructionism rather than talking about what we can do to \naddress the real issues facing this country.\n  One of those important issues has to do with how we get this economy \ngoing again. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside \nof the United States; and for American companies to grow and expand, to \ncreate jobs, we have to increase exports of goods and services. That is \nthe simple reality.\n  There are several actions we need to take to help American companies \ncompete overseas. Tomorrow, for example, I am going to be back on the \nSenate floor talking about what we can do to strengthen the Small \nBusiness Administration's export lending and promotion services. \nCertainly another thing we need to do is to protect the interests of \nAmerican companies and workers in the trade arena.\n  As we have already heard from Senator Whitehouse, that is why it is \nunconscionable that the confirmation of President Obama's nominee to be \nAmbassador to the World Trade Organization, Michael Punke, is being \nheld up by a single Senator.\n  Senator Tester came to the floor last week to ask Senator Bunning to \nstop blocking Mr. Punke's confirmation. Now, after reading yesterday's \nNew York Times, I felt compelled to also speak about the hold on this \nconfirmation. Yesterday's story in the paper reported on China's \naggressive filing of complaints with the WTO. In the last 12 months, \nChina filed more complaints with the WTO than any other country, even \nthough it is cleaning the clock of every country on the planet, \nincluding the United States, when it comes to trade.\n  China racked up a nearly $200 billion trade surplus with the rest of \nthe world last year. Its trade imbalance with the United States is 4 to \n1. Yet the top position of the United States at the WTO--you guessed \nit, the position that Mr. Punke has been nominated for--is being held \nup, is still vacant because there is one Senator who is unhappy with \nCanada's tobacco law.\n  That is right. As Senator Whitehouse has already told us, the hold on \nMr. Punke has nothing to do with whether he is qualified to be \nambassador to the WTO. His confirmation was unanimously recommended by \nthe Finance Committee 3 months ago. No, this critical post remains \nvacant because one Senator--Senator Bunning--is angry that Canada \nbanned flavored cigarettes as a way to combat teen smoking.\n  I certainly understand the tobacco industry fears the Canadian law \nwill be interpreted broadly to ban American-blend cigarettes. But \nblocking the confirmation of our WTO ambassador over this issue at this \ntime, when expanding exports is critical to our economic recovery, is \ncounterproductive, and it is an abuse of Senate rules. The point has \nnow been made. So now is the time for Senator Bunning to lift this hold \nso we can confirm Mr. Punke and we can get this critical position \nfilled and make sure that American businesses have a level playing \nfield when it comes to exports.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in the \nfreshman and sophomore classes today to highlight a recurring problem \nin the Senate--the Republican holds on the confirmations of crucial \nexecutive branch nominees. These are not controversial people, as you \nwill hear from what I am going to tell you from my part of the story \ntoday and what you have heard from some of my colleagues.\n  As a former prosecutor and the manager of a prosecutor's office of \nmore than 400 people, I know from personal experience how important it \nis to have a strong leadership team in place. Only with a strong \nleadership team can an executive implement his or her vision. In our \ncurrent economy, a vision for increased trade and export promotion is \nparticularly important, and the President has one.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  Earlier this year, he announced a plan, widely supported by CEOs of \nlarge and small corporations, to double American exports overseas in \nthe next 5 years. Export promotion is a topic that is of special \ninterest to me, as I chair the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, \nInnovation and Export Promotion.\n  I truly believe if we are to move this economy again, we have a world \nof opportunity out there. Ninety-five percent of the world's customers \nare outside of our borders. This is a different world with growing \nbuying power in countries such as India and China, where instead of \njust importing goods we can be making stuff again; we can be sending it \nout so that customers in these other countries can be buying it.\n  Look at the numbers. A diversified base of customers helps a business \nweather the economic ups and downs. According to research, businesses \nthat export grow 1.3 percent faster--and they are nearly 8.5 percent \nmore likely to stay in business--than companies that don't export. \nThese are the facts. So it is hard to believe, when we have a laser \nfocus on the economy right now, when that is all I hear about from the \npeople of my State, that my friends on the other side of the aisle are \nholding up the President's nominees for positions that promote American \nexports abroad. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  Right now, Republican holds are blocking votes on the confirmations \nof Michael Punke, nominated to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, and \n``Isi'' Siddiqui, nominated to be Chief Agricultural Negotiator. These \nnominees have five decades of experience in international trade between \nthe two of them, including extensive private sector and government \nwork. They work with Democrats and they work with Republicans. They \njust want to get this economy moving again. But our friends on the \nother side of the aisle are placing holds on them at the very time when \nwe all know this is the direction in which we need to move. These are \nexactly the type of people who could help expand American agricultural \nand small business exports and grow our economy.\n  These two nominees have been fully vetted and received strong \nbipartisan support in their Finance Committee hearings. They were \nrecommended by the Finance Committee to the full Senate by a vote of 23 \nto 0--including the affirmative vote of the Senator who has since \nplaced a hold on Mr. Punke. No one would believe this. The reason for \nthe hold? The Senator in question wants Mr. Punke to commit to forcing \nCanada to repeal parts of an antismoking law passed by the Canadian \nParliament.\n  So we have people in Rhode Island, in Illinois, in Minnesota, in New \nHampshire who are looking for jobs, and they know that a key part of \nthis is to increase exports to be able to sell our goods to other \ncountries. Yet these guys are placing a hold on the very people who can \nget this work done because they are concerned about a law passed by the \nCanadian Parliament. It is too good to be true but, sadly, it is true.\n  Holding these nominees in limbo has dire consequences for our ability \nto promote American products abroad. Our international partners \nactually use the absence of Mr. Punke and Dr. Siddiqui as an excuse to \nstall progress on serious negotiations. You know what they say. They \nsay: You don't have your guys in place. You don't have your people in \nplace, so we are not negotiating with you, America.\n  Blocking these nominees gives cover to other nations that want to \nkeep the United States from getting fair market access in the global \ntrading system for American agriculture, manufacturing, and services.\n  A coalition of 42 food and agricultural groups wrote Senators Reid \nand McConnell in January to call for quick approval. They said: U.S. \nfood and agricultural exports are under assault in many markets with \ntrading partners erecting even more barriers in recent months. It has \nto stop.\n  In the United States, we further export promotion policy through a \nvariety of different executive agencies, and Republicans aren't just \nholding up USTR reps, they are also holding up Eric Hirschhorn, the \nnominee to head up the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Commerce \nDepartment. This is the division at Commerce that screens exports to \nmake sure national security, economic security, cyber-security, and \nhomeland security standards are upheld when we export sensitive \ntechnologies.\n  The head of this bureau engages in strategic dialogues with high-\nlevel government officials from key transshipment countries such as \nMalaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates in order \nto prevent sensitive technologies from being diverted to China, Iran, \nand North Korea. Leaving this position unfilled sends a negative \nmessage to the domestic exporting community, to our allied governments, \nand it hurts our security. Why would we want to leave this position \nunfilled?\n  Mr. Hirschhorn has spent more than 30 years involved in issues \nrelated to export control. As an author of numerous articles and ``The \nExport Control and Embargo Handbook,'' which is widely recognized as \nthe leading text on the issue, Hirschhorn displays an unparalleled \nunderstanding of the importance of export control systems and work.\n  These are a few examples of the pivotal positions being held up by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle. If you are going to talk \nthe talk about moving this economy, about exports, about trade, about \ngetting our goods out there, building things again, then you should \nwalk the walk. You should not be holding up Siddiqui and Punke and \nHirschhorn. These are noncontroversial people. Nobody watching C-SPAN \nhas ever heard of them before. They are not in the middle of some \ncontroversial mess. They are trying to get our country moving again. \nThat is what this is about. For people who are trying to get jobs, \ntrying to move this country, they need people in place in the \ngovernment to help them. Take those holds off, get this moving, put \nthese people in place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to decry the attack of my \nRepublican colleagues on the executive branch of the United States of \nAmerica. The Constitution, which we are sworn to uphold, calls for a \nbalance of power between three branches of government--the executive \nbranch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. In it, it \ngives us a certain ability to test the fitness of high appointees to \nthe executive branch. That is the advise and consent clause of the \nConstitution.\n  The Constitution does not have a delay and obstruct clause. It has an \nadvise and consent clause. That means we have the responsibility, on a \ntimely basis, to review high appointees to the executive branch and \ngive our opinion. If we vote a person down, then indeed that nomination \ndoes not go forward.\n  What we have here is not a sincere application of advise and consent. \nWe have a systematic effort underway to undermine the credibility and \nthe capability of the President's team here in America.\n  This is a list of nominations that is being held up. This is not one \nnomination here and one nomination there. These are dozens and dozens \nof key appointees who will make the executive branch operate. Let's \nlook at some of these. The Federal Election Commission, the Department \nof Energy, the Small Business Administration, the National Labor \nRelations Board, the Legal Services Corporation, the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Army, the Executive Office of the President, the \nAmtrak Board of Directors, the National Transportation Safety Board, \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Farm Credit \nAdministration, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, the Department of the Treasury, the Department \nof Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State, \nthe Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nNational Council on Disability, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  Fellow Americans, I think you get the picture that this is a list in \na systematic effort to undermine the ability of the executive branch to \ndo its job. If we simply look back at the nominations on which we have \nhad to file cloture and hold a vote in this Chamber, two-thirds of \nthose nominees have passed by more than 70 of this body.\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nMany of them had 80 or 90 votes because there was no sincere objection \nto this individual, be it he or she, in a number of these departments. \nBut it was a systematic effort to delay the capability of the executive \nbranch of the United States of America. That is unacceptable. We are \nnot empowered as a Chamber, in this Constitution, to delay and obstruct \nand prevent the executive branch from doing its job.\n  I call upon my Republican colleagues who are conducting this attack \non the President and his team to honor their constitutional \nresponsibilities to advise and consent, to take this list and if there \nare a couple of key nominees that you have serious concerns about, then \nindeed let's have that debate here on the floor. But these dozens need \nto be set free to do their job. That is how the balance of powers is \nenvisioned in the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to raise questions \nabout why the Republicans in the Senate are holding up a number of \nnominations. We have heard some of that articulated this morning by a \nnumber of our colleagues. I have a specific example of what this kind \nof obstruction leads to. It is with regard to a circuit court \nnomination, in this case a judge in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. This is someone I have known a long time, someone I have \nknown to be not only capable to do the job a U.S. Court of Appeals \njudge must do, but also someone who has demonstrated his ability on the \ndistrict court for many years. The person I am speaking of is Judge \nThomas I. Vanaskie, who has been nominated for a position on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, \nDelaware, and the Virgin Islands.\n  As I said, I have known him a long time. He is someone who has been a \nlegal scholar, someone who has a long and distinguished career on the \nFederal bench as well as a career as an advocate when he was practicing \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent a fuller statement of his record and resume \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               biography\n\n       Judge Vanaskie's biography highlights both his scholarly \n     and professional accomplishments and the high esteem in which \n     he is held by his colleagues in the legal profession. He \n     graduated magna cum laude from Lycoming College in \n     Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he was also an honorable \n     mention All-American football player, a first team Academic \n     All-American, the college's outstanding male student athlete, \n     and the recipient of the highest award given to a graduating \n     student.\n       At Dickinson School of Law, from which he graduated cum \n     laude in 1978, Judge Vanaskie served as an editor of the Law \n     Review and received the M. Vashti Burr award, a scholarship \n     given by the faculty to the student deemed ``most \n     deserving''.\n       After graduating, Judge Vanaskie served as a law clerk for \n     Judge William J. Nealon, Chief Judge of the U.S. District \n     Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n       Judge Vanaskie practiced law for two highly regarded \n     Pennsylvania firms before his appointment to the U.S. \n     District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in \n     1994.\n       He became the Middle District's Chief Judge in 1999 and \n     completed his seven-year term in 2006.\n       He was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to the \n     Information Technology Committee of the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States where he served as Chair for three \n     years. He has also participated in several working groups of \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, mostly \n     recently on the Future of District CM/ECF Working Group, \n     tasked with determining the design and development of the \n     next generation of the federal judiciary's electronic case \n     filing program.\n       He is an adjunct professor at the Dickinson School of Law \n     and has also been active in civic and charitable efforts in \n     his hometown of Scranton.\n\n\n                               accolades\n\n       Lawyers who have appeared before Judge Vanaskie have \n     expressed tremendous respect for his intellectual rigor and \n     the disciplined attention he brings to the matters before \n     him.\n       One attorney who has tried over a dozen cases before Judge \n     Vanaskie has described him as ``objective, fair, analytical, \n     dispassionate, extraordinarily careful, and very respectful \n     of appellate authority.'' This same practitioner said that he \n     has not always agreed with Judge Vanaskie's decisions, but he \n     has always felt that his rulings reflected what the Judge \n     considered to be the most appropriate result, and the result \n     that he was obligated to impose under the law.\n        U.S. District Judge William J. Nealon, for whom Judge \n     Vanaskie clerked has described him as ``superbly qualified . \n     . . He's outstanding . . . He's brilliant. He's objective. \n     And he's tireless . . .''\n        Judge Vanaskie recognizes that for many citizens, his \n     decisions will be the final word on their claims. He treats \n     people with respect and honors their right to be heard. His \n     deep understanding of and respect for the law will serve him \n     well in ruling on cases and authoring opinions that will be \n     influential in the Third Circuit and beyond.\n\n\n                           career highlights\n\n        In 2008, Judge Vanaskie presided over the first known \n     court appearance of aging mobster Bill D'Elia where he \n     pleaded guilty to two federal felonies. He later sentenced \n     ``Big Billy'' to serve in federal prison.\n        Late last year, Judge Vanaskie sentenced the former \n     Superintendent of the Pittston Area School District to 13 \n     months in federal prison and a $15,000 fine for accepting \n     $5,000 cash in kickbacks from a contractor he supported in \n     obtaining a contract with the school district. The case is \n     part of an ongoing investigation by the FBI and the IRS and \n     is being prosecuted by a team of federal prosecutors.\n        He ruled that the government could not deport Sameh \n     Khouzam, a native of Egypt and a Christian, because the State \n     Department did not review Egyptian diplomatic assurances that \n     Khouzam would not be tortured upon his return. ``The fact \n     that this matter implicates the foreign affairs of the United \n     States does not insulate the executive branch action from \n     judicial review,'' the Judge wrote. ``Not even the president \n     of the United States has the authority to sacrifice . . . the \n     right to be free from torture . . .''\n        He presided over the trial and sentencing of an Old Forge \n     man who spent more than $413,000 that he stole from victims \n     of an investment scam. ``You stole these people's money,'' \n     said the Judge. ``I can't sugarcoat it.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Judge Vanaskie graduated with high honors from Lycoming \nCollege and was an honorable mention All-American football player \nthere. He attended the Dickinson School of Law in Pennsylvania, \ngraduated with honors in 1978, was editor of the Law Review, clerked \nfor Judge William Nealon, who was then the Chief Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. Judge Vanaskie went on to have a \ndistinguished career as a lawyer. He got to the Middle District Court, \nthe U.S. Middle District of Pennsylvania in 1994, became the Chief \nJudge, just like Judge Nealon, the judge he served. Judge Vanaskie \nbecame the Middle District's Chief Judge in 1999 and his 7-year term as \nChief Judge was completed in 1996.\n  He was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to the Information \nTechnology Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, \nwhere he served as Chair for 3 years.\n  I will submit for the Record, as I mentioned before, what many people \nhave said about him in addition to his record. I will read one of those \nat this moment. Judge Nealon, someone who has been on the District \nCourt of Pennsylvania, the Middle District, for more than a generation, \nsince 1962--here is what that judge said about Judge Vanaskie. He said:\n\n       He is superbly qualified, he is outstanding, he is \n     brilliant, he is objective and he is tireless.\n\n  There is not much more you could say that would be higher praise than \nthat from not only a colleague but someone who has had decades of \nexperience presiding over complex matters in the district courts.\n  In my own judgment, Judge Vanaskie demonstrated, when he was on the \ndistrict court, the kind of legal acumen and scholarship and commitment \nto the rule of law that made him stand out on the district court. I \nknow I personally have experience with that; I appeared before him. I \nremember in particular trying a case in front of him. He is someone I \nknew very well for many years, someone I had great respect for, but \nalso someone I knew personally. Despite that personal connection, I do \nremember him ruling against me on a number of objections. That alone is \ntestament to his integrity. It is widely shared.\n  When you consider all of that legal experience, unquestioned ability \non the district court, unquestioned ability to handle very complex \nmatters that prepared him to serve on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals and that he was voted out of committee close to unanimously--I \nthink there were three votes against him. I will doublecheck this, but \nI think the vote was 16 to 3. I will make sure we check that for the \nRecord.\n  Having said all that, I cannot understand why our friends on the \nother side\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nof the aisle would want to hold up someone who has such a brilliant \nrecord, who is committed to being and has already demonstrated a \ncommitment to be a fair-minded judge, someone who will set aside their \npersonal points of view, their personal biases, to rule on matters that \ncome before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It does \nnot make much sense when you consider the support he has received. But \nit seems, as on so many of these nominations, the impediment here is \nnot a set of questions, not a set of unresolved issues. The impediment \nis too many Senators on the other side of the aisle who want to use the \nnomination process to achieve political objectives. That, in my \njudgment, is what is happening.\n  What they should do for the American people is set aside those \npolitical objectives and get people confirmed, just as they would hope \nthat their nominees, people they support under a Republican President, \nwould be confirmed.\n  This is just one example, but I think a very telling example, of what \nour friends are doing when they hold up a judge who has that kind of \nrecord of service, of commitment to justice and the rule of law. I \nthink it speaks volumes about what is happening in the Senate on \nnominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the gridlock \nin the Senate and the effect it has on our ability to do our jobs as \nlegislators. If you talk to the average person on the street, he or she \nwill probably tell you that Americans are pretty frustrated with their \ngovernment right now. People think government does not work and that \npoliticians care more about fighting with each other than they do about \nhelping American families.\n  Some days I can hardly blame the people who hold this opinion. We are \nnow in the second year of President Obama's administration and we have \nonly just begun to fill the spots in the executive and judicial \nbranches because of filibusters, holds, and other procedural tactics \nthat have delayed an extraordinary number of people. We had no Under \nSecretary for Domestic Finance at the Treasury Department despite the \nfact that our country has just experienced arguably the worst economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression. We have no Assistant Secretary for \nLegislation at the Department of Health and Human Services. You would \nthink when we have been considering health care reform legislation in \nthe past year, it might be helpful to confirm an Assistant Secretary \nfor Legislation at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  There are so few members of the National Labor Relations Board, the \nSupreme Court is currently deciding whether the NLRB's current \ndecisions have any legal standing, yet we have failed to confirm a \nsingle one of President Obama's three nominees.\n  In one of the most egregious examples of obstructionism, the Senate \nfailed to vote on the appointment of the first nominee for \nTransportation Security Administration Chief, the person charged with \nkeeping our Nation's airlines safe. In the interim, a terrorist tried \nto attack Northwest flight 253. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the nominee \neventually withdrew himself from consideration, saying he was \n``obstructed by political ideology.''\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: I have no problem with \nstanding on principle. Our first President, George Washington, \nsupposedly once said we pour House legislation into the senatorial \nsaucer to cool it. Whether or not that story is true, the Senate has \nlong served as the cooling Chamber, the place where reason and \nthoughtful debate occur in our Congress. The filibuster is a key tool \nfor the way the minority can stand up to a majority that is acting \nirrationally in the heat of the moment. So I have no problems with my \ncolleagues threatening to filibuster nominees or legislation that they \nactually oppose.\n  That is what the Founders intended. The Senate has an important role \nto play in giving the President its advice and consent on nominations. \nI take that role very seriously. But too often my colleagues filibuster \nnominees they actually support in an effort to extract other promises \nor just to slow the Senate down.\n  In February, the Senate finally confirmed the noncontroversial \nadministrator of the General Services Administration after 9 months. \nThe vote was 94 to 2. Similarly this month, my colleagues forced a \ncloture vote, they forced a cloture vote to approve a judicial nominee \nfor the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. She was then confirmed \nunanimously, 99 to 0.\n  Yet we are forced to vote for a filibuster. That is nuts. This is a \nperversion of the filibuster and a perversion of the role of the \nSenate. It used to be the filibuster was reserved for matters of great \nprinciple. Today it has become a way to play out the clock. Some of my \ncolleagues seem more interested in using every procedural method \npossible to keep the Senate from doing anything then they are in \ncreating jobs or helping Americans struggling in a difficult economy.\n  They seem to actually want the government to fail. Why else delay \nthings you actually agree with? No wonder Americans are frustrated with \nthe government. It is time for this to stop. It is time for the Senate \nto stop playing politics or pursuing personal agendas and start \napproving well-qualified nominees without forcing unnecessary delay.\n  For our government to function the way it is supposed to, it needs to \nhave personnel. Let's give the executive branch and the judicial branch \nthe people they need so we can help government function in the way it \nis supposed to and reassure Americans that government does work for \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise, along with my \ncolleagues this morning, to draw attention to the growing dysfunction \nexacted on this institution's ability to confirm both judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees.\n  Having served five terms in the House of Representatives, I have come \nto expect a certain amount of political revelry and combat. While I was \nhonored to serve in the House, and I have fond memories of the often \nraucous debates there, I had high expectations that the Senate would \ntruly be a place of deliberation and bipartisan goodwill.\n  Of late, however, it seems the worst political gamesmanship has \ninfiltrated the Senate. Perhaps the proverb ``the grass is always \ngreener on the other side'' applies here, but I do have to tell you, I \nthink the level of gridlock we have faced in the last year is \nunprecedented.\n  We have seen roadblock after roadblock as we have tried to exercise \none of the most basic functions of the Senate, that of making sure we \nhave a full complement of Federal judges and ensuring the departments \nand agencies of the sitting administration are filled with competent \npublic servants.\n  In contrast, by this date during President Bush's first term in \noffice, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, had confirmed twice as \nmany circuit and district court nominations. The obstruction of present \njudicial nominees is all the more galling when you note that they were \nreported by the Judiciary Committee without dissent.\n  Two weeks ago today, we were forced to invoke cloture on Barbara \nMilano Keenan to be U.S. circuit judge. Her nomination was held up for \nmonths. We finally had to say enough is enough and shut off the \nfilibuster. When we finally voted on cloture, it was invoked 99 to 0, \nmeaning not a single Senator was willing to stand and oppose the \nnominee.\n  You know in your State, Mr. President, this is the kind of \nsuperficial partisanship the American people are fed up with. In \naddition to judicial nominees, President Obama's executive branch \nappointments have suffered from a similar kind of gamesmanship. One \nwould be hard-pressed to find one single department in this \nadministration whose work has not been interrupted by phony delays.\n  Let me give you an example. After having invoked cloture and overcome \na filibuster on Martha Johnson to be the Director of the General \nServices Administration, not a single Senator was willing to stand in \nopposition to the nominee. Cloture was invoked and she was confirmed by \na 96-to-0 margin.\n  I know partisanship is rampant in this town, but the American people \ndeserve to know what is happening in the\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nSenate. We are reaching a heightened level of imprudence, the kind \nGeorge Washington warned us about in his farewell address in 1796.\n  In outlaying the principle we first all have an obligation to govern, \nWashington stated, ``All obstructions to the execution of the national \nlaws [ . . . ] with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or \nawe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities \nare destructive of this fundamental principle.''\n  As I close, the American people know this town causes grown men and \nwomen to bicker and fight like children. Children have an excuse, they \nare children. We are not. We can do better, and I urge my colleagues to \nset aside their partisan differences, end this gridlock, and begin \nworking together for the good of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank the Senator from Colorado for yielding.\n  I am joining my freshman colleagues on the floor to express my \namazement at the difficulty this body is having conducting even the \nsimplest legislative functions.\n  When I came to Washington last year from the North Carolina State \nSenate, I was certainly under no illusions that the process here would \nbe lightening fast. In fact, I believe strongly we should take the time \nto make reasoned judgments about legislative and executive branch and \njudicial nominees. The American people are better served when we take \nthe time to make the best decisions.\n  But there is a difference between taking time for reasoned judgment \nand impeding progress for the sole purpose of delay. There currently \nare 67 executive branch nominations awaiting action by the full Senate. \nEvery one of these has been approved by the committee of jurisdiction, \nmany having been approved unanimously. Thirty-one of those sixty-seven \nnominees were approved in committee last year and have been waiting for \nmonths for action by the full Senate.\n  One individual awaiting action by the Senate, Michael Punke, has been \nnominated to be our ambassador to the World Trade Organization. He was \napproved unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee in December.\n  As my colleagues know, the member countries of the WTO are currently \nengaged in a round of trade talks that could have enormous implications \nfor American workers and industries. Would it not make sense to have \nthe best possible American representation at those talks? Should we not \nwant someone there who is advocating forcefully on behalf of our \nAmerican workers, producers, and businesses?\n  It has been reported the delay in considering this particular \nnomination is connected to a concern one Senator has regarding a recent \ntobacco law passed in the Canadian Parliament. Well, I represent the \nlargest tobacco State in the country. I will be honest, I understand \nthe concerns of my fellow tobacco-State Senator regarding this \nlegislation.\n  But I guess I have not been here long enough to understand how \nconcerns with Canadian tobacco legislation lead you to the conclusion \nthat you should prevent the United States from being represented in \ninternational trade negotiations. How are we supposed to address our \nissues with Canada and all trading partners when our seat at the table \nis empty? That is just one example. The calendar is full of nominees \nwho deserve a vote.\n  In fact, there are two judicial nominees on the calendar from North \nCarolina who would be easily confirmed should they come up with for a \nvote, Jim Wynn and Al Diaz, nominees for the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. They were both approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nJanuary. But truth be told, we have not just been waiting since \nJanuary, we have been waiting since 1994.\n  There has been an opening for a North Carolina judge on the Fourth \nCircuit since 1994. Partisan politics has gotten in the way of filling \nthat vacancy time and again. Finally, we have not one but two qualified \njudges, supported by both myself and Senator Burr. Let's bring them up \nfor a vote.\n  The government cannot function without qualified appointees in place. \nLet's stop the delays and bring these nominees up for a vote so they \ncan get on with the business of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to call on the Senate to do \nsomething the rest of the American people are doing, our job. Most of \nPresident Obama's nominees to the executive branch and our Federal \ncourts are not even remotely controversial. The country needs them on \nthe job, and their responsibilities, their careers, and the stress on \ntheir families should not be caused by holds and other pointless \ndelays.\n  We face serious challenges as a nation. Unemployment and \nunderemployment rates are unacceptably high. Our courts have \nunprecedented backlogs. We are fighting two wars and have the \npersistent threat of terror that casts a shadow over our security.\n  We need a functioning Federal Government. The American people expect \nthis. Yet some in this body are too tied up in ``politics as usual'' to \nget our government working again. Rather than making sure we get the \ngovernment up and running by allowing our votes on key administration \nnominees, the Senate is mired in perpetual stalling, failing to perform \nits constitutional responsibility to advise and consent. Qualified \npeople nominated to hold key positions in the administration are \nlanguishing in the Senate because of procedural abuses. These should \nend.\n  I have introduced a resolution which would help address some of these \nabuses. My resolution would bring holds by one Senator outside the \nshadows, time limit them, and place requirements that, after 2 days, \nholds must be bipartisan to continue.\n  These commonsense improvements ought not be necessary. But in today's \nSenate, unfortunately, they are. I fully support scrutinizing all \npositions requiring confirmation. In fact, that is why my suggested \nresolution actually says, if you have bipartisan support--and there \nmight be a reason to look at it other than just pure politics--I think \nwe should look at it.\n  But useless delay is not getting us anywhere. I am not asking for a \nrubberstamp from anyone. But a desire to assert leverage over the \nadministration or a desire to frustrate the government's efforts to \nwork for the American people is unacceptable for holding up nominees.\n  Too often we have seen nominees held for months only to be confirmed \nby overwhelming margins. Judge Barbara Keenan was recently confirmed to \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by the breathtakingly close vote of \n99 to 0. This was after her nomination was held up for 4 months \nfollowing approval by the Judiciary Committee.\n  There are currently 16 other judicial nominees who, similar to Judge \nKeenan, have cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting \nfloor time. Unfortunately, they are subject to partisan and meritless \ndelays. The result is, our district and appellate courts will continue \nto be backlogged and justice will not be served in communities all \nacross the United States of America.\n  Judicial nominations have a sad history of partisanship in recent \nyears. The delays and games that have replaced the Senate's role to \nadvise and consent have now bled into all executive branch nominations \nat unprecedented levels.\n  Just last month, the media reported 80 nominees were being held up by \none Senator. These holds included the Under Secretary for Military \nReadiness and top officials at the Departments of State and Homeland \nSecurity. These holds were unrelated to the actual nominee and solely \nconcerned parochial and political interests. Our national security \nshould never be subjugated to one Senator's politics.\n  We also had the President's nomination to the Transportation Security \nAdministration tied up and ultimately withdrawn because of partisan \nbickering unrelated to his responsibilities to secure our airports. \nThis is unacceptable. Does it no longer matter whether there is someone \nat the helm of the agencies responsible for securing our airports?\n  How is this acceptable behavior in the Senate? It would not be \nacceptable\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nbehavior around my kitchen table. If it is not acceptable there, it \nshould not be acceptable here. There are too many examples of \nqualified, noncontroversial nominees, such as Martha Johnson, the GSA \nAdministrator with impeccable qualifications whose nomination was held \nfor 9 months. Yet she was confirmed by a 96-to-0 vote once the hold on \nher nomination was removed.\n  These nominations are being blocked even though they have broad \nbipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove their holds on noncontroversial \nadministration nominees and allow confirmation votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Colorado.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many Senators are speaking on the Senate \nfloor today about the Republican delays and obstruction of President \nObama's nominations to fill critical posts throughout the executive \nbranch.\n  Republicans have engaged in a partisan effort to block scores of \nnominations, preventing up-or-down votes in the Senate. This Republican \neffort has prevented the Senate from considering well-qualified public \nservants like Professor Chris Schroeder, who was first nominated by \nPresident Obama on June 4, 2009. He appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last June, and was reported favorably in July by \nvoice vote, with no dissent. His nomination then languished on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar for nearly 5 months. Not a single \nRepublican explained the reason for the delay.\n  Republican Senators objected to carrying over Professor Schroeder's \nnomination into the new session. It was returned to the President with \nno action. President Obama nominated Professor Schroeder again this \nyear, and again his nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwith Republican support. An esteemed scholar and public servant who has \nserved with distinction on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand in the Justice Department, Professor Schroeder has support across \nthe political spectrum.\n  We treated President Bush's nominations to run the Office of Legal \nPolicy much more fairly than Republicans are treating President \nObama's, confirming all four nominees to lead that office quickly. We \nconfirmed President Bush's first nominee to that post by a vote of 96 \nto 1 just 1 month after he was nominated, and only a week after his \nnomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee. In contrast \nProfessor Schroeder's nomination has been pending since last June. It \nis time for an up-or-down vote on his nomination.\n  In addition to the many executive branch nominees currently stalled \non the Senate calendar, there are 18 judicial nominees that have been \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee--most of them \nunanimously--who await Senate consideration. That is more nominees than \nthe total of President Obama's circuit and district court nominees--\n17--that have been confirmed since he took office. This sorry state of \naffairs is the result of a Republican strategy to stall, obstruct, and \ndelay that has existed throughout President Obama's time in office. The \ncasualties of this effort are the American people who seek justice in \nour increasingly overburdened Federal courts.\n  By this date during President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 41 Federal circuit and district court nominations. That was a \ntumultuous period in which Senate Democrats worked hard to make \nprogress with a staunchly partisan Republican President. It included \nthe period of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks upon the Senate. \nIn contrast, the Senate has confirmed just 17 Federal and circuit court \nnominees--just 17--during President Obama's first term.\n  We are currently on pace to confirm fewer than 30 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees during this Congress, which would be easily the \nlowest in memory. That number stands in sad contrast to the 100 judges \nwe confirmed when I chaired the Judiciary Committee for 17 months \nduring President Bush's first term. When we were reviewing the judicial \nnominees of a President of the other party, and one who consulted \nacross the aisle far less than President Obama has, we confirmed 100 \njudges in just 17 months. President Obama is in his 14th month and \nSenate Republicans have allowed only 17 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges to be confirmed. We are 24 behind the pace we set in 2001 \nand 2002.\n  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 35 of President \nObama's Federal circuit and district court nominees to the Senate for \nfinal consideration and confirmation. Eighteen of those nominees are \nstill awaiting a vote by the Senate. The Senate can more than double \nthe total number of judicial nominations it has confirmed by \nconsidering the other judicial nominees already before the Senate \nawaiting final action. We should do that now, without more delay, \nwithout additional obstruction. There are another five judicial \nnominations set to be reported by the Judiciary Committee this week. \nThey will bring the total awaiting final action by the Senate to 23. \nConfirming them without unnecessary delay would put us back on track.\n  While Republican Senators stall, judicial vacancies continue to \nskyrocket. Vacancies have already grown to more than 100, undoing years \nof our hard work repairing the damage done by Republican pocket \nfilibusters of President Clinton's judicial nominees. When I chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee during President Bush's last year in office, we \nreduced judicial vacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a \npresidential election year.When President Bush left office, we had \nreduced vacancies in 9 of the 13 Federal circuits. As matters stand \ntoday, judicial vacancies have spiked and are being left unfilled. We \nstarted 2010 with the highest number of vacancies on article III courts \nsince 1994, when the vacancies created by the last comprehensive \njudgeship bill were still being filled.\n  More than 30 of the vacancies on our Federal courts today are \nclassified as ``judicial emergencies.'' This is another reversal of our \nhard work during the Bush administration when we reduced judicial \nemergencies by more than half. Those vacancies have now increased \ndramatically, encumbering judges across the country with overloaded \ndockets and preventing ordinary Americans from seeking justice in our \noverburdened Federal courts. This is wrong. We owe it to the American \npeople to do better.\n  President Obama deserves praise for working closely with home State \nSenators, whether Democratic or Republican, to identify and select \nwell-qualified nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal bench. Yet \nSenate Republicans delay and obstruct even nominees chosen after \nconsultation with Republican home State Senators. President Obama has \nworked closely with home State Republican Senators, but Senate \nRepublicans have still chosen to treat his nominees badly. Last year, \nPresident Obama sent 33 Federal circuit and district court nominations \nto the Senate, but the Senate confirmed only 12 of them, the fewest \njudicial nominees confirmed in the first year of a Presidency in more \nthan 50 years.\n  Senate Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit, despite support \nfor his nomination from the senior Republican in the Senate, Dick Lugar \nof Indiana. Republicans delayed for months Senate consideration of \nJudge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit despite the \nendorsement of both her Republican home State Senators. When \nRepublicans finally agreed to consider her nomination on January 20, \nshe was confirmed unanimously. Whether Jeffrey Viken or Roberto Lange \nof South Dakota, who were supported by Senator Thune, or Charlene \nEdwards Honeywell of Florida, who was supported by Senators Martinez \nand LeMieux, virtually all of President Obama's nominees have been \ndenied prompt Senate action by Republican objections.\n  I noted when the Senate considered the nominations of Judge Christina \nReiss of Vermont and Mr. Abdul Kallon of Alabama relatively promptly \nthat they should serve as the model for Senate action. Sadly, they are \nthe exception rather than the model. They show what the Senate could \ndo, but does not. Time and again, noncontroversial nominees are \ndelayed. When the Senate does finally consider them, they are confirmed \noverwhelmingly.\n  In December, I made several statements in this Chamber about the need \nfor progress on the nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\nalso spoke repeatedly to Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle and \nmade the following proposal: Agree to immediate votes on those judicial \nnominees that are reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee without \ndissent, and agree to time agreements to debate and vote on the others. \nI have recently reiterated my proposal and urged Senate Republicans to \nreconsider their strategy of obstruction. There is no justification for \nthese nominations to be dragged out week after week, month after month.\n  The last time the Senate considered judicial nominations was weeks \nago. Indeed, on March 2, the Republican filibuster and obstruction of \nthe nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan of Virginia to be a Fourth \nCircuit Judge had to be ended by invoking cloture. Senate Republicans \nwould not agree to debate and vote on her nomination and the majority \nleader was required to proceed through a time consuming procedure to \nend the obstruction. The votes to end debate and on her confirmation \nwere both 99 to 0. That nomination had been reported in October. So \nafter more than 4 months of stalling, there was no justification, \nexplanation or basis for the delay. That is wrong. That was the 17th \nfilibuster of President Obama's nominations.\n  The 18 judicial nominees awaiting Senate consideration are: Jane \nStranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth Circuit; Judge Thomas \nVanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third Circuit; Judge Denny \nChin of New York, nominated to the Second Circuit; Justice Rogeriee \nThompson of Rhode Island, nominated to the First Circuit; Judge James \nWynn of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Albert \nDiaz of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth Circuit; Judge Edward \nChen, nominated to the Northern District of California; Justice Louis \nButler, nominated to the Western District of Wisconsin; Nancy \nFreudenthal, nominated to the District of Wyoming; Denzil Marshall, \nnominated to the Eastern District of Arkansas; Benita Pearson, \nnominated to the Northern District of Ohio; Timothy Black, nominated to \nthe Southern District of Ohio; Gloria M. Navarro, nominated to the \nDistrict of Nevada; Audrey G. Fleissig, nominated to the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri; Lucy H. Koh, nominated to the Northern District \nof California; Jon E. DeGuilio, nominated to the Northern District of \nIndiana; Tanya Walton Pratt, nominated to the Southern District of \nIndiana; and Jane Magnus-Stinson, nominated to the Southern District of \nIndiana. Twelve of the 18 were reported from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without opposition; one had a single negative vote. The \nstalling and obstruction should end and these nominations should be \nconsidered by the Senate and voted upon without further delay. When \nthey are, they, too, will be confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  I also want to highlight my concern about the new standard the \nRepublican minority is applying to many of President Obama's district \ncourt nominees. Democrats never used this standard with President \nBush's nominees, whether we were in the majority or the minority. In 8 \nyears, the Judiciary Committee reported only a single Bush district \ncourt nomination by a party-line vote. That was the controversial \nnomination of Leon Holmes, who was opposed not because of some litmus \ntest, but because of his strident, intemperate, and insensitive public \nstatements over the years. During President Obama's short time in \noffice, not one, not two, but three district court nominees have been \nreported on a party-line vote as Senate Republicans look for any reason \nto oppose every nomination. I hope this new standard does not become \nthe rule for Senate Republicans.\n  Of the 17 Federal circuit and district court judges confirmed, 14 \nhave been confirmed unanimously. That is right. The delay and \nobstruction is so baseless that when votes are finally taken, they are \noverwhelmingly in favor and most often unanimous. There have been only \na handful of votes cast against just three of President Obama's \nnominees to the Federal circuit and district courts. One of those, \nJudge Gerry Lynch of the Second Circuit, garnered only three negative \nvotes, and 94 votes in favor. Judge Andre Davis of Maryland was stalled \nfor months and then confirmed with 72 votes in favor. Judge David \nHamilton was filibustered in a failed effort to prevent an up or down \nvote.\n  So why all the obstruction and delay? It is part of a partisan \npattern. Even when they cannot say ``no,'' Republicans nonetheless \ndemand that the Senate go slow. The practice is continuing. There have \nalready been 17 filibusters of President Obama's nominees. That is the \nsame number of Federal circuit and district nominees the Senate has \nconfirmed during the entirety of the Obama administration. And that \ncomparison does not include the many other nominees who were delayed or \nwho are being denied up-or-down votes by Senate Republicans refusing to \nagree to time agreements to consider even noncontroversial nominees.\n  I urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their destructive strategy \nand to work with us to provide final consideration without further \ndelay to the 18 judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar \nawaiting final action. We can make real progress if they will join with \nus and we work together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my colleague from Colorado. I ask unanimous \nconsent that 7 minutes of morning business be added to each side and at \nthe end of that time, the Senate stand in recess as provided for under \nthe previous order. I thank my colleagues on the other side for their \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor today \nto discuss what none of us are the least bit happy to see happening in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  We were sent here by the people of our States to get work done. This \nmeans passing legislation and overseeing the work of Federal agencies.\n  It is difficult, if not impossible, for Federal agencies to do the \nwork Congress and the American people want them to do if they spend \nmonths--in some cases, years--leaderless. It is impossible for them to \ndo their work if they can hope that a momentary peace will break out in \nthe Senate to allow for confirmation of the presidential designee for \ntheir respective agency.\n  As Senators, we are endowed with a constitutional responsibility to \nlend our advice and consent to the men and women a President nominates \nto run agencies and parts of agencies.\n  Career civil servants can do a lot. We would be lost without them. \nBut they do not have the authority, or the accountability to Congress \nand the American people to accomplish what a President selects them to \ndo.\n  Yet many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would deny \nPresident Obama any of his nominees. I believe a President--the current \nPresident or any future President with whom I am lucky enough to \nserve--is due a great deal of deference in his or her selections for \nSenate-confirmable positions.\n  For our Republican colleagues, it would seem there is a belief that \nthe Federal Government should just not function, certainly any \ngovernment led by President Obama.\n  We have seen the slow-walking, the indefinite--and indefensible--\nholds on nominations for crucial national security positions. Only when \nArmed Services Chairman Levin took the unusual step of embarrassing \ncolleagues who were placing a hold for their home State politics did a \nnumber of important nominees get reported out of our committee.\n  There is still a hold by one of our Republican colleagues--\nunbelievable as it may seem--on the promotion of an Army general while \nour Nation is involved in two wars.\n  But the problem and the cynicism of Republican obstructionism is seen \nnowhere as obviously as in the judiciary. There are currently 103 \nFederal judge vacancies.\n  Several nominees reported out of the Judiciary Committee have been \ndenied votes in the Senate by Republican ostructionism for almost 200 \ndays. In some cases the judicial seat to be filled has been vacant for \nyears.\n  It is clear that--even if they are in denial about who was elected in \n2008--\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nour Republican colleagues have their sights set on 2012 and beyond, \nwhen they hope to have a huge number of Federal court vacancies to be \nfilled by a President more to their liking.\n  Obstruction of nominees hurts the functioning of the government our \ncolleagues have strived to be part of. If they continue to block \nqualified nominees, our Republican colleagues only further demonstrate \ntheir unwillingness to perform the duties for which they were elected \nand prove their disdain for the constitutional responsibilities with \nwhich they have been entrusted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Warner for organizing \nthis presentation to point out the abuses the minority has used in \nblocking the responsibility of the Senate to confirm appointments made \nby the President. I believe in the right of the minority. At times, it \nneeds to be exercised. But it has been abused. The American people need \nto know that because it is affecting their rights and the ability of \nagencies and the courts to protect the rights of Americans.\n  Let me cite one number: 60 individuals the President has nominated \nfor important offices have been blocked in their confirmation votes on \nthe Senate floor even though their nominations were approved by the \ncommittees either by voice vote or unanimous vote or by significant \nsupermajorities. These are just being delayed, when we now know the \nfinal outcome will be approval. As a result, Americans are being denied \njudges on the courts and administrators who can help enforce their \nrights.\n  We have already heard the circumstances about our courts, how we have \nhad to take to a cloture vote, which means floor time, for the \nnomination of Judge Keenan, who received 99 votes and no one in \nopposition. We have two vacancies on the Fourth Circuit right now. \nThese appointments have been approved overwhelmingly by the Judiciary \nCommittee--Albert Diaz and James Wynn--by votes of 19 to 0 and 18 to 1. \nThey have the support of Senators Burr and Hagan. Yet they have still \nnot been brought to the floor for a vote. That represents a 20-percent \nvacancy on the Fourth Circuit, denying the people of my region their \nfull representation on the appellate court.\n  We are very proud of legislation we have passed to help the \ndisabled--the ADA law--to guarantee gender pay equity with the Lilly \nLedbetter law, and genetic discrimination prohibition legislation. But \nit takes the EEOC to enforce those rules. President Obama has submitted \nfour nominees for the EEOC. They have been approved by the committee by \nvoice votes, which means they are not controversial. Yet we cannot \nbring those nominations to the floor for quick action because \nRepublicans are abusing their rights to hold up action on the floor of \nthe Senate to carry out our constitutional responsibilities to act on \nthe President's nominations.\n  This is denying the people of America the protections they are \nentitled to by the courts and by agencies. It is wrong. It is time for \nthis practice to end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1575-S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HIRE ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are going to be taking up the so-called \nHIRE Act starting tomorrow. I wish to address some of the problems with \nit since the procedure under which we have considered this bill does \nnot allow any amendments. As a result, we have no opportunity to fix \nproblems that are inherent with the bill and will force me to vote \nagainst it.\n  The first provision that should be highlighted is the provision \ncalled the Build America Bonds. This was created first in the 2009 \nstimulus bill. It offers a direct subsidy from the Federal Government \nto States and other governmental entities to cover their cost of \nfinancing for certain kinds of projects.\n  The House-passed bill expands this subsidy by allowing four current \ntax-preferred bonds to qualify for the direct subsidy under this \nprogram and increases the generosity of that subsidy to cover all of \nthe borrowing costs for education projects. This will mean an expansion \nof the already substantial support the Federal Government offers for \nState and local governments, support for which we taxpayers are then \nresponsible. The Federal Government gave $44 billion in extraordinary \nstimulus State aid last year and regularly spends $26 billion annually \nin sub-Federal Government subsidies through tax-exempt bond financing. \nThis is a significant Federal expenditure for which taxpayers will be \nresponsible.\n  Here is the key problem, in addition to the additional exposure of \ntaxpayers: Because interest rates reflect risks, States with poor \ncredit ratings that therefore pay higher interest rates would actually \nbe rewarded under this legislation due to the structure of these bonds. \nFor example, a State that issues $1 billion worth of debt paying a 5-\npercent interest rate would receive a bigger direct payment from the \nFederal Government than a State issuing $1 billion worth of debt paying \na 4-percent interest rate. Thus, States with lower credit ratings could \nreceive larger subsidies, which, of course, encourages greater risk-\ntaking and creates an incentive for States to issue even more debt than \nthey would have without the subsidy.\n  The so-called jobs bill would further reward States with poor credit. \nThe Senate version of the bill expands the Build America Bonds program \nby giving insurers of certain tax credit bonds for school construction \nand alternative energy projects the option of receiving direct payment \nof up to 65 percent of the interest cost. The House bill would, in \ncertain cases, reimburse up to 100 percent of a project's interest \ncosts.\n  The original Build America Bonds program encouraged States to take \ngreater risks. The bill we will consider tomorrow would make the \nproblem even worse. One of the lessons from the financial crisis is \nthat people should not borrow more than they can afford. Unfortunately, \nit appears many of us have not taken this lesson to heart.\n  There is a provision relating to highway extension. Rather than being \na straight extension of the current highway authorization, this bill \nrepresents a significant expansion of the Federal Government's funding \nfor highway projects. The highway piece first cancels rescissions that \nwere scheduled under the last highway reauthorization. It then \npermanently increases the authorization levels for highway spending and \npermanently authorizes interest payments from the general fund to the \nhighway trust fund and authorizes a one-time transfer of $19.5 billion \nfrom the general fund to the highway trust fund.\n  Although not all of these costs will show up as increasing the \ndeficit because of the unique CBO scoring conventions, all told, the \nhighway extension under this bill will add $46.5 billion to the debt \nover the next 10 years and will authorize $142.5 billion in additional \nspending over the next 10 years.\n  You hear the President talking about not adding to the deficit. All \nof our colleagues wring their hands and say: We have to somehow control \nFederal spending. Yet in this legislation we take up tomorrow we add \n$46.5 billion to the debt over the next 10 years and then authorize an \nadditional $142.5 billion of spending over the next 10 years. When will \nit stop?\n  There is a provision of the bill that has some merit to it. It is \ncalled the payroll tax holiday, although I think the way it has been \nconstructed is not something we should do. This is the most expensive \npiece of the bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has told us \nthat it expects a provision similar to this to create five to nine jobs \nfor each million dollars in budgetary cost in 2010. Since this \nprovision would cost approximately $13 billion by using the CBO model, \none would estimate that the provision would create between 65,000 and \n117,000 jobs this year at a cost of $110,000 to $200,000 per job. This \nsounds a lot like the stimulus bill to me, a very inefficient way to \ncreate jobs, if, in fact, they actually get created.\n  The proposed payroll tax holiday comes on the heels of the Senate-\npassed health care bill which actually increases the Medicare payroll \ntax from 2.9 percent to 3.8 percent. This actually would relieve \nemployers of an\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nelement of the payroll tax. So which is it? Do we agree that payroll \ntaxes that are increased are unhelpful to job creation?\n  According to Timothy Bartik of the Economic Policy Institute:\n\n       The employer tax credit in the Senate jobs bill is likely \n     to create few jobs and at an excessively high cost.\n\n  As I have said, up to $200,000 per job.\n  He explains it this way:\n\n       Awarding credits for hires can be very expensive. Over a \n     one-year period, the number of hires, as a percentage of \n     total private employment, is over 40 percent even during a \n     recession. To pay for hires that would have occurred anyway \n     will be expensive and won't necessarily increase total \n     private sector employment. The Schumer-Hatch design tries to \n     avoid some of these large costs in several ways. First, \n     credits are limited to hiring the unemployed, apply only to \n     the rest of 2010, and are only worth 6.2 percent of the new \n     hire's payroll costs. The retention bonus is of modest size \n     and delayed. While these limits control costs, they also \n     hamper the credit's benefits.\n       Limiting the credit to hiring someone unemployed at least \n     60 days makes the credit less attractive to employers.\n       Not only does the credit become more complicated to claim \n     (which reduces its effectiveness), but it restricts the \n     employer's hiring to a more limited pool of workers.\n\n  Bartik also explains that past experiences--for example, with the \ntargeted jobs tax credit, the work opportunities tax credit, and the \nwelfare-to-work tax credit--show that tax credits to encourage hiring \ndisadvantaged workers usually generate little employer interest and \nhave a negligible effect upon employer behavior. He says:\n\n       Employers are happy to claim such credits, if they happen \n     to meet the credit's rules, but they are reluctant to change \n     their behavior in response to such targeted tax credits.\n\n  So even the one provision of the bill that actually has some alleged \nrelationship to job creation probably would not and, to the extent it \ndoes, would cost an extraordinary amount of money per job actually \ncreated.\n  Let me turn to one of the ways in which these expenses are allegedly \noffset: delaying the application of the so-called worldwide interest \nallocation. This is a very bad idea. This delays implementing a \ncorporate tax reform we passed in 2004 in order to help American \nbusinesses properly account for their overseas income and, frankly, be \nmore competitive with those abroad.\n  The worldwide interest allocation rules were originally improved as \npart of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as I said, and were \nscheduled to take effect in 2009. However, the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008 delayed the effectiveness of these rules by 2 \nyears to 2011. The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act \nof 2009 that extended the first-time home buyer tax credit further \ndelayed the effectiveness of these rules to 2018.\n  The so-called jobs bill would delay this provision through the end of \nthe existing budget window to 2021. Repeated delays have the same \neffect as repeal: an increase in the effective corporate tax rate. As I \nsaid, that does nothing to help our American businesses in their desire \nto compete overseas.\n  So these are just some of the reasons why I am not going to be able \nto support the HIRE Act, and I would urge my colleagues, since we are \nnot going to have an opportunity to amend it, to oppose it as well.\n  Might I ask, Mr. President, how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1576-S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to address now the health care \nlegislation we passed in the Senate and that is pending over in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  There is a news report that Democrats are going to use the strangest \nof all procedural tactics to try to pass the Senate health care bill \nover in the House of Representatives, and this is against a backdrop of \na lot of strange things--the use of the reconciliation process, all the \nbackroom deals that result in the various benefits for various Senators \nand Representatives--we have heard so much about.\n  It almost seems Democratic leaders view the views of their \nconstituents as an obstacle to be overcome, and every time the polls \nshow even more opposition to the legislation, they decide to try even \nmore clever ways of getting around their constituents' views--wheeling \nand dealing, backdoor legislation--but nothing quite as brazen, I guess \nI would say, as the process we now see developing. This is a process I \nbecame familiar with as a Member of the Senate--not when I was in the \nHouse of Representatives because I do not believe it was ever used \nthen, although it might have been and I was not aware of it. But it is \na process by which House of Representatives Members can actually say \nthey have passed a piece of legislation without ever voting on it.\n  You might say: That does not quite comport with what I learned in \neighth grade civics class, and you would be right. We all know the only \nway a President can sign a bill is if identical versions of legislation \npass both the House and the Senate.\n  Well, the House does not want to have to vote on the Senate health \ncare bill because, as the Speaker of the House said: ``Nobody wants to \nvote for the Senate bill.'' So now what they have done is concoct a way \nyou can actually pass the bill without ever voting for it, and it is by \nincluding the substantive Senate-passed bill into the rule that as a \nprocedural matter the House votes on to consider each measure. So as a \nrule to consider the reconciliation bill is brought to the House floor, \nit would contain a provision that would deem the Senate-passed bill \npassed, even though the House Members would never vote on it.\n  That is wrong. It is probably unconstitutional. Any House Member who \nbelieves he or she can go home and say to their constituents: Well, I \nnever voted for the Senate-passed bill is, frankly, not going to get \naway with it because, by voting for the rule, they will have voted for \nthe Senate-passed bill.\n  It seems to me this is the time for principled Members of the House \nof Representatives to stand and say: Enough. I may even somewhat like \nwhat we are trying to do with this health care legislation, but \nsomebody has to stand for principle, and principle means, at a minimum, \nvoting for legislation that you send to the President for his \nsignature--not standing behind a rule which deems legislation to have \nbeen passed, even though it was never separately voted on.\n  It seems to me, first of all, we should make it crystal clear we will \nmake this famous to the American people, if in fact they decide to use \nthis process--something that has never been used for a bill such as \nthis before. This so-called deeming rule will become part of the \nlexicon of American political discourse, and people will come to know \nit, just like they did the House banking scandal and certain other \nthings here in Washington, to represent a time period and a group of \npeople who were willing to violate all rules of sensibility, of \nmorality, as well as legality in order to try to accomplish ends that \ncould not be accomplished in other ways.\n  Nobody who votes for this rule and then later claims they did not \nhave anything to do with passing this Senate bill is going to be able \nto get away with that. The American people will understand it. Frankly, \nwhether they are sympathetic to the underlying health care legislation, \nthey are not going to be sympathetic to Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who decide to do this kind of end run, this sort of \nscheme to deem a bill passed that has never been separately voted on in \nthat body.\n  I hope the health care legislation we have now debated for a year can \nstand or fall on its merits. The American people have made it clear \nthey do not want this legislation. Twenty-five percent do, but seventy-\nthree percent have said either stop altogether or stop and start over. \nThat is what we should be doing. Because of this wave of opposition by \nour constituents, our colleagues in the House should not try to get \naround that by using a procedure that is totally inappropriate to the \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I make a parliamentary inquiry: Is \nthere more time remaining on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-one minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  What I would like to do, until Senator Grassley arrives--I first ask\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Gov. \nJanice K. Brewer of Arizona, dated March 10, 2010, to President Barack \nObama.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Executive Office,\n\n\n                                             State of Arizona,\n\n                                      Phoenix, AZ, March 10, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We share common ground in that we have \n     both been called to lead during some of the most difficult \n     times our nation has faced. Like you, I hear painful stories \n     on a regular basis from people who are struggling to survive.\n       Yet in their time of need, our state government is on the \n     brink of insolvency.\n       During this downturn, Arizona has lost the largest \n     percentage of jobs in the United States. The flagging economy \n     has resulted in a loss of state revenues in excess of 30%, \n     placing tremendous pressure on our state budget. Today, \n     Arizona faces one of the largest deficits of any state.\n       There is no doubt that this fiscal calamity has been \n     compounded by the enormous spending increases we are facing \n     as a result of our Medicaid program, which has seen \n     population growth of almost 20% in the past 12 months.\n       It is for that reason I write to you today.\n       You have repeated on several occasions that the debate on \n     health care reform has consumed the past year and you most \n     recently called on Congress to vote the measure ``up or \n     down''. As the Governor of a state that is bleeding red ink, \n     I am imploring our Congressional delegation to vote against \n     your proposal to expand government health care and to help \n     vote it down.\n       The reason for my position is simple: we cannot afford it. \n     And based on our state's own experience with government \n     health care expansion, we doubt the rest of America can, \n     either.\n       Arizona is one of a few states that have pursued health \n     care policies similar to those that you are proposing for the \n     nation. In 2000, Arizonans voted to provide health care \n     coverage up to 100% of the federal poverty limit for all \n     residents, including childless adults, through the expansion \n     of the state's Medicaid program.\n       While the expansion resulted in a modest reduction in the \n     state's uninsured rate, the voters did not earmark adequate \n     funding for the expansion and, as a result, our expenditures \n     have become unsustainable, exploding from $3.0 billion to \n     $9.5 billion during the past decade. Based on our state's own \n     experience with underfunded government health care programs, \n     Arizona can serve as a case in point for what will happen \n     across our nation if your proposal is enacted.\n       Even with generous and enhanced federal matches, as well as \n     recognition as one of the country's best Medicaid models, the \n     program today demands nearly one in five state dollars. As a \n     result, we find ourselves even more limited in our ability to \n     invest in other critical state services, such as education \n     and public safety, not to mention job creation and other \n     economic development activities.\n       Unfortunately, your proposal to further expand government \n     health care does not fix the problem we face in Arizona. In \n     fact, it makes our situation much worse, exacerbating our \n     state's fiscal woes by billions of dollars. Following are \n     some of Arizona's concerns:\n       Makes Arizonans pay twice to fund other states' \n     expansions--Your proposal continues the inequities \n     established in the Senate bill with regard to early expansion \n     states. While there is some mention of additional funding for \n     states that have already expanded coverage, it is clear it \n     will not fully cover the costs we will experience as a result \n     of the mandated expansion. Therefore, Arizona taxpayers will \n     have the misfortune to pay twice: once for our program and \n     then once more for the higher match for other states.\n       Makes states responsible for financing national health \n     care--In addition, your proposal, as well as the Senate bill \n     it is based on, effectively terminates the partnership that \n     has existed with the states since the inception of Medicaid. \n     For 28 years, Arizona and the federal government have been \n     partners in administering the Medicaid program. States have \n     been provided with important flexibility to develop and \n     create programs that work for their citizens. However, under \n     your proposal, more power is centralized in Washington, DC, \n     and the states become just another financing mechanism. Not \n     only will states be forced to pay for this massive new \n     entitlement program our ability to control the costs of our \n     existing program will be limited. These policies are simply \n     not sustainable, and will result in a greater burden on state \n     budgets and state taxpayers.\n       Creates a massive new entitlement program our country \n     cannot afford--Your proposal creates a vast new entitlement \n     program that our country does not have the resources to \n     support. Our nation faces trillion dollar deficits far into \n     our future. Medicare has an unfunded liability of $38 \n     trillion, and physicians are destined to realize a 21 percent \n     decrease in Medicare reimbursement until Congress finally \n     accounts for the $371 billion in additional costs associated \n     with their rates.\n       Mr. President, I am concerned that Washington does not \n     recognize the fiscal realities states are facing, and likely \n     will continue to face, for several years to come. Our country \n     is living beyond its means and the federal government is \n     leading the way by its example.\n       As Governor, it has been a painful process to move the \n     State towards fiscal sanity. I have even proposed a temporary \n     revenue increase, something I have never done in my 28 years \n     of public service, to help mitigate impacts to education, \n     public safety, and health services for our most extremely \n     vulnerable citizens. Though Arizona's budget deficit is not \n     of my creation, I am firm in my determination and \n     responsibility to resolve it. I believe we have a moral \n     imperative as leaders to not bankrupt and diminish the \n     capacity of future generations.\n       I understand that there are tremendous pressures to show \n     some progress on health care given the time and effort that \n     has been spent to date on this important issue. Indeed, \n     improving access to quality health care is a laudable goal. \n     However, the approach being taken by your administration has \n     been proven by states like Arizona to be unsustainable in the \n     long run.\n       Mr. President, I humbly request that you heed Arizona's \n     experience and reconsider your proposed policies that will \n     further strain already overburdened state budgets.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and for your tireless \n     efforts on behalf of our citizens.\n       Yours in service to our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Janice K. Brewer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me briefly describe the reason for this request.\n  Arizona is suffering, as are other States, from the economic \ndownturn. We have an unemployment rate now that has more than doubled. \nIn fact, it has gone from 3.6 percent in June of 2007 to 9.2 percent \nthis month. Our State faces a $1.4 billion shortfall in the current \nfiscal year and a $3.2 billion shortfall for the next fiscal year, \ndespite the fact that the Governor and the State legislature have \nimposed significant spending reductions.\n  State revenues are down by 34 percent. Notwithstanding this, over \n200,000 Arizonans have enrolled in the State's Medicaid Program, known \nas AHCCCS--which is our Arizona health Care Cost Containment System--\njust since the beginning of 2009. That is nearly 20,000 new enrollees \nevery month. The last thing, given these kinds of numbers, Washington \nshould be doing is making the States' economic or fiscal problems even \nworse. Yet that is exactly what Governor Brewer says the Senate health \ncare bill would do because it would require every State to expand its \nMedicaid Program.\n  The Federal Government would foot the bill for 3 years. Then the \nStates would have to help finance the expansion in 2017 and in \nsubsequent years. She estimates the bill would increase the cost in \nArizona by nearly $4 billion over the next 10 years. Making matters \nworse, the early expansion States--States such as Arizona that have \nalready expanded Medicaid to cover the uninsured, as I noted--will \nactually get fewer Federal dollars than the States that have not yet \nexpanded their Medicaid Programs, in effect punishing those who have \ntried to do the right things--the exact things Democrats have wanted in \nthe health care bill.\n  As she observed in her letter:\n\n       Arizona taxpayers will have the misfortune to pay twice: \n     once for [Arizona's] program and then once more for the \n     higher match for other states.\n\n  Additionally, States currently retain important flexibility in \nadministering their Medicaid Programs so they are not caught off-guard \nas the economy changes. But as Governor Brewer notes, that flexibility \nwould be eliminated under the Senate bill. She says:\n\n       Under your proposal, more power is centralized in \n     Washington, DC, and the states just become another financing \n     mechanism. Not only will states be forced to pay for this \n     massive new entitlement program, but our ability to control \n     the costs of our existing program will be limited. These \n     policies are simply not sustainable, and will result in a \n     greater burden on state budgets and state taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, since I put the letter in the Record, I will not \nreflect further on it but note the fact that this is yet one more \nreason for Members to oppose the Senate-passed bill in the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1577-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1577-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HIRE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of the provisions the Democratic \nleadership decided to put in this HIRE bill is the expansion of Build \nAmerica Bonds. Build America Bonds is a very rich spending program; \nhowever, it is\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\ndisguised as a tax cut. One Democratic Senator was asked why the Build \nAmerica Bonds program is viewed differently than appropriations, and \nshe replied: It has a good name.\n  Ironically, the Finance Committee is returning to its roots of doing \nappropriations bills. When our committee was established in 1816, the \nFinance Committee handled the major appropriations bills that came \nbefore Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a portion of the document \noutlining the history of the Finance Committee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This vote of no confidence proved a turning point in \n     jurisdiction over tariff bills. . . . Beginning in 1834, all \n     tariff bills were referred initially to the Finance \n     Committee. The important Tariff Act of 1842 was handle by the \n     Finance Committee, as were a number of minor bills in the \n     decade following the Compromise Tariff of 1833.\n       In 1846, a bill to reduce tariffs was passed by the House \n     and sent to the Senate on July 6. The Senate leaders wished \n     to take the bill up on the Senate floor immediately; a motion \n     to refer it first to the Finance Committee was narrowly \n     defeated 24 to 22. After 6 weeks of floor debate, it was \n     referred to the Finance Committee on July 27 by a 28 to 27 \n     vote, with detailed specific instructions on what to report. \n     The following day the committee asked to be discharged from \n     further consideration of the bill. A motion to refer the bill \n     to a special committee, with similar detailed instructions, \n     was defeated 27 to 27 (with the Vice President opposing the \n     motion), the bill was then passed with the Vice President \n     voting for the bill, thereby breaking a tie vote of 27 to 27.\n       For the next decade, there was no serious challenge to the \n     Finance Committee's jurisdiction over tariff measures. The \n     tariff-reducing Tariff Act of 1857 was handled by the Finance \n     Committee; an attempt to prevent referral of the 1861 Tariff \n     Act to the Finance Committee was defeated, 29 to 27 (though \n     subsequent to Finance Committee action, a select committee \n     was appointed to consider the bill further).\n       Appropriation bills.--Though the Finance Committee was to \n     become the major committee handling appropriations before the \n     Civil War, this role was not established immediately upon the \n     creation of the committee in 1816.\n       In the earliest years of the committee's existence, there \n     were only three major appropriation bills to be considered \n     each year: for the Army, for the Navy, and for the civil \n     functions of Government. In the first session of the 14th \n     Congress, while the Finance Committee was still a select \n     committee, the Army appropriation bill was handled by the \n     Select Committee on Military Affairs; the Navy appropriation \n     bill was handled by the Select Committee on Naval Affairs; \n     and the general Government appropriation bill was referred to \n     a specially created select committee none of whose members \n     served on the select Committee on Finance and an Uniform \n     National Currency).\n       The next year, when the standing Committee on Finance was \n     established it took over the responsibility for the Army and \n     general Government appropriation bills. The Navy \n     appropriation bill continued to be handled by the Committee \n     on Naval Affairs until 1827 (with the exception of the 2 \n     years 1821 and 1822), when the Finance Committee was assigned \n     the bill.\n       One of the appropriation actions in the early years of the \n     Senate Finance Committee related to the Louisiana purchase, \n     which had been made in 1803. Of the $15 million cost of the \n     purchase, $3.75 million was retained by the United States to \n     pay claims of U.S. citizens for damages incurred (mostly at \n     sea at the hands of the French). The remaining $11.25 million \n     was provided in 6-percent bonds payable in four annual \n     installments, from 1818 to 1821. Since Napoleon wanted cash \n     rather than bonds, he sold them to two international bankers \n     for about $10.2 million. The bankers held the bonds until \n     maturity: when they were paid, the Senate Finance Committee \n     had jurisdiction over the appropriation bills. The total cost \n     of the Louisiana purchase to the United States, including \n     interest and American damage claims, was $23.5 million less \n     than 3 cents an acre for the entire territory.\n       New appropriation bills were not always referred to the \n     Finance Committee. An annual bill appropriating funds for \n     Revolutionary War pensions was first referred to the \n     Committee on Pensions: not until 1830 was Finance Committee \n     jurisdiction over appropriations for this purpose firmly \n     established. Appropriations related to Indian treaties were \n     first handled by the Committee on Indian Affairs; transfer of \n     jurisdiction to the Finance Committee took several years, and \n     it was not until 1834 that all Indian appropriation bills \n     began to be referred to the Finance Committee.\n       From this time on, jurisdiction over appropriation bills \n     remained virtually unchanged until the Civil War. The Finance \n     Committee was given basic responsibility for appropriations, \n     with the sole exception of public works appropriation bills \n     (which were referred either to the Committee on Commerce or \n     the Committee on Territories, depending on the location of \n     the projects).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Bloomberg News reported that large Wall Street \ninvestment banks were charging 37 percent higher underwriting fees on \nBuild America Bond deals than on other tax-exempt bond deals. \nTherefore, American taxpayers appear to be funding huge underwriting \nfees for large Wall Street investment banks as part of the Build \nAmerica Bonds.\n  The Wall Street Journal article, dated March 10, 2010, stated, Wall \nStreet investment banks have made over $1 billion in underwriting fees \non Build America Bonds in less than 1 year.\n  The Wall Street Journal article, based on data from Thomson Reuters, \nstated underwriting fees on Build America Bond deals are higher than \nthose for tax-exempt bond deals. That sounds like a great deal for the \nhigh rollers on Wall Street. But how about the taxpayers back on Main \nStreet America who have to pick up this tab?\n  The Democratic leadership has said the Build America Bonds program is \nabout creating jobs. But I wish to know whether it is about lining the \npockets of Wall Street executives.\n  Recently, I asked the CEO of a large Wall Street investment bank a \nnumber of questions about these larger underwriting fees that are \nsubsidized by the American taxpayers. He confirmed that the \nunderwriting fees for Build America Bond deals are larger than those of \ntax-exempt bond deals.\n  The Senate and House have recently passed different versions of the \nbill we are currently debating which includes a provision that expands \nthe Build America Bonds program created in the stimulus bill. One would \nassume it was just a temporary provision and extend that to four types \nof tax credit bonds. I will give those four types. Before I do, I \nremind my colleagues that this is another example that the word \n``temporary'' does not apply to very many things in Washington, DC, \nbecause it does not take long for a temporary program to become a \npermanent program.\n\n  I talked about four types of tax credit bonds. They are the qualified \nschool construction bonds, qualified zone academy bonds, clean \nrenewable energy bonds, and qualified energy conservation bonds.\n  The Build America Bonds program contains an option for the issuer of \nbonds which is a nontaxpaying entity to receive a check from the \nTreasury Department based on a percentage of the interest cost incurred \nby the issuer. Some refer to this option as the direct pay option.\n  The percentage of the interest costs on the four tax credit bonds \nsubsidized by the American taxpayers under the direct pay option in the \nSenate bill is a whopping 45 percent and is increased to 65 percent for \nsmall issuers. ``Small issuers'' are defined as those issuing less than \n$30 million in bonds per year.\n  The House version increased the direct payment subsidy to 100 percent \nfor qualified school construction bonds and qualified zone academy \nbonds, and increased the subsidy to 70 percent for clean renewable \nenergy bonds and the qualified energy conservation bonds.\n  Let me put this in context.\n  The Build America Bonds program created in the stimulus bill contains \na 35-percent direct pay subsidy, and the President has proposed in his \nfiscal year 2011 budget that it be lowered to 28 percent.\n  It was reported in the March 11, 2010, Bond Buyer article that a \nsenior House staffer asserted that no issuers would opt to issue direct \npay bonds under the lower Senate rates of 45 and 65 percent.\n  When I read that assertion, I asked the Finance Committee Republican \nstaff to reconcile that assertion with the scoring of the Build America \nBonds proposal in the Senate-passed bill.\n  The Republican staff of the Finance Committee reviewed the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation's final estimate of the Senate-passed bill and \nfound that the senior House staffer's assertion was directly \ncontradicted by the estimate provided by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, which everybody knows is the nonpartisan official scorekeeper \nfor Congress on any tax matters. In fact, footnote 2 of the estimate of \nthe Senate Build America Bonds provision states that the Joint Tax \nCommittee's estimate of the Senate direct pay bonds option includes an \nincrease in outlays of--let's say $8 billion. This means the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates assumed that a large number of issuers \nwould elect to use\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nthe direct pay option, contrary to that House staffer's assertion.\n  The Bond Buyer--that is a publication--the Bond Buyer also reported \nthat the senior House staffer stated:\n\n       There is nobody that I know who does not view the Build \n     America Bonds program as an enormous success, with the \n     possible exception of one person.\n\n  I assume that staffer was referring to me. There are many Federal \ntaxpayers who do not view the Build America Bonds program as an \nenormous success. To understand why, let's see which States benefit the \nmost from the Build America Bonds.\n  In looking at data from Thomson Reuters on the 10 largest Build \nAmerica Bonds deals, California alone issues 73 percent of those bonds. \nBetween California and New York, those two States alone issue 92 \npercent of the bonds from the 10 largest Build America Bonds deals. \nCalifornia and New York are the biggest winners under the Build America \nBonds, while American taxpayers from the remaining 48 States subsidize \nthese States.\n  As Senator Kyl pointed out in his ``Dear Colleague'' letter on Build \nAmerica Bonds circulated on March 15, the Build America Bonds program \nactually rewards States for having a riskier credit rating by giving \nthem more money. Build America Bonds creates a perverse incentive that \ncauses State and local governments to borrow more than they otherwise \nwould borrow. This is especially true regarding the school tax credit \nbonds.\n  This bill creates incentives where States and local governments \nshould not even care what the interest rate is. The American taxpayers \nare picking up 100 percent of the interest cost. Actually, the cost \nborne by the American taxpayers is, in fact, more than 100 percent. At \nleast with tax credit bonds, the taxpayers include the amount of the \ntax credit in income and the Federal Government collects taxes on that \nincome. The only purchasers of tax credit bonds are those who have tax \nliabilities; otherwise, it makes no sense to buy tax credit bonds. \nHowever, Build America bonds are technically taxable bonds. But most of \nthe investors do not pay tax on these bonds.\n  For example, under our tax rules, if a foreign person or a pension \nfund or a tax-exempt entity buys a Build America Bond, they do not pay \ntax on the interest they receive. Thus, the Federal Government not only \ncuts a check for 100 percent of the bond's interest cost, but it also \nloses most of the revenue it would have collected from the tax credit \nbonds.\n  State and local governments can view this Federal money as what it \nreally is--free money--because they do not have to collect it from \ntheir residents. Therefore, of course, State and local governments turn \nout to be very big fans of the Build America Bonds program. They get \nFederal money that they do not have to pay back. The large Wall Street \ninvestment banks love Build America Bonds. Why? Because they are \ngetting richer off those bonds.\n  However, we all know there is no such thing as a free lunch. \nWashington is an island surrounded by reality. Consequently, everybody \nin this town thinks there are free lunches, and the common sense of the \nrest of the country has difficulty getting inside this island. It is \nour responsibility to point out that in this city, this District--the \nonly real industry is government--you cannot have everybody in the \nwagon. In this town, everybody is in the wagon. Everybody outside the \nDistrict is pulling the wagon. That cannot go on very long.\n  There is no such thing as a free lunch. Federal taxpayers are footing \nthe bill for this big spending program, which only gets bigger every \ntime Congress touches it. This legislation before us is just an \nexample. As this program that started out as a little program in the \nstimulus bill--and presumably the word ``stimulus'' means temporary, \ndoesn't it? But this is not turning out to be temporary and it is not \nturning out to be small because it has just been enhanced greatly in \nthe other body. The American taxpayers are the ones we ought to be \nlooking out for, and a temporary program ought to be temporary and a \nstimulus program ought to be stimulus and nothing else. And here we are \nexpanding it.\n  The American taxpayers are the ones who, in the words of the senior \nHouse staffer, do ``not view the Build America Bonds program as an \nenormous success.''\n  I urge my colleagues to look beyond the fancy, well-funded lobbying \ncampaign for this rich subsidy. Take a look at who wins. The winners \nare big Wall Street banks. Maybe a small number of governments will \nissue bonds they otherwise would not. Main Street is not helped very \nmuch by this program. The only certainty is that the Federal taxpayers \nare on the hook for the interest costs.\n  With record budget deficits under this Congress and administration, \nwe cannot casually look away as new, open-ended subsidies are proposed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Department of \nEnergy submitted a motion to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nwithdraw its license application to construct a spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. What was the \nlatest rationale for this? Simply because we need it too much.\n  That might seem like creative interpretation on my part, but just \nlast week, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu noted that due to the revival \nof the nuclear industry, Yucca Mountain's repository would hit its \nstatutory capacity limit in the next several decades and would not meet \nfuture industry needs. Instead of moving forward with a permanent \nrepository that billions of dollars have already been spent on and \nsimply expanding the arbitrary limit the law puts on the size of the \nrepository, spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors will be \nstored onsite at over 100 locations across the country for at least the \nnext several decades.\n  If we do have the nuclear revival that many of us believe is needed \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet our energy needs, the \nnumber of onsite storage locations across the country will only \nincrease.\n  Not only is the Department of Energy seeking to withdraw its license \napplication--and I am not absolutely convinced they have the authority \nto do so--they are seeking to withdraw it ``with prejudice,'' making it \nvery difficult, if not impossible, to resurrect Yucca Mountain as a \npossible option for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \nwaste, regardless of what future scientific and engineering advances \nmay offer and regardless of what the administration's blue ribbon panel \nthat is directed to consider all of the options may conclude.\n  In fact, the Department of Energy argues in its motion that \n``scientific and engineering knowledge on issues relevant to \ndisposition of high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel has advanced \ndramatically over the 20 years since the Yucca Mountain project was \ninitiated.''\n  Apparently, the Department is also arguing that scientific and \nengineering knowledge on the same issues will not advance any further \nover the next several decades to address issues with the Yucca Mountain \nsite.\n  Setting the legal issues aside surrounding the Department's motion to \nwithdraw, I wish to focus for a moment on what stopping work on the \nYucca Mountain site will actually cost the American taxpayers.\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Federal Government \nhas a contractual obligation to collect spent nuclear fuel from \nindividual nuclear powerplants starting in 1998. The government has \nclearly missed on that deadline.\n  According to the Department of Justice, the Federal Government has so \nfar paid $565 million in settlement costs for breaching this contract \nwith the utilities. I say ``so far'' because the ultimate cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer we know is going to be much higher.\n  Utility companies have filed 71 cases in Federal court alleging the \nDepartment of Energy's delay in taking title to spent nuclear fuel is a \nbreach of contract. Of those 71 lawsuits, 10 have now been settled, 6 \nwere withdrawn, and 4 were fully litigated, resulting in the $565 \nmillion in payments. Of the 51 cases that are outstanding, then, the\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\njudgment has been entered in 13 of those cases, putting government \nliability, so far--so far--for commercial spent nuclear fuel stored \nonsite between 1998 and 2007 at a cost of $1.3 billion. And there \nremain another 38 cases for judgment to be entered on, so the amount of \nthe liability for that timeframe is likely to increase significantly in \nthe future. Keep in mind, this number does not take in account the \nlevel of liability for the increasing amount of spent nuclear fuel \nstored onsite from 2008 until the date when a permanent repository is \nopened, whenever that might be, nor do the costs include the $24 \nmillion in attorney costs, $91 million in expert funds, $39 million in \nlitigation support costs, or the thousands of hours the DOE and the NRC \nemployees have already expended on this effort.\n\n  The Department of Energy estimates that the potential liability of \nthe Federal Government to utilities will be $12.3 billion--if the \ngovernment starts taking title to the spent fuel by 2020, just 10 years \nfrom now. According to the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nutility industry reports estimate that the claims will total $50 \nbillion. And both of these estimates were developed before the \nadministration took steps to withdraw the Yucca application. So we have \nliability estimates of between $12 billion and $50 billion in taxpayer \nmoney--if a repository is opened and accepting spent fuels in the next \n10 years. Keep in mind, it took us almost 30 years to get this far on \nYucca Mountain. With the current administration shutting down all work \non Yucca and beginning the search for a solution anew, it seems \nincreasingly likely that the costs will greatly exceed the $50 billion \nestimate.\n  At a time when we are already racking up trillions of dollars in debt \nfor future generations, the administration has freely chosen--freely \nchosen--to incur additional future taxpayer liability in terms of tens \nof billions of dollars by withdrawing the Yucca Mountain repository \nlicense application because, in the words of Secretary Chu, ``the \nstatutory limit of Yucca Mountain would have been used up in the next \nseveral decades.''\n  So all Americans are on the hook for tens of billions of dollars \nbecause the Federal Government is in breach of its contract to take \ntitle to spent nuclear fuel. But it gets even better for those \nAmericans whose utility gets some of its electricity from nuclear power \nplants: You get to pay twice. In return for the Federal Government \ntaking title to commercial spent nuclear fuel, the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct established a nuclear waste fund to provide for the construction of \na spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste repository. \nUtilities that operate under nuclear power reactors are charged a fee \nby the Secretary of Energy, and that fee is then deposited into the \nwaste fund. The cost of that fee is passed on from the utility to the \nconsumer. The utilities, and then hence their customers, contribute \nbetween $750 million and $800 million into the waste fund each year.\n  As of September 30, 2009, payments and interest credited to the fund \ntotaled just over $30 billion. That is a substantial amount of money. \nHowever, there are restrictions on what those funds can be used for. \nFunds from the nuclear waste fund may only be expended for the \nconstruction of a facility expressly authorized by the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act or subsequent legislation. The only facility that meets this \ndescription is Yucca Mountain. Yet the Obama administration has shut \ndown work on Yucca and filed a motion to withdraw its license \napplication. So the natural question is, What happens to the money in \nthe nuclear waste fund since it can't be spent on anything other than \nthe construction of the Yucca Mountain repository? Well, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act directs the Secretary of Energy to adjust the fee paid \nby the utilities if the amount collected is insufficient or in excess \nof the amount needed to meet the cost of construction of the \nrepository. It is hard to see how the $24 billion balance in the fund \nis not sufficient to pay for work on a facility where no more work will \never occur.\n  Utilities have been suggesting that the fee be dispensed with, but \nSecretary Chu said that the collection will continue. So some \nratepayers will continue to pay a higher electricity bill to contribute \nto a fund that no longer serves a purpose, at least until the courts \nshould rule otherwise. If--or perhaps when--the courts order the \nreduction of the fee and the refund of the balances already paid into \nthe fund, you can add the loss of over $750 million in income to the \nFederal Government per year, as well as the refund of the $30 billion \nalready collected, to the taxpayers' debt.\n  Mr. President, I have focused on the impact stopping work at Yucca \nMountain will have on the commercial operations and the individual \ntaxpayer, but the license application withdrawal will also impact those \n13 States that host Federal sites that hold high-level radioactive \nwaste from the production of nuclear weapons dating back to the \nManhattan Project. These are, most notably, Hanford, WA; Savannah \nRiver, SC; and the National Engineering and Environmental Lab in Idaho. \nJust as utilities have sued the Federal Government for breach of \ncontract, the decision to terminate Yucca should open the door to a \nlawsuit from a State such as Idaho, which has a court-approved \nagreement with the Department of Energy to remove nuclear waste from \nthe State by the year 2035.\n  I am also concerned that in the administration's haste to suspend the \nwork on Yucca Mountain, valuable scientific data will be lost--for \nexample, as the Sustainable Fuel Cycle Task Force noted, long-term \ncorrosion samples containing decades of information that is \nirreplaceable.\n  To quote the task force, they say:\n\n       Scientific information developed at considerable cost in \n     the Yucca Mountain program should be preserved to assist in \n     future repository development, wherever that may be.\n\n  I call upon the administration to preserve the data it has collected \nso far. I support moving forward with the Yucca Mountain license \napplication, but if the motion to withdraw the application is \nsuccessful, the knowledge and data received so far in the process will \nbe valuable for future repository siting needs.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers are on the hook for tens of billions of \ndollars. Some are paying twice for a repository that is being taken off \nthe table. States are left with Federal holding sites that contain \nhigh-level radioactive waste. Valuable scientific data is at risk of \nbeing lost forever. And all the administration can offer in return is a \n2-year delay while a panel studies the issue and offers a report.\n  It is encouraging to hear the administration voice its support for \nthe development of additional nuclear power and back those words with a \nrequest for greater loan guarantee funding. That is good. But in order \nto have support for new nuclear at a national level, there must be \nsupport among the communities which host existing nuclear powerplants. \nI am increasingly concerned that until we can resolve what to do with \nthe back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, local support for nuclear will \nerode as questions about how long the spent fuel will be stored onsite \npersist.\n  With the withdrawal of the Yucca Mountain license application, we are \nessentially back to square one, and the American taxpayer will continue \nto pay the cost--without receiving any answers.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, am I correct that, procedurally, I am \nspeaking in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1580-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on this health \ncare reform bill that is purportedly going through the House right now. \nI just have to speak on it because it is so obvious that the American \npeople do not want this bill, and yet now the Democrats seem to be \npushing it through the House with these elaborate procedures. So I want \nto talk about it, as I know many others on this floor are doing and \nhave done, because really the only way we can bring to the attention of \nthe American people what is going on here is to talk about it--both \nprocess as well as substance.\n  The health care bill that passed this Senate last December, on \nChristmas Eve, was passed really under a cloud,\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\nand the American people immediately saw that big cloud on the horizon, \nfor sure. The bill has been bandied around so much that the American \npeople have finally come to the conclusion that what was passed was not \nin the best interest of America. So we are still debating this \nlegislation, and the reason is the American people don't want this \nbill. Why do they not want it? They know it will do great harm to our \neconomy--one-sixth of the whole economy of our country--and it is not \ngoing to significantly change the course of our Nation's spending on \nhealth care, nor is it going to add to its quality. The Senate bill is \na failure in terms of resolving the concerns Americans have with our \ncurrent health care system.\n  Most of us in this Chamber agree that the health care system today is \nnot what it needs to be and that it is not sustainable. And we can \nprobably agree on the causes--No. 1, health care costs are going up, \nand No. 2, a lot of people can't afford and don't have access to health \ncare insurance. So limited access to affordable options and rising \ncosts. But this bill makes it worse, not better.\n  The bill is so bad that the President and the leadership in Congress \nare going to use the unique budget procedure known as reconciliation to \nforce additional health care measures through Congress. In fact, they \nare even talking about not actually passing the bill that passed the \nSenate--without any minority votes--in December, and they are talking \nabout ``passing it'' by deeming it in the House, which means Members of \nthe House won't actually vote on it, because it is so bad. Well, how \nmuch sense does that make?\n  The media is continuing to speculate about whether the Speaker of the \nHouse can secure the votes needed to pass the Senate bill as well as a \nnew unseen, unknown additional bill that would change the bill that \npassed the Senate and take out some of its flaws. We haven't seen this \nnew bill, either, and we are talking about getting it over on the \nSenate side next week.\n  Amid this media storm of speculation on whether a bill can be passed \nusing reconciliation, we need to talk about why this bill represents \nthe wrong approach to health care reform.\n  No. 1 is the cost of the bill. The bill costs more than $2 trillion. \nSome may try to say it is actually less than that, but the truth is, \nthere are 10 years of tax increases and 10 years of Medicare cuts to \npay for 6 years of spending. Yes, that is right. The taxes start \nimmediately, the Medicare cuts start immediately, and 4 years from now \nthere will be presumed options for people to be able to have affordable \nhealth care. The true 10-year cost of this bill is $2 trillion.\n  More taxes. The bill imposes 10 years of taxes--$\\1/2\\ trillion of \ntax increases--most of which will start immediately or very shortly. \nMore than $100 billion in taxes on prescription drug companies, medical \ndevice manufacturers, and insurance companies is going to be levied. \nWhat do those taxes mean? Well, clearly, every study shows and every \neconomist says those taxes will be passed on to individuals. They will \nbe passed on to individuals in the form of higher cost for prescription \ndrugs and higher cost of insurance premiums and medical devices. That \nall starts before we ever see any kind of affordable health care \noptions.\n  I offered an amendment in the December debate that would say no taxes \nstart until services are provided. I thought that was a pretty clear \ntax policy, one that maybe the American people would at least say: OK, \nat least it is fair; the taxes don't start until the services start.\n  Of course, my amendment was rejected. Now we have the bill that was \npassed which is 10 years of taxes for 6 years of services. There are \ntaxes on those who cannot afford insurance, the higher of $750 per \nindividual or 2 percent of household income. That is the tax on people \nwho do not purchase insurance. Employers are also hit with new taxes. \nThe penalty could be as high as $3,000 per employee under the Senate \nbill.\n  What will this do to small businesses, which create 70 percent of the \nnew jobs in our country? In a letter sent to the majority leader, the \nSmall Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care stated ``with the \nnew taxes, mandates, growth in government programs and overall price \ntag, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,'' the health care \nreform bill, ``costs too much and delivers too little.''\n  That is pretty succinct, the Small Business Coalition speaking out \nand saying this bill costs too much and delivers too little. Small \nbusinesses are reeling. We are in a time when families are struggling \nto pay their mortgages, struggling to find a job, struggling to pay \nbills, and businesses are having a hard time, too, and they are not \nhiring. What are we doing? Providing more burdens on small businesses \nand expecting them to hire more people. This is so counterintuitive \nthat the American people certainly see what is happening.\n  Those are all the taxes. The other side is the cuts to Medicare. The \nSenate bill includes $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare over 10 years, \nincluding $135 billion in cuts to hospitals. The Medicare Program is \nunsustainable. The Chief Actuary of Medicare has said as much as 20 \npercent of Medicare's providers will either go out of business or will \nhave to stop seeing Medicare beneficiaries. Millions of seniors, \nincluding those who have chosen Medicare Advantage, will lose the \ncoverage they now enjoy. Medicare is being used as a piggy bank, and it \nneeds every penny that has been deposited. We cannot reform all of the \nhealth care system on the backs of our seniors. Cuts to hospitals will \nthreaten access for seniors.\n  We have been asking the leadership of Congress to scrap this bill and \nwork with Republicans to achieve the reform that Americans want, reform \nthat will reduce costs, increase competition, and improve access. This \nbill achieves none of that. I cannot understand why the President chose \nto base his proposal for reform on the Senate bill that was passed by \nthe Senate, but the American people have consistently opposed it. Every \npoll shows the American people do not want the Senate bill. They saw it \nfor what it was, a failure.\n  I hope the Members of Congress who are being cajoled into voting for \nthis bill will listen to the American people. They do not want the \ngovernment to take over their health care. They want affordable access, \nand that means we have to bring the costs down and give more options.\n  Let's talk about the right kind of reform, what Republicans are \nputting on the table: more choices. How about allowing small businesses \nto pull together so their risk pool is increased and costs are lowered; \nand create an online marketplace where the public can easily compare \nand select insurance plans. But it would be a marketplace that is free \nfrom mandates and government interference. The one that is in the \nSenate bill had so many mandates and so many requirements that the \ncosts are going to be out of sight.\n  So what happens? In comes the government plan to supplant the new \nhigher cost options because of all the taxes that have been put on the \ncompanies that are trying to provide health care.\n  No. 2, how can we reduce costs and lower expenses? For one thing, we \ncould reform our litigious system of tort law that punishes doctors and \nhospitals. It drives physicians away from the practice of medicine. \nTort reform alone could save at least $54 billion. That is the low end \nof the projections of what tort reform could save.\n  No. 3, we could lower the cost to taxpayers by giving tax incentives \nto encourage the purchase of health insurance. We do not have to have a \ngovernment takeover, and we don't have to have new taxes. Let's give \nincentives, tax breaks for individuals and families who will buy health \ninsurance. We will help them have affordable access. Senator DeMint and \nI have a bill that would offer a voucher to families: $5,000 for a \nfamily to purchase their own health insurance, to go on the exchange, \nto determine what they can afford, to determine what their needs are, \nand it is not tied to their employer so it is portable, so it is theirs \nand they own it. No preexisting conditions would ever keep them from \nhaving that policy again, and they could take it to whatever employer \nthey decided to work for. They would not be tied to employment for \nhealth care coverage.\n  These are options the Republicans have given to the majority to ask \nthem to consider in a bill that would reform health care in the right \nway.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to their constituents. Their \nconstituents are speaking in volumes at a time\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nwhen we are seeing political games being played on the House side to \nstrong-arm people to vote for a bill that their constituents do not \nwant, and then they are going to send it over to the Senate with a new \nbill that is going to, supposedly, correct the problems in the Senate \nbill--except that we will still have the taxes, we will still have the \nincreased costs, we will still have the cuts to Medicare. All of that \nwill remain. It is a flawed bill.\n  Please, Members of Congress, listen to your constituents and let's \nstart again and do this right. That is what the American people are \nasking for. It is the least that we owe them: not to pass a bill that \nis going to destroy one-sixth of the American economy and take away the \nchoices that Medicare patients have, cut the services of Medicare, and \ntax every employer and every family whether they have not enough health \ninsurance, no health insurance, or too much health insurance.

I would like to discuss all four amendments briefly. The \nfirst is the prohibition on earmarks in years in which there is a \ndeficit. I have been pleased and somewhat surprised over the past week \nto hear about the renewed bipartisan interest in banning earmarks. I am \nthankful for the attention and I welcome the House Democratic \nleadership to the fight against earmarks.\n  According to last Thursday's Washington Post:\n\n       Facing an election year backlash over runaway spending and \n     ethics scandals, House Democrats moved Wednesday to ban \n     earmarks for private companies, sparking a war between the \n     parties over which would embrace the most dramatic steps to \n     change the way business is done in Washington.\n\n  I was pleased to see that the Speaker of the House and the chairman \nof the House Appropriations Committee have recognized earmarks for what \nthey are: a corrupting influence that should not be tolerated in these \ntimes of fiscal crisis.\n  I applaud my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate, \nespecially Senators Coburn and DeMint, who have called for a year-long \nmoratorium on all earmarks. I fully support and join them in those \nefforts, but I think we need to do more.\n  We need a complete ban on earmarks until our budget is balanced and \nwe have eliminated our massive deficit. This amendment promises to do \njust that. I encourage my colleagues to join\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\nme in this effort. It is what the American people want. We have an \nobligation to give it to them.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from Indiana, Senator \nBayh.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3472\n\n  The next amendment I would like to discuss very quickly is that no \nfunds from the passenger facility fee could be used to construct bike \nstorage facilities at airports.\n  As many know, the passenger facility fee is assessed on every ticket \nfor any flight. Currently, this fee is $4.50 per flight. During these \nvery difficult economic times for most Americans, the bill from the \nHouse raises this fee to $7 and indexes it to inflation. It is \nfrustrating, but it is more frustrating that taxes and fees make up as \nmuch as 25 percent of every passenger's airline ticket.\n  I think most airline passengers would agree with me that they would \nrather see more improvements to ensure faster travel times and safer \ndepartures and arrivals.\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported earlier this year, on \nJanuary 14, 2010, that $1.5 million of passenger facility fees were \nused for a ``function art project of glass panels laminated with \npatterns of tree bark.''\n  It sounds beautiful, but I know most Americans want these excessive \nfees and charges to be used effectively and for the goal that Congress \nintended: to improve safety and performance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  On the issue of the amendment concerning moving Next Generation air \ntraffic control forward, this amendment would require the FAA to report \nback to Congress in 90 days with proposals for innovative financing \nmechanisms to further the deployment and implementation of a modernized \nair traffic control system known as NextGen.\n  Specifically, the report requires these innovative financing \nproposals to not increase our Federal deficit and consider public-\nprivate partnerships. As the distinguished chairman of the committee \nknows all so well, modernizing our outdated air traffic control system \nwill positively impact all Americans by decreasing airport delays, \nimproving the flow of commerce, and advancing our Nation's air quality \nby reducing aircraft carbon emissions.\n  Every day Americans sit on a runway and miss meetings, children's \nsoccer games, family dinners, and other important events due to air \ntraffic delays that could have been avoided if our Nation had a \nmodernized air traffic control system.\n  Thousands of goods are delayed for delivery each year due to air \ntraffic delays which results in more than $40 billion in costs each \nyear that are passed on to consumers, according to the Joint Economic \nCommittee.\n  The Government Accountability Office estimates that one in every four \nflights in the United States of America is delayed. The airlines have \ncalled our air traffic control system ``an outdated World War II radar \nsystem.''\n  The FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System, NextGen, will \ntransform the current ground-based radar air traffic control system to \none that uses precision satellites, digital network communications, and \nan integrated weather system.\n  Moving from a ground-based to a satellite-based system will enable \nmore flights to occupy the same airspace, meaning the ontime \nperformance improvements would be a reality, and would triple the \naircraft capacity according to airlines. However, the administration \nand Congress have not provided adequate funding toward air traffic \ncontrol modernization, and instead continue to fund billions of dollars \nof earmarks. The FAA estimates it will cost up to $42 billion to \nimplement a modern air traffic control system.\n  Congress appropriated $188 million for air traffic control \nmodernization in 2008, and $638 million in 2009, then another $358 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2010 Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill. However, that same bill dedicated $1.7 billion on \ntransportation earmarks. We have to stop spending billions of dollars \nand instead cut spending or at least spend taxpayers' dollars on worthy \nprojects.\n  Again, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for his \nefforts over many years on FAA modernization. There is no doubt the \nairlines are right when they describe our air traffic control system as \n``an outdated World War II radar system.''\n  It is a shame that all of these years we have had attempts that \nfailed and wasted billions of dollars in our efforts to modernize the \nair traffic control system, and we have failed. But we have to redouble \nour efforts.\n  As we expect the economy to recover, there will be more aircraft \nflying in crowded airspace. There will be a more dangerous situation \nunless we modernize our air traffic control system.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3528\n\n  The final amendment I have is to provide standards for determining \nwhether the substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience \nof the Grand Canyon National Park has been achieved, and to clarify \nregulatory authority with respect to commercial air tours operating \nover the park.\n  I see my colleagues waiting, and I will not take a lot of time on \nthis amendment. But I would like to mention to my colleagues that it \nwas approximately 25 years ago that I proposed legislation to restore \nnatural quiet in the great experience over the Grand Canyon National \nPark.\n  All of these years have intervened and there still have not been \nregulations written to implement that legislation. All of us share the \nsame goal. We have been able to sit down, with the help of the majority \nleader's office, Senator Ensign's office, Senator Kyl's office, and \nothers to try to make progress on this important issue.\n  I think we have brought all parties together. I think there is \nconsensus. So I am hoping that we will be able to adopt this amendment \nwithout further disagreement. It is important that we restore the \nnatural quiet and experience of the Grand Canyon National Park. At the \nsame time, it is also very important that people from all over the \nworld have the opportunity to enjoy one of the great and magnificent \nexperiences that any person can have; that is, to view the Grand Canyon \nfrom the air as well as from the ground.\n  I think this legislation represents that careful balance. I thank \nSenator Reid and Senator Ensign and Senator Kyl for their efforts in \ncrafting this legislation. It is time we acted. I appreciate the \nindulgence of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would say to the good Senator from \nthe State of Arizona that we have a number of amendments that are \nalready more or less agreed to. More amendments are coming in, \nincluding several that he has mentioned. We want a chance to look at \nthose to see whether those are--I heard one amendment, for example, \nthat sounded pretty easy to do.\n  The earmark amendment, I actually--I am not dissing this, but I just \ncannot resist but point something out; that is, on earmarks, this would \nban earmarks for the foreseeable future. Let me redefine that.\n  In the last 71 years, the Congress of the United States has not had a \nbudget deficit in only 13 years. So you can see for the foreseeable \nfuture it is sort of a large matter. Nevertheless, we welcome the \nchance to look at that and work on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to talk about two issues. First, \nI will talk about the pending business before the Senate, which is the \nFAA reauthorization, in a moment. I certainly want to commend my dear \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, for what he has done in bringing the reauthorization to the \nfloor and the manner in which he has fashioned it.\n  This is an opportunity to create 150,000 jobs, modernize our system \nfor this 21st century, save millions of gallons of fuel that get spent \nunder a system that is antiquated, and people sitting in planes just \nidling, and $9 billion in lost revenue to the Nation as a result of an \nantiquated system. All of this will be dealt with, with the FAA \nreauthorization.\n  But before I get to that I want to speak for a moment on an item that \nwe will be voting on tomorrow which is critically important to make \nsure we put the Nation back to work, the HIRE Act. One of those items I \nbelieve is incredibly important that has been getting the wrong view \nhere is the question of the Build America Bonds. It is\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\none that has been debated quite a bit on the Senate floor the last \ncouple of times we have been in session. My view is that these bonds \nhave been one of the most successful pieces of the economic recovery \npackage passed last year. They have helped to finance nearly $80 \nbillion in economic development projects in all 50 States.\n  Those are projects that are a win-win for America. By helping States \nand local governments finance vital public infrastructure projects, we \nare putting Americans back to work; building better, stronger \ncommunities, better schools, retooling our infrastructure, and \npreparing for the new economy. That is what makes the Build America \nBonds so effective. By lowering borrowing costs, these bonds \nincentivize investments in our communities across America. This gives \nState and local entities resources to fund badly needed projects, \nprojects from which we all benefit.\n  These bonds have been a resounding success. As a matter of fact, in a \nNovember article by Stephen Gandel that appeared on time.com, it ran \nunder this headline: ``A Stimulus Success: Build America Bonds Are \nWorking.''\n  In this article, Amy Resnick, the editor in chief of a publication \nwhich follows bond markets, was quoted as saying: ``It's clearly been a \nsuccess as a means of stimulating the economy.''\n  When we talk about stimulating the economy, ultimately we are talking \nabout putting Americans back to work. The bill we have before us, that \nwe will vote on tomorrow, expands this successful program to allow \nissuers of school construction and energy project bonds to convert \nthese tax credit bonds into a Build America Bond. Seems like a rather \nsimple provision to me, a commonsense provision that says if it has \nbeen successful, why not expand on it. If we can stimulate needed \nconstruction for schools and communities across America, if we have a \nproven way to promote putting people to work on critical energy \nprojects, why wouldn't we do it?\n  Some of my Republican friends say they want to work on job creation, \nbut I find it ironic that on one hand they speak about creating jobs, \nbut on the other hand they criticize Build America Bonds for ``doing \ntoo much'' to create jobs and facilitate investment in vital public \nprojects in communities across America.\n  You can't have it both ways. You can't blame the majority for not \nfocusing on job creation while criticizing one of the most successful \nprograms as having done too much. At a time of 10 percent unemployment, \nthe question is not are we helping our communities too much; rather, \nthe fundamental question the Congress must be focused on is how do we \ncreate more investment so we can create more jobs so that we can put \nmore Americans back to work. The lessons of history are important. \nBuild America Bonds, the jobs they create, the good they do, underscore \nsome of the historic differences between this side of the aisle and the \nother. History tells us that in difficult economic times, creating \nbadly needed jobs for families struggling to make ends meet strengthens \nthe economy and helps us rebuild a better future.\n  In the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt understood the need for \ngovernment to step in and create jobs. He rebuilt America's rusted old \n19th century infrastructure, retooled old systems and prepared the \nNation for the 20th century. History has a way of repeating itself. We \nshould not ignore it. We should instead learn from it, learn from our \ngreat successes so we don't repeat our worst failures. A proactive \ngovernment creating a jobs agenda and putting people back to work \nduring the New Deal and rebuilding our infrastructure was one of those \nsuccesses. On the other hand, a static government doing nothing to \ncreate jobs in the face of massive unemployment, as Herbert Hoover did, \nwas one of our worst failures.\n  The lesson of history is clear. If we are too shortsighted to repeat \nthe things that work, we are doomed to repeat the things that failed.\n  Finally, on the second issue and the pending issue before the Senate, \nwe need this FAA reauthorization bill because it will create jobs, over \n150,000. It will reduce congestion, that $9 billion lost for America by \nairplanes idling and people not being productive at work as they try to \nget to their business appointments and others who get lost along the \nway in terms of the time lost being with their families and friends. It \nalso improves safety, which should be job 1. It will invest in \ninfrastructure that will get more people to their destinations on two \nwords we want to hear more and more, as the chairman is trying to make \nhappen: On time.\n  It will address several essential safety issues related to oversight, \npilot training, pilot safety, and pilot fatigue after the tragic Colgan \nAir crash last year in Buffalo. This bill takes several steps to ensure \nthat, 1, an extremely high level of safety exists throughout the entire \ntransportation system. It protects passengers from being stranded on \nthe tarmac like those at Stewart Airport in New York who sat on a plane \nthat ran out of food. Things got so bad that each passenger was given \nfour potato chips and half a cup of water. That is simply ridiculous \nand unacceptable. This bill will put an end to these stories by \nrequiring each airline to provide adequate provisions to stranded \nplanes and give all passengers the right to deplane after 3 hours, if \nnot sooner.\n  I salute Senator Rockefeller and the members of the Commerce \nCommittee who have worked to bring this important bill to the floor.\n  There are some things I hope we have offered that will be accepted \ninto a managers' amendment. I look forward to some opportunities. We \nhave something called the Clear Airfares Act. I believe when you buy a \nticket, you should have the right to know what you are paying for. \nAnything short of that is simply unfair. My amendment No. 3506 would \nrequire airlines to be upfront with their fees so consumers can make an \ninformed decision. It seems as though the airlines never have met a fee \nthey do not like. These are some of them. We have two easels here to \ntry to make the case. It is rather busy, but this gives you a sense to \nthese two chart that lay out 13 common airline fees that 18 different \nairlines assign--fees for ordering tickets by phone, fuel surcharges, \nfor traveling with a pet. Last year they invented a new fee. It is \ncalled the holiday fee. Because these fees don't appear alongside a \nticket's base airfare, consumers have little idea of how much the \nticket will eventually cost them.\n  I brought an example we worked on to dramatize what we are talking \nabout here. Airline A's ticket from BWI to La Guardia appears to be $2 \ncheaper than airline B's ticket, $223.50 compared to $225.40. But then \ncome the hidden fees. Airline A charges you $120 round trip to check \ntwo bags plus an additional $200 to travel with a pet. By contrast, \nairline B allows you to check two bags for free and charges you $150 to \ntravel with a pet. The end result, when you add up the fees, what \nappeared to be the least expensive ticket for the same exact flight is \nactually $150 more expensive. My amendment shines a light on airline \nfees and surcharges so consumers have an accurate picture about what \ntheir trip is likely to cost them. We hope the committee will accept \nthat.\n  We also have an amendment on focused flying which was written in \nresponse to the flight that flew 150 miles beyond its destination, \nallegedly because the pilots were too distracted to notice the airport. \nI am pleased. Working with the committee and Senator Dorgan, we were \nable to include language in the underlying bill that would prohibit \nunnecessary electronic devices from the cockpit. However, it is \nimportant we look at all pilot distractions. Our amendment calls for \nthe FAA to conduct a study on the broader issue of distractive flying \nand its impact on flight safety.\n  The last amendment I have filed would require the FAA to monitor the \nair noise impacts of New Jersey, New York, and Philadelphia airspace \nredesign and simply provide the data to the public. I have not been \nsupportive of the airspace redesign in part because it was done in such \na way where noise impacts are rather severe. Now that the redesign is \nbeing implemented, the public has a right to know what consequences \nthere are in that redesign and that some level of transparency should \nbe provided to the flying public and the communities affected.\n  Lastly, I look forward to what I hope is an end product, as we move \nthrough this Chamber and have a conference,\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nthat no longer makes it tougher for some workers to organize unions \nthan others who do the same work. I believe the rules should be applied \nevenly across the board. Unions help improve safety standards which not \nonly benefit workers, they touch all of us who drive on the roads and \nfly in the skies. I hope the ultimate result will create that \nopportunity. It is time we finally pass the FAA reauthorization. It \nwill create jobs. It will make our flying experience safer. It will \nmake it more efficient. We will save money in our economy.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Rockefeller to make the bill \none we can continue to be proud of as we fly the skies of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New \nJersey who is complimented far too little for doing so many good things \nbut did a lot of them on the floor this afternoon. I appreciate what he \nsaid which is not related to aviation, about the school bond. It makes \nan enormous difference. It has been changed a bit to make it more \neffective at the State level. I appreciate the fact that he said that. \nAnd the points he made with respect to some of the amendments to the \naviation bill seemed to make a lot of sense. The last one may cause \nsome discussion, but I know the Senator and I know what is in his \nheart. He always speaks the truth.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank my distinguished colleague and chairman for his \nremarks and observations. We look forward to working with the committee \nto achieve some of these things and to achieve ultimate success with \nhim at the end of the day.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. You could join the Commerce Committee. You are right \nup there in the leadership. I respect everything the Senator from New \nJersey does.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have just visited with Senator \nRockefeller. Of course, we, along with Senator Hutchison, are trying to \npass an FAA reauthorization bill, which is not as easy as it sounds. \nThis is not one of the most controversial or difficult or passionate \nissues that divide America. We have plenty of those issues around. But \nthis is about modernizing our air traffic control system, about \nreauthorizing the Airport Improvement Program, improving air safety--a \nwide range of issues. Still, anything that is brought to the floor of \nthe Senate these days slows down--way, way, way down--and that is the \ncase with this bill as well. I have described it as similar to trying \nto walk through wet cement to try to get something through the \nCongress.\n  We have amendments pending dealing with school vouchers, putting \ndiscretionary caps on budgets, earmark reform--things that have very \nlittle or in most cases nothing to do with this underlying bill. It is \njust that this is an authorization bill open for amendment, so we have \namendments on a wide range of issues. We also have other amendments \nthat have been offered that are germane and relate to this piece of \nlegislation, and we have been working through trying to put together an \nen bloc amendment with our staffs and Senator Rockefeller's staff, \nworking through, with other colleagues, some of the suggestions. They \nmake a lot of sense. I think we are making progress there.\n  I have described before the need for this legislation. Last year, I \nmet with some of the Europeans who are putting together the \nmodernization program in Europe. This issue of modernization of the air \ntraffic control system--I think I heard Senator McCain talk about World \nWar II vintage air traffic control. It is the case that for those who \nare now taking off this minute from National Airport, when that \nairplane leaves the runway and is in the national airspace, it is the \ncase that someone in a control tower somewhere is watching that \nairplane. Why? Because there is a lot of traffic up there.\n  This is the most complex airspace in the world here in the United \nStates, and I think the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, does \na terrific job in operating the most complex system in the world. We \nhave the safest skies in the world, there is no question about that. We \nhave had one particularly fatal accident in the last year. That tragedy \noccurred in Buffalo, NY, with Colgan Air, in which 50 people tragically \nlost their lives, including the pilot and copilot and flight attendant. \nBut the fact is, we have safe skies, and I would be the last to come to \nthe floor of the Senate and say the American public should be worried \nabout safety. It is the case, however, that the Colgan crash gave us a \nroadmap to some changes that I believe are necessary and that I and \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison have put in this bill. The \nissues we have discovered from that tragedy persuaded us that a number \nof things needed to be done.\n  The FAA itself has worked on aviation safety for a long while. The \nNational Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aviation \naccidents, has made recommendations. In fact, they have a most wanted \nlist. There are some recommendations that will improve air safety that \nhave been on the most wanted list for a long, long time, some for well \nover a decade and not yet adopted. So the Administrator of the FAA, \nRandy Babbitt, has worked with us. I know he is working diligently to \ntry to address some of those issues.\n  Let me mention safety in just a moment, but let me talk for a moment \nabout modernizing the system.\n  When people say: Well, what is that about, it means we are moving \nfrom the tracking of that airplane that just left National Airport--I \nthink we have about one a minute that is authorized at that slot \nairport, so every minute, an airplane is leaving that airport. When \nthat airplane is at cruising altitude and on its way up to cruising \naltitude, it has a transponder, and that transponder is sending \nsignals. That signal shows up on a screen. That screen is in front of \nan air traffic controller. That screen shows that airplane, in most \ncases by number, and that air traffic controller is directing that \nairplane with its traffic through other routes flown by other \nairplanes. It is all about safety, making sure airplanes can fly in a \ncongested, crowded sky.\n  The dilemma--by the way, it has been relatively safe. It certainly is \nsafer than in the old days when they first started flying at night. \nDuring the day, they would fly by sight, years and years ago. Then, at \nnight, they would fly to bonfires. They would fly to a bonfire and then \nfly 50 miles to another bonfire as they carried the mail at night. \nEventually they would fly to lights, and then eventually they would fly \nto ground-based radar. It has been around a long time.\n  The problem is, ground-based radar only shows where a jet plane is \nright at that moment--any airplane, for that matter, but a jet moves \nvery fast, so at that nanosecond when that sweep of the radar shows \nthat airplane in that airspace, that is exactly where it is. But a \nnanosecond later, it is somewhere else. Especially with a jet, with the \nnext 5 or 7 seconds it takes to sweep the radar, that jet is somewhere \nother than where the dot showed it on the screen. Now we have the \ncapability to know much more precisely than that where the airplane is, \nbut because we only know about where that airplane is, we have to space \nairplanes for a margin of safety and we fly less direct routes. The \nresult is, we use more fuel in that plane by flying a less direct \nroute. We have to have much wider spacing of airplanes in a congested \nairspace. We are polluting the skies with more fuel used. We are \ncosting the airplanes and the passengers the extra fuel. We are also \ntaking extra time for the passengers to get to where they are headed \nbecause of less direct routes.\n  All of that can change with a new system of global positing, GPS. \nEverybody understands what GPS is. You have GPS in your automobile in \nmany cases. You type in an address and it shows you where your car is \nand where the address is and it takes you right to the address. If your \nchild has a cell phone, in most cases they have access to GPS in their \ncell phone. In many cases, your child with a cell phone has\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nthe opportunity, with some of the providers, to link with their best \nfriends--their five best friends, for example--and each of them with \ntheir cell phone can have GPS locators, so they can access their five \nfriends and know exactly where each of the five is. We can do that with \nchildren and cell phones. We cannot do it today with commercial \nairplanes. We cannot know exactly where that airliner is with GPS \ntechnology. That is because we have not yet modernized.\n  That is what this is all about--modernization of the air traffic \ncontrol system. When we do--and we will--we will be able to fly much \nmore direct routes, have a greater margin of safety, save fuel, save \nthe environment. We will do all of these things. Other parts of the \nworld are doing it, and so must we. That is why Senator Rockefeller and \nI have brought a bill to the floor that moves directly and aggressively \ntoward what is called modernization of the air traffic control systems. \nIt sounds complicated. It is less complicated than one would think. It \nneeds the FAA to build the facilities on the ground, and it needs the \nairplanes to have the equipage in the jet or the airplane itself. When \nwe do that and have the procedures and the developed process, we will \nhave modernized the air traffic control system. That is what the \nlegislation is about.\n  The legislation is also about building infrastructure across the \ncountry. If you are going to fly, you have to have someplace to land \nand someplace for passengers to embark and disembark. It means runways \nand terminals. It means a wide range of things. This also includes the \nEssential Air Service Program, which provides essential air service \nthrough contracts to smaller communities. As I indicated earlier, it \naddresses the issue of safety.\n  Let me describe safety for a moment, as I have done a couple of times \non the floor because I think it is very important.\n  One-half of the flights in this country are by regional airlines. The \npassengers do not necessarily know it is a regional airline. They get \non, in most cases, a smaller airplane, and it says United, US Airways, \nDelta, Continental, but it is not that company at all. That is just the \nbrand on the airplane, and it is a regional company, in most cases, \nthat is flying for the larger carrier. In some cases, the larger \ncarrier owns the regional, but in most cases, it is a regional flying \nunder contract to one of the major carriers.\n  What we have discovered in several hearings, in the aftermath of the \nColgan accident, is some very difficult circumstances in terms of \nmistakes that were made and things that we think we need to improve and \ncorrect. Some of it we do in this bill.\n  The pilot who was in charge of the Colgan plane that evening--flying \nat night, in ice, in the winter, into Buffalo, NY, from Newark \nAirport--that pilot, we discovered later, had failed a number of pilot \nexams along the way. We have learned that the CEO of this company, \nColgan, indicated: Had we known about these multiple failures along the \nway of this pilot's credentials, we would not have hired the pilot. But \nthey did not know because they did not have access to all of that \ninformation. This legislation provides that access shall be made \navailable. So those hiring decisions will be better decisions.\n  The issue of fatigue is very important and was very evident as part \nof the cause, I believe, of that Colgan accident in Buffalo. There is \nalmost never a circumstance where there was an airplane accident in \nthis country where the accident report says definitively: This was \ncaused by fatigue. But we know, of course, there are a number of \ntragedies that were caused by fatigue.\n  Let me point out something we learned with respect to this particular \nflight, and my assumption is it is not peculiar to this flight. This \nchart shows the Colgan Air pilots' commuting prior to a flight. On this \nparticular flight, on that evening, when the passengers boarded that \nflight, the copilot, who got in the right seat of that cockpit, had \nflown from Seattle, WA, to Newark Airport in order to reach her duty \nstation. She lived in Seattle and she worked out of Newark. She flew \nall night long, deadheaded on a FedEx plane to Memphis, changed, and \nflew to Newark all night long. The pilot commuted from Florida to \nNewark. So you have two people in the cockpit: one from Florida who \ncommuted to Newark and one from Seattle who commuted to Newark.\n  What we now have heard from testimony from the National \nTransportation Safety Board is the pilot of that airplane had not slept \nin a bed the two previous nights, the copilot had not slept in a bed \nthe previous night. Was this crash caused by fatigue? There will never \nbe something that definitively suggests that, but if you were a \npassenger on an airplane and in the cockpit sat a pilot and copilot, \nneither of whom had slept in a bed the previous night or two nights, \nwould you believe fatigue was the cause of perhaps a misjudgment in the \ncockpit? I would. I would.\n  The question is not, Can you end all commuting? I do not expect you \ncan probably end all commuting. But the question is, Does some of this \ncommuting invariably cause fatigue? I believe it does. And how do you \nbegin to address that? The FAA Administrator has now sent to the Office \nof Management and Budget, I believe, his rulemaking on fatigue, so that \nis a step forward because we have to address that.\n  As shown on this chart, this quote is from a discussion by a regional \npilot in the Wall Street Journal of September 12, 2008. He said:\n\n       Take a shower, brush your teeth, pretend you slept.\n\n  That is what a regional pilot says about the kind of work on regional \ncarriers, where you have a lot of stops, small routes or short routes: \n``Take a shower, brush your teeth, pretend you slept.''\n  Again, I think it raises the question--and a reasonable question--\nabout how do you make this circumstance change. How do you promote \ngreater safety in circumstances where there is so much commuting, where \nyou have duty time that often allows for less than is necessary to \nsleep at night? There is the full 8 hours, to be sure. But by the time \nyou get to a hotel somewhere during duty time, it is quite often the \ncase you have not slept a full night.\n  In this case of the Colgan flight, we have now learned the copilot on \nthat airplane not only traveled all the way across country to reach her \nduty station, but she is someone who made in the neighborhood of \n$20,000 to $23,000 a year. Does anybody believe a copilot on a \ncommercial carrier paid $20,000 to $23,000 a year is going to be able \nto afford hotel rooms when they get to their duty station prior to \ntaking a flight? I don't think so. That is not an unreasonable thing to \nexpect to have happen.\n  Let me say, my discussion of this is not to tarnish regional \nairlines. They play a very important role in our air traffic system in \nthe commercial aviation system--very important. My hope is, though, \nworking with the regional carriers, these safety provisions we have \nincluded in this piece of legislation will substantially improve safety \nand avoid the kind of circumstances that existed on that particular \nColgan flight.\n  I mentioned previously the families of the victims on that Colgan \nflight have been real champions for aviation safety. They have never \nmissed a hearing. They have shown up at all the events in Washington, \nDC, whether it is a hearing or other activities, to say: I am here on \nbehalf of my son, my daughter, my brother, my mother who perished in \nthat crash. The fact is, that diligence and that effort has made a \ndifference and shows itself in this legislation.\n  We also, in this legislation, are addressing the issue of pilot hours \nas qualifications. I will talk about that some other time.\n  I think there is a lot here to commend this bill to my colleagues. It \nis urgent we get this passed through the Senate, get to conference, be \nable to reach a conference agreement with the House, and get the bill \nsigned. We will, by that, I think improve the infrastructure in this \ncountry, substantially increase jobs--we are estimating 150,000 new \njobs as a result of it--and dramatically change the air traffic control \nsystem from an archaic system to a modern system. All that is good for \nthe country.\n  There is way too much that is needed to be done in this country to \nimprove things, especially in areas of infrastructure and \nmodernization, that is\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nleft undone. Let's at least get this piece for commercial aviation and \nfor all aviation completed.\n  I have mentioned almost exclusively the issue of commercial aviation. \nI do not want to leave the floor again without saying there is another \ncomponent to aviation in our country; that is, general aviation. Many \nof us fly on small planes a lot. I learned how to fly a small plane \nyears and years ago. General aviation plays a very important role in \nthe area of aviation in our lives.\n  In States such as Alaska, the Presiding Officer's State, or perhaps \nWest Virginia or North Dakota, in States such as that, the ability to \nget on a Cessna 210 or a King Air, if we are lucky, or perhaps even a \nMooney or a 172 Cessna and go someplace and get there, sometimes in \ncircumstances where there are not a lot of roads, as would be the case \nin Alaska, and other circumstances where you have wide distances to \ntravel on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday--general aviation is so \nimportant and they do so much good work.\n  In addition, very few people talk--it is true of general aviation and \nalso commercial aviation--about the mercy flights, flying a heart for a \ndonor on a mercy flight, or flying someone who needs desperate \ntreatment to save a life. It goes on every day all across this \ncountry--corporate jets, private planes, and, yes, even with commercial \nairliners.\n  We are in the process right now of beginning to fight a flood in \nFargo-Moorhead. That river will go up 20 feet in about 10 days. It is \ngoing to be 20 feet by Friday from 2 weeks ago. I recall last year when \nthe flood occurred, then Northwest Airlines, now Delta Airlines, flew \nsome very large planes into Fargo for relief purposes. They never asked \nfor anything. They just said they were coming. There is a lot of work \nthat goes on by some of the major carriers, as well as corporate and \ngeneral aviation, that is very important.\n  Again, I thank Senator Rockefeller for the work he and Senator \nHutchison have done. I, as chairman, and Senator DeMint, as ranking \nmember, of the Subcommittee on Aviation are pleased to be working with \nthem.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  United States and Israel Controversy\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe current controversy between the United States and Israel on the \nsettlement issue.\n  Before the current controversy between the United States and Israel \nescalates further, I suggest all parties cool the rhetoric, avoid \npublic recriminations, determine exactly what happened and consider \nsome fundamental questions.\n  What are the facts? It has been reported that there are 1,600 new \nsettlements in East Jerusalem in violation of Israeli commitments. \nAuthoritative sources insist that the announcement by a mid-level \nofficial at the Ministry of the Interior only involved planning subject \nto judicial review with no groundbreaking for 3 years. Another report \nsaid U.S. officials extracted a secret promise from Prime Minister \nNetanyahu not to allow provocative steps in East Jerusalem. Is it true \nthat the United States accepted the 10-month moratorium on settlements \nwith caveats that excluded East Jerusalem in line with the insistence \nby Israeli officials dating back to Prime Minister Golda Meir that \nJerusalem was under Israeli exclusive sovereignty?\n  It is conceded that Prime Minister Netanyahu was blindsided by the \nannouncement. It is further acknowledged that the Israeli Minister of \nthe Interior is a member of the ultra-conservative Shaos party whose \nparticipation is essential to the continuation of the coalition \ngovernment.\n  These matters need to be thought through before making public \npronouncements that could significantly damage the U.S.-Israeli \nrelationship and give aid and comfort to the enemies of the Mideast \npeace process.\n  The rock solid alliance between the United States and Israel has \nwithstood significant disagreements for six decades. The mutual \ninterests which bind these two countries together have always been \nstronger than the most substantial differences. The United States needs \nto respect Israeli security interests, understanding that Israel cannot \nlose a war and survive. The United States has many layers of defense to \nprotect our security interests and survive.\n  I suggest that if we all take a few deep breaths, think through the \npending questions and reflect on the importance of maintaining U.S.-\nIsraeli solidarity, we can weather this storm.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 3120 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Connecticut for \nawaiting those few comments and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3456\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it was a pleasure to yield that time \nto my friend from Pennsylvania, which he used very well.\n  I rise to continue a discussion of amendment No. 3456, which has been \noffered by Senators Collins, Byrd, Feinstein, Voinovich, Ensign, and \nmyself, which would reauthorize the Opportunity Scholarship Program for \nstudents, needy and deserving students here in the District of \nColumbia, sometimes referred to as the DC voucher program.\n  This amendment would, as I say, reauthorize this program which \notherwise would either atrophy over time--there are still 1,300 \nstudents in it, but now, for the last 2 years, it has not been \nreauthorized. President Obama in his budget says this probably will be \nthe last year that Federal funding would be in it. The nonprofit \ncorporation that has administered this program has said--under the \ncircumstances the Congress by our inaction and in some sense \ninterruption have created--they cannot continue to administer the \nprogram. No one else has come forward to do that.\n  This amendment says, effectively, it would be a tragedy, a human \ntragedy, 1,300 human tragedies--that 1,300 economically disadvantaged \nstudents in the District of Columbia who have been given a lifeline out \nof failing public schools to try to better educate themselves so they \ncan live a life of self-sufficiency and satisfaction--that all that \nhope would be ended, all that opportunity would be ended.\n  This amendment would turn all that around and say the Senate believes \nthis program is at least worth continuing as an experiment. But more \nthan that, it has worked, by independent evaluation. Why terminate it? \nThere is no good reason to terminate it. Would the Chancellor of the \nDistrict of Columbia School System, Michelle Rhee, obviously an \nadvocate for the public schools here--as I am, as the other Senators, \nCollins, Byrd, Feinstein, Voinovich, and Ensign are--would the \nChancellor of a public school system here support this program if it \nwere not a good program? Of course not. Would she support it if she \nthought it was a threat to the public schools? Of course not. That is \nher first and major commitment. She supports a 5-year extension of this \nprogram that this amendment would authorize because, as she said \npoignantly to our Government Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover matters related to the District of Columbia--she said until she \ncan say to a parent of a child at a school that has been designated \nunder Federal law as a failing school, a school that has failed to give \nthose children an equal educational opportunity--until, Chancellor Rhee \nhas told us, she can say to the parent, ``that public school that your \nchild is in here in the District of Columbia, our Nation's Capital, is \nprepared to give your child an equal and good educational \nopportunity,'' then she cannot say terminate the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program which gives low-income, economically disadvantaged \nchildren a lifeline, a passport, a scholarship they can use at a \nprivate or faith-based school of their choice.\n  This program was started after difficult and intricate negotiations \nin\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n2004. It was started with a basic premise that is deeply and \nwonderfully American, which is: Hey, this is the country whose \nDeclaration of Independence said that the government was being created \nin the first place, in 1776, to secure the rights to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness; that everybody has an endowment from our \nCreator--not by the government; the government is there to secure those \nrights--the endowment came from God, from our Creator. One of the \nfundamental ways in which we have attempted over our history to secure \nthose rights is through the public school system, through our school \nsystem.\n  Generations and generations of Americans, new Americans, immigrant \nAmericans, have come here and the school system has given them an \nopportunity for education and they have gone on to not only make a \nsuccess of themselves but contribute enormously to our country.\n  The sad fact is that a lot of our public schools today are failing \nparticularly our economically disadvantaged students. There is a \nterrible gap based on income and race and ethnicity, an achievement \ngap, in our public school system. No Child Left Behind and various \nFederal programs are trying hard to close that, but it has not been \nclosed yet.\n  That is why a lot of us got together in 2004, the administration and \nboth parties, and tried to negotiate and ultimately did negotiate a \ncompromise which was based not on supporting any particular educational \ninstitution but founded on that goal that was in the Declaration of \nIndependence, that is characteristically and fundamentally American, \nthe individual and, in this case, the individual child. How many \nindividual children, in this case in the Nation's Capital, can we give \na better education so they can develop their God-given talent to the \nhighest level possible, which they cannot do if they are not getting a \ngood education?\n  So in this compromise that was enacted in 2004, we basically created \nnew income streams. Some people say: Oh, the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram looks like it is working. It is a good idea to help kids get a \nscholarship to a private or faith-based school, but I am against it \nbecause it takes money from public schools. Wrong. That was the whole \npremise.\n  In fact, to even it out, when we adopted this program we gave an \nequal amount of additional money to the DC Public Schools as went into \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, then a new stream of money into \ncharter schools in the District of Columbia. That was the agreement \nthat was made. It was a good agreement. Those of us who support the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program are not at all unhappy to give an equal \namount of extra money to the public schools and to the charter school \nmovement in the District.\n  I guess the program is controversial because some people do not want \nto experiment with something other than the public school system on how \nto educate the individual. OK, I respect that. I understand that.\n  Teachers unions are at the forefront of the opposition. They are \nagainst this bill. I understand that. But I disagree, respectfully. \nThis is not an assault on teachers or the public schools. As Chancellor \nRhee has said: This is a temporary lifeline for students who are in \nschools designated under Federal law as inadequate to educate them, to \ngive them an opportunity to step up and go to a private or a faith-\nbased school where they can do better.\n  I do not know why anyone would want to terminate this program. It is \na small program. As I will make clear in a few moments, it has been \npositively evaluated. Particularly, I repeat, why would we want to \nintervene when the leader of the DC Public Schools says this \nOpportunity Scholarship Program should be continued because it is good \nfor kids in the District of Columbia. She cannot really say to parents: \nI can give a good, first-class education to all of your children.\n  Parents like this program a lot. Kids like it. We heard moving \ntestimony from children in the system. Polling in the District of \nColumbia shows very strong support for it, particularly and not \nsurprisingly in economically disadvantaged areas.\n  Look, let's talk from the facts. Most of us, I will say ``us,'' \nincluding me, have the money to send our kids to either private or \nfaith-based schools because we think they can get a better education \nthere or the kind of education we want them to get, particularly if it \nis in a faith-based school.\n  These are parents who do not have that choice because they do not \nhave the money. Imagine the frustration that we would feel if our \nchildren were trapped in a public school where we knew they were not \ngetting a good education that would compromise the rest of their life \nand yet we did not have the money to get them a better education.\n  That is all this program deems, the Opportunity Scholarship Program. \nIt is a scholarship to give economically disadvantaged kids an \nopportunity to rise to the limits of their ability. A vote against this \namendment, I really believe, is a vote to take away opportunity for \n1,300 economically disadvantaged students who are now in the program \nand hundreds of others who would join if and when this program is \nextended.\n  There have been hundreds of students involved. At its peak there were \n1,930 students enrolled for the 2007-2008 school year. Because no new \nstudents could enroll, because the program was not reauthorized to that \nextent by Congress, enrollment declined to 1,721 for the 2008-2009 \nschool year. It is now at 1,319.\n  Here is a terrible thing that happened: Last year, 216 students were \noffered a scholarship for the year that followed, the school year that \nfollowed. Then that offer, because of opposition to this program and a \ndecision not to allow new students into it, was revoked by the \nSecretary of Education of the United States.\n  Since its inception, the Opportunity Scholarship Program has served \nover 3,000 students, and more than 8,400 have applied to participate. \nOver 85 percent of the students in this program would be attending a \nschool in need of improvement, corrective action, or restructuring as \ndesignated under Federal law. This is a remarkable program that really \ndoes deserve to be continued.\n  I note the presence of my colleague and friend and cosponsor, Senator \nEnsign. If the Senator would like to speak at this time, I will be glad \nto yield the floor, and then I will take it back after he has \nconcluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, first of all, I appreciate all of the \ngreat work that the chairman has done on this piece of legislation. \nThis is a bipartisan piece of legislation that we are talking about \ntoday. We are talking about the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  Why is it on the bill that deals with the FAA, people would ask? \nWell, it is on there because we have been trying to get this \nreauthorized for a long time. In the Senate, we have to take whatever \nvehicle we can get.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Lieberman and the work he has \ndone, as well as many of my other colleagues. Unfortunately, there are \nforces on the other side who apparently think giving opportunity \nscholarships for 1,300 poor children in the District of Columbia is \nsomehow a threat to our public education system in America.\n  I heard the chairman talk about Michelle Rhee. Michelle is one of the \ntrue reformers of education. She is a believer in the public education \nsystem in America, as I am. I know that Chairman Lieberman is a big \nbeliever in the public education system. That is one of the reasons we \nwant to explore and test various reform proposals to actually see if \nthey will work, or see if they do not work.\n  Well, so far, there have been 1,300 students participating in the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program. Based on the satisfaction of their \nparents, it is serving the students well. Remember, when they get a \nscholarship, they do not have to go. Let me repeat that. If they are in \na public school system, they are zoned for that public school system. \nThey cannot afford to go anyplace else; they do not have any choice. \nBut if they get one of these DC scholarships, nobody forces them to use \nit. Nobody forces them to go to one of those other private schools.\n  Why do the parents and the kids like it? They like it because they \nare escaping from a bad school.\n  As Senator Lieberman discussed, 85 percent of the kids who \nparticipate in\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nthis program are from failing schools; failing based on objective \ncriteria. The average household income is about $25,000 a year for the \nfamilies of these kids who are participating in the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program. These are kids are from low-income families. They \ncannot afford to take their kids out of these failing schools by \nthemselves. That is why we wanted to experiment to see whether the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program worked. Did it help the kids' \neducational system? Education in America has been called the new civil \nright. Well, I think that is exactly right. I think we need to look at \neducation as a way to lift people out of poverty. But just because kids \nare getting an education at school, it does not give them the \nopportunities that other kids are getting. It is not a question of \nmoney. The DC Public School System spends $15,000 per year per student. \nIt is one of the highest, if not the highest, in the country. It is \nabout $4,600 a year more than the national average. It is almost three \ntimes more than what Nevada spends per student.\n  But I can guarantee you, I do not know of anybody in Nevada who would \nrather have their kids going here in Washington, DC, Public Schools \nthan going to public school in Nevada. It is because of the poor \nperformance of Washington, DC Public Schools.\n  Now, Michelle Rhee, to her credit, is doing a good job improving the \npublic schools. But they have so far to go. The Mayor of Washington, \nDC, supports the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. The parents of \nthese children--there were over 7,000 people who just signed a petition \nin Washington, DC, to continue this program. I have met many of these \nstudents. When you talk to them, and you look in their faces and you \nsay: Do you want this program to continue? Is this something that has \nhelped you in your life? The students who have participated in the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program say it is one of the best things that \never happened to them in their life. DC Opportunity Scholarship Program \nallowed the students to get out of a school that had high crime rates, \nthat had low performance, and where sometimes the teachers did not have \ngreat attitudes. The students went to a caring, loving atmosphere where \nthey had a chance to succeed.\n  That is really what this whole thing is about. Recent data shows that \nabout 26 percent of eighth graders in the DC Public Schools score below \nbasic in math. Students of DC Public Schools rank near the bottom in \nthe Nation in both SAT and ACT scores. About half of the DC students do \nnot even graduate from high school.\n  On the other side of the coin, when you look at what has happened \nwith the DC Opportunity Scholarship kids, a rigorous study by the \nInstitute of Education Services found that students in the program \nexperienced statistically significant improvements in reading that were \nequal to more than 3 months of additional schooling.\n  The study also found that students in five out of ten subgroups \nimproved in reading, and parents experienced increased satisfaction \nwith the quality and the safety of their children's schools.\n  Dr. Wolf, who was the principal investigator for the Department of \nEducation study, has stated:\n\n       . . . the D.C. scholarship program has proven to be the \n     most effective education policy evaluated by the federal \n     government's official education research arm so far.\n\n  You know, Rome was not built in a day. I believe we owe it to DC's \nchildren to continue this program and to continue the research on these \npromising gains.\n  Do we know that the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program will work in \nthe future? No. But it is promising research so far. So we should not \ndiscontinue the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. We should fund it, \nmake sure that it continues and continue to study it.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened is that in the public school system, \nthere are forces who believe that giving parents choice is somehow a \nthreat to our public school system. To me, it is just about the kids \nand their education. That is who should come first in our education \nsystem, the children. Let's put their education and future first. Let's \nnot have special interests decide who is going to control education.\n  That is what the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is all about. I \nsee Senator Collins is on the Senate floor. I appreciate her work, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Voinovich, and many others in the Senate who \nhave worked in a bipartisan fashion. Let's not let this bill go down.\n  Secretary Duncan is a reformer. There is no question he has brought \nsome reform proposals that I think deserve looking at.\n  He has talked a lot about putting our kids first in our education \nsystem. This is one way we can do it. We need to support Michelle Rhee \nin her efforts to improve the public school system, but we also need to \nkeep this valuable program, the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, \nintact for those 1,300 kids and their families who are enjoying its \nbenefits.\n  I yield the floor and thank the chairman for allowing me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator Ensign for his \ncosponsorship, for his convincing and informed argument for this \namendment. I couldn't agree more. There is such an irony here. \nSecretary Duncan of Education is a reformer. The President supports \nschool reforms. Michelle Rhee is trying very hard and valiantly and \neffectively to reform the DC Public Schools. Why would Secretary Duncan \nand members of the administration and some in this body and our \ncolleagues in the other body oppose this program, an opportunity \nscholarship program which Chancellor Rhee supports because it is \nconsistent with her attempt and the attempt of Secretary Duncan to \nreform our public schools? The only answer I can think of is that \ncertain interest groups, including particularly teachers unions, oppose \nthis measure.\n  For me, that is not an acceptable reason to terminate the hopes of \n1,300 children in a program in the Nation's Capital.\n  I note, with pleasure, the presence of our colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, let me begin by saluting the leadership \nof my colleague, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, \nSenator Lieberman. He has been so persistent in ensuring a debate on \nthis program. His leadership on this issue, as on every other issue I \nwork with him on, has been exemplary.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Lieberman, Ensign, Voinovich, \nFeinstein, and Byrd in offering this amendment to reauthorize the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program.\n  More than 5 years ago, leaders in the District of Columbia became \nfrustrated with institutionalized failure within the public school \nsystem, and designed a ``three-sector'' strategy that provided new \nfunding for public schools, public charter schools and new educational \noptions for needy children. Working with the District, Congress then \nimplemented the DC School Choice Incentive Act in 2004, giving birth to \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program is the first to \nprovide federally funded scholarships to students, and has enabled low-\nincome students from the District of Columbia public school system to \nattend the independent-private or parochial school of their choice. For \nmany of these students, this was their first opportunity to access a \nhigh quality education.\n  The program has clearly filled a need, a fact that is illustrated by \nthe long lines of parents waiting to enroll their children in the \nprogram. Since its inception, more than 7,000 students have applied for \nscholarships. With demand so high, it is dismaying that critics would \nseek to dismantle the program.\n  The inspiring stories we have heard from parents and students \nparticipating in the program, parallels what we have learned from \nrecent independent studies conducted by the University of Arkansas and \nthe Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  In December 2009, University of Arkansas researchers released the \nfindings of a new evaluation entitled ``Family Reflections on the \nDistrict of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program.'' The project \nsought to ``capture the contextual nuances of what is\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\nhappening in the lives of the families experiencing the Program'' by \nconducting a qualitative assessment.\n  The study showed that parents were overwhelmingly satisfied with \ntheir children's experience in the program. Common reasons for this \nhigher level of satisfaction included, appreciation for the ability to \nchoose their child's school, the success their children are having in \nnew school environments, and the support provided by the Washington \nScholarship Fund.\n\n  In March 2009, the Department of Education released its evaluation of \nthe program's impact after three years, which showed that overall; \nstudents offered scholarships had higher reading achievement than those \nnot offered scholarships, the equivalent of an additional three months \nof learning.\n  As I noted previously, this amendment has bipartisan support and was \ncrafted using input from Members on both sides of the aisle. As chair \nand ranking member of the Financial Services General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Durbin and I held a hearing last \nSeptember on funding for schools in the District. We heard from \nstakeholders representing DC Public Schools, DC Public Charter Schools, \nand the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. This amendment is the \nbyproduct of their input as well as that of my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Durbin.\n  In addition to providing scholarships for low-income students and \ntheir family's real choice in education, the amendment authorizes $20 \nmillion for DC public schools and $20 million for pubic charter \nschools--so that all students in the District have access to a high \nquality education.\n  Further, our amendment includes provisions supported by Senator \nDurbin. Among other things, it provides that all participating OSP \nschools maintain a valid certificate of occupancy issued by the DC \ngovernment, that core subject matter teachers in OSP schools must hold \nat least a bachelor's degree, and that all OSP schools must be \naccredited.\n  We all must place what's best for students first. If Congress were to \ndiscontinue funding for DC opportunity scholarships, it is estimated \nthat 86 percent of the students would be reassigned to schools that did \nnot meet ``adequate yearly progress'' goals in reading and math for the \n2006-07 school year. We simply cannot afford to allow that to happen. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  We are talking about averting a true tragedy by adopting the \nLieberman amendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor. I do not use that \nword ``tragedy'' often nor lightly. That is what we are talking about. \nWe are talking about the futures of young people in the District of \nColumbia. That is what is at stake in this debate. It is that serious.\n  It is important to go back and look at the history of the DC \nscholarship program. More than 5 years ago, the leaders of the District \nof Columbia became so frustrated with the institutionalized failure \nwithin the District's public school system that they came to Congress \nand worked with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to \ndesign a new three-sector strategy that provided new funding for public \nschools in the District, for public charter schools, and for \nscholarships for low-income children who might choose to attend a \nprivate school.\n  Working with the District's leaders, Congress then passed the DC \nSchool Choice Incentive Act of 2004, giving birth to the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program. For many of these students, this was their first \nopportunity to access a high-quality education, an education that would \ngive them the opportunity to excel, the opportunity for a bright \nfuture. That is what the debate is about. Indeed, we have seen \nincredible enthusiasm for this program, and the three-pronged approach \nhas helped DC's public schools to get on the path of improvement and \nDC's charter schools which are also providing some quality educational \nopportunities.\n  But a young man who testified before our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee put it very well when he was asked by a \nSenator who opposed the DC scholarship program why we should not, \ninstead, focus solely on the DC Public Schools.\n  He said: Mr. Senator, the DC schools didn't get bad overnight, and \nthey are not going to get better overnight.\n  Clearly, what he was saying was, why should he lose the opportunity \nfor a good education and a bright future while he is waiting for DC \nPublic Schools to get better.\n  I join in the admiration for Michelle Rhee, who is working very hard \nwith the mayor and with the city council to improve the DC Public \nSchools. We are making progress. We rejoice in that progress. We \nsupport that progress. That is why we are continuing to provide Federal \nfunding for DC's public schools. But as this young man told us, the DC \nschools did not get bad overnight, and they are not going to get better \novernight, no matter what extraordinary leadership they are receiving.\n  The DC scholarship program has clearly filled a need, a fact that is \nillustrated by the long lines of parents waiting to enroll their \nchildren in the program. Since its inception, more than 7,000 students \nhave applied for scholarships. With demand so high, with the stakes so \ngreat, it is dismaying, to say the least--I think it is tragic--that \ncritics are seeking to dismantle this program.\n  The inspiring stories we have heard from parents and students \nparticipating in the DC scholarship program parallel what we have \nlearned from recent independent, rigorous studies conducted by the \nUniversity of Arkansas and the Institute of Education Sciences at the \nU.S. Department of Education. Senator Lieberman and I heard firsthand \nfrom the researcher who conducted that study. He told us parents were \noverwhelmingly satisfied with their children's experience in this \nprogram, and they also told us the students offered scholarships had \nhigher reading achievement than those not offered scholarships, the \nequivalent of an additional 3 months of learning. Given that these \nstudents had not been enrolled in these better schools for very long, \nthat is impressive progress. I am certain as their education continues, \nif it is allowed to continue, we will see even more substantial \neducational gains.\n  It is so disappointing--it is discouraging and dismaying--that we are \nhaving to fight for the continuation of a program that each and every \nday is making a difference in the lives of these children.\n  I am going to challenge my colleagues, before you decide how you are \ngoing to vote on this program, if you are inclined to vote against our \namendment, first talk to just one student who is enrolled in this \nprogram and their parents. If you then can come to the floor and, in \ngood conscience, vote against the Lieberman-Collins amendment--well, \nsuffice it to say, I don't think our colleagues can, in good \nconscience, vote against our amendment, if they have talked to any of \nthe students and their families who are benefiting from this program.\n  It would be truly a tragedy for the children of the District of \nColumbia if this program is not continued.\n  Let me end my comments with one startling fact. If Congress were to \ndiscontinue funding for DC opportunity scholarships, it is estimated 86 \npercent of the students would be returned to schools that are failing \nschools, schools that did not meet the adequate yearly progress \nstandard for reading and math for the 2006-2007 school year. We simply \ncannot, in good conscience, allow that to happen.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a close look at the facts revealed by \nour hearing, the rigorous studies that have been done to compare \neducational progress, the recommendations of the chancellor of the DC \nPublic Schools and, most of all, I hope they will listen to the \nstudents and to the families whose lives have been changed for the \nbetter due to this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague, Senator Collins, for coming to \nthe floor, for being a cosponsor of this amendment. And for the \npassionate and reasoned way in which she spoke.\n  Two things come to mind in listening to her remarks. One is, we are \nvery often dealing with big national or international matters on the \nfloor of the Senate--health care reform, jobs act, whatever. They all \ninvolve people,\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\nof course. But here is one which is local, and we can actually quantify \nthe people. We have 1,319 children who are in private or faith-based \nschools because of this DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, getting, by \ntheir own telling and that of their parents, so much better an \neducation, feeling better about themselves, being on the road of \nopportunity.\n  If we don't authorize this, although the administration has said it \nis committed to at least following these students through high school, \nthere is not enough money there to do that. The President, in the \nbudget, said this is probably the last year he will fund it. There is \nnot enough money to carry these students through high school.\n  The second point is, with all the uncertainty in the program, the \ncurrent administrator of it, a nonprofit corporation, has said they \ndon't want to do this anymore. So far, no one else has been found to do \nit.\n\n  So this definitely closes the door to opportunity for hundreds of \nother students in the District and their parents to give them a better \neducation, while Chancellor Rhee, over the next 5 years, is trying to \nmake every school in the District of Columbia a good school.\n  But, secondly, it really focuses us on the possibility that these \n1,319 children will be forced to go back to the public schools in their \nneighborhoods, and 86 percent of those schools, as Senator Collins has \nsaid, are designated under Federal law as inadequate. None of us would \nlet our kids go there, and we would pay their way out. But these \nparents who benefit from this program cannot.\n  So Senator Collins has really spoken of this as a tragedy, a human \ntragedy--she is right--that you could look into the face of each of \nthese 1,319 kids and say: Sorry, you can't go on in this school you all \nare so happy to be going to at this point.\n  The second point is this, and I say this respectfully: It has been \nvery rare, when I have been involved in a debate in the Senate on a \nmatter, that I have not felt there were some respectable, good \narguments on the other side. I did not agree with them. On balance, \nthey did not convince me my position was wrong. But I must say that on \nthis one I cannot think of a single good reason to be opposed to this \namendment: 5 more years of an experimental program, $20 million to the \nDC Opportunity Scholarship Program out of, by my recollection, $13 \nbillion of Federal taxpayer money that goes to title I schools, and \nover $25 billion that goes from the Federal Government to public \nschools around America in the No Child Left Behind Program--a total of \n$25 billion or $26 billion.\n  This is $20 million for these DC Opportunity Scholarships, alongside \n$20 million more to the DC Public Schools that they will not otherwise \nget, and $20 million more for the charter schools. In fact, if this \nprogram is allowed to die and those 1,319 students are forced back into \nthe public schools in their neighborhoods, that adds, by the estimate \nof one independent authority I have seen, at least $14 million more to \nthe expense of the DC Public School System to take them back.\n  So I welcome people who oppose this amendment to come to the floor to \ndebate it, but honestly, listening to Senator Collins, I cannot think \nof a good reason to be against this amendment. I thank the Senator very \nmuch for coming over, for her cosponsorship, and for all the work we \nhave been able to do together.\n  Again, I say, why did this come before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee? Because historically--the Presiding \nOfficer, I am now proud to say, is a new member of the committee--the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has been given jurisdiction over matters \nregarding the District of Columbia. It is in that capacity that we have \ndone oversight of this program.\n  I note the presence of another cosponsor--and I will give her a \nmoment to get ready--Senator Feinstein of California, whom I will yield \nto whenever she wants to speak.\n  One of the arguments against this--actually, since no one is on the \nfloor opposing this, I am going to use a memo sent out this afternoon \nby staff to Senators opposing the amendment from the Democratic \nleadership office, I believe. I will just pick out a few of these.\n  The first problem cited: This program was passed in 2003 as a 5-year \npilot program. It has now been extended twice through appropriations \nbills to minimize the disruption to students already in the program, \nand a plan for winding it down is in place. But that is the point.\n  So they say: Reauthorization is not needed to keep students in the \nschools they are in. That, according to the DC authorities on this, is \nnot true. There is not enough money in it to keep them in there. The \nPresident said, in his budget this year, this would probably be the \nlast time he would recommend appropriating to this program. The promise \nwas to keep these students in the Opportunity Scholarship Program right \nthrough graduation from high school. There is not enough money there.\n  But more to the point, there is every reason to do it, based on the \nindependent evaluation of the program, based on Michelle Rhee, \nchancellor of the DC Public Schools, who is supporting the 5-year \nreauthorization because she feels it is necessary.\n  Incidentally, this reauthorization is also supported by Mayor Fenty. \nHe supports the tripartite appropriation: public schools, charter \nschools, and the Opportunity Scholarship Program. And it is supported \nin a letter from a majority of the members of the city council of the \nDistrict.\n  I want to quote--I will come back to it again--Michelle Rhee. This is \nwhy it is not adequate to say this ought to be just appropriated every \nyear and keep these students in the program dangling every year, making \nit harder to find an independent administrator of the program, why \nreauthorization is needed. But listen to this. This is Michelle Rhee in \ntestimony before the Financial Services and General Government \nSubcommittee on September 16 of last year. She says:\n\n       [O]n a regular basis, I have parents from Wards 7 and 8 \n     (which are our highest poverty wards, which are also the home \n     of our lowest performing schools) come to me and they've done \n     everything a parent should do and they say, ``I've looked at \n     all the data, I know my neighborhood school and the schools \n     surrounding are not performing at the level that I want them \n     to. So I participated in the out-of-boundary process; I went \n     through the lottery and I didn't get a slot at one of the \n     schools I wanted.'' So they look at me and say, ``Now what? \n     What are you going to do?''\n\n  Michelle Rhee answered in her testimony:\n\n       And I cannot look at those parents in the eye right now at \n     this point and offer every single one of them a spot in a \n     school that I think is a high-performing school.\n\n  Here is a gutsy comment from this chancellor who is really devoted to \nthe improvement of the public schools. Chancellor Rhee says:\n\n       And until I think we are able to do that, which I think is \n     on that five-year horizon, then I believe that we do need to \n     have choice for our families and I think they do have to have \n     the ability to participate: either to move into a charter \n     school or to use the opportunity scholarships.\n\n  End of quote from the chancellor of the DC Public School System. I \nhave the greatest respect for her. It took a lot of guts to say that. \nBut she said ``5-year horizon,'' and that is what this reauthorization \ndoes. It gives these kids--these parents who know their children are \nnot getting a good education in the public school they are in--who have \nnot been able to go to one of the out-of-boundary, out-of-their-\nneighborhood schools because the schools are packed, have not made it \ninto a charter school because I gather there are thousands waiting who \ncannot get into the existing charter schools--let's give them an \nopportunity to get one of these opportunity scholarships and have a \nchance for a better education and a better life.\n  Mr. President, I am going to stop now. I am very grateful for the \ncosponsorship by the distinguished Senator from California, a former \nmayor, of course, who is intimately knowledgeable on public education, \nwho is committed to public education and yet really concerned about \nevery child. That is what this program is about.\n  I will yield the floor at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator and chairman of the committee for \nhis leadership on this issue. Also, the Senator from Maine is in the \nChamber. I thank her for her support.\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\n  This has not been an easy program. It has always surprised me that \npeople oppose anything that might give an individual another \nopportunity. I believe very deeply that some children do well in one \nkind of setting, other children do well in another kind of setting, and \nthe real goal of education ought to be to provide a number of different \nchoices for youngsters so you can see where they learn best and then \nenable them to be in that situation. I also have always had a hard time \nunderstanding why only the well-to-do can afford a private school, why \nyoungsters have to go to schools that are among the most troubled and, \ncandidly, the worst anywhere because that is the way it is and that is \nwhat public education insists it be. So I have supported this program \nfor some 6 years now, since its inception under the leadership of \nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams, and I strongly believe it \nshould be continued. It is right.\n  It started out as a 5-year pilot program to determine whether \nyoungsters, low-income students, do, in fact, learn more and learn \nbetter in some of DC's private and parochial schools. The program's \nmost recent evaluation results show this program is, in fact, valid and \nstudents are, in fact, improving. So I say, why not reauthorize it? \nWhat is everybody scared of? Why not reauthorize it? The scholarships \nof up to $7,500 that are offered through the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram help children make their education in a private or parochial \nschool possible.\n  Currently, we know this: There are 1,319 children who attend 45 \nprivate and parochial schools. They all come from families where the \naverage income is $25,000, and 85 percent of these students would be in \nDC's worst performing public schools if it were not for this program.\n  This amendment would extend the life of this worthy program for 5 \nmore years and allow both current and new students the opportunity to \nparticipate. What are we afraid of? It is supported by DC Mayor Adrian \nFenty, as the chairman said; DC School Chancellor Michelle Rhee--one \nvery gutsy young superintendent; a majority of the District's council; \nand by parents in the District.\n  What are we afraid of?\n  Preliminary evaluations by the U.S. Department of Education's \nInstitute of Education Sciences have shown academic gains and student \nimprovement. When these students entered the program 6 years ago, they \nwere performing in the bottom third on reading and math tests in the \nDistrict's public schools. Last year's more comprehensive evaluation \nshows that reading test scores of students receiving a scholarship were \nhigher by the equivalent of 3 months of additional schooling. It showed \nthat they increased to the 35th percentile on the SAT-9 national \nstandardized test from the 33rd percentile where they were before \nentering the program. So progress has been made. Specifically, pilot \nprogram students scored 4.5 points higher in reading on the SAT-9, with \na total score of 635.4 when compared to the District's public school \nstudents' score of 630.9. These academic gains are despite the many \nchallenges these students face outside the classroom, coming from \nfamilies where the average income is $25,000.\n  I look forward to learning more in the months ahead of how students \nare performing in the program and the impact it has had on them. But in \nthe meantime, there are these results. They may not be major, but what \nthey are showing is that youngsters are learning to read better in this \nnew setting than they were in the public school setting. That, indeed, \nis something.\n  I would like to share three examples with you of how the program has \nhelped change the lives of the District's youngsters and how it has \nshown to give them a chance to reach their highest potential.\n  Let me give you the first one. OK. Here we are. This is a picture of \nShirley-Ann Tomdio, a ninth grade student at Georgetown Visitation High \nSchool. I have someone very close to me at Georgetown Visitation. This \nis a tough academic school, so this youngster has gone from one of the \nworst schools to a very strong academic school. The scholarship has \nallowed her to attend this school for the past 5 years. She is now a \nninth grade student at Georgetown Visitation School, and she wants to \ngo to college and become a surgeon. She was the eighth grade \nvaledictorian at Sacred Heart Middle School which is located in the \nDistrict's neighborhood of Columbia Heights.\n\n  Shirley-Ann said at her eighth grade graduation speech last year:\n\n       The DC OSP [Opportunity Scholarship Program] is important \n     to me because without it I wouldn't be able to receive the \n     best education possible. It should continue so that my \n     brother, sister, and other students get the same chance. \n     Every child should get the chance to go to a good school.\n\n  Who can disagree with that? That is her statement. She is one of the \nlucky ones. She will go on, and she will do well.\n  The second student is Carlos Battle. He is a twelfth grade student at \nGeorgetown Day School. He has attended a private school for the past 6 \nyears, since the program started. He is a well-rounded student, \nparticipating in school plays. He enjoys classes in classical and \nmodern dance. He plays on the basketball team. And he maintains a solid \ngrade point average of 3.1. He wants to go to college and has already \nbeen accepted to Northeastern University with a possible full \nscholarship, and Loyola University, among other colleges.\n  He comes from a family with a single mother and has a younger brother \nnamed Calvin who is currently an eighth grader at St. Francis Xavier \nAcademy, also with a scholarship from the program.\n  Carlos said this about his experience in the program:\n\n       The scholarships I have received through the Washington \n     Scholarship Fund have afforded me countless opportunities, \n     but most important, I have been given the chance to better \n     myself. Now, instead of wanting to be someone who is well-\n     known on the streets, I'd rather be someone who is well-known \n     for his education, communication, and advocacy skills. I now \n     no longer have to worry about fights breaking out in my \n     classroom, or being threatened on a constant basis.\n       With this security, I'm able to focus harder and become \n     more active in my school's community. Even better, I can look \n     forward to the future. If I keep on this same track, I am \n     almost guaranteed a better future for my family and for \n     myself.\n\n  Why should we be afraid of this program?\n  Let me show you a third youngster, Sanya Arias. This is someone who \nis now attending St. John's University in New York. She graduated last \nyear from Archbishop Carroll High School with a 3.95 grade point \naverage and is now in her first year at St. John's University in New \nYork with a full scholarship, and she loves it.\n  The DC opportunity scholarship helped Sanya attend Archbishop Carroll \nHigh where she was vice president of her class, captain of the soccer \nteam, on the lacrosse team, and president of the International Club.\n  In addition to her many extracurricular activities, Sanya took all \nhonors and advanced placement courses. She said this about her \nexperience in the program after just graduating from Archbishop Carroll \nHigh School:\n\n       It just shows the difference from 7th and 8th grade to \n     where I am now, where my friends strive to succeed and they \n     influence me to want to succeed along with them. So, I'm \n     really grateful for this opportunity.\n\n  Why don't the words of students such as Sanya, Carlos, and Shirley-\nAnn affect us? Why don't they enable us to see that choice in education \nis not something that is threatening?\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I was one of the deciding \nvotes in that committee when this came up. We put a lot of amount of \nmoney, additionally, into the District for public education to be able \nto sustain a simple choice opportunity program.\n  This program goes to the District's neediest students from the \nDistrict's most failing schools. I have just shown my colleagues three \nwho have succeeded. Is that not worth it? I do not understand why we \nare so afraid to give needy youngsters the opportunity of choice in \neducation, to allow someone who cannot do well in a certain setting to \nhave a different setting in which they may well be able to do very \nwell.\n  I say to these three youngsters: All the more power to you. I am very \nproud. We should listen to students such as Sanya, Carlos, and Shirley-\nAnn and continue to provide this program to the District's neediest \nchildren. We need different models for different children, and I think \nthis program is showing that.\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n  I don't know, there is a lot of lobbying against the program. The \nteachers union does not like the program. I don't understand why. I \ndon't understand what is to fear. I don't understand why, if you \nprovide some funding for poor children to go to a special environment \nto learn and they learn and this youngster now is in a university \nbecause of it--I think that is what we are all about. I strongly \nsupport this program.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his support and advocacy for it and his \nleadership in bringing this to the floor. I hope we have the votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, briefly, I thank my colleague and dear \nfriend from California for a wonderful statement. First, I say \nofficially as an Independent that the Senator from California has begun \ndemonstrating her independence of mind, spirit, and heart.\n  Secondly, I cannot tell the Senator how important it was that she did \nwhat she did with those three students because this is personal. This \nmatters to individual students. It is hard to imagine the talents these \nthree have shown and have developed would have been developed in the \nsame way, unfortunately, at the school they were consigned to by their \nneighborhood.\n  Years ago, I learned an expression from some wise person--a hundred \nyears ago--that if you save one life, it is as if you saved the whole \nworld because every individual has all the potential of the world \nwithin them. That probably was talking more about physically saving a \nlife. The truth is, in a way, that is real. By giving these kids an \nequal educational opportunity, we are giving them the ability to save \ntheir own lives.\n  I cannot thank the Senator from California enough for a wonderful \nstatement. I appreciate it very much.\n  I note the presence of my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, who has been a long-time advocate, going back to his days in \nOhio, for better educational opportunity for every child.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to his statement at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lieberman for the \nleadership he has shown in this effort to make a difference in the \nlives of students in the District of Columbia. The Senator from \nCalifornia did a beautiful job of outlining the difference it has made \nfor just a few who have been able to participate in the program thus \nfar.\n  I rise, of course, to support the amendment--the amendment that will \ncontinue to give thousands of children in the District of Columbia an \nopportunity for a good education.\n  It was first authorized in 2004. The program has the potential to \nprovide 1,700 children with scholarships of up to $7,500 each to attend \nthe school of their choice. To qualify, students must live in the \nDistrict and have a household income of no more than 185 percent of the \npoverty line. In the District, recipients' average family income is \n$24,300. These are very poor kids from families who are just making it. \nIt is not something we have created to make available to everyone.\n  Unfortunately, while the program can provide 1,700 children with \nscholarships, it does not. Increasingly, prohibitive language in the \nappropriations bills and a hostile administration--and I mean hostile--\nhas already decreased participation significantly. The program now \nhelps just over 1,300 students.\n  It is baffling to me why this administration has focused so much \nattention opposing a successful program which has provided a high-\nquality education to more than 3,300 children. According to the \nindependent evaluator of the program, ``participating DC students are \nreading at higher levels as a result of the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram.'' That is why, since 2004, approximately 9,000 families have \napplied for spots in the program--nearly three applications for each \navailable scholarship.\n  In its fiscal year 2011 budget request, President Obama has indicated \nthis will be the last year he expects to request funding for the \nprogram based on declining participation. Give me a break. I say to the \nPresident: It is difficult to participate in a program that is closed \nto new applicants. Participation levels are down because the Secretary \nof Education rescinded more than 200 scholarships to deserving children \nfor the current school year, and he did so after enrollment in \ndesirable charter and public schools had already begun.\n  Are we going to allow these children to return to failing, unsafe \nschools? High school graduation rates in the District's public schools \nare consistently among the worst in the Nation. According to the \nWashington Post--which, by the way, has editorialized in favor of this \nover and over--just over half the District's teenage students attend a \nschool that is ``persistently dangerous,'' as defined by the DC \nGovernment. On an average school day, nine violent incidents are \nreported throughout the school system.\n  I would like to say that Michelle Rhee is doing her very best to \nbring back the school system. The DC Tuition Assistance Grant Program \nhas been a help to many of these students. In fact, we increased \nattendance to college education because of the TAG Program. She is \ndoing everything she can. Here is someone who came in here and wants to \nmake a difference for the District. Before our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, she came out strongly and said this program should be \ncontinued. Mayor Fenty, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, again \nsaid this program should be continued.\n  What I find troubling is that some of our leaders who have exercised \ntheir right to school choice are denying that right to District \nparents. President Obama enrolled his children in a private school. \nThere is no way he would allow his kids to attend the DC public \nschools.\n  Listen to this: Secretary of Education Arne Duncan moved his family \nto Virginia, saying:\n\n       I didn't want to try to save the country's children and our \n     educational system and jeopardize my own children's \n     education.\n\n  Hear that?\n\n       I don't want to try to save the country's children and our \n     educational system and jeopardize my own children's \n     education.\n\n  He has that opportunity. These people who take advantage of the \nprogram do not have that opportunity.\n  To quote former DC Mayor Anthony Williams:\n\n       It is only fair to allow low-income parents the same \n     choices that we all have, to select the best educational \n     environment for their child.\n\n  In a letter to Senate Democrats regarding the DC program, the \nNational Education Association wrote:\n\n       Throughout its history, NEA has strongly opposed any \n     diversion of limited public funds to private schools.\n\n  Unfortunately, the letter neglects the fact that the scholarships \nwere designed according to a three-sector approach under which not a \nsingle dime has been cut from public schools. In fact, when we came in \nwith this program--I think the Senator from Connecticut remembers--we \nput $14 million into charters, $14 million into the public school \nsystem, and $14 million into the scholarship program. We did not take a \ndime away from the District. In fact, they made out quite well on it. \nAdd up 3 times 14, whatever that is. That is not bad coming from the \nCongress so we can move forward with some new ideas.\n  I have to tell my colleagues something. The merits of the program are \nof little importance to the NEA. I know this because after endorsing my \n1998 Senate campaign, here is what they said. I love this:\n\n       It is fair to say that no other Governor has done more for \n     education and Ohio's children.\n\n  That is the NEA. They then quickly withdrew support for my 2004 \ncampaign because I supported the DC School Choice Act. I was told--I \nwill never forget it. I went into the interview. They all sit around. \nYou know how it is. I answered their questions. After it was over, my \nopponent did the same thing.\n  Later on I heard back from the people who were there. They said: You \ndid a terrific job. We appreciate what you have done, but you are not \ngoing to get it because we have been told from the boys in Washington: \nThere is no way you are going to be allowed to endorse George Voinovich \nbecause he came out for the DC Scholarship Program.\n  Mr. President, I know the same kind of pressure is on many Members of \nthis\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nSenate. What they are afraid of is, if they vote for this amendment \nSenator Lieberman has, it will hurt them with the OEA or the NEA they \nhave in their respective States. Senator Lieberman has done the job \nexplaining what this is. This is not a big deal. Why can't they stand \nand say: This is a little bitty program that is helping a bunch of kids \nin the District of Columbia. Give me a break. Why shouldn't I support \nit?\n  I may be a little emotional about this, but Ohioans knew this was a \ngood program way back in 1995 when, as Governor, I supported the \nopportunity scholarships with the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring \nProgram Office. This was opposed--of course it was--but Ohioans knew it \nwas a good program. Over 1,900 students participated in the first year. \nSo with hard work and dedication, we fought for the program for nearly \na decade. Finally, on June 27, 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a \nlandmark decision, agreed that the program was constitutional in Zelman \nv. Simmons-Harris.\n  When I leave the Senate, I am going to write a book. One of the \nthings I am going to talk about in that book is that landmark decision \nthat started out in the State of Ohio in 1995 because I told the \nlegislature the Cleveland system was going down the tubes and they \nneeded to do something else. We finally got them to agree to put that \nscholarship program into Cleveland, OH. As a result of that program, \nover 1,900 participated in the beginning of it. Today, there are 6,000 \nstudents who are participating in that program.\n  The benefits, I would like to say, go beyond the academic. I think \nthe Senator from California did a beautiful job in laying out how this \nhelps academically, but a study by the Buckeye Institute in Ohio found \nstudents involved in the Cleveland program are gaining access to a more \nintegrated school experience. It is very important they have this kind \nof experience.\n  This program wasn't available when I was mayor, and my children \nprobably wouldn't have been eligible for it, but I will never forget \nthat my son George was the only White kid in his class in a major work \nprogram in the city of Cleveland, and I have to tell you he is a \ndifferent person because of the fact that he had that experience.\n  My daughter was one of two White kids who were in a class that was \nall African American. The program was terrific and they took advantage \nof it and they had a learning experience they would not have had if it \nhadn't been for this program that brought kids together for a special \nprogram.\n  In his closing testimony before our committee, former Mayor Anthony \nWilliams said:\n\n       Quite frankly, I am befuddled by the proposal to have the \n     program die by attrition. I cannot understand why anyone \n     could eliminate a program that has uplifted the lives, \n     fulfilled the dreams and given hopes to thousands of low-\n     income families.\n\n  I am also befuddled by that idea, and I urge my colleagues to stand \nand be counted. Support the Lieberman amendment. Let's let these kids \nhave an opportunity that without this program they are not going to \nhave available to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Voinovich for \nhis statement. He brings several thoughts to my mind. The first is: \nSenator Voinovich, I am going to miss you when you retire at the end of \nthis year. You are a straight shooter, you are a straight talker, and \nyou speak from your heart. You have had a lot of practical experience--\nas mayor, as Governor, and as a Member of the Senate--and you bring it \nall to bear in what you said.\n  Secondly, I look forward to buying that book you are about to write. \nI hope it is about your career broadly, but I would be real interested \nin that Ohio opportunity scholarships or voucher program.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator would yield, Mr. President, I would \nlike to say, I hope that one of the things I write about is the \nLieberman amendment that passed the Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, let's call it the Lieberman-Voinovich amendment.\n  Senator Voinovich has spoken from his own experience in the Ohio \ncase. As he said, sometimes people say opportunity scholarships or \nvouchers are constitutionally suspect or unconstitutional. Not true. \nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the Ohio voucher program was a neutral \nprivate choice program that did not violate the establishment clause.\n  But I will tell you what rings in my ear is the questions that have \nbeen raised by my colleagues in support of this amendment. Senator \nVoinovich said: Why would you vote against this amendment? Why would \nyou vote against this program? As the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, said: What is there to be afraid of in this program? It \ndoesn't take money away from the public schools. The head of the DC \nPublic School System is for the program because she thinks it will \nbenefit the children who need it, whom she knows she can't give a \nquality eduction to over the 5 years of the authorization program.\n  This program has been tested by an independent evaluator, Dr. Patrick \nWolf, principal investigator for the U.S. Department of Education \nstudy, and he concluded that:\n\n       The DC voucher program has proven to be the most effective \n     education innovation policy program evaluated by the Federal \n     Government's official education research arm so far.\n\n  Of the 11 innovation programs investigated, studies showed only 3 \nhave reported any statistically significant achievement gains, and the \ngains reported in the Opportunity Scholarship Program in the District \nof Columbia are the highest thus far.\n  I know Senator Rockefeller wants to return to the FAA authorization \nbill, so I will begin to wind this up. I thank all my colleagues who \ncame over to speak on behalf of the amendment. I regret that nobody has \ncome to speak against it. I was looking forward to a good debate. So I \nhave to go back to this staff memo sent out to Senators against the \namendment. We have actually dealt with all the arguments made:\n  Public dollars should be spent on public schools that accept all \nstudents subject to uniform public standards. This program accepts the \nstudents who apply, and when there are too many, they subject them to a \nlottery. It is a wide-open program.\n  They cite the Department of Education study. They do not do it \nfairly. They speak wrongly: DC parents already have choices about where \nto send their children with the public charter school network. Yet we \nknow those programs are oversubscribed.\n  The fact is, all the arguments made in this memo against the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program and keeping it alive in the hopes that \nthe lives of a limited number of students in the DC school system--\n1,300; maybe with this reauthorization they will be able to add a \ncouple hundred more in each year for the next 5 years; maybe it will be \n1,000 more children--will be better and for whom the doors of \nopportunity will be opened in a way they are not opened now. Why would \nanybody oppose this? I can't think of a good reason.\n  The group that has been most vigorously opposed has been the teachers \nunions. I understand why, but their interests do not outweigh the \ninterests of these children, economically disadvantaged, with dreams \nand hopes they can't realize in the schools they are in but who have \nthose hopes elevated and realized--as those three beautiful pictures of \nstudents who have been in this program that Senator Feinstein showed \nus.\n  Look, along with Chancellor Rhee, I hope for and, in fact, envision a \nday when the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is not needed and it \nwill not be needed because the DC Public School System will be \nproviding a good education to every student who lives in the District \nof Columbia. But that, as Chancellor Rhee has said, is not the reality \nthese children and their families live in today. Many schools in our \nNation's Capital, as the chancellor has said, are not providing an \nadequate education to the students.\n  I repeat: I will bet there is not a Member of this Senate, if their \nchildren were consigned by neighborhood allocation systems, who would \nnot spend the money to get their children out of those schools because \ntheir children's lives and hopes and dreams would be compromised, \nthrough no fault of their own, simply because the schools were not \nadequate to educate them. So this is all about helping some\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nof those students by supporting this amendment to reauthorize the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program 5 more years.\n  I hope and pray what Chancellor Rhee said is right; that in 5 years \nshe can look every parent of every student in the DC Public School \nSystem in the eye and say: Your child is at a school where he or she \ncan get a good education so we don't need the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program anymore. But for now, Chancellor Rhee says we need \nit, Mayor Fenty says we need it, former Mayor Williams--who helped to \ncreate the program--is strongly for it, and a July 2009 poll conducted \nin the District of Columbia says, 75 percent of District residents want \nand need the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  I don't see a reason why a majority of Members of this Senate, \nhopefully an overwhelming bipartisan majority, would speak against \nthis; would frustrate the hopes of all these families, all these \nstudents, and all these leaders of education in the District of \nColumbia. So I am going to yield the floor with the hope that we can \nhave a vote on this soon, and I urge my colleagues to think about the \n1,319 children whose lives will be compromised, whose dreams will be \nstifled if this program is not reauthorized.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller for his patience while we continued on \nthis amendment, and with that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to vehemently oppose Senator \nLieberman's amendment to reauthorize the District of Columbia \nOpportunity Scholarship Program. This amendment would extend a program \nthat impacts fewer than 5 percent of the District's public school \nchildren, and, after more than 5 years in operation, has proved to be \nlittle more than an ineffective exercise in ideologically driven \neducation reform.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program has minimal impact and scant \nevidence of any academic benefit to the students who participate in the \nprogram. It also siphons vital Federal money away from DC families that \nenroll their boys and girls in public schools. I would rather see that \nmoney invested in research-driven, high-impact education initiatives \nthat benefit public schools open to all children. Let's invest more in \nDC's early education programs, so that moms and dads have kids ready \nfor kindergarten when they get there. Let's boost funding for teacher \nrecruitment to bring the best teachers into DC's most challenged \nschools, which can have a tough time recruiting top talent. Let's \ninvest in the renovation and modernization of DC's oldest school \nbuildings, so students and families are guaranteed safe, clean, and \nhealthy learning environments. Let's ramp up funding to improve DC's \nspecial education programs, so that parents aren't forced to send their \nchildren to costly, private special education providers.\n  I can understand why parents would be excited about the opportunity \nto send their child to a private school. I myself am the product of a \nCatholic education. But I cannot reconcile that potential benefit to \nparents with the fact that certain members of Congress believe they can \nact like DC's school board. I believe the District of Columbia should \nhave a voice and a vote in Congress; that they should receive \nstatehood. I believe they should control their own money. And, I \nbelieve that if DC would like to have a voucher program the DC School \nBoard should vote for it and pay for it with local, not Federal, tax \ndollars.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing Senator Lieberman's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to get back to something \ncalled the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. It is \nthe bill we are on. I do not hesitate to say my daughter was one of the \ncofounders of a charter school, very successful, in Washington, DC, but \nI would also say to her, as I would to proponents of this legislation \nwhich is being discussed--vouchers--that in the Federal aviation bill, \nwe are talking about 500 million Americans who fly every year. Not to \ndiminish them nor my daughter's incredible work--1,300 students--that \nfigure is going to rise very shortly to over 1 billion, and therefore \nwhat we do in the Federal aviation bill, which is the pending business, \nis incredibly important.\n  Senator Byron Dorgan has discussed safety issues and other aspects of \nthe legislation and he is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation \nOperations, Safety, and Security, which I was for 10 years before I \nbecame chairman of the full committee, so I care passionately about the \nFederal Aviation Administration bill. I recognize it is not the most \ncolorful, gallant legislation in the history of the world but, believe \nme, it affects every single American. It used to be that only 16 \npercent of Americans fly. Now everybody flies.\n  There is no way to describe how frustrated passengers are, and they \nhave every right to be. This Federal aviation bill, incidentally, has \nbeen extended or laid over 11 different times. Eleven different times \nwe have not been able to get to it, until this day. So I am glad we had \nthe previous discussion and we are going to get to a number of \namendments and vote on them before 6 o'clock this evening, after I \nannounce some agreements that have been already been reached. So \nprogress is being made, and I just wish to see it continue being made.\n  You have to figure that some passengers--not many cases but in some \ncases--have been kept waiting 9 hours on a tarmac. I can't even begin \nto do the body math of 9 hours, but I don't choose to because it is not \npleasant. How does one eat? How does one keep sanity? Presumably, the \nengines are running. If they are, there is air. If they are not, there \nis no air. So it is extremely stuffy. You are without food, you are \nwithout water, you are without facilities and, most important, you are \nwithout any information to know where you are. This is all absolutely \nunacceptable.\n\n  In one little section of the bill, I want to say a couple of the \nthings we do to fix that. This bill requires that air carriers in \ncoordination with airports develop contingency plans to make certain \nthey are prepared for these kinds of delays which will happen and which \ndo happen. As more and more people fly, they will happen more \nfrequently. It is a fact of life.\n  Under our bill, passengers have to have access to water, they have to \nhave access to food, to restroom facilities, and to medical attention. \nThey cannot remain on the tarmac for over 3 hours. I think that is \nstretching it. There is one little caveat which I sort of accept--at \nleast it is in the bill--that if a pilot in his or her judgment \nbelieves that within the next 30 minutes or less they will take off, \nthey do not have to go back to the terminal to disgorge their \npassengers so they can get caught up on water, facilities, medical \nattention, all the rest of it.\n  These are such commonsense protections, but they affect so many \npeople and children. I have five grandchildren. I am trying to think \nwhat my five grandchildren would be acting like after 3 hours on a \nplane that has not gone anywhere. I am trying to imagine that from \nvarious points of view and none of them comes out very favorably, not \none of them.\n  The air carriers will also have to post on their Web site which of \ntheir flights as a matter of their record tend to be delayed, tend to \nbe canceled, tend to be on time, or diverted. That is a matter of \nrecord. It is not doing every one, but those which are likely to do \nthat. That is on the Web site so when the passenger purchases tickets \nthey get that, and that information has to be updated on a monthly \nbasis and it has to be provided to customers before they purchase a \nticket, Web site or no Web site. That is an advance in keeping \npassengers happier.\n  Any air carrier selling a ticket must disclose the actual air \ncarrier. Why do I say that? Because, as Senator Dorgan has said a \nnumber of times, oft you do not know what you are flying on. There is a \nUnited up here, and a Colgan down here, and you don't know what you are \nflying on so you do not know who to hold accountable. We think \naccountability matters so you are told before you get the ticket what \nplane you are going to be flying on--who owns that plane, who flies \nthat plane. So you do not, as I routinely--in West Virginia, this \nSenator--they are all propeller flights with one or two exceptions.\n  Senator Dorgan has also pointed out that 50 percent of all our \naviation in\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nAmerica--and we do fly half the people in the world. We are half the \nworld's air traffic, right in North America. So we have to know whether \nthey are a regional carrier and we have to know the information about \nthem before people buy their ticket.\n  Passengers have been overlooked. They have been dismissed by the \naviation system for so many years because we could get away with it and \neverybody was prospering. But along this time people were suffering, \ngrievously sometimes. I think a lot of people--in fact, I think of a \ncouple of my sisters and some people in my office, who, just when they \nare in an airplane, they change. They get white-knuckled. It is a \ncylinder, and people react in different ways to that. So we need to \ngive passengers all the comfort, the information, and the transparency \nthey can possibly have.\n  I just make that short statement. It is one aspect of our very long \nand comprehensive FAA authorization bill which has been waiting now for \n3 years to reauthorization, and which we wish to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, as the Senator from West Virginia said, \nwe are on the FAA reauthorization bill, that is reauthorizing the \nprograms that deal with aviation safety and air traffic control and \nairport improvement funds and essential air service--all of these \nissues. For the last hour we have been hearing debate about a school \nvoucher program in the District of Columbia. Why would that be the \ncase? Because this is an authorization bill and anyone can come and \noffer any amendment to an authorization bill. So Senator Lieberman and \nthe cosponsors of his amendment are well within their rights to do \nthat. It has nothing at all to do with the bill on the floor of the \nSenate, however.\n  Because we are going to vote on it, however, let me say a few words \nabout it. I have spoken about the FAA reauthorization bill previously \nthis afternoon and will again later, but let me talk for a moment about \nthe issue of school vouchers. First, this is not the place to do it. \nThis is not the place to offer the amendment. They have the right to \noffer the amendment but we are trying to get a bill done here.\n  The rest of the world is moving forward to modernize the aircraft \ncontrol system and we, with the most congested and complicated air \ntraffic control space in the world, we have extended the FAA \nauthorization 11 straight times because we have not been able to get a \nbill done.\n  We will probably have three or four votes today and none of them have \nanything to do with the FAA. I hope we will clear some amendments. \nSenator Rockefeller has been working hard to clear some amendments, but \nthe votes we will have today have to do with earmark reform or school \nvouchers or any number of other subjects, discretionary budget caps, \nhaving nothing to do with the underlying bill. But if we must vote on \nthem, let me at least take a couple of moments to respond to what we \nhave heard for the last hour.\n  I know the people who came here to support the voucher amendment are \nenormously passionate about their support. The amendment is providing \nvouchers paid for by the American taxpayer for about 1,200 students in \nthe District of Columbia, to attend private schools. In short, it \nprovides public funding for certain students to attend private schools.\n  I am a big supporter of education. I believe education is our future. \nI believe when Thomas Jefferson said that anybody who believes a \ncountry can be both ignorant and free believes in something that never \nwas and never can be. I understand that. I think education is the \nbuilding block and foundation for America's future. In fact, it has \nbeen the success of America, that we designed education from the very \nstart differently from many other countries. We said we are going to \nhave a system of public education--public education, that means public \nschools that allow every child to go into that school and come out of \nthat school with whatever their God-given talents allow them to become. \nWe are not going to move people off, in the sixth grade or eighth \ngrade, based on ability. That is not the way we are going to do it. \nEvery child can enter those classrooms and decide to graduate with \nwhatever their God-given talent allows them to achieve in this \neducation system.\n  That is public education. I know people say to me America's schools \ndo not work. Oh, really? Really? If you get to the Moon, anybody, would \nyou please tell me whose bootprints are on the Moon? They are not \nChinese or Russian, they are bootprints made by an American, made \npossible by people who were educated in America's public school system, \nwho helped us to understand the science and math that allowed us to \nlearn to build airplanes and learn to fly them and then build rockets \nand walk on the Moon and plant an American flag on the Moon. Public \neducation has been remarkable for this country.\n  I walked into the oldest House Member's office the first day I came \nto the Congress. His name was Claude Pepper and he had two photographs \nbehind his chair, at his desk, that I have never forgotten. Claude was \nin his mid- or late eighties. One photo was of Orville and Wilbur \nWright making the first airplane flight, December 17, 1903, 59 seconds \noff the ground, the first human-powered flight. The photo was \nautographed ``To Congressman Claude Pepper with deep admiration, \nOrville Wright,'' before Orville died.\n\n  But just behind it was a second photograph of Neil Armstrong stepping \ngently with his boot on the surface of the Moon. I thought to myself, \nwhat is the distance measured between those two photographs? About four \ninches. But think of the distance in education, to learn to fly and fly \nto the Moon. Someone else didn't do that. We did that, with a network \nof public education that says to every kid: You can become whatever \nyour God-given talents allow you to become.\n  Universal education in a system of public schools. Is it perfect? \nCertainly not. Has it worked? You bet. I am so tired of people trashing \npublic schools. I go into a lot of classrooms and I almost never leave \nthe classroom without thinking to myself: What an American hero \nteaching in that classroom. They didn't choose the profession that pays \nthe most, for sure. But that teacher, that man or woman who is teaching \nthose kids, what a remarkable person that is. I always leave classrooms \nfeeling that way.\n  Let me talk about this program very quickly. This program, a voucher \nprogram to create public funding for a certain number of students here \nin the District of Columbia to attend private schools, was established \nas a 5-year pilot program in 2003. That is 7 years ago; a 5-year pilot \nprogram. It has now been extended twice through appropriations bills in \norder to minimize the disruption for students already in the program \nand a plan to wind it down is now in place. Reauthorization is not \nneeded to keep current students in their schools.\n  In my judgment, public dollars should be spent on public schools. \nYes, there are improvements that are needed in public schools. Why \ndon't we invest in those improvements. Here in the District of Columbia \nthey are $40 million short of what is needed. Yet we are using public \ndollars to support vouchers for private schools. I know it is not a lot \nof money but this is a program that, 7 years ago, was authorized for 5 \nyears. It demonstrates how hard it is to shut down any program. At a \ntime when education budgets are being slashed for public schools, we \nought to be directing the money we have in the public domain for public \nschools.\n  Those who wish to attend private schools, they pay private tuition, I \nunderstand that. But our public funding ought to be devoted to \nstrengthen our public schools.\n  Let me talk for a moment about a study that has been done of this \nvoucher program. It has produced very mixed results. The Department of \nEducation did a study that was mandated. After 3 years, no \nstatistically significant achievement impacts were registered for \nstudents coming from the lowest performing schools. The reason that is \nimportant is that was the target of this program, low-performance \nschools, to allow those parents to get those kids out of those schools \nand give them a voucher to go to a private school. What we have \ndiscovered from the Department of Education study is for those very \nschools, the target schools, the lower performing schools, there is no\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nstatistical achievement impact for students who came from those schools \ngoing into this voucher program.\n  Some of my colleagues said you have to give these people a choice and \na chance. How about giving them a choice? The District of Columbia \nalready has choices. There are choices available to parents on where to \nsend their kids. There is a robust public charter school network with \n60 charter schools here in the District of Columbia. Unlike voucher \nschools, public charter schools are open to all students, subject to \nthe same accountability as all other schools, public schools; the same \naccountability standards. So the parents in DC already have some of \nthat flexibility about which schools their children shall attend.\n  This program has not gone through the full committee process since \n2003. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has yet \nto mark up this legislation in this Congress. More important, this \namendment has nothing at all to do with the bill that is on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I do not support this on its merits. I didn't support it in the \nAppropriations Committee. I do not support it now. I believe we ought \nto defeat it at this point, not because I do not support education but \nit is precisely because I support public education that we ought not be \nspooning off money here into a voucher program, taking public funds and \nmoving them into private schools with, as I indicated, very mixed \nresults as reported in a study that was done by the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  I want for our children, for all children, to have the best education \nthey can have. Our public school system has served this country well, \nbut we have a lot of challenges. I will, finally, say this: One of the \nsignificant challenges of the public school system is not that teachers \nare poor teachers; it is not that the school is a bad school; it is, a \nschool inherits virtually everything that exists in that town or that \nneighborhood and has to deal with it. That is just a fact.\n  So it is a challenge sometimes to, in public schools, do all that we \nwant to do. But if we look at a couple of hundred years of history in \nthe United States of America, it is pretty hard to conclude that we, as \nopposed to all other countries, we are the ones with universal \neducation. We are the ones who supported public education. It is pretty \nhard to conclude that we have come up short relative to other \ncountries.\n  Let me make one other point and perhaps boast just for a moment. If \nNorth Dakota were a country and not a State, a country not a State, we \nwould rank second in the world next to Singapore in eighth grade math \nscores.\n  Does good news get reported very often? Not very often. It is just \nbad news that sells. This is an old saying: Bad news travels halfway \naround the world before good news gets its shoes on.\n  We ought to spend a day talking about the good news of education and \nthen spend time as well addressing the challenges because there are \nsome difficulties that we need to address. But I did want to say I am \nnot going to vote for this voucher amendment. I do not think it is the \nright choice. I believe the proper choice is to strengthen public \neducation, address the challenges of public education. We can do that. \nOur parents did it, our grandparents did it, and we can have the same \nkind of impact on our future as they did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Lehman Brothers\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, last Thursday the bankruptcy examiner \nfor Lehman Brothers Holdings, Incorporated released a 2,200-page report \nabout the demise of the firm, which included riveting detail on the \nfirm's accounting practices. That report has put into sharp relief what \nmany have expected all along: that fraud and potential criminal conduct \nwere at the heart of this financial crisis.\n  Now that we are beginning to learn many of the facts, at least with \nrespect to the activities of Lehman Brothers, the country has every \nright to be outraged.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now resume consideration of the DeMint amendment No. 3454, and \nthat at 6 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, \nwith the time until then divided and controlled between Senators Inouye \nand DeMint or their designees; and that upon disposition of amendment \nNo. 3454, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments with 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; and that after the first vote in this \nsequence, the remaining votes be limited to 10 minutes each; and that \nno amendment be in order to any of the amendments in this order, prior \nto a vote in relation thereto; and that in the case where there is a \nmodification, the amendment be so modified with the changes at the \ndesk.\n  The amendments are Feingold amendment No. 3470, as modified; Vitter \namendment No. 3458, as modified; Lieberman amendment No. 3456.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I will not object, but I would like \nto add that Senator Cochran be protected, with Senator Inouye, to have \nsome of the divided time but that it not affect the 6 o'clock \nbeginning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, as modified, are as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3458, as modified\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. COASTAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1356a) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Application requirements; availability of funding.--\n     On approval of a plan by the Secretary under this section, \n     the producing State shall--\n       ``(A) not be subject to any additional application or other \n     requirements (other than notifying the Secretary of which \n     projects are being carried out under the plan) to receive the \n     payments; and\n       ``(B) be immediately eligible to receive payments under \n     this section.''\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3470, as modified\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n  TITLE ___--RESCISSION OF UNUSED TRANSPORTATION EARMARKS AND GENERAL \n                         REPORTING REQUIREMENT\n\n     SEC. _01. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this title, the term ``earmark'' means the following:\n       (1) A congressionally directed spending item, as defined in \n     Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       (2) A congressional earmark, as defined for purposes of \n     Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. _02.

Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I just wanted to say to my \ncolleagues that they need to prepare now for a 6 o'clock vote. Anyone \nwanting to debate will be able to do so within the constraints of the \nresolution that we just passed.\n  Senator Inouye is on the Senate floor. We are expecting Senator \nCochran and Senator DeMint. So I hope if anyone else wants to have time \nwithin those timeframes that they would come to the floor now because I \nwill object to any delay beyond 6 o'clock to start these four votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina is, simply stated, a misguided attempt which would \nturn over the power of the purse to the executive branch. It will not \nsave a penny toward the deficit. It will allow unelected bureaucrats \nwho have no accountability to voters to determine how Federal tax \ndollars are expended instead of the Congress.\n  Despite the protestations of a few Senators and an active media \ncampaign spurred on by well-financed so-called watchdogs, this \namendment is a solution to a problem that does not exist.\n  For the sake of my colleagues who may still want to support a \nmoratorium on earmarks, let me point out where we are at this moment. \nSince retaking the majority in 2006, the Democratic-led Congress has \nreduced funding for earmarks by more than 50 percent.\n  As the new chairman of the appropriations committee last year I vowed \nwith the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative \nObey, that we would continue on the path set by former Chairman Byrd to \nreduce earmarks until they represented less than 1 percent of \ndiscretionary spending.\n  We achieved that objective in the fiscal year 2010 Appropriations \nBills, and we have agreed that we will not exceed 1 percent as long as \nwe are chairmen of our respective committees.\n  If we look at the numbers in 2006, the completed appropriations Acts \nincluded $16.7 billion in what are called ``Non-project Based Earmarks.\n  Madam President, $8.4 billion of these were in defense and the \nremainder in non-defense programs. In the fiscal year 2010 bills, we \nended the year with a total of $8.2 billion in earmarks, $4.1 billion \nin defense and $4.1 billion in non-defense, well below 50 percent of \nthe amount in 2006.\n  As a percentage of discretionary spending, non-project based earmarks \nare hardly \\1/2\\ of 1 percent. Not only have we accomplished our \nobjective, we have exceeded our goal.\n  I am sure others will cite different numbers and try to say that we \nhave many more earmarks than we are counting. The earmark definition \nthat we use for FY 2010 is the one that comes from the Senate rules. \nOther outside groups may want to consider additional congressional \nitems as earmarks, but we can only go by what the Senate has declared \nas earmarks.\n  In summation, let me say this. Since the Democrats have retaken the \nCongress we have reduced earmarks by more than 50 percent. We are well \nbelow 1 percent of total discretionary spending for non-project based \nearmarks, and we will not be going above 1 percent as long as I am \nChairman.\n  As the Senate considers this amendment, I believe it is time we have \nan honest debate about the overall subject of earmarks. What they are \nand what they aren't.\n  First and foremost, earmarks have nothing to do with the deficit. And \nlet me say that another way to make sure everyone understands.\n  If we eliminate all earmarks this year or forever, it will not save a \nnickel in Federal spending. Not a dime. Not this year, next year, or \never.\n  So to continue on this theme, if we adopt the amendment from the \nsenator from South Carolina, we won't save a penny in fiscal year 2010 \nor fiscal year 2011. We just change who gets to decide what we spend.\n  The definition of an earmark is to carve out funding from a budget \nfor a specific purpose. It is not adding to the budget. When we specify \nthat we want an agency to spend a portion of its budget on a specific \nitem we aren't increasing that agency's budget, we are simply \nreallocating funding within the budget for that purpose.\n  If that is not completely understood let's look at it this way. The \npresident submits his request to the Congress for funding by agency and \nbudget functions.\n  Our budget committee reviews the funding requested and tells the \nappropriations committee how much funding it can spend in the budget \nresolution.\n  The budget resolution makes no assumptions about earmarks. It doesn't \ndesignate earmark levels in any way, shape or form.\n  The appropriations committee then divides the total funding provided \nin the budget resolution among its subcommittees.\n  The committee doesn't increase an allocation for earmarks, nor does \nit reduce the allocation if earmarks are not funded.\n  Instead it provides the subcommittee with a total amount it can \nspend. For example, the Foreign Operations subcommittee usually chooses \nnot to proide earmarks. That doesn't change the amount of spending the \nsubcommittee provides.\n  If the Senate adopts this amendment it will dictate that the fiscal \nyear 2011 there will be no earmarks, but the budget committee won't be \nreducing the allocation to the appropriations committee. The \nappropriations committee won't reduce the subcommittee allocations. We \nwill just defer to the executive branch to determine how taxpayer funds \nare spent.\n  So this debate like all others on the issue of earmarks is who gets \nto determine how taxpayer funds are allocated, the congress or the \nExecutive Branch?\n  All my colleagues are aware that the Constitution requires the \nCongress to determine where our Nation's funds should be spent. There \ncan be no argument on that.\n  Why then do a handful of members persist in advocating the \nelimination of the congressional discretion to allocate funds?\n  Some raise the factor of corruption. We are all too aware the role \nthat earmarks played in the corruption and eventual conviction of one \nRepublican member of the House of Representatives.\n  While other corruption has swept other Members of the House, little \nof that had to do with earmarks. It has involved paid vacations or \ngifts. It has had to do with sweetheart deals in legislation, or \npossible bribes for legislative favors.\n  Moreover, the appropriations committee has enacted reforms to \nminimize any possible chance of corruption by increasing transparency.\n  As Chairman I now require members to place all of their earmarks on \ntheir website 30 days before we act upon their requests.\n  We then post all earmarks that are to be included in appropriations \nbills on the committee's website 24 hours before the full committee \ntakes action on the bill.\n  Furthermore, as directed under Senate Rules, we require each Senator \nto certify that he or she has no pecuniary interest in any earmark that \nis requested.\n  We cannot legislate morality. What we can do and have done, however, \nis to put safeguards in place to ensure that our actions are above \nboard, transparent, and in the best interest of our constituents.\n  Clearly if this amendment were to become law it would change who does \nthe earmarking, not whether earmarks are done.\n  On February 1, the President submitted his appropriations requests to \nthe Congress. The staff of the appropriations committee has begun its \ndetailed examination of that request.\n  My colleagues should know that our review by the staff and the \nmembers of our subcommittees takes months to complete. However, in our \npreliminary review of the budget we have discovered that the President \nhas requested earmarks totalling $25 billion.\n  This is a conservative estimate of the executive branch's earmarks \nand it\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nuses the same criteria as we would use to identify a congressional \nspending earmark, specific location or entity, noncompetitive award, \nand specific dollar amount.\n  In this first assessment, we find that the administration request \nexceeds congressional earmarks that were approved last year by more \nthan 100 percent, twice as much.\n  This amendment would do nothing to stop the practice of earmarking, \nbut rather only eliminate the congressional influence in that process.\n  But for those who want to persist in championing this amendment as a \nreform, they should seriously think about the following information.\n  Last week, the democratic leadership of the House Appropriations \nCommittee announced that they no longer would include earmarks done on \nbehalf of for-profit entities, that means for all practical purposes, \nprivate companies.\n  The reaction from the lobbying community and other interested parties \nwas swift.\n  According to a March 11 Washington Post article:\n\n       Lobbyists said a prohibition against for profit earmarks \n     will shift their focus from Capitol Hill to the Federal \n     agencies.\n\n  Mr. Alan Chvotkin, a lobbyist for the Professional Services Council, \nwas also quoted saying:\n\n       There will be greater attention focused on protecting \n     programs in the President's Budget.\n\n  Lobbyists and oversight organizations both agree--the lobbyists will \nsimply go around the Congress and attempt to get their earmarks in the \nPresident's Request.\n  A story that appeared in the March 11 edition of Roll Call reports \nthat Bill Allison of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, which \nadvocates for government transparency, said earmarks should remain in \nappropriations bills.\n\n       ``The dangerous earmarkers are those going underground,'' \n     Mr. Allison said. ``The real solution is to make them \n     transparent.''\n\n  Instead of banning earmarks, Mr. Allison said Congress should focus \non creating a centralized place for the public to see who is requesting \nearmarks and an easily navigable process for following an earmark from \nstart to finish.\n  Let me say for the record we already do that.\n  And finally, this from Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense, \nan organization that has been outspoken in its criticism of the \nappropriations committee.\n  In a March 10 Congressional Quarterly article, she said:\n\n       Any ban on spending defined as earmarks could end up \n     increasing the practice of securing funding without formally \n     requesting an earmark. I would be concerned that some \n     earmarks might just migrate to the appropriations bills as \n     committee adds.\n\n  If it weren't so serious it would be almost laughable. Under this \namendment, we won't eliminate earmarks, we will only eliminate our \nrole, a role the Constitution has assigned to the Congress.\n  Moreover, all our efforts at making earmarks more transparent would \nbe rendered moot.\n  The reforms we have implemented, which ensured full and open \ndisclosure of who sponsors earmarks, as well as who has given money to \nthose sponsoring earmarks, would be irrelevant.\n  Instead, we will have these decisions made by unelected bureaucrats \nin back rooms of agencies scattered all over this city. Is this the \ntransparency that earmark opponents desired? I think not.\n  I don't understand why those who are the most opposed to the policies \nof the current president are so intent on putting additional power into \nhis hands and those who serve the Executive Branch. Article I of the \nConstitution states very clearly:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     consequence of appropriations made by law.\n\n  The DeMint amendment tramples on the framework established by our \nfounding fathers. In fact, James Madison believed the power of the \npurse to be the most important power of congress. He called it ``The \nmost complete and effectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm \nthe immediate representatives of the people.''\n  I want all my colleagues to understand what we are doing today. I \nwant everyone watching this body on the television to understand what \nwe are doing today, so that in the future, no one can say, ``I didn't \nknow.''\n  This amendment shifts the power to designate the expenditure of and \naccountability for taxpayers' hard earned dollars away from the \nrepresentatives they elected, to the Executive Branch, where unelected \nbureaucrats who are accountable to no taxpayer will make the decisions \nof where those dollars will be spent.\n  There were indeed corruptions in the earmark process in the past. No \none will dispute that. A Republican member of the House was convicted \nfor corruption related to earmarking.\n  But we as Democrats addressed that issue when we came into power. We \nimplemented reforms which ensured full and open disclosure of who \nsponsors earmarks, as well as who has given money to those sponsoring \nearmarks. It is all outlined for the world to see.\n  Now with this amendment, not only is transparency in the Congress not \ncontinued, but we are shifting the decisionmaking related to billions \nof dollars--which is another way of saying earmarking--to unelected \nbureaucrats.\n  As I said, now with this amendment, not only is transparency in the \nCongress not continued, but we are shifting the decision-making related \nto billions of dollars--which is another way of saying earmarking--to \nunelected bureaucrats that do not have to post anything about their \nrelationships to recipients, who they meet with, when they meet with \nthem, or who bought them dinner. None of those reporting requirements \napply to unelected bureaucrats.\n  I am a strong proponent of earmarks. I am proud to sponsor earmarks \nthat meet the needs of my constituents. Like every other Member of this \nbody, I believe I understand the needs of my State better than the \nbureaucrats downtown do. I am closer to the people of Hawaii and I owe \nmy allegiance to them.\n  I will continue to support earmarks for Hawaii as I will support the \nlegitimate earmarks from other members of this institution.\n  The founders of our great Nation in their wisdom correctly placed the \npower of the purse in the hands of our elected legislators.\n  Those who seek to overturn that decision by placing artificial \nconstraints on our ability to carry out that mandate are ultimately \nundermining our Nation's freedoms. They would create a system where \nthere is no accountability to the voter on how their tax dollars are \nspent.\n  This amendment is one of many this institution has faced and will \ncontinue to face that seeks to alter the way taxpayer funds are \nallocated.\n  Perhaps unwittingly, but if enacted it would turn over spending \ndecisions to the executive branch and weaken our separation of powers. \nWe should not tolerate that.\n  Finally, to remind my colleagues, this amendment won't save a nickel. \nIt has no impact on the deficit. The amendment serves no purpose other \nthan to take away the Congress's right to determine how funds are \nallocated. I urge all my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Hawaii has \nexpired.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank you very much and I hope this \namendment is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I understand we have time allocated to \nthis side of the aisle, and the Senator from South Carolina has agreed \nto yield me a few minutes, and then he is going to close up debate \nafter I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. He is a friend of mine. He is a distinguished \nSenator. He makes an impact here in the Senate that is very impressive. \nBut I think his proposal to impose a virtual moratorium on \ncongressionally directed spending is not in the public's interest.\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\n  Some Senators who support the amendment voted earlier this year \nagainst creation of a deficit reduction commission and against pay-as-\nyou-go rules. They argued that those initiatives were merely fig leaves \nand might make Congress feel good, but would not serve any useful \npurpose and might actually operate against our effort to reduce the \nnational debt.\n  This amendment also may make you feel good, feel like you are doing \nsomething to reduce spending, but in reality, it does not accomplish \nthat goal. Earmarking has nothing to do with how much the Federal \nGovernment spends, but it has everything to do with who decides how the \nFederal Government spends.\n  The DeMint amendment applies to earmarks in any bill--whether it is \nauthorizing legislation, tax bills, or appropriations bills. The \nAppropriations Committee drafts bills that conform to the discretionary \nspending levels established in the annual budget resolution. If it is \nthe will of the Congress, as expressed in the budget resolution, to \nincrease domestic spending by 5 percent, the Appropriations Committee \nproduces bills to conform to that level of spending. If the will of the \nSenate is to cut discretionary spending below a certain level, the \ncommittee will do that as well.\n  In any case, the committee allocates the discretionary amounts of \nfunding for Federal programs as provided in the budget resolution. We \nalso review the President's budget request, the levels of funding in \nprior years, and other considerations that are important. We meet with \nmany outside groups during the annual hearing process. We review the \nrequests for funding of every government agency in the executive \nbranch. We also consider the priorities expressed by Members of the \nSenate. Some come to our hearings and testify as witnesses. We have an \nannual series of hearings reviewing every Department's budget requests \nand the agencies that operate within those Departments.\n  We subject the entire process to careful scrutiny. The Senate as a \nwhole is involved as they want to be in negotiations with the other \nbody, letting us know what their views are, and what we should argue \nfor during conferences with the House. In disagreements with the \nadministration, the Congress really has the power for the final say-so.\n  We do not all agree on the spending levels approved in the budget \nresolution. The Senator from South Carolina and I are likely to agree \nthat the discretionary spending level approved for fiscal year 2010 was \ntoo high. But the level of spending is not the question before us. The \nquestion proposed by the DeMint amendment is whether Congress will \nallow the executive branch to make 100 percent of all the decisions \nabout how spending is allocated or whether Congress will preserve its \nconstitutional prerogative to appropriate funds for the purposes it \ndeems meritorious.\n  There are many outstanding civil servants within the executive branch \nwho do their best to manage in a careful way Federal funds in a \nprofessional manner. But those persons are not necessarily familiar \nwith the interests of the people in our respective States and with the \nneeds of those we represent.\n  It is naive to think that political considerations are not going to \nbe a part of the executive branch decisionmaking process. History \nbelies the notion that executive branch judgment with regard to \nspending is superior to the legislative branch.\n  Are my colleagues happy with the way stimulus funding has been spent, \nunfettered by congressional earmarks? Will western Senators be \ncomfortable appropriating lump sums of money to the Department of the \nInterior for land acquisition not knowing what lands will be acquired? \nInspector general reports arrive almost weekly describing wasteful and \nsometimes fraudulent spending by executive branch agencies.\n  Some may think executive branch spending decisions are entirely merit \nbased, immune from political pressure and lapses in judgment. But they \nare not. That is one of the reasons I am not willing to cede every \nspending decision to the executive branch. I am not talking about \npolitical party-driven decisions, but I am not willing to concede \nsuperior public interests in the executive branch as compared with the \nlegislative branch. I think the people of my State are entitled to be \nrepresented by advocates of projects that are important to the \ninterests of their State. The programs and legislation that benefit our \nState they want me to support, and they want it to be in the best \ninterests of my State and the country.\n  Each Member has to make his or her own analysis of each bill based on \nthe entirety of its contents, the Member's views and background, his or \nher view of the national interest. So the presence or absence of \nearmarks is not the determining factor in the quality of the \nlegislative process.\n  Every piece of legislation we consider in the Senate affects all of \nour citizens, communities, and industries in different ways. The bill \ncurrently before the Senate, which is the FAA authorization bill, has \nmany provisions of particular interest and benefit to communities and \nsectors of the aviation community.\n  Madam President, I know the time is limited, and I do not want to \nprolong the debate. I do not question the motives of any Senator in \nthis legislative process. Actions that we are taking are driven by \nnotions of what is in the best interests of the country. We just happen \nto disagree, and I strongly disagree with this amendment.\n  Should we throw up our hands and say: This is a tough job, and let's \nturn it over to the executive branch; let's respect their decisions, \nforget our own interests in our States, and our own individual \nbackgrounds and experience? Of course not. That would be an abdication \nof our responsibilities as Senators.\n  So the solution is to adopt an aggressive budget resolution; consider \nall spending and tax bills in a transparent fashion; subject them to \npublic, careful scrutiny; allow Members to propose amendments on any \nand all provisions of any and all appropriations bills. When they judge \nit to be wasteful, vote against it. Cut the spending or approve it. In \nany case, do what each individual Senator thinks is in the public \ninterest, unfettered by makeshift budget restraints that accomplish \nnothing except shift power from the Congress to the Executive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina. Mr. DeMINT. \nThank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from Mississippi and--\n--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would you be willing to give me 2 minutes? That is all I \nneed. I want to say and make sure everyone understands this. I have a \ntotally different argument against this. I happen to be ranked as the \nmost conservative Member of the Senate, and all you are trying to do \nwith this thing--all you will end up doing, if you are successful, is \ngiving all this to the executive branch.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well----\n  Mr. DeMINT. All the time so far----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. All the time so far has been used----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for a unanimous consent request, please.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If the Senator will yield, all the time so far has been \nyielded to those who oppose the bill. As I understand it, the time will \nbe cut off at 6, and I will use that remaining time.\n  I do want to thank the appropriators, the Senator from Mississippi, \nall of those who work for the entire Senate to do what the Members ask \nas far as to look out for their States, and I do not call into account \ntheir motives at all. But I think as Members of the Senate we have to \nask ourselves: Is the way we are doing this working?\n  We can have all the theoretical arguments we want. But what we have \nis trillions of dollars of debt, many wasteful projects. The trust in \nour government is at an all-time low, and the earmarks we are sending \nout all across the\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\ncountry are mostly now with borrowed money.\n  So we can talk about our theories all we want, but what we are doing \nis not working, and perception is reality. With all of our debt, the \ncorruption, the waste, every American has a right to question what we \nare doing right now. Clearly, if it is a constitutional responsibility \nfor all of us to be here to get money for our States, somehow for the \nfirst 200 years of our country that was missed because even a few years \nago Ronald Reagan would veto a bill with less than a couple hundred \nearmarks in it because of all the pork and waste. But now we are in the \nthousands and tens of thousands. It is out of control. The waste and \nthe fraud and the abuse is so obvious that it is time we see it in the \nSenate.\n  If you look at the Constitution, a couple of principles are clear. \nThey expect uniformity across the States, nonpreferential treatment, \nand that is not what happens with earmarks. Folks, we have to admit, \nwhile a lot of the proponents of earmarks will say it is a small part \nof our total budget, that is like looking at a long train that covers a \nwhole mile and saying the engine is just a small part of that train. \nBut the engine is what pulls the whole train, and earmarks are what \npull through a lot of spending and a lot of borrowing.\n  Just going back 1 year, the big bailout bill--almost a trillion \ndollars--failed to pass the House, and then they added earmarks and it \npassed. Following that was a stimulus bill, a candy store of earmarks. \nAfter that, the omnibus bill with thousands of earmarks that sailed \nthrough the Congress, and even the health care bill. With the \n``Nebraska kickback,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' Americans now know \nthat we buy votes with earmarks.\n  Isn't it time we just take a timeout for 1 year and see if we can \nreform this system? Some of the reforms people are talking about that \nwe have been talking about for years that we have not done--it is time \nto admit what we are doing is not working.\n  In the House of Representatives, yesterday, the Republicans led the \nway. They do not agree on how to deal with earmarks long term, but they \nagreed that it is enough of a problem that they decided to take a 1-\nyear moratorium on earmarks. The House Republican Conference voted to \neliminate earmarks for 1 year. It gives us a chance to take a timeout \nto try to work on this.\n  As to the argument that if we do not do earmarks, the administration \nwill do it, folks, we have every power here by the way we appropriate \nto disallow the use of funds for certain things. We could not only here \ndo what we are supposed to do, which is pass bills that provide funding \nfor programs, and then provide the oversight for the administration--\nand we require they only use the funds in a nonpreferential, formula-\nbased way or competitive grants or bids--we have every way to restrain \nthe way the administration uses the funds that we appropriate. Then \nwhat would happen is, we would resist big spending bills because we did \nnot have our parochial interests, our conflicts of interest to get \nmoney for our States.\n  Senators, we are not here to get money for our States. We are here as \nrepresentatives of our States in the United States of America, and we \nput up our hands and say: We are going to defend and protect the \nConstitution that is about the general welfare of America. We cannot \ncontinue to come here every day and talk about our unsustainable debt, \nand then say: I have to have $1 million for my museum or my local sewer \nplant when, in fact, this is borrowed money.\n  We do not have the money we need to keep the promises to seniors we \nhave made for Social Security and Medicare and to defend our country. \nYet we spend most of the year trying to get earmarks for our local \ncommunities so we can do a press release, so we can talk about bringing \nhome the bacon.\n  So we can talk about how a lot of these projects may have merit, but \nwhat doesn't have merit is when we forgo the interests of our Nation, \nthe general welfare of our people, so that we can do our press releases \non our tens of thousands of earmarks.\n  It is time to bring it to a close, at least for 1 year. The House has \ntaken a bold stand, at least on the Republican side. Let's vote to take \na timeout on earmarks, try to get our house in order, re-earn the trust \nof the American people, and stop putting this debt on the shoulders of \nour children.\n  We have a chance in a few minutes to vote on a moratorium of earmarks \nfor 1 year. This is the very least we can do for the people of the \nUnited States of America. All of these arguments we can push aside. \nWhat America thinks right now is true. There is a connection between \nthe waste, the fraud, the abuse, the debt, the borrowing, and earmarks. \nThere is no question about it.\n  I implore my colleagues: Set aside the self-interests for one vote. \nLet's do what is best for our country and vote for a 1-year timeout on \nearmarks.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, could I ask unanimous consent to have 15 \nseconds----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from West \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a \nresponse.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and \nhope it is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes debate equally divided \nprior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3470, offered by the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Feingold-Coburn-Sherrod Brown-\nMcCain-McCaskill amendment rescinds any earmarks that have sat on the \nshelf at the Department of Transportation for more than 10 years \nwithout more than 10 percent of it being obligated or spent. It also \nrequires a report by the OMB on how many of these old,\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nunspent earmarks are at all Federal agencies. This would save an \nestimated $626 million in the first year and more down the road as \nother unused earmarks hit the 10-year milestone.\n  I know many Senators support transportation spending to create jobs \nand deal with crumbling infrastructure, as do I. But these unused and \noften unwanted earmarks do nothing to create jobs and fix roads.\n  The Bush administration supported the amendment, and the Obama \nadministration and Chairwomen Boxer and Murray support the amendment. I \nhope it is adopted easily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield my 1 minute to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to make one \nstatement on the DeMint amendment that was just defeated. I have to say \nthis, as the person who was most recently characterized as the most \nconservative Member of the Senate: If there is anyone out there who \nthinks that was a conservative vote on earmarks, they are wrong. There \nhas never been one case where an earmark has saved one penny that has \nbeen reduced.\n  I have to say this: Senator DeMint had $70 million worth of highway \nearmarks that were in the amendment that we are talking about right \nnow.\n  Real quickly: The Feingold amendment does not reduce the deficit one \npenny. Because of environmental laws and other things, the CBO and the \nadministration have said the average time for a highway project is 13 \nyears. For example, in my State of Oklahoma, Highway 40--a huge \nproject--was started in 1991.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHutchison and Landrieu be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in 2005 we passed the CF program, which is \nrevenue sharing for States, for coastal conservation and other \npurposes. Unfortunately, that money has been very slow to get to \nStates. Only 15 percent that was supposed to have been distributed by \nnow has been. This amendment helps fix that. It does not spend new \nmoney, it does not increase the deficit.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague in supporting this \namendment. We have modified it from the original version. No \nenvironmental laws will be ignored. The process will be followed. But \nthis amendment would simply expedite getting money to the Gulf Coast \nStates and to other States that benefit from this program. I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is completely unrelated \nto the FAA reauthorization legislation. It deals with a matter that is \nin the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee. It would make, in my view, \ninappropriate changes to a program that provides assistance to six \ncoastal States.\n  I oppose the amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it as well. In \nmy view, it will dilute the authority of the Secretary of Interior to \nproperly oversee and ensure the accountability for the funds that are \nbeing spent in these programs.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, with regard to this technical point of \norder, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \nsection 4(G)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to \nwaive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget \nresolutions for purposes of my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The managers do have a managers' \npackage; they are going to clear it tonight.\n  Tomorrow morning after the Senate convenes at 9:30 a.m., we are \nslated to complete action on Job 1, so Senators should expect up to two \nrollcall votes at that time.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, at 2 p.m. tomorrow there is going to \nbe a live quorum so that we can receive the House managers with respect \nto the impeachment proceedings. Therefore, all Members are urged to be \nin the Chamber at 2 p.m. so that proceedings can be expedited.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3456\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3456 offered by \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment \nintroduced by Senators Collins, Burr, Voinovich, Feinstein, Ensign, and \nmyself. It would benefit schoolchildren in the District of Columbia, \nreauthorizing a program we created 7 years ago now that has worked: $20 \nmillion to the DC public schools, $20 million to charter schools, and \n$20 million to the Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  The last part is the controversial part. But it should not be. As \nSenator Feinstein said in her remarks on this amendment, what is there \nin this amendment to be afraid of? It has helped 1,300 economically \ndisadvantages children to have an opportunity to get out of a public \nschool that the Chancellor of the DC Public Schools says is not working \nfor them.\n  This measure is supported by Mayor Fenty, Chancellor Michelle Rhee, a \nmajority of the members of the DC Public Schools, and it has been \njudged by an independent evaluator to be the most effective program of \nits kind in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, this program has never been \nauthorized. It was only put into an appropriations bill in 2003. It was \nextended once.\n  We had the Department of Education, not this one, the previous one, \nand this one, do studies of whether this was successful. After 3 years, \nno statistically significant achievement impacts were observed for \nstudents who came from the lowest performing schools--which was the \ntarget of the program--or for students who entered the program \nacademically behind. No achievement impacts were found for male \nstudents, and there was no statistically significant impact on math \nscores. Already DC parents have a choice. We have over 60 charter \nschools here in the District of Columbia, and it is growing all the \ntime. So there is a choice for them to go to charter schools which are \npublic schools open to everyone and they do not discriminate.\n  So, again, there is no reason for this authorization. The kids who \nare in those schools on those vouchers can continue. There is no \nproblem with that. But why open it for vouchers when we have got the \ncharter schools building up here?\n  I might add the chairman of the Committee also, Senator Rockefeller, \nopposes the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Conversion of lost eligibility airports.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce an amendment along \nwith Senators Reid, Ensign and Kyl to clarify the Grand Canyon \nOverflights Act of 1987 that sought to restore the natural quiet of the \ncanyon from commercial air tour overflights. After 23 years of numerous \nrulemakings by the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, and a lawsuit in 2002, it is now time to move forward \nto ensure that the 5 million visitors to the Grand Canyon can enjoy its \nmajestic beauty by air or by foot without excessive noise from \ncommercial air tour operators.\n  Specifically, this amendment would set forth in statute the \n``substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the \nGrand Canyon'' is achieved if for at least 75 percent of each day--\nbetween 7 a.m. and 7 p.m--50 percent of the park is free from the sound \nproduced by commercial air tour operations. Additionally, the amendment \nprovides curfews for overflights, particularly during the peak visitor \nseason, so many visitors can enjoy the grand sunset at the Grand Canyon \nrelatively free from overflight noise.\n  The amendment also sets forth curfews and reduced flight allocations \nfor specific parts of the canyon that are particularly special for many \nvisitors, including the Dragon Corridor on the west rim in the vicinity \nof Hermits Rest and Dripping Spring, the Zuni Point Corridor that \nincludes the area known as ``Snoopy's Nose,'' and Marble Canyon. I have \nmany fond memories of hiking the canyon with my sons, most recently \njust last year, and I hope all Americans are able to enjoy the beauty \nof the canyon without the interference of excessive noise from air \ntours. I believe this amendment allows without waiting another 23 years \nfor progress.\n  Over the past few years, there have been strong improvements in quiet \ntechnology for aircraft. I am pleased that several of the air tour \noperators that provide air tours at the Grand Canyon have migrated to \nquiet technology aircraft. This amendment would mandate the conversion \nto quiet technology for all air tour operations within 15 years of \nenactment. Additionally, this amendment provides numerous incentives \nfor operators to convert to quiet technology, including a reduced park \nentrance fee and increased flight allocations for aircraft that utilize \nquiet technology.\n  Lastly, this amendment requires the FAA to review flight allocations \nfor air tour operators serving the Grand Canyon. These allocations have \nnot been reviewed since 2001 and are based on 1990s data. Tourism is \nessential to Arizona's economic recovery. Over 37 million visitors came \nto Arizona in 2008 generating over $2.5 billion in tax revenues. There \nare over 300,000 jobs in Arizona that are tied to tourism in Arizona, \nand we must ensure that these jobs continue to exist and grow.\n  Over 5 million tourists, hikers and adventure seekers visited the \nGrand Canyon in 2008. These visitors have also contributed millions of \ndollars to the great States of Arizona and Nevada, in addition to the \nlocal communities surrounding the Grand Canyon. We must ensure that \nthese visitors have the ability to view the canyon by air if they wish \nto do so, but in a manner that maintains ``natural quite'' for those \nvisiting the canyon by foot. I think this amendment achieves that goal.\n  Again, I am proud to have the support of Senators Reid, Ensign, and \nKyl who share my commitment to continuing the progress that has been \nmade toward establishing ``natural quiet'' at the Grand Canyon, while \ncontinuing to ensure that its majesty is available to be viewed by air \nfor those who wish to do so. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the FAA bill we are considering contains \nimportant new changes in both the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise \nProgram, DBE, and the Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise, ACDBE, program. While we have made progress, discrimination \nin airport related business remains pervasive. Both of these programs \nare critical to our Nation's efforts to level the playing field in \nairport related contracting.\n  Over the past couple of years, both in my role on the Commerce \nCommittee and Aviation Subcommittee and in my former role as chairman \nof the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nreceived an enormous amount of evidence about the ongoing existence of \nrace and gender discrimination against minority and\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nwomen owned businesses. Discrimination impacts every aspect of the \ncontracting process, every major industry category and hurts all types \nof disadvantaged business owners including African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and women. Here in the \nCongress, we have received a great deal of evidence about the \ndiscrimination that specifically impacts minority and women owned \nbusinesses in the airport business context. In September of 2008 the \nCommittee on Small Business heard testimony from diverse perspectives \nabout the ongoing problem of discrimination in lending and access to \ncapital across the disadvantaged business perspective, including \ndiscrimination against minority and women businesses in airport related \nbusiness issues. In March of 2009, the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure conducted an extensive hearing \nfocused on the DBE and ACDBE programs. They heard testimony about \ndiscrimination and needed program improvements from the administration, \nresearchers, advocates and minority and women businesses themselves. \nAnd the Senate Aviation subcommittee itself received similar testimony \nand evidence in our May 2009 hearing--including a large number of \ndisparity studies outlining extremely compelling statistical testimony \nof discrimination in airport related contracting.\n  The present day effects of past discrimination, and ongoing current \ndiscrimination, continue to be barriers to minority and women owned \nbusinesses. Even in the context of the highest constitutional scrutiny \nrequired by the Supreme Court, this powerful evidence of discrimination \nmakes the maintenance of these programs imperative and constitutional. \nIt also makes all the more important the changes we have proposed to \nimprove the programs--adjusting the personal net worth cap for \ninflation, prohibiting excessive and discriminatory bonding, and \nimproving certification training. The disturbing fact is, \ndiscrimination is still a major impediment to the formation, growth and \nsuccess of minority and women business owners. That is unacceptable. \nRace and gender discrimination are bad for minority and women business \nowners, bad for our economy and morally wrong. With this bill, we are \nseeking to remedy that wrong in the FAA context.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, due to a meeting at the White House today, \nI regret I was unable to make the vote on the motion to table the \nDeMint amendment No. 3454 to H.R. 1586, the legislative vehicle for FAA \nreauthorization.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to tell you a tale about \nthe Klamath Basin. It is really two stories about the Klamath Basin. \nOne is of a terrific vision that has come together between fishermen \nand ranchers and tribes, and the second is a story about a terrible \ndrought. So I want to start with the good news and share a little bit \nof the vision.\n  First, let me tell you about the magical place that is the Klamath \nBasin. It is in southern Oregon and northern California. It is an area \nof the country that is rich with agricultural resources and exceptional \nwildlife populations. The basin contains approximately 1,400 family \nfarms and ranches and encompasses over 200,000 acres of farmland \nirrigated with water from the Klamath River and Klamath Lake.\n  In 2009, the basin's agricultural industry produced over $440 million \nin revenue. The Klamath is sometimes referred to as the ``Western \nEverglades.'' The basin attracts 80 percent of the Pacific Flyway's \nwaterfowl and supports the largest over-wintering population of bald \neagles anywhere in the Lower 48 States. It is also home to one of the \nmost productive salmon river systems in the country.\n  Let me tell you that the allocation of water in this basin has always \nbeen a source of enormous tension between the farmers and ranchers, the \nfishermen--both the instream fishermen and the offshore fishermen--and \nthe tribes. These groups that have traditionally been in contest with \neach other have come together over the last few years to say that this \nsituation--the uncertainty about water and the poor health of the \nriver--is not sustainable into the future; that all of us could \nbenefit, all of the parties could benefit, if we worked together for a \ndifferent vision, for a vision that shared a little more regularity \nwith water, that took out some dams that increased the water flow, that \nhad colder water for the salmon, that avoided some of the terrible \ncalamities that occurred, including the worst die-off of fish we have \nhad in the United States of America that happened about a decade ago.\n  So these stakeholders have developed a collaborative agreement and \nsigned it, called the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement or KBRA. That \nagreement is designed to benefit farmers and ranchers as well as the \nKlamath tribe and fishermen up and down the west coast by offering more \ncertainty about access to water. At the same time, it restores the \nriver and improves habitat and riverflows for native fish species and \nwildlife refuges.\n  The development of the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement is a \nhistoric step forward for the region. If it were already in place, it \nwould provide a powerful set of collaborative tools for dealing with \ndrought, for dealing with years when there is a shortage of water. But \nCongress has not yet acted and those tools are not in place.\n  That brings us to this current year and the second half of the story. \nTo help me address that, I am going to put up a chart in the Chamber.\n  This black line on the chart shows what had been the lowest level of \nKlamath Lake since it has been recorded in Oregon history--the lowest \nlevel, which is shown by the black line. This red line represents the \nlevel of the lake this year. As you can readily see, the level of the \nlake is far below the worst ever year that had been recorded--the \ncalamity of 1992. These red dots on the chart represent the level the \nlake needs to be to provide irrigation water to farmers. There is no \nconceivable way we are going to get from this red line, as shown on the \nchart, to these red dots in order to provide water in the normal \nfashion. That is why we are facing such a calamity this year.\n  With spring planting season already upon us, it is critical that we \ntake immediate action to respond to this crisis. We have the advantage \nof tracking this and knowing the crisis is coming. So together we can \nwork to mitigate the worst effects of the drought rather than waiting \nfor the drought to simply play itself out.\n  A drought of this magnitude requires an unprecedented, integrated, \nexpansive set of responses from the Federal agencies and a dedicated \neffort to coordinate response efforts along with local and State \ngovernments. Along with Senator Wyden, I have requested the Departments \nof Agriculture, Interior, and Commerce to dedicate all required \nresources to address this crisis swiftly. My team has been working with \nthe teams at those Departments, and they are making a lot of progress. \nBut we have to continue pushing forward as fast and as quickly as \npossible.\n  There are several key strategies that could help address this: first, \nacquiring upstream water rights from willing sellers to increase the \namount of water that is available in the Klamath Basin; second, to \npursue extensive flexibility within the boundaries of law and science \nto utilize surface water in the most effective possible manner; third, \nhelp farmers activate emergency drought wells and otherwise access \nground water; and fourth, set up crop idling programs to conserve \nwater.\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\n  The worst thing we can do is simply stand by, watch farmers plant \ntheir crops, and then watch those crops fail. So I want to say now that \nthere is a big compliment owed to the Departments of Agriculture, \nCommerce, and Interior for their prompt and engaged action. I know \nSenator Wyden and I will stay equally engaged. It is no exaggeration to \nsay that without Federal assistance and cooperation with local and \nState officials, the impending drought will result in disaster for \nKlamath Basin communities.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \nnature of the economy today, the cause of the very deep recession we \nare currently in, and what I think we have to do about it.\n  Right now, our country is experiencing the worst economy since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s. While officially unemployment is 9.7 \npercent, the reality is that we have some 19 percent of our people who \nare either unemployed or underemployed, people who would like to work \n40 hours a week but they are only working 20 or 30 hours a week.\n  The crisis we are addressing today is magnified by the reality that \nthe recession for the middle class and working families of this country \ndid not just begin in the fall of 2008 with the financial crisis. In \nfact, the middle class has been collapsing for a very long time.\n  During the Bush administration, over 8 million Americans slipped out \nof the middle class and into poverty. Today, some 40 million Americans \nare living in poverty. During the Bush years, median household income \ndeclined by over $2,100. Middle-class Americans earned more income in \n1999 than they did in 2008, and middle-class men earned more money in \n1973 than they did in 2008, with inflation being accounted for.\n  When we look at people in this country who are angry, there is the \nreason. After working long and hard hours, tens of millions of \nAmericans find themselves in worse economic shape today than they were \nin 10 years ago or even 20 years ago. Meanwhile, while the middle class \nshrinks and poverty increases, while more and more people lose their \nhealth insurance--so today we have 46 million with no health insurance \nat all--while 4 million American workers have lost their pension over \nthe last 9 years, we continue to see in this country the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth. That \ngrowing inequality is a moral obscenity, but it is a very serious \neconomic problem as well. Because we become a nation in which very few \nhave a whole lot, while a whole lot of people have very little.\n\n  The immediate recession was caused, as I think everybody knows, by \nthe greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior of a small number \nof giant financial institutions on Wall Street. These people were not \ncontent to be making 40 percent of the profits being made in America. \nTheir CEOs were not content to earn bonuses of tens of millions of \ndollars a year. The hedge funds were not content to have their owners \nand managers become billionaires. No, that was not good enough. So what \nthese financial tycoons had to do was to develop and produce worthless, \ncomplicated financial instruments which plunged our country and much of \nthe world into a deep recession.\n  To the frustration of the American people, a year and a half has \npassed since the financial collapse and what has happened? What actions \nhas the Congress taken to rein in Wall Street, to tell Wall Street that \ntheir greed is not acceptable in this country, that they cannot \ncontinue to go forward with actions that destroy our economy and the \nlives of millions of people?\n  Within a short period of time, the Senate will be considering \nlegislation dealing with financial reform. I wish to congratulate \nSenator Dodd and others on the Banking Committee for the hard work they \nhave done in producing a bill which, in a number of ways, moves us \nforward. But what I wish to say this evening is that moving us forward \nis not good enough. The American people want an end now to the \nrecklessness and irresponsibility of Wall Street. They want an \naccounting and they want real change. They want, in my view, a new Wall \nStreet which invests in the productive economy of small- and medium-\nsized businesses that actually produce real products and real services \nand which actually create real jobs, rather than the activities of Wall \nStreet, which is a giant gambling casino, playing with financial \ninstruments that nobody understands and which, at the end of the day, \nproduces nothing real.\n  As the debate over financial reform moves on, I intend to play an \nactive role in fighting for a number of concepts. Let me enumerate a \nfew of them.\n  No. 1, right now, people in the State of Vermont, in the State of \nColorado, in the State of Rhode Island, and all over this country are \npaying usurious interest rates on their credit cards, and I use the \nword ``usury'' advisedly. We now take it for granted, and we accept the \nfact that our friends and neighbors and family members are paying 20, \n25, 30, 35 percent interest rates on their credit cards. That is wrong. \nThat is unjust. In fact, according to every major religion on Earth--\nChristianity, Judaism, Islam--it is immoral. It is immoral to lend \nmoney to people who desperately need that money and then suck the blood \nout of them because, when they are desperate, they are going to have to \npay 30 or 35 percent interest rates. That is immoral. That is wrong.\n  Over the years, a number of States, including Vermont, have said: We \nare going to prohibit usury. You can't do it. You can't charge more \nthan 10 percent, 12 percent, 15 percent, whatever it is. But all those \nlaws were made null and void by a Supreme Court decision which resulted \nin credit card companies being able to go to States which had no usury \nlaw and, therefore, they could sell their product all over this country \nwith no limit.\n  Let us be clear. Those large financial institutions that are charging \nAmericans 25, 30, 35 percent interest rates on their credit cards are \nno better than loan sharks. In the old days, what loan sharks used to \ndo was break kneecaps if people couldn't repay their loans. Well, these \nguys don't break kneecaps, but they are destroying lives just the same. \nPeople are desperate. They are borrowing money. We have all been to the \ngrocery store and have seen people buying bread and milk with their \ncredit cards, gas to get to work with their credit cards, because that \nis the only source of revenue they now have available to them, paying \n25 to 30 percent. We have to eliminate that once and for all.\n  I will be bringing forth an amendment which does nothing more than \nwhat credit unions now exist under. Credit unions in this country, by \nlaw, cannot charge more than 15 percent interest rates, except under \nexceptional circumstances, and now they can go up to 18 percent, but \nmost of them don't; the vast majority of them don't. I don't think that \nis asking too much.\n  Secondly, I am going to bring forth language which will increase \ntransparency at the Federal Reserve. This is an issue, interestingly \nenough, that brings some of the most conservative Members and some of \nthe most progressive Members together. I remember a year or so ago the \nchairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, came before the Budget Committee on \nwhich I serve, and I asked him a very simple question. I said: Mr. \nBernanke, my understanding is that you have lent out trillions of \ndollars of zero interest loans to financial institutions. Trillions of \ndollars. Can you please tell me and the American people which financial \ninstitutions received that money and what the terms were. I don't think \nthat was an unreasonable question--trillions of dollars.\n  He said: No, Senator, I am not going to do it.\n  We have since introduced legislation to make them do it, and so forth \nand so on.\n  It is beyond my comprehension that we do not know which financial \ninstitutions have received trillions of dollars of zero or close to \nzero interest loans. We don't know about the conflicts of interest that \nmay have existed.\n  In that regard, let me talk about a scam which is quite unbelievable \nthat\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\ngoes on today. What goes on today is, companies such as Goldman Sachs \nborrow money from the Fed--and I have no reason to doubt that Goldman \nSachs also was on the receiving end of these zero interest loans--and \nthey borrow this money for a tenth of a percent, maybe a quarter of a \npercent, and then they take that money and they invest it in U.S. \nTreasury securities at 3.5 to 4 percent. That is a pretty good deal. \nTalk about welfare. Borrow money at zero or half a percent, lend it to \nthe U.S. Government, which has the entire faith and credit of American \nhistory behind it, and you make 3 percent, 4 percent. What a deal. That \nis a pretty good deal. I think we have to end those types of practices \nand we have to move forward with real transparency at the Fed.\n  The other thing we have to do, which is enormously important, is have \nthese large financial institutions start lending money to small- and \nmedium-sized businesses that are prepared to create meaningful jobs in \nthis country.\n  Earlier today, I think the Presiding Officer and I heard from former \nPresident Clinton, who made a very important point. He believes--and I \nagree with him--we can make profound changes in our economy; that over \na period of years we can create millions of jobs as we transform our \nenergy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and to \nsustainable energy. There are small businesses in the energy business \nin this country that are ready to go, to create the jobs, if they can \nget reasonable loans, and they can't get that money today. We can \ntransform our energy system. We can give a real spirit to our economy. \nWe can create good-paying jobs, but we have to demand that Wall Street \nstart investing in the real economy.\n  Another issue I intend to play an active role in is this issue of too \nbig to fail. I have said it once. I have said it many times. If a \nfinancial institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. We \nnow have four major financial institutions which, if any one of them \ncollapsed today, would bring down the entire economy, and what we have \nto do is start breaking them up now--now. We have to take action at \nthis point.\n  I think the American people are angry and they are angry for some \ngood reasons. They are hurting financially. As I mentioned earlier, \nthere are millions of Americans today who have seen a substantial \ndecline in their income and are working incredibly hard and they are \nwondering what has happened. Then, despite all that, with the trend \nthat has led to the collapse of the middle class as a result of Wall \nStreet greed, we have been driven into a major recession.\n  The American people want us to have the courage to stand up to Wall \nStreet. I should say that in 2009 alone, our good friends on Wall \nStreet who have unlimited resources spent $300 million in lobbying this \ninstitution. They spent $300 million. When they fought for the \nderegulation over a period of 10 years, they spent $5 billion to be \nable to engage in the activities which they did engage in and that led \nus to the recession we are in right now.\n\n  So these guys, I guess they can borrow zero interest loans from the \nFed--I don't know if they can use that for lobbying or whatever--but \nthey have an unlimited sum of money. I think the American people want \nus to have the courage to stand with them, to take these guys on no \nmatter how powerful and wealthy they may be. I think the eyes of the \ncountry and the eyes of the world will be on what we do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1609-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1609-S1611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COOKING THE BOOKS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, last Thursday, the bankruptcy examiner \nfor Lehman Brothers Holding Company released a 2,200-page report about \nthe demise of the firm, which included riveting detail on the firm's \naccounting practices. That report has put into sharp relief what many \nof us have expected all along: that fraud and potential criminal \nconduct were at the heart of the financial crisis.\n  Now that we are beginning to learn many of the facts, at least with \nrespect to the activities at Lehman Brothers, the country has every \nright to be outraged. Lehman was cooking its books, hiding $50 billion \nin toxic assets by temporarily shifting them off its balance sheet in \ntime to produce rosier quarter-end reports. According to the bankruptcy \nexaminer's report, Lehman Brothers's financial statements were \n``materially misleading'' and said its executives engaged in \n``actionable balance sheet manipulation.'' Only further investigation \nwill determine whether the individuals involved can be indicted or \nconvicted of criminal wrongdoing.\n  According to the examiner's report, Lehman used accounting tricks to \nhide billions in debt from its investors and the public. Starting in \n2001, that firm began abusing financial transactions called repurchase \nagreements or repos. Repos are basically short-term loans that exchange \ncollateral for cash in trades that may be unwound as soon as the next \nday. While investment banks have come to overrely on repos to finance \ntheir operations, they are neither illegal nor questionable, assuming, \nof course, they are clearly accounted for.\n  Lehman structured some of its repo agreements so the collateral was \nworth 105 percent of the cash it received--hence, the name ``Repo \n105.'' As explained by the New York Times' DealBook:\n\n       That meant that for a few days--and by the fourth quarter \n     of 2007 that meant end-of-quarter--Lehman could shuffle off \n     tens of billions of dollars in assets to appear more \n     financially healthy than it really was.\n\n  Even worse, Lehman's management trumpeted how the firm was decreasing \nits leverage so investors would not flee from the firm. But inside \nLehman, according to the report, someone described the Repo 105 \ntransactions as ``window dressing,'' a nice way of saying they were \ndesigned to mislead the public.\n  Ernst & Young, Lehman's outside auditor, apparently became \ncomfortable with and never objected to the Repo 105 transactions. While \nLehman could never find a U.S. law firm to provide an opinion that \ntreating the Repo 105 transactions as a sale for accounting purposes \nwas legal, the British law firm Linklaters provided an opinion letter \nunder British law that they were sales and not merely financing \nagreements. Lehman ran the transaction through its London subsidiary \nand used several different foreign bank counterparties.\n  The SEC and Justice Department should pursue a thorough \ninvestigation, both civil and criminal, to identify every last person \nwho had knowledge Lehman was misleading the public about its troubled \nbalance sheet--and that means everyone from the Lehman executives, to \nits board of directors, to its accounting firm, Ernst & Young. \nMoreover, if the foreign bank counterparties who purchased the now \ninfamous ``Repo 105s'' were complicit in the scheme, they should be \nheld accountable as well.\n\n  It is high time that we return the rule of law to Wall Street, which \nhas been seriously eroded by the deregulatory mindset that captured our \nregulatory agencies over the past 30 years, a process I described at \nlength in my speech on the floor last Thursday. We became enamored of \nthe view that self-regulation was adequate, that ``rational'' self-\ninterest would motivate counterparties to undertake stronger and better \nforms of due diligence than any regulator could perform, and that \nmarket fundamentalism would lead to the best outcomes for the most \npeople. Transparency and vigorous oversight by outside accountants were \nsupposed to keep our financial system credible and sound.\n  The allure of deregulation, instead, led to the biggest financial \ncrisis since 1929. And now we are learning, not surprisingly, that \nfraud and lawlessness were key ingredients in the collapse as well. \nSince the fall of 2008, Congress, the Federal Reserve and the American \ntaxpayer have had to step into the breach--at a direct cost of more \nthan $2.5 trillion--because, as so many experts have said: ``We had to \nsave the system.''\n  But what exactly did we save?\n  First, a system of overwhelming and concentrated financial power that \nhas become dangerous. It caused the crisis of 2008-2009 and threatens \nto cause another major crisis if we do not enact fundamental reforms. \nOnly six U.S. banks control assets equal to 63 percent of the nation's \ngross domestic\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\nproduct, while oversight is splintered among various regulators who are \noften overmatched in assessing weaknesses at these firms.\n  Second, a system in which the rule of law has broken yet again. Big \nbanks can get away with extraordinarily bad behavior--conduct that \nwould not be tolerated in the rest of society, such as the blatant \ngimmicks used by Lehman, despite the massive cost to the rest of us.\n  What lessons should we take from the bankruptcy examiner's report on \nLehman, and from other recent examples of misleading conduct on Wall \nStreet? I see three.\n  First, we must undo the damage done by decades of deregulation. That \ndamage includes--financial institutions that are ``too big to manage \nand too big to regulate''--as former FDIC Chairman Bill Isaac has \ncalled them--a ``wild west'' attitude on Wall Street, and colossal \nfailures by accountants and lawyers who misunderstand or disregard \ntheir role as gatekeepers. The rule of law depends in part on \nmanageably-sized institutions, participants interested in following the \nlaw, and gatekeepers motivated by more than a paycheck from their \nclients.\n  Second, we must concentrate law enforcement and regulatory resources \non restoring the rule of law to Wall Street. We must treat financial \ncrimes with the same gravity as other crimes, because the price of \ninaction and a failure to deter future misconduct is enormous.\n  Third, we must help regulators and other gatekeepers not only by \ndemanding transparency but also by providing clear, enforceable ``rules \nof the road'' wherever possible. That includes studying conduct that \nmay not be illegal now, but that we should nonetheless consider banning \nor curtailing because it provides too ready a cover for financial \nwrongdoing.\n\n  The bottom line is that we need financial regulatory reform that is \ntough, far-reaching, and untainted by discredited claims about the \nefficacy of self-regulation.\n  When Senators Leahy, Grassley and I introduced the Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act--FERA--last year, our central objective was restoring \nthe rule of law to Wall Street. We wanted to make certain that the \nDepartment of Justice and other law enforcement authorities had the \nresources necessary to investigate and prosecute precisely the sort of \nfraudulent behavior allegedly engaged in by Lehman Brothers that we \nlearned about recently.\n  We all understood that to restore the public's faith in our financial \nmarkets and the rule of law, we must identify, prosecute, and send to \nprison the participants in those markets who broke the law. Their \nfraudulent conduct has severely damaged our economy, caused devastating \nand sustained harm to countless hard-working Americans, and contributed \nto the widespread view that Wall Street does not play by the same rules \nas Main Street.\n  FERA, signed into law in May, ensures that additional tools and \nresources will be provided to those charged with enforcement of our \nNation's laws against financial fraud. Since its passage, progress has \nbeen made, including the President's creation of an interagency \nFinancial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, but much more needs to be done.\n  Many have said we should of seek to punish anyone, as all of Wall \nStreet was in a delirium of profitmaking and almost no one foresaw the \nsub-prime crisis caused by the dramatic decline in housing values. But \nthis is not about retribution. This is about addressing the continuum \nof behavior that took place--some of it fraudulent and illegal--and in \nthe process addressing what Wall Street and the legal and regulatory \nsystem underlying its behavior have become.\n  As part of that effort, we must ensure that the legal system tackles \nfinancial crimes with the same gravity as other crimes. When crimes \nhappened in the past--as in the case of Enron, when aided and abetted \nby, among others, Merrill Lynch, and not prevented by the supposed \ngatekeepers at Arthur Andersen--there were criminal convictions. If \nindividuals and entities broke the law in the lead up to the 2008 \nfinancial crisis--such as at Lehman Brothers, which allegedly deceived \neveryone, including the New York Fed and the SEC--there should be civil \nand criminal cases that hold them accountable.\n  If we uncover bad behavior that was nonetheless lawful, or that we \ncannot prove to be unlawful, as may be exemplified by the recent \nreports of actions by Goldman Sachs with respect to the debt of Greece, \nthen we should review our legal rules in the United States and perhaps \nchange them so that certain misleading behavior cannot go unpunished \nagain. This will not be easy. As the Wall Street Journal's ``Heard on \nthe Street'' noted last week, ``Give Wall Street a rule and it will \nfind a loophole.''\n  This confirms what I heard on December 9 of last year when I convened \nan oversight hearing on FERA. As that hearing made clear, unraveling \nsophisticated financial fraud is an enormously complicated and \nresource-intensive undertaking, because of the nature of both the \nconduct and the perpetrators.\n  Rob Khuzami, head of the SEC's enforcement division, put it this way \nduring the hearing:\n\n       White-collar area cases, I think, are distinguishable from \n     terrorism or drug crimes, for the primary reason that, often, \n     people are plotting their defense at the same time they're \n     committing their crime. They are smart people who understand \n     that they are crossing the line, and so they are papering the \n     record or having veiled or coded conversations that make it \n     difficult to establish a wrongdoing.\n\n  In other words, Wall Street criminals not only possess enormous \nresources but also are sophisticated enough to cover their tracks as \nthey go along, often with the help, perhaps unwitting, of their lawyers \nand accountants.\n  Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer and Khuzami, along with \nAssistant FBI Director Kevin Perkins, all emphasized at the hearing the \ndifficulty of proving these cases from the historical record alone. The \nstrongest cases come with the help of insiders, those who have first-\nhand knowledge of not only conduct but also motive and intent. That is \nwhy I have applauded the efforts of the SEC and DOJ to use both carrots \nand sticks to encourage those with knowledge to come forward.\n  At the conclusion of that hearing in December, I was confident that \nour law enforcement agencies were intensely focused on bringing to \njustice those wrongdoers who brought our economy to the brink of \ncollapse.\n  Going forward, we need to make sure that those agencies have the \nresources and tools they need to complete the job. But we are fooling \nourselves if we believe that our law enforcement efforts, no matter how \nvigorous or well funded, are enough by themselves to prevent the types \nof destructive behavior perpetrated by today's too-big, too-powerful \nfinancial institutions on Wall Street.\n  I am concerned that the revelations about Lehman Brothers are just \nthe tip of the iceberg. We have no reason to believe that the conduct \ndetailed last week is somehow isolated or unique. Indeed, this sort of \nbehavior is hardly novel. Enron engaged in similar deceit with some of \nits assets. And while we don't have the benefit of an examiner's report \nfor other firms with a business model like Lehman's, law enforcement \nauthorities should be well on their way in conducting investigations of \nwhether others used similar ``accounting gimmicks'' to hide dangerous \nrisk from investors and the public.\n  At the same time, there are reports that raise questions about \nwhether Goldman Sachs and other firms may have failed to disclose \nmaterial information about swaps with Greece that allowed the country \nto effectively mask the full extent of its debt just as it was joining \nthe European Monetary Union, EMU. We simply do not know whether fraud \nwas involved, but these actions have kicked off a continent-wide \ncontroversy, with ramifications for U.S. investors as well.\n  In Greece, the main transactions in question were called cross-\ncurrency swaps that exchange cash flows denominated in one currency for \ncash flows denominated in another. In Greece's case, these swaps were \npriced ``off-market,'' meaning that they didn't use prevailing market \nexchange rates. Instead, these highly unorthodox transactions provided \nGreece with a large upfront payment, and an apparent reduction in debt, \nwhich they then paid off through periodic interest payments and finally \na large ``balloon'' payment at the contract's maturity. In other words, \nGoldman Sachs allegedly provided Greece with a loan by another name.\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\n  The story, however, does not end there. Following these transactions, \nGoldman Sachs and other investment banks underwrote billions of Euros \nin bonds for Greece. The questions being raised include whether some of \nthese bond offering documents disclosed the true nature of these swaps \nto investors, and, if not, whether the failure to do so was material.\n  These bonds were issued under Greek law, and there is nothing \nnecessarily illegal about not disclosing this information to bond \ninvestors in Europe. At least some of these bonds, however, were likely \nsold to American investors, so they may therefore still be subject to \napplicable U.S. securities law. While ``qualified institutional \nbuyers,'' QIBs, in the United States are able to purchase bonds, such \nas the ones issued by Greece, and other securities not registered with \nthe SEC under Securities Act of 1933, the sale of these bonds would \nstill be governed by other requirements of U.S. law. Specifically, they \npresumably would be subject to the prohibition against the sale of \nsecurities to U.S. investors while deliberately withholding material \nadverse information.\n  The point may be not so much what happened in Greece, but yet again \nthe broader point that financial transactions must be transparent to \nthe investing public and verified as such by outside auditors. AIG fell \nin large part due to its credit default swap exposure, but no one knew \nuntil it was too late how much risk AIG had taken upon itself. Why do \nsome on Wall Street resist transparency so? Lehman shows the answer: \neveryone will flee a listing ship, so the less investors know, the \nbetter off are the firms which find themselves in a downward spiral. At \nleast until the final reckoning.\n\n  Who is to blame for this state of affairs, where major Wall Street \nfirms conclude that hiding the truth is okay? Well, there is plenty of \nblame to go around. As I said previously, both Congress and the \nregulators came to believe that self-interest was regulation enough. In \nthe now-immortal words of Alan Greenspan, ``Those of us who have looked \nto the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's \nequity--myself especially--are in a state of shocked disbelief.'' The \ntime has come to get over the shock and get on with the work.\n  What about the professions? Accountants and lawyers are supposed to \nhelp insure that their clients obey the law. Indeed they often claim \nthat simply by giving good advice to their clients, they are \nresponsible for far more compliance with the law than are government \ninvestigators. That claim rings hollow, however, when these \nprofessionals now seem too often focused on helping their clients get \naround the law.\n  Experts such as Professor Peter Henning of Wayne State University Law \nSchool, looking at the Lehman examiner's report on the Repo 105 \ntransactions, are stunned that the accountant Ernst & Young never \nseemed to be troubled in the least about it. Of course, the fact that a \nLehman executive was blowing a whistle on the practice in May 2008 did \nnot change anything, other than to cause some discomfort in the ranks.\n  While saying he was confident he could clear up the whistleblower's \nconcerns, the lead partner for Lehman at Ernst & Young wrote that the \nletter and off-balance sheet accounting issues were ``adding stress to \neveryone.''\n  As Professor Henning notes, one of the supposed major effects of the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act was to empower the accountants to challenge \nmanagement and ensure that transactions were accounted for properly. \nIndeed, it was my predecessor, then-Senator Biden, who was the lead \nauthor of the provision requiring the CEO and CFO to attest to the \naccuracy of financial statements, under penalty of criminal sanction if \nthey knowingly or willfully certified materially false statements. I \ndon't believe this is a failure of Sarbanes-Oxley. A law is not a \nfailure simply because some people subsequently violate it.\n\n  I am deeply disturbed at the apparent failure of some in the \naccounting profession to change their ways and truly undertake the \nprofession's role as the first line of defense--the gatekeeper--against \naccounting fraud. In just a few years time since the Enron-related \ndeath of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, one might have hoped that \n``technically correct'' was no longer a defensible standard if the \ncumulative impression left by the action is grossly misleading. But \napparently that standard as a singular defense is creeping back into \nthe profession.\n  The accountants and lawyers weren't the only gatekeepers. If Lehman \nwas hiding balance sheet risks from investors, it was also hiding them \nfrom rating agencies and regulators, thereby allowing it to delay \npossible ratings downgrades that would increase its capital \nrequirements. The Repo 105 transactions allowed Lehman to lower its \nreported net leverage ratio from 17.3 to 15.4 for the first quarter of \n2008, according to the examiner's report. It was bad enough that the \nSEC focused on a misguided metric like net leverage when Lehman's gross \nleverage ratio was much higher and more indicative of its risks. The \nSEC's failure to uncover such aggressive and possibly fraudulent \naccounting, as was employed on the Repo 105 transactions, provides a \nclear indication of the lack of rigor of its supervision of Lehman and \nother investment banks.\n  The SEC in years past allowed the investment banks to increase their \nleverage ratios by permitting them to determine their own risk level. \nWhen that approach was taken, it should have been coupled with absolute \ntransparency on the level of risk. What the Lehman example shows is \nthat increased leverage without the accountants and regulators and \ncredit rating agencies insisting on transparency is yet another recipe \nfor disaster.\n  Mr. President, last week's revelations about Lehman Brothers \nreinforce what I have been saying for some time. The folly of radical \nderegulation has given us financial institutions that are too big to \nfail, too big to manage, and too big to regulate. If we have any hope \nof returning the rule of law to Wall Street, we need regulatory reform \nthat addresses this central reality.\n  As I said more than a year ago:\n\n       At the end of the day, this is a test of whether we have \n     one justice system in this country or two. If we don't treat \n     a Wall Street firm that defrauded investors of millions of \n     dollars the same way we treat someone who stole $500 from a \n     cash register, then how can we expect our citizens to have \n     faith in the rule of law? For our economy to work for all \n     Americans, investors must have confidence in the honest and \n     open functioning of our financial markets. Our markets can \n     only flourish when Americans again trust that they are fair, \n     transparent, and accountable to the laws.\n\n  The American people deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I speak to the topic \nthat brought me to the floor tonight, I want to acknowledge the \nPresiding Officer's remarks on the situation with Lehman Brothers and \nothers on Wall Street. I know that the Senator is on a mission, and \nnothing would make him happier, nor me happier, if the story of Lehman \nBrothers is a story that is told for the last time, much less written \nfor the last time.\n  I listened with great interest to the narrative that is now \nunfolding, and with that interest also the sense of horror and outrage \nand anger that the Presiding Officer clearly carries. A crime is a \ncrime, as it was pointed out, whether it is $500 from a cash register \nor literally billions, in fact trillions of dollars of net worth that \nwe have seen taken from Americans and American families.\n  I commend the Presiding Officer for his leadership, and I think he \nput it well when he pointed out if you are too big to fail, you are too \nbig to exist, and too bad. Never again should that happen. So I wanted \nto acknowledge the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1611-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1611-S1612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SOLAR UNITING NEIGHBORHOODS ACT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I want to speak about a bill \nthat is born from the forward-thinking ideas of our constituents--a \nbill that will\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nhelp spur our Nation's new energy economy and create jobs. To that end, \ntomorrow I will introduce the Solar Uniting Neighborhoods Act, or the \nSUN Act.\n  Last year, I began traveling across Colorado as part of a workforce \ntour to listen directly to Coloradans and hear their innovative policy \nideas to create jobs. These ongoing efforts not only make me proud to \nbe a Coloradan but they help me identify ways the Federal Government \ncan help--or in some cases get out of the way--in supporting economic \ndevelopment and investing in Colorado. The SUN Act comes from directly \nvisiting with Coloradans. It was one of the several job creation \nproposals developed after I hosted an energy jobs summit last month in \nColorado.\n  Our summit brought together leading clean energy stakeholders from \nthe worlds of business and public interest and government. Many of our \ntop elected officials were there, including Energy Secretary Steven \nChu, Governor Bill Ritter, Senator Michael Bennet, and Congressman Ed \nPerlmutter. They were there to discuss ways to sensibly spur job growth \nin our emerging clean energy economy. In the coming weeks, I will be \nintroducing further legislation developed in part from the creative \nideas that flowed from the clean energy summit.\n  The SUN Act will bring common sense to our Tax Code, get government \nout of the way of developing solar energy and spur job growth in every \ncommunity across the United States. Americans currently qualify for a \n30-percent Federal tax credit for the cost of installing solar panels \non their homes. These solar panels are a great way to convert sunlight \nto electricity, and over time they save American families money on \ntheir utility bills. A few years ago, I installed panels on my own home \nto take advantage of the Sun, which is very strong in the great State \nof Colorado. But I have come to understand that this option isn't \navailable for all American families who want to receive their \nelectricity from solar power. Why? Well, there can be difficulties \nattaching solar panels to your home, which is why more and more \nneighborhoods and towns are creating so-called ``community solar'' \nprojects. In those projects, instead of attaching the panels on every \nroof on the block, an increasing number of families have decided to \nplace those same solar panels together in one open and unobstructed \nsunny area near their homes. By grouping these solar panels, you can \nreduce the cost by 30 percent compared to installing a panel or a set \nof panels on every roof in the neighborhood. Moreover, community solar \nprojects streamline maintenance and optimize energy production by \navoiding trees, buildings, and other obstructions. Whether used by \nneighbors living at the end of a cul-de-sac or developed by a rural \nenergy cooperative, creating these group solar projects to share energy \nis a great way to lower the cost of making electricity through the \nmarvelous technology of photovoltaic units.\n  But there is a problem. Our Tax Code gets in the way. Why? Well, we \nhave seen the Federal Tax Code discourage neighborhood solar projects \nbecause it requires the panels to be on your property. To put it \nsimply, Federal law is telling Americans they need to have their solar \npanels affixed to their roofs instead of being able to partner with \ntheir neighbors on a community solar project. So this discourages \ninnovation and slows the growth of solar power as an alternative energy \nsource.\n  Back to the reason why I am introducing the SUN Act. It makes a small \nchange in the Tax Code so that we no longer will be constrained in this \ninnovative solar energy opportunity. By eliminating the requirement \nthat the solar panel be on one individual's property, it frees \nAmericans to work together on community projects where each individual \ncan claim a tax credit on part of a shared project. This simple turnkey \nsolution makes it easier to adopt and use clean renewable energy.\n  As more and more Americans are realizing, weaning ourselves off \nsources of foreign energy is a bipartisan imperative no matter what you \nthink about global warming. Back in 2004, Colorado took a big step \nforward into the emerging clean energy economy when we approved a \nrenewable electricity standard--a so-called RES. I know the Presiding \nOfficer supports such a concept. It wasn't an easy transition. There \nwere a lot of skeptics who feared setting a goal for renewable energy \nwould result in job losses. I remember it well. I cochaired the \ncampaign for this RES in the State of Colorado with the Republican \nSpeaker of our Statehouse, Lola Spradley, who is a close friend. She \nand I toured the State during election season in a bipartisan effort. \nIt was a surprise to a lot of people, who thought Republicans and \nDemocrats only fight and disagree. We in fact agreed, and we had a \nwonderful time campaigning together. We passed the RES.\n  Colorado has initiated other efforts as well and we have easily \ncreated over 20,000 jobs. We have the fourth highest concentration of \nrenewable energy and energy research jobs in our country. Estimates are \nthat the solar energy requirement in the RES--because the RES allows \nfor wind, biomass, and other kinds of renewable energies--created over \n1,500 jobs.\n  So what does this tell us? It tells us what we already know well--\nthat American capitalism can take the seeds of an idea and create \npositive economic change. So wherever possible, our Federal Government \nshould encourage, not hinder, such entrepreneurial ideas and \nentrepreneurs.\n  Other important issues are at play as well. As we find our way out of \nthe current recession, we are witness to the emergence of powerful \neconomic competitors abroad, and we have an increasingly dangerous \nalliance on foreign fossil fuels. So with these factors in mind for our \nown economic and national security, Americans must become the world \nleader in adopting clean energy and creating homegrown jobs.\n  The story must be told that clean energy is one of the greatest \neconomic opportunities of the 21st century. Fortunately, that is a \npromise we can meet as the global demand for clean energy is growing by \n$1 trillion every year. Let me say that again--$1 trillion every year. \nAnd what excites me about this bill, like many measures currently being \ndebated here in our Chamber, is that it will create jobs for Americans \nin every neighborhood where these community solar projects are \ndeveloped.\n  This bill reduces many of the barriers which currently prevent \nAmericans from adopting solar energy, opens up new markets and creates \na simple structure to allow people to utilize clean energy for their \nhome.\n  As I close, I can tell you there is nothing more thrilling than \nmaking electricity, which I do in my own home. And then, when you need \nto use it at your home, you use it there. And also, when it is not \nneeded, you send it back on the grid for your neighbors to use. So I \nurge my colleagues in both parties to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1612-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1612-S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Eric D. Currier\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay \ntribute to the life and service of Marine PFC Eric D. Currier of \nLondonderry, NH. This young soldier died from wounds inflicted by an \nenemy sniper in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, on February 17, 2010. \nPrivate First Class Currier was just 21 years old at the time of his \ndeath. A rifleman, he was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force based at \nCamp Lejeune, NC, and was deployed to Afghanistan in January.\n  Eric was born in Massachusetts but moved to my home State of New \nHampshire when he was in the eighth grade. He continued his schooling \nin Londonderry and graduated from Londonderry High School in 2007. Like \nmany in northern New England, Eric was an avid outdoorsman. He began \nfishing with his grandfather at the age of three. He enjoyed camping \ntrips with his brothers and was a skilled hunter. He spent many summer \ndays boating, fishing and swimming while staying with his grandparents \non Plum Island in Massachusetts. Eric even met his future wife, Kaila \nParkhurst, while canoeing on the Saco River as a teenager. He was a \nfine young man, friendly and\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\noutgoing, who cared deeply for his family. Army PVT Brent Currier, \nEric's brother, describes him as the hero of his seven siblings.\n  Eric enlisted in the Marine Corps in March 2009 with a desire to \nserve an important cause and make his family proud. He most certainly \naccomplished those goals. Private First Class Currier selflessly joined \nthe men and women of our armed services who give of themselves each day \nso that we, as a nation, might enjoy freedom and security. He has \nearned our country's enduring gratitude and recognition. While Eric's \nlife may have ended too soon, his legacy lives on through the people \nwho loved him and through all of us, who are forever indebted to him.\n  No words of mine can diminish the pain of losing such a young \nsoldier, but I hope Eric's family can find solace in knowing that all \nAmericans share a deep appreciation of his service. Daniel Webster's \nwords, first spoken during his eulogy for Presidents Adams and \nJefferson in 1826, are fitting: ``Although no sculptured marble should \nrise to their memory, nor engraved stone bear record of their deeds, \nyet will their remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.'' I \nask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring Eric's life, \nservice and sacrifice.\n  Private First Class Currier is survived by his wife Kaila; his father \nRussell Currier; his mother Helen Boudreau and her husband Kevin; \nsiblings Brent, Dylan, Kevin, Melana, Cassie, Jake and Alyssa; as well \nas grandparents, in-laws, and others. I offer my deepest sympathies to \nhis entire family for their loss, and my sincere thanks for their loved \none's service. This young marine will be dearly missed; his death while \ndeployed far from home is another painful loss for our small State and \nfor this Nation. It is my sad duty to enter the name of PFC Eric \nCurrier in the Record of the U.S. Senate in recognition of his \nsacrifice for this country and his contribution to freedom and lasting \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1613-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

Mr. President, Taiwan is a steadfast ally in a very \nturbulent region of the world. On January 29, the State Department \napproved a $6.4 billion arms package to Taiwan that includes 114 \nPatriot missiles, 60 Black Hawk helicopters, Harpoon antiship training \nmissiles, and Osprey-class minehunter ships.\n  I am pleased that the administration is taking this important step \ntoward fulfilling the United States' commitment to Taiwan under the \nTaiwan Relations Act, TRA, which requires us to make available to \nTaiwan such defense articles and defense services ``as may be necessary \nto enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' \nHowever, despite the billions of dollars worth of weapons involved in \nthis sale, it represents little more than a half step in providing \nTaiwan the defensive arms that it needs--and that we are obligated by \nlaw to provide it--to protect itself against rapidly increasing air- \nand sea-based threats from China. What Taiwan has repeatedly \nrequested--and what was not in the arms package--are new fighter \naircraft.\n  Since 2006, the Taiwanese have made clear their desire to purchase 66 \nF-16 C/Ds to augment an air fleet that is bordering on obsolescence. On \nApril 22, 2009, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Taiwan's \ncommitment to request the F-16C/Ds from the Obama Administration. And, \nin a December 29, 2009, letter to Senate and House leaders, members of \nTaiwan's Parliament stated, ``Though economic and diplomatic relations \nwith the People's Republic of China's Communist Party are improving, we \nface a significant threat from the People's Liberation Army Air Force. \nOur military must be able to defend our airspace as a further \ndeterioration in the air balance across the Strait will only encourage \nPRC aggression.''\n  On January 21, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, completed a \nreport on the current condition of Taiwan's air force. This formal \nassessment was required under a provision that I authored in the fiscal \nyear 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, which received \nbipartisan support. The report's findings are grim.\n  The unclassified version of the report concludes that, although \nTaiwan has an inventory of almost 400 combat aircraft, ``far fewer of \nthese are operationally capable.'' It states that Taiwan's 60 U.S.-made \nF-5 fighters have already reached the end of their operational service, \nthat its 126 locally produced Indigenous Defense Fighter aircraft lack \n``the capability for sustained sorties,'' and that its 56 French-made \nMirage 2000-5 fighter jets ``require frequent, expensive maintenance'' \nwhile lacking required spare parts. Furthermore, the report found that \nalthough some of Taiwan's 146 F-16 A/Bs may receive improvements to \nenhance avionics and combat effectiveness, the ``extent of the \nupgrades, and timing and quantity of aircraft is currently unknown.''\n  In the past, what has kept Taiwan free and allowed its democracy and \nfree enterprise system to flourish has been a qualitative technological \nadvantage in military hardware over Chinese forces. In simple terms, it \nwould have been too costly for Beijing to contemplate an attack on \nTaiwan. This in and of itself created a stabilizing effect that \npromoted dialogue and negotiations. Yet due to the massive, \nnontransparent increase in China's defense spending, the past 10 years \nhave seen a dramatic erosion in this cornerstone of Taiwan's defense \nstrategy. A gauge of how quickly this tide has turned can be found in \nthe Department of Defense's Annual Report on the Military Power of the \nPeople's Republic of China. The 2002 version of this report concluded \nthat Taiwan ``has enjoyed dominance of the airspace over the Taiwan \nStrait for many years.'' The DOD's 2009 Report now states this \nconclusion no longer holds true.\n  Taiwanese defense officials have also recognized this alarming trend, \npredicting that, in the coming decade, they will completely lose their \nqualitative edge. Beijing will have an advantage in both troops and \narms. This imminent reality holds critical consequences for both our \nally Taiwan and the United States. If China becomes emboldened, it \nmight be tempted to try to take Taiwan through outright aggression or \ncow Taiwan into subservience through intimidation.\n  How would the U.S. react in the face of Chinese belligerence towards \nTaiwan? Would we deploy our ships and aircraft to ward off Chinese \naggression? Would we decide to counter force with force? These are \ndifficult and tough questions, and the soundest policy option is to \nensure they never have to be answered. We know a Taiwan that is \nproperly defended and equipped will raise the stakes for China, and \nthat would serve as the best defense against belligerent acts.\n  Strategically, assisting Taiwan in maintaining a robust defense \ncapability will help keep the Taiwan Strait stable. We should remember \nthat, in 1996, Beijing rattled its Chinese saber and launched ballistic \nmissiles off Taiwan's coast and initiated amphibious landing training \nexercises. This prompted President Clinton to dispatch two carrier \nbattle groups as a show of strength. President Ma recently commented on \nthe latest weapons sale by stating, ``The more confidence we have and \nthe safer we feel, the more interactions we can have with mainland \nChina. The new weapons will help us develop cross-strait ties and \nensure Taiwan maintains a determined defense and effective \ndeterrence.'' During the Reagan years, we knew this common-sense \nstrategy as ``Peace Through Strength.''\n  The benefits of an F-16 sale to Taiwan are not limited to national \nsecurity--this sale also stands to benefit the American economy during \na difficult period. The F-16, one of the world's finest tactical \naircraft, is proudly assembled in Fort Worth, TX. The overall \nproduction effort involves hundreds of suppliers and thousands of \nworkers across the United States. The\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\nsale of 66 aircraft to Taiwan would be worth approximately $4.9 billion \nand guarantee U.S. jobs for years to come. The ripple effects of this \nsale through our economy would be significant, especially for workers \nin states where the recession has hit hard. This sale will also be a \nshot in the arm to America's defense industrial base, where \nconstructing and equipping the F-16 means high-paying jobs for \nAmericans.\n  The Obama administration has indicated that it intends to further \nreview Taiwan's request for F-16s. Yet, the time for a decision \nregarding this sale draws near, and this review cannot be allowed to \ncontinue indefinitely. Taiwan needs these F-16 C/D aircraft now. What's \nmore, the F-16 production line is approaching its end, after having \nmanufactured these world-class aircraft for decades and having equipped \n25 nations with more than 4,000 aircraft. If hard orders are not \nreceived for Taiwan's F-16s this year, the U.S. production line will \nlikely be forced to start shutting down. Once the line begins closing, \npersonnel will be shifted to other programs, inventory orders will be \ncancelled, and machine tools will be decommissioned. When the F-16 line \neventually goes ``cold,'' it is not realistic to expect that it would \nbe restarted. At the same time, through economic and diplomatic \nthreats, China has effectively cut off all other countries from selling \narms to Taiwan.\n  In the months leading up to the administration's recent arms sales \nannouncement, the administration took great pains to telegraph to \nBeijing their intention that the sale would provide only defensive arms \nto Taiwan. Nevertheless, China has responded to the sale by threatening \nU.S. companies, cancelling high-level meetings with U.S. officials, and \nlaunching verbal assaults against our country. Beijing's blustering is \nclearly intended to intimidate the United States and dissuade us from \nselling new F-16s to Taiwan. This is unacceptable. The United States \nmust not allow Beijing to dictate the terms of any future U.S. arms \nsales or other support for Taiwan.\n  President Ma and Taiwan parliamentarians have been clear and direct \nin their request for these aircraft. It is my hope that they will \nredouble their efforts here in Congress, as well as with the \nadministration, to make the case and demonstrate the urgent need for \nthe sale of these F-16C/Ds. This is a telling moment for the Obama \nadministration. Our allies are watching carefully, and so are our \npotential adversaries. Without question, the path of least resistance \nfor the administration would be to not move forward with the sale of F-\n16s, under the guise of continued analysis of the proposal. Then, once \nthe F-16 production line had shut down, the proposed sale would be a \nmoot issue for the administration. However, that path would ultimately \nleave Taiwan--and U.S. interests in the region--dangerously exposed. \nThe sale of these F-16s to Taiwan would send a powerful message that \nthe U.S. will stand by our allies, both in the Taiwan Strait and in \nother parts of the world.\n  I urge the President to move forward expeditiously with the sale of \nF-16s to Taiwan. I hope he will do so, and I know that many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle share this sentiment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1614-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1614-S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to address the \nsubject of reconciliation.\n  I have previously spoken about gridlock in Congress and the negative \nimpact it is having on our stature internationally. We are unable to \nconfirm judicial and executive nominations which is paralyzing the work \nof the Senate and putting the government's ability to confront the \nNation's challenges at risk. It slows the judicial process and leaves \nmany posts empty, including those in defense and national security.\n  The most central issue at the moment, however, is health care reform. \nHealth care reform passed both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. In the Senate, it passed by a supermajority vote of 60-39. The \nonly issue before us now is aligning the already-passed Senate version \nwith the already-passed House version. Despite its passage by 60-39, \nRepublicans are still trying to stop this bill by threatening to \nfilibuster the amendments needed to bring it into a condition that will \npass the House of Representatives.\n  These tactics, which amount to a minority of Senators halting a bill \nthat has overwhelming support, can be overcome by the often used \nreconciliation process. The reconciliation process is an optional \nprocedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process \nestablished by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The reconciliation \nprocess has been used by nearly every Congress since its enactment to \npass a vast array of legislation.\n  In their endless efforts to circumvent the will of the majority and \nthwart the passage of much needed and much supported health care \nlegislation, the Republicans have launched a campaign against the \nreconciliation process, making it out to be an illegitimate tactic that \nthe Democrats have invented to pass health care legislation. That is \nsimply untrue.\n  A look back in time, however, shows that the very same Republicans \nwho are now denouncing the use of reconciliation were the very same \nRepublicans who were defending its use not too long ago.\n  When he was chair of the Budget Committee, Senator Judd Gregg, in \ndefending the use of reconciliation to try to pass an amendment \nallowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 2005 \nsaid, ``Reconciliation is a rule of the Senate set up under the Budget \nAct. It has been used before for purposes exactly like this on numerous \noccasions. The fact is all this rule of the Senate does is allow a \nmajority of the Senate to take a position and pass a piece of \nlegislation, support that position. Is there something wrong with \n`majority rules'? I don't think so.''\n  When using reconciliation to pass Medicare spending, Senator Gregg \nsaid, ``You can't get 60 votes because the party on the other side of \nthe aisle simply refuses to do anything constructive in this area.'' \nSenator Chuck Grassley, when defending the use of reconciliation to \npass the Bush tax cuts, said that reconciliation was ``the way it will \nhave to be done in order to get it done at all.''\n  Last year Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said of Democrats using \nreconciliation, ``It's their right. They did win the election. We don't \nlike it because we don't like what looks like the outcome.''\n  Republicans are implying that reconciliation is a new idea, and has \nnever been used to pass significant legislation. The fact is, since \n1980, Congress has sent 22 reconciliation bills to the President. Of \nthose, 16 enacted into law occurred under Republican majority control.\n  The 16 reconciliation bills created with a Republican majority \nincluded:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Resultant\n                  FY                           Majority          reconciliation act(s)            Veto?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1981.................................

The new Reagan \nadministration and Republican majority in 1981 that first used \nreconciliation to pass major legislation--Reagan's tax cuts--and used \nit again in 1982 to cut spending and roll back some tax cuts. A \nRepublican-controlled Senate also used reconciliation to pass the 1996 \nwelfare overhaul, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare \nAdvantage and COBRA.\n  Republicans have used reconciliation many times to pass partisan \nbills. For example, the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the 2001 Bush tax \ncuts, the 2003 Bush tax cuts, the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act, and the \n2006 Tax Relief Extension Act were all passed in reconciliation and \nwith small vote margins. Two of these passed only with the tie-breaking \nintervention of Vice President Dick Cheney, and Democrats got more \nvotes for the health bill than any of these measures received.\n  Republicans have also complained that reconciliation is not proper \nfor a health care bill. However, over the past 20 years, reconciliation \nhas been used to pass almost all major pieces of health care \nlegislation, including COBRA; the Children's Health Insurance Program; \nthe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires \nhospitals that take Medicaid and Medicare to treat anyone entering an \nER; and welfare reform, which disentangled Medicaid from welfare.\n  Further, the health care bill has already passed with 60 votes. It is \nonly the amendments that need to pass via reconciliation. The 2009 \nbudget resolution instructed both Houses of Congress to enact health \ncare reform. Again, comprehensive health legislation has already passed \nboth Chambers, garnering a majority in the House and a supermajority in \nthe Senate. Since the House and the Senate versions are slightly \ndifferent, using reconciliation to implement the budget resolution by \nreconciling the two bills follows established procedure. Reconciliation \nwill be used only to pass a small package of fixes to the original \nhealth bills that are necessary to align the House and Senate versions. \nThis is actually less ambitious than the usual reconciliation process, \nwhich usually applies to entire bills, not just small fixes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1615-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RADIO SPECTRUM INVENTORY ACT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I express my support for S. 649, the Radio \nSpectrum Inventory Act. I am joining as a cosponsor of this legislation \nbecause it is important to complete a comprehensive assessment of how \nwe use our radio spectrum before we make decisions about how we want to \nuse it in the future.\n  As the FCC submits the Nation's first broadband plan to Congress, we \nhave heard much about the need for allocating additional spectrum for \nthe expansion of mobile broadband service. There is little question \nthat rapidly expanding these networks is of critical importance--\nespecially in rural States like North Dakota, which rely on 21st-\ncentury technology like mobile broadband to stay competitive.\n  However, without a thorough understanding of how our public airwaves \nare currently being used, making a plan to reallocate spectrum would be \nputting the cart before the horse. For that reason, I strongly believe \nthat the Congress should pass this legislation and policymakers should \nwait to review the results of the inventory it requires before \ndecisions are made about how or where spectrum should be distributed \nfor the expansion of mobile broadband services. This will allow us to \nshape spectrum policy in a more thoughtful manner.\n  Just as the National Broadband Plan gives us for the first time a \ncomprehensive plan for broadband deployment and use, the Radio Spectrum \nInventory Act will provide for the first time a comprehensive map of \nhow the public airwaves are used--for radio broadcasts, over-the-air \ntelevision, mobile phones, public safety, and mobile broadband. There \nare too many users involved to move forward in a piecemeal way. \nUltimately, spectrum reallocation is too important to rush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1615-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GREG KENDALL\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \nwife Kathy to pay tribute to Officer Greg Kendall of Rye, NH, who \nretired on January 1, 2010, after 50 years of service as an educator \nand law enforcement officer. It is important for us to take a moment to \nrecognize and honor Officer Kendall's long career as a dedicated public \nservant. Citizens like Greg Kendall ensure that our communities remain \ngreat places to live, work, and raise a family. The outstanding \ncommunity service demonstrated by him is what inspires people to leave \nbehind a better society than they found, and contribute to the \nbetterment of their local community.\n  Greg, whom Rye Police Chief Kevin Walsh describes as \n``irreplaceable,'' is both well known and highly respected throughout \nNew Hampshire's Seacoast community, where he has served on the Rye \npolice force and as an educator in the Rye and Seabrook school \ndistricts. Starting out on summer beach patrol in 1960 as a full-time \nofficer, Greg continued to serve as a police officer on weekends while \nalso beginning his career in education as a full-time sixth grade \nteacher at Rye Junior High School. Upon finishing graduate studies at \nthe University of New Hampshire and the University of Maine, he became \nthe principal at Rye Junior High School, where he continued to guide \nand shape the education and character of a generation of young students \nover the next 16 years. Following that, Greg taught in Seabrook for an \nadditional 13 years, all while serving nights and weekends as a special \nofficer in Rye. Since 2001, Greg has also been animal control officer, \nperforming his duties with the same compassion, calm demeanor, and \nprofessionalism that he always brought to his shifts on patrol or \nlessons in the classroom.\n  On a personal note, I had the pleasure of serving with Greg when, in \nthe summer of 1968, I worked as a special officer on the Rye Police \nForce. The town of Rye, the people of the region and the State of New \nHampshire are all better off for Greg's wisdom, skills, and experience. \nHe is a friend and someone whose sense of humor, expertise and \ndedication I have always admired. Kathy and I join Greg's friends and \nneighbors in Rye in honoring him as an officer of the law, an educator \nof youth, and a motivator for us all. Thank you, Greg Kendall. We wish \nyou the best in all your future endeavors; may they be as rewarding as \nthose of the last 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1615-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2377.

A message from the Secretary-General of the United \n     Nations petitioning support for Nuclear Disarmament and Non-\n     Proliferation; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                                        The Secretary-General,\n\n                                                February 26, 2010.\n     Mr. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n     President, Senate, United States of America, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., We stand at a watershed \n     moment for the achievement of international security through \n     a world free of nuclear weapons. For several years now, \n     momentum has been building towards this goal, due in no small \n     part to the diligent efforts of civil society and \n     parliamentarians.\n       I have tried to do my part to revitalize the peace and \n     disarmament agenda. In October 2008, I presented a five-point \n     proposal for nuclear disarmament. Greatly encouraged by the \n     support that has been expressed for my initiative, I \n     welcomed, in particular, the call by the Inter-Parliamentary \n     Union in April 2009 for parliaments to instruct their \n     Governments to support this proposal. I salute the \n     Parliamentary Network for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and \n     Disarmament for its related efforts and for its work towards \n     building support for a nuclear weapon convention.\n       Since 2008, we have seen progress. The Russian Federation \n     and the United States have negotiated on further reductions \n     of their strategic nuclear arsenals. The Security Council \n     held a historic summit on nuclear disarmament and non-\n     proliferation. Treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free \n     zones have entered into force in Africa and Central Asia. \n     Calls for global nuclear disarmament have emanated from many \n     quarters and detailed plans have been proposed containing \n     practical ideas to achieve the goal of global zero.\n       In order to sustain this momentum ahead of the 2010 Review \n     Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, I have proposed an Action Plan on Nuclear \n     Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. My plan is founded on a \n     fundamental principle: nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-\n     proliferation are mutually reinforcing and inseparable. In my \n     action plan, I promised to explore ways to encourage greater \n     involvement by civil society and parliamentarians.\n       Parliamentarians and parliaments play a key role in the \n     success of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. \n     Parliaments support the implementation of treaties and global \n     agreements contributing to the rule of law and promoting \n     adherence to commitments. They adopt legislation that \n     increases transparency and accountability, thus building \n     trust, facilitating verification and creating conditions that \n     are conducive to the further pursuit of disarmament.\n       At a time when the international community is facing \n     unprecedented global challenges, parliamentarians can take on \n     leading roles in ensuring sustainable global security, while \n     reducing the diversion of precious resources from human \n     needs. As parliaments set the fiscal priorities for their \n     respective countries, they can determine how much to invest \n     in the pursuit of peace and cooperative security. Towards \n     this end, parliaments can establish the institutional \n     infrastructures to support the development of necessary \n     practical measures.\n       I would therefore like to take this opportunity to \n     encourage all parliamentarians to join in efforts to achieve \n     a nuclear-weapon-free world. In particular, I call upon \n     parliamentarians to increase their support for peace and \n     disarmament, to bring disarmament and non-proliferation \n     treaties into force, and to start work now on the legislative \n     agendas needed to achieve and sustain the objective of \n     nuclear disarmament.\n       I look forward to opportunities to work with you to advance \n     global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     BAN Ki-Moon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/16/senate-section/article/S1617-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, with amendments:\n       H.R. 885.

The Inquirer described it as ``a system that \ntoo often fails to punish violent criminals, fails to protect \nwitnesses, fails to catch thousands of fugitives, fails to decide cases \non their merits, and fails to provide justice.'' The Inquirer article 3 \ndays later elaborated on the fugitive problem, noting that as of \nNovember 2009, there were almost 47,000 long-term fugitives at large.\n  The warrant situation in Philadelphia is complicated by the fact that \nthe Philadelphia Police Department only enters into the national \ndatabase a few hundred bench warrants deemed by the district attorney's \noffice to concern extraditable offenses. Those who abscond from \ncriminal proceedings in Philadelphia and flee to other States likely \nwill not be captured because the information for their warrants is not \nautomatically entered into the NCIC database.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with Senator Durbin, \nbuilds on legislation previously entered by then-Senator Biden and \nSenator Durbin. The proposed legislation will provide substantial \nFederal funding to assist the States in tracking and returning these \nfugitives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement which I have just summarized and the\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Senator Specter's Statement Upon Introducing the Fugitive Information \n              Networked Database Act of 2010, The Find Act\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce the \n     Fugitive Information Networked Database Act of 2010, the FIND \n     Act. On December 12, 2009, the Philadelphia Inquirer began a \n     series of articles that served as a blistering indictment of \n     the Philadelphia criminal justice system. The Inquirer \n     described it as ``a system that all too often fails to punish \n     violent criminals, fails to protect witnesses, fails to catch \n     thousands of fugitives, fails to decide cases on their \n     merits--fails to provide justice.'' (Craig R. McCoy, Nancy \n     Phillips, and Dylan Purcell, Justice: Delayed, Dismissed, \n     Denied, Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 12, 2009). Three days \n     later, on December 15, 2009, the Philadelphia Inquirer \n     elaborated on the fugitive problem noting that as of November \n     2009, ``there were 46,801 long-term fugitives--suspects \n     generally on the run for at least a year. The bulk of these \n     fugitives date from this decade and the last.'' (Dylan \n     Purcell, Craig R. McCoy, and Nancy Phillips, Violent \n     Criminals Flout Broken Bail System, Tens of Thousands of \n     Philadelphia Fugitives are on the Streets, Abetted by the \n     City's Deeply Flawed Program, Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 15, \n     2009). The article reported that Philadelphia ``[f]ugitives \n     now owe taxpayers a whopping $1 billion in forfeited bail, \n     according to court officials who computed the figure . . .'' \n     (Id.). Despite the obvious incentive to recapture those funds \n     in this era of budget shortfalls, the article noted, that the \n     ``Clerk of Quarter Sessions Office . . . has never kept a \n     computerized list of the debtors.''\n       These problems warranted Senate hearings and in my capacity \n     as the Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and \n     Drugs, I held a field hearing in Philadelphia titled, \n     ``Exploring Federal Solutions to the State and Local Fugitive \n     Crisis,'' on January 19, 2010. What we learned was that \n     Philadelphia's fugitive problem, though serious in scope, is \n     not just a local problem but is in fact a significant \n     national problem.\n       Nationwide, there are an estimated 2.7 million active \n     Federal, State, and local outstanding felony warrants. Many \n     of these fugitives commit additional crimes. Every day large \n     numbers of fugitives evade capture because state and local \n     law enforcement authorities have insufficient resources to \n     find and arrest them. And even if found, state and local law \n     enforcement authorities often do not have the funds to pay \n     for the fugitive's extradition to face trial. Shockingly, \n     many fugitives are released without prosecution.\n       The nationwide database operated by the FBI's National \n     Crime Information Center (``NCIC'') is missing over half of \n     the country's 2.7 million felony warrants, including warrants \n     for hundreds of thousands of violent crimes. Fugitives who \n     have fled to another state will not be caught--even if they \n     are stopped and questioned by the police on a routine traffic \n     stop--because their warrants have not been entered into the \n     NCIC database.\n       In early 2008, the St. Louis Post Dispatch published a \n     series of articles--affirmed by the Department of Justice \n     documenting law enforcement's widespread failure to find and \n     arrest fugitives. For purposes of the series, ``fugitive'' \n     included un-arrested suspects with pending warrants that law \n     enforcement cannot find, and those who cannot be found after \n     violating the rules of their pre-trial detention, probation, \n     or parole. The articles revealed that the reach of this \n     national problem is extensive and cited federal estimates \n     from two years ago that as many as an estimated 800,000 to \n     1.6 million outstanding state or local warrants are \n     inaccessible to law enforcement outside the state or locality \n     in which they were issued because the information about the \n     warrants had not been entered into the NCIC database.\n       In Philadelphia, while all warrants, including bench \n     warrants, are entered into a state database, only a small \n     fraction of these warrants is entered into the NCIC database. \n     The Philadelphia Police Department only enters into the NCIC \n     database a few hundred bench warrants deemed by the District \n     Attorney's Office to concern extraditable offenses and \n     surprisingly the Police Departments makes these entries \n     manually and not by automatic computer transfers. Thus, those \n     who abscond from criminal proceedings in Philadelphia and \n     flee to other states likely will not be captured because \n     information from their warrants is not automatically entered \n     into the NCIC database.\n       Last Congress, on June 16, 2008, then-Senator Biden \n     introduced the FIND Act (S. 3136), that sought to address \n     similar problems. At the time, Senator Biden said, ``Too \n     often, State and local law enforcement agencies enter \n     warrants into the State and local databases, but not into the \n     national database.'' His statement was prescient then and is \n     still true now. By September 2008, Senator Biden had been \n     joined by Senators Clinton and Durbin as cosponsors and the \n     bill had passed the Judiciary Committee.\n       Today I take up Vice President Biden's mantle and, along \n     with Senator Durbin, introduce the ``Fugitive Information \n     Networked Database Act of 2010,'' the FIND Act. This bill \n     directs the Attorney General to make a total of $10 million \n     in grants each fiscal year 2011 through 2015 to states and \n     Indian tribes for use in developing and implementing or \n     upgrading secure electronic warrant management systems for \n     the preparation, submission, and validation of state felony \n     warrants that are interoperable with the NCIC database. A \n     portion of these grant funds can be used to hire additional \n     personnel to validate warrants entered into the NCIC \n     database. The bill also directs the Attorney General to make \n     a total of $30 million in grants each fiscal year 2011 to \n     2015 to states and Indian tribes for extraditing fugitives \n     for prosecution and encourages their participation in the \n     U.S. Marshal's Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation \n     Service (``JPATS'') program. The bill directs the Comptroller \n     General to submit a statistical report to the House and \n     Senate Judiciary Committees on felony warrants issued by \n     state, local, and tribal governments and entered into the \n     NCIC database and on the apprehension and extradition of \n     persons with active felony warrants.\n       Finally, in an enhancement of the prior FIND Act, this new \n     bill requires any state seeking a grant renewal to file \n     public reports with the Attorney General and within its own \n     county clerk's offices indicating (i) the number of \n     defendants assessed or interviewed for pretrial release; (ii) \n     the number of indigent defendants included in (i); (iii) the \n     total number of failures to appear for all defendants \n     released; and (iv) the number and type of infractions \n     committed by defendants while on pretrial release.\n       I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation \n     which is designed to facilitate state and local data entry \n     into the NCIC database through grants, increase the \n     extradition of fugitives travelling in interstate commerce \n     and to ascertain whether our pretrial release programs are \n     operating effectively. The fugitive problem is national in \n     scope, involves individuals travelling in interstate \n     commerce, and requires federal solutions. By enacting this \n     bill, we take an important first step.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fugitive Information \n     Networked Database Act of 2010'' or the ``FIND Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nationwide, there are an estimated 2,700,000 active \n     Federal, State, and local warrants for the arrest of persons \n     charged with felony crimes.\n       (2) State and local law enforcement authorities have \n     insufficient resources to devote to searching for and \n     apprehending fugitives. As a result, large numbers of \n     fugitives evade arrest. State and local law enforcement \n     authorities also lack resources for extraditing fugitives who \n     have been arrested in other States. As a result, such \n     fugitives frequently are released without prosecution.\n       (3) Increasing the resources available for conducting \n     fugitive investigations and transporting fugitives between \n     States would increase the number of fugitives who are \n     arrested and prosecuted.\n       (4) The United States Marshals Service (referred to in this \n     Act as the ``USMS'') plays an integral role in the \n     apprehension of fugitives in the United States, and has a \n     long history of providing assistance and expertise to \n     Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in support \n     of fugitive investigations, including through 82 District \n     Task Forces, and through the 7 Regional Fugitive Task Force \n     Programs that have partnered with Federal, State and local \n     law enforcement agencies to locate and apprehend fugitives.\n       (5) The USMS utilizes the Justice Prisoner and Alien \n     Transportation Service (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``JPATS'') to transport Federal detainees and prisoners. It \n     also makes JPATS available to State and local law enforcement \n     agencies on a reimbursable, space-available basis for the \n     purpose of transporting a fugitive from the place where the \n     fugitive was arrested to the jurisdiction\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\n     that issued the warrant for the arrest of the fugitive. \n     Through JPATS, these agencies are able to reduce the cost of \n     extradition significantly.\n       (6) Expanding the availability of JPATS to State and local \n     law enforcement agencies would lower the cost of transporting \n     fugitives for extradition and lead to the prosecution of a \n     greater number of fugitives.\n       (7) Since 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has \n     operated the National Crime Information Center, which \n     administers a nationwide database containing criminal history \n     information from the Federal Government and the States, \n     including outstanding arrest warrants. The National Crime \n     Information Center database allows a law enforcement officer \n     who stops a person in 1 State to obtain information about a \n     warrant for that person issued in another State. It contains \n     approximately 1,700,000 felony and misdemeanor warrants. It \n     is missing nearly half of the 2,800,000 to 3,200,000 of the \n     felony warrants issued across the Nation, including warrants \n     for hundreds of thousands of violent crimes.\n       (8) The failure of a State to enter a warrant into the \n     National Crime Information Center database enables a fugitive \n     to escape arrest even when the fugitive is stopped by a law \n     enforcement officer in another State, because the officer is \n     not aware there was a warrant issued for the fugitive. Many \n     of such fugitives go on to commit additional crimes. In \n     addition, such fugitives pose a danger to law enforcement \n     officers who encounter them without knowledge of the pending \n     charges against the fugitives or their record of fleeing law \n     enforcement authorities.\n       (9) All warrants entered into the National Crime \n     Information Center database must be validated on a regular \n     basis to ensure that the information in the warrant is still \n     accurate and that the warrant is still active.\n       (10) Improving the entry and validation of warrants in the \n     National Crime Information Center database would enable law \n     enforcement officers to identify and arrest a larger number \n     of fugitives, improve the safety of these officers, and \n     better protect communities from crime.\n       (11) Federal funds for State and local law enforcement are \n     most effective when they do not supplant, but rather \n     supplement State and local funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to require the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a program to \nassist eligible schools and nonprofit entities\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nthrough grants and technical assistance to implement farm to school \nprograms that improve access to local foods in eligible schools; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my Growing Farm \nto School Programs Act of 2010. This important proposal will support \ngrassroots efforts all across our Nation to improve the health and \nwell-being of children while supporting local farmers and bolstering \nlocal economies.\n  I am pleased to have 13 of my respected Senate colleagues from across \nthe country join with me today as original cosponsors of this bill. \nFarm to School is a proven, common-sense, community-driven approach to \nincorporate farm fresh local food into school meals. Schools nationwide \nunderstand the many benefits of farm to school but often lack the \nstartup funding and the technical capacity to plan and implement the \nprogram. This bill will provide the important seed money and technical \nassistance needed to enable our schools to teach children about good \nnutrition and show them the importance of agriculture while also \nsupporting local farms.\n  It is amazing how far some farm products travel to get to our school \ncafeterias, and how heavily processed it is when it arrives. While our \nNation's schools should provide an enormous market for our struggling \nsmall and mid-sized farmers, for far too long the products grown by our \nfamily farms have largely been absent from school lunch trays. We \nshould not be surprised that many kids today do not understand the link \nbetween the food they eat and farms on which it is raised. By offering \nour children local, fresh, less-processed choices, and a chance to \nlearn how and where their food is grown we can also provide economic \nbenefits for small, local farms and keep food dollars within the \ncommunity.\n  Communities and schools all across our Nation are beginning to link \nfarms and school with great success. In my home State of Vermont, from \nrural towns across the state to the city of Burlington, many of our \nschools have integrated school meals with classroom learning and local \nagriculture. As more schools create these important connections, \nneighboring communities are often also eager to start similar programs. \nUnfortunately many of these schools do not have sufficient staff, \nexpertise, equipment, or funding to start a Farm to School program on \ntheir own. The Growing Farm to Schools Programs Act will provide the \nsmall amount of funding and technical assistance that these schools \nneed to create a program. Once in place, these programs can be expected \nto be self-sustaining.\n  In introducing the Growing Farm to School Programs Act of 2010, I am \nhoping that we will be able to provide more communities, schools, and \nfarmers the opportunity to grow and cultivate Farm to School programs. \nI thank my 13 co-sponsors and urge my other colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this exciting initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
