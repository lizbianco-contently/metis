We have two issues we are going to have to vote on. One is \nthe START treaty, we have to complete work on that, and we have to \ncomplete work on the 9/11 bill for the emergency workers who have been \ndevastated with illnesses as a result of all the toxins they inhaled \nduring the time they were working there. Some are really ill. So I hope \nwe can get that done quickly.\n  I am working with the Republican leader on nominations. We have made \na little progress on that. I hope to do better. I look forward to \ncooperation to finish this work. Last year, we were here at this time \nup until Christmas Eve. I hope we don't have to do that this year.

Mr. President, over the weekend, I indicated that I \nwould be voting against the START treaty. This morning, I would like to \nexplain my decision in a little more detail. And I will begin with the \nmost obvious objection.\n  First and foremost, a decision of this magnitude should not be \ndecided under the pressure of a deadline. The American people don't \nwant us to squeeze our most important work into the final days of a \nsession. They want us to take the time we need to make informed, \nresponsible decisions. The Senate can do better than to have the \nconsideration of a treaty interrupted by a series of controversial \npolitical items.\n  So leaving aside for a moment any substantive concerns, and we have \nmany, this is reason enough to delay a vote. No Senator should be \nforced to make decisions like this so we can tick off another item on \nsomeone's political check list before the end of the year.\n  Yet looking back over the past 2 years, it becomes apparent why the \nadministration would attempt to rush this treaty. And it is in this \ncontext that we discover another important reason to oppose it. I am \nreferring, of course, to the administration's pattern of rushing to a \npolicy judgment, and then subsequently studying the problem that the \npolicy decision was intended to address, a pattern that again and again \ncreated more problems and complications than we started out with.\n  First there was the Executive Order to close Guantanamo Bay without \nany plan for dealing with the detainee population there. As we now \nknow, the administration had no plan for returning terrorists who were \nheld at Guantanamo to Yemen, and it is still grappling with questions \nof how best to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n  Next was the President's rush to remove the intelligence community \nfrom interrogating captured terrorists, without any consideration as to \nhow to deal with them, whether they were captured on the battlefield or \nat an airport in Detroit. This became all the more concerning when the \nPresident announced his surge strategy in Afghanistan, which \npredictably led to more prisoners. And even in announcing the strategy \nitself, the President decided to set a date for withdrawal without any \nsense at the time of what the state of the conflict would be in July \n2011.\n  Then there was the administration's approach on don't ask, don't \ntell. The President announced his determination to repeal this policy \nduring his campaign, before the military had the time to study whether \nthis change in policy was in the best interest of combat readiness, \nbefore senior enlisted staff and noncommissioned officers of the \nmilitary had testified, and before those who are currently serving had \ntold us whether, in their expert opinion, the policy should be \nrepealed. Moreover, when the Commandant of the Marine Corps suggested \nthe change would harm unit cohesion, he was ignored.\n  The administration has taken the same cart-before-the-horse approach \non the treaty before us. In this case, the President came to office \nwith a long-term plan to reduce the Nation's arsenal of nuclear weapons \nand their role in our national security policy. The plan envisioned a \nquick agreement to replace the START treaty that was allowed to expire, \nwith no bridging agreement for arms inspections, followed by efforts to \nstrengthen international commitments to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, \nreconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and further \nreductions in nuclear arms over time. And he spoke of ultimately \nreducing nuclear weapons to ``global zero.''\n  In other words, the New START treaty was just a first step, and it \nneeded to be done quickly. Leave aside for a moment the fact that the \nNew START treaty does nothing to significantly reduce the Russian \nFederation's stockpile of strategic arms, ignores the thousands of \ntactical weapons in the Russian arsenal, and contains an important \nconcession linking missile defense to the strategic arms. We had to \nrush this treaty, according to the logic of the administration, because \nit had become an important component in the effort to ``reset'' the \nbilateral relationship with the Russian Federation. It was brought up \nfor debate prematurely because it was the first step in a pre-\ndetermined arms control agenda. The Senate's constitutional role of \nadvice and consent became an inconvenient impediment.\n  The debate over the McCain amendment to strike the language in the \npreamble of the treaty was instructive. The language in the preamble \nconcerning missile defense is harmful to\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\nour foreign policy because of how it will be viewed not by our \nPresident, but how it will be viewed by our allies in Europe and by the \nRussians. The Russian government opposed the Bush administration plan \nto place 10 silo-based missiles in Poland and a fixed radar \ninstallation in the Czech Republic. Although the Bush administration \nhad reached agreement with the governments of our two allies, and the \nproposed ballistic missile defense plan posed no threat to Russia's \noverwhelming ability to strike Europe and the United States, Russia \nsought to coerce our eastern European allies.\n  It is worth noting that neither Poland nor the Czech Republic \nratified the agreements to go forward with the plan, which the Obama \nadministration cancelled. The McCain amendment would have removed any \nstrategic ambiguity that the Russian Federation will exploit to \nintimidate NATO members. Many of our NATO partners have been slow to \naccept the concept of territorial missile defense, and rest assured \nthat they will be slower to fund the program. It is a certainty that if \nthe language in the preamble survives, and this treaty is ratified, the \nRussians will mount a campaign to obstruct missile defense in Europe. \nThere is no good argument for having voted against the McCain \nAmendment, which would have significantly improved this treaty.\n  The principal argument raised against the McCain amendment was that \nany amendment to the treaty would result in the State Department having \nto return to a negotiation with the Russian Federation. That may be \ntrue, or the amended treaty could be considered by the Russian Duma. In \neither case, the argument brings into question the Senate's role in \nproviding advice and consent to ratification. If it is the position of \nthe majority that the treaty cannot be amended, as the Senate was \nunable to amend so many other matters before us these last weeks of \nthis session, why have any debate at all?\n  This leads us to the subject of verification--a second matter of \nserious concern. Although the Senate will meet today in closed session \nto discuss the flawed nature of the verification procedures envisioned \nby the New START treaty, the majority has filed cloture and stated that \nthe treaty cannot be amended. The senior Senator from Missouri, the \nvice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has provided his views to \nthe Senate on this matter, and I join him in his concerns.\n  Senator Bond has provided a classified assessment of the details \nrelated to verification and chances of Russian breakout of the treaty's \nwarhead limits which is available for all Senators to review. To quote \nthe vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n\n       I have reviewed the key intelligence on our ability to \n     monitor this treaty and heard from our intelligence \n     professionals. There is no doubt in my mind that the United \n     States cannot reliably verify the treaty's 1,550 limit on \n     deployed warheads.\n\n  I agree with the conclusion that the New START treaty central warhead \nlimit of 1,550 cannot be conclusively verified. The New Start treaty \nallows the Russians to deploy missiles without a standard or uniform \nnumber of warheads. The limited number of warhead inspections provided \nfor under this treaty also limits the access of our inspectors to an \nupper limit of three percent of the Russian force. It can thus be said \nthat this treaty places higher confidence in trust than on \nverification.\n  Compounding these concerns is the history of Russian treaty \nviolations. As the State Department's recent reports on arms control \ncompliance make clear, the Russians have previously violated provisions \nof the START treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Conventional \nForces in Europe treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention.\n  This is a not a track record to be rewarded with greater trust. It is \na reason to take our verification duties even more seriously.\n  Despite my opposition to this treaty, I hope the President remains \ncommitted to modernizing the nuclear triad. The war on terror has \nrequired an expansion of our nation's ground forces, the Marine Corps, \nthe Army, and our Special Operations Forces, and our near-term \nreadiness. As we continue the effort to dismantle, defeat and disrupt \nal-Qaida, we must also plan for the threats that our country will face \nin the coming decades.\n\n  We must invest not only in the delivery systems and platforms that \nwill preserve our nuclear delivery capability, such as the next \ngeneration bomber, nuclear submarines and a new intercontinental \nballistic missile, but also in the strike aircraft and naval forces \nrequired to control the Pacific rim as economic growth and the military \ncapabilities of China increase.\n  Although the President has decided there is value in pursuing a \ndisarmament agenda, this country may determine in the coming years to \nplace a greater reliance upon the role of strategic arms, and we must \nremain committed to defense modernization. Our Nation faces many \nchallenges in the coming decades, some economic, some strategic. It \nwould seem short-sighted to think that as North Korea, Iran and others \nwork to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities we could draw our arsenal \ndown to zero.\n  So I will oppose this treaty. I thank the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees for the service that they have provided the Senate in \nreviewing it. It is unfortunate that something as important as the \nSenate's consideration of a treaty like this one was truncated in order \nto meet another arbitrary deadline or the wish list of the liberal \nbase. And it is deeply troubling to think that a legislative body \ncharged with the solemn responsibility of advice and consent would be \ndeprived of this role because it would inconvenience our negotiating \npartners.\n  As debate over this treaty has intensified over the past few days, \nthese and other concerns have become increasingly apparent to a number \nof Senators and to the American people. We should wait until every one \nof them is addressed. Our top concern should be the safety and security \nof our Nation, not some politician's desire to declare a political \nvictory and host a press conference before the first of the year. \nAmericans have had more than enough of artificial timelines set by \npoliticians eager for attention. They want us to focus on their \nconcerns, not ours, and never more so than on matters of national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to say a few \nwords in response to the minority leader. I have great respect for the \nminority leader. He and I came to the Senate together in the same \nclass, and I appreciate the difficulties of his job and certainly the \ndifficulties of corralling any number of the different personalities. \nThe same is true for the majority leader. These are tough jobs.\n  But I say to my friend from Kentucky that just because you say \nsomething doesn't make it true. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle seem to have a habit of repeating things that have been \ncompletely refuted by every fact there is. Our old friend Patrick \nMoynihan used to remind all of us in the Senate and in the country that \neverybody is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled \nto their\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\nown facts. John Adams made that famous statement that facts are \nstubborn things. Mr. President, facts are stubborn things.\n  The facts are that this treaty is not being rushed. This treaty was \ndelayed at the request of Republicans. This treaty was delayed 13 times \nseparately by Senator Lugar to respect their desire to have more time \nto deal with the modernization issue, which the administration has \ncompletely, totally, thoroughly dealt with in good faith. I would like \nto know where the good faith comes from on the other side occasionally. \nThey put extra money in. They sat and negotiated. They sent people to \nArizona to brief Senator Kyl personally. For weeks, we delayed the \nprocession of moving forward on this treaty in order to accommodate our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. And now, fully accommodated, \nwith their requests entirely met, they come back and say, oh, it is \nbeing rushed.\n  Well, today marks our sixth day of debate on the New START treaty. \nThat is a fact--6 days of debate on the New START treaty. Now they will \ncome to the floor and say that we had an intervening vote here or \nthere. Sure. That is the way the Senate works. That is the way it \nworked when they passed the first START treaty in 5 days. We are now \nspending more time on this treaty than we did on a far more complicated \ntreaty, at a far more complicated time. The fact is that if we go \nthrough today, which we will, on this treaty, and depending what \nhappens with cloture and when the other side decides they want to vote, \nwe can be here for 9 days on this treaty, which is more time than we \nwould have spent on the START treaty, START II treaty, and the Moscow \nTreaty. With the time it took other Senates to deal with three \ntreaties, these folks are complaining about the time to take one \ntreaty, and it will be more time. It is astounding to me.\n  I hope people in the country will see through this. When the leader \ncomes to the floor and says our national security is being driven by \npolitics, we need to step back and calm down for a moment and think \nabout what is at stake. This treaty is in front of the Senate now not \nbecause of some political schedule; it is here because the Republicans \nasked us to delay it. We wanted to hold this vote before the election. \nWhat was the argument then by our friends on the other side of the \naisle? ``Oh, no, please don't do that; that will politicize the \ntreaty.'' And so in order to not politicize the treaty, we made a \ndecision on our side to accommodate their interests. Having \naccommodated their interests, they now turn around and say: You guys \nare terrible, you are bringing this treaty up at the last minute. Is \nthere no shame ever with respect to the arguments that are made \nsometimes on the floor of the Senate? Is the idea always, just say it, \nsay it enough, go out there and repeat it, and somewhere it will \nstick--maybe in the rightwing blogosphere or somewhere--and people will \nget agitated enough and believe this is being jammed somehow?\n  This is on the floor for the sixth day. It is a simple add-on treaty \nto everything that has gone before, over all the years of arms control. \nIt is a simple add-on treaty and extension of the START I treaty.\n  This is not a new principle; it is not complicated. It is \nparticularly not complicated when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Secretary of State, and every prior Republican Secretary of State \nall say ratify this treaty, ratify it now. We need it now.\n  Honestly, I scratch my head and am baffled at the place we have \nseemingly arrived at, where national security interests of our country \nare going to get wrapped up in ideology, politics, and all of the \nthings that have commanded everybody's attention over the course of the \nlast couple of years.\n  We did have an election a few weeks ago. It has been much referred to \nby our colleagues. It did signal the need to do some things \ndifferently. One of the things it signaled the need to do differently \nis something like the START treaty, where the American people expect us \nto come to the floor and do the Nation's business, particularly the \nbusiness of keeping America safer.\n  We have had an excellent debate so far. The two amendments that were \nproposed were rejected overwhelmingly--60 to 30 was the last one. We \nhad a number of people who were absent. That is a pretty pronounced \nstatement by the Senate. It seems to me the Senator from Kentucky just \nsaid the major argument for not approving one of those amendments was \nthat it would require us to go back and renegotiate. No, Mr. Leader, \nthat is not the major argument. That is an argument that underscores \nthe major argument, which is that the language has no meaning. The \nlanguage doesn't affect missile defense. The major arguments are the \nfacts, the substance of which is that the preamble language has no \nimpact whatsoever on what we are going to do with respect to missile \ndefense, and everybody who has anything to do with missile defense in \nthis administration has said that. That is the major argument. In \naddition, the major argument is also that Henry Kissinger and Donald \nRumsfeld and Secretary Gates have all said that language that has no \nlegal impact and is just an expression of a truism--the reality that \noffense and defense have a relationship.\n  Are we not capable in the Senate of overlooking nonbinding, nonlegal, \nnonimpacting language that acknowledges a simple truth about the \nrelationship of offense and defense in the nature of arms control? That \nis all it does. That is the major argument. It just happens that in \naddition to having no impact on our defense, and no impact legally, and \nno impact that is binding--in addition to that, it also requires going \nback to the Russians and renegotiating the treaty. As we will show in \nthe classified session today, there are a lot of reasons why that \ndoesn't make sense from the security interests of the United States of \nAmerica. It is not that we should not do our job of advice and consent, \nbut our job of advice and consent requires us to process the facts, \nrequires us to think seriously about what those facts are and how they \nimpact this treaty.\n  If the Senate does its job of thinking seriously about this treaty, \nit will separate out language that has no impact and no meaning \nwhatsoever on our national missile defense plans, or on the treaty \nitself. I don't know how the President could make it more clear than in \nthe letter he wrote to the leadership, in which he said as clearly as \npossible:\n\n       The United States did not and does not agree with the \n     Russian statement. We believe that continued development and \n     deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, including \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation. Regardless of Russia's actions in this \n     regard, as long as I am President, as long as the Congress \n     provides the necessary funding, the United States will \n     continue to develop and deploy effective missile defenses to \n     protect the United States, our deployed forces, and our \n     allies and our partners.\n\n  I don't know how you can make it more clear than that. Those are the \nfacts. It is my understanding that today the Joint Chiefs will all be \nsubmitting an additional statement for the record here to make it clear \nit is their view that this treaty has absolutely no negative impact \nwhatsoever on our missile defense, and they believe it is entirely \nverifiable, and they want to see it ratified. So the issue of advice \nand consent here is whether we are going to follow the advice of those \nwhom we look to on military matters, on defense intelligence matters, \non security matters--those statespeople who have argued these treaties \nand negotiated these treaties through the years. The Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs, the Commander of U.S. \nStrategic Command--and this is Secretary Gates:\n\n       I assess that Russia will not be able to achieve militarily \n     significant cheating or breakout under the New START. Our \n     analysis of the NIE and potential for Russia cheating or \n     breakout confirms the treaty's verification regime is \n     effective.\n\n  I hope that facts will control this debate, that the security \ninterests of our country will control this debate, that those who have \ncreated this record for the Senate to weigh--we have been on this \ntreaty for a year and a half not just for 6 days. Sixty Members of the \nSenate--the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthe National Intelligence Committee, the National Security Working \nGroup, which I cochair with Senator Kyl--have all met and considered \nthis treaty. Some people have gone to Geneva and actually met with the \nnegotiators. The negotiators met with us\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\nhere. Before the treaty was even signed, we were weighing in on this \ntreaty. We considered it in over 21 hearings and meetings over the \ncourse of the last 6 months. This is not 6 days. Let's not kid the \nAmerican people. This is not 6 days. Three other treaties, one of which \nhad no verification at all--that treaty received a 95-to-0 vote.\n  The American people voted for us to stop the politics. They voted for \nus to act like adults and do the business of this country. I believe \nvoting on this treaty in these next hours and days is our opportunity \nto live up to the hopes of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, a great deal of our day will be spent on \ndiscussing the verification regime of the New START treaty. A part of \nthat will be in closed session. But I want to initiate additional \ndebate this morning on the New START verification regime.\n  The important point is that today we have zero on the ground \nverification capability for Russian strategic forces, given that START \nI expired on December 5, 2009, more than a year ago.\n  Opponents of New START's verification regime have emphasized a \npeculiar argument, in my judgment. On the one hand we are told we do \nnot need New START because it is a Cold War relic and that more modern \napproaches to arms control should be sought. On the other hand, \nopponents lament the passing of START I's Cold War verification regime.\n  I ask my colleagues which one should it be. Should we prefer \nmodernized verification for a post-Cold War world that reflects the \nlack of an arms race and our military's desire for flexible force \nstructures? Or should we resort back to Cold War verification?\n  The fact is, President Bush's Moscow Treaty, approved by a vote of 95 \nto 0, as the chairman just mentioned, contained no verification \nwhatsoever. Some would cite this as a modern approach to arms control. \nThey fail to mention that the Moscow Treaty explicitly relied on START \nI's verification regime. As I noted, START I expired more than a year \nago.\n  I point out parenthetically that at numerous hearings in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, those who extol the virtues of the Moscow \nTreaty--which, as I pointed out, was ratified 95 to 0--indicated we \nwere in a new day. When we asked in that particular context how about \nverification, they said there is already verification under START I. We \npointed out even then that it would expire in December of 2009. But it \nwas fully anticipated by those advocating the Moscow Treaty that we \nwould have another START regime by that point or that verification \napparently would not be needed at all.\n  Some Senators say we could have just extended START I and kept the \nMoscow Treaty in place. This, again, overlooks the fact that our \nmilitary, in particular, disliked aspects of START I and advocated for \na more flexible approach in START II or the New START.\n  Under START, the United States conducted inspections of weapons, \ntheir facilities, their delivery vehicles, and warheads in Russia, \nKazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. These inspections fulfilled a crucial \nnational security interest by greatly reducing the possibility that we \nwould be surprised by future advancements in Russian weapons technology \nor deployment. Only through ratification of New START will U.S. \ntechnicians return to Russia to resume verification.\n  New START verification should not be evaluated by Cold War standards. \nDuring the Cold War, we wanted to constrain the arms race and improve \nstability by encouraging a shift away from ICBMs with multiple \nwarheads. Neither of these objectives remain today. START was \nnegotiated at a time when the former Soviet Union had more than 10,000 \nnuclear warheads on more than 6,000 missiles and bombers, most of them \ntargeted against the United States and our allies.\n  Under New START, the United States and Russia each will deploy no \nmore than 1,550 warheads for strategic deterrence. Seven years from \nentry into force, the Russian Federation is likely to have only about \n350 deployed missiles. This smaller number of strategic nuclear systems \nwill be deployed at fewer bases, as has been pointed out earlier in the \ndebate.\n  While we inspected 70 facilities under START, many of these have been \nshut down in recent years. Under New START, we will be inspecting only \n35 Russian facilities. It is likely that Russia will close down even \nmore bases over the life of the treaty.\n  Both sides agreed at the outset that each would be free to structure \nits forces as it sees fit, a view consistent with that of the Bush \nadministration. As a practical economic matter, conditions in Russia \npreclude a massive restructuring of its strategic forces.\n  For the United States, the New START treaty will allow for flexible \nmodernization and operation of U.S. strategic forces while facilitating \ntransparency regarding the development and the deployment of Russian \nstrategic forces.\n  The treaty, protocol, and annexes contain a detailed set of rules and \nprocedures for verification of the New START treaty, many of them drawn \nfrom START I. Negotiators took the experience of onsite inspection that \nwas well honed during START I and tailored it to the new circumstances \nof today. The inspection regime contained in New START is designed to \nprovide each party confidence that the other is upholding its \nobligations while also being simpler and safer for the inspectors to \nimplement, less operationally disruptive for our strategic forces, and \nless costly than START's regime.\n  Secretary Gates recently wrote to Congress that ``the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs, the Commander, U.S. Strategic \nCommand, and I assess that Russia will not be able to achieve \nmilitarily significant cheating or breakout under New START due to both \nthe New START verification regime and the inherent survivability and \nflexibility of the planned U.S. strategic force structure.''\n  That is a very important statement, in my judgment, that Secretary \nGates, with affirmation of all of the above officials of our \ngovernment, says that Russia will not be able to achieve militarily \nsignificant cheating or breakout under New START given the verification \nprocedures we have outlined.\n  Predictably, recent verification and compliance reports covering \nSTART have chronicled cases where we disagreed with Russia about START \nI implementation. Yet despite these issues, neither party violated \nSTART I's central limits. We should not expect that New START will \neliminate friction, but the treaty will provide a means to deal with \nsuch differences constructively, as under START I.\n  The resolution of ratification approved by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee of the Senate requires further assurances by conditioning \nratification on Presidential certification prior to the treaty's entry \ninto force, of our ability to monitor Russian compliance, and on \nimmediate consultations should a Russian breakout from the treaty be \ndetected. For the first time in any strategic arms control treaty, a \ncondition requires a plan for New START monitoring.\n\n  Some have asserted there are too few inspections in New START. The \ntreaty does provide for fewer inspections compared to START I. But this \nis because fewer facilities will require inspection under New START. \nSTART I covered 70 facilities in four Soviet successor states, whereas \nNew START only applies to Russia and its 35 facilities. Therefore, we \nneed fewer inspectors to achieve a comparable level of oversight.\n  New START also maintains the same number of ``re-entry vehicle on-\nsite inspections'' as START I; namely, 10 per year. Baseline \ninspections that were phased out in New START are no longer needed \nbecause we have 15 years of START I treaty implementation and data on \nwhich to rely. Of course, if New START is not ratified for a lengthy \nperiod, the efficacy of our baseline data would eventually deteriorate.\n  New START includes the innovation that unique identifiers, or UIDs, \nbe affixed to all Russian missiles and nuclear-capable heavy bombers. \nUIDs were applied only to Russian road-mobile missiles in START 1. \nRegular exchanges of UID data will provide confidence and transparency \nregarding the existence and location of 700 deployed missiles, even \nwhen they are on nondeployed status--something that START I did not do.\n  The New START treaty also codifies and continues important \nverification\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\nenhancements related to warhead loading on Russian ICBMs and SLBMs. \nThese enhancements, originally agreed to during START I implementation, \nallow for greater transparency in confirming the number of warheads on \neach missile.\n  Under START I and the INF Treaty, the United States maintained a \ncontinuous onsite presence of up to 30 technicians at Votkinsk, Russia, \nto conduct monitoring of final assembly of Russian strategic systems \nusing solid rocket motors. While this portal monitoring is not \ncontinued under New START, the decision to phase out this arrangement \nwas made by the Bush administration in anticipation of START I's \nexpiration. With vastly lower rates of Russian missile production, \ncontinuous monitoring is not crucial, as it was during the Cold War.\n  The Moscow Treaty's verification shortcomings were dismissed during \ndebate in the Senate in 2003 because we were told there would be time \nto fix them before START I expired--something we failed to achieve.\n  The only binding treaty of any kind in place is the Moscow Treaty \nwhich itself will expire in December of 2012, and the Moscow Treaty \ncontains no counting rules and no verification.\n  An illustration of the benefits of New START compared to the Moscow \nTreaty: We will have data on the number, by type, of deployed, fixed \nland-based ICBMs and SLBMs and their launchers. This is not in the \nMoscow Treaty.\n  Secondly, we will have data on the number, by type, if they exist, of \ndeployed and nondeployed road-mobile and rail-mobile ICBMs and their \nlaunchers, and the production of mobile ICBMs. This, too, is not in the \nMoscow Treaty.\n  We will know, thanks to New START preinspection procedures, the \nactual number of warheads emplaced on each ICBM or SLBM subject to the \ninspection. The warhead inspection portion of a New START inspection on \na deployed missile is used to confirm the accuracy of the declared data \non the actual number of warheads emplaced on a designated, deployed \nICBM or SLBM. This is not in the Moscow Treaty.\n  We will have data and inspections for the number of warheads on ICBMs \nand SLBMs. This is not in the Moscow Treaty.\n  For the first time, we will have identification and tracking of all \nnondeployed Russian missiles--nondeployed Russian missiles--not just \nroad-mobile missiles, a unique verification system under New START.\n  We will have declarations, notifications, and inspections on the \naggregate number of deployed missiles.\n  We will have data on the technical parameters for ballistic missiles \nthrough technical exhibitions/inspections for missiles, and we will \nhave data on the number, by type, of deployed heavy bombers, both those \nthat are equipped for nuclear-capable weapons and those that are not, \nand the number, by type, of formerly nuclear-capable heavy bombers, \ntraining aircraft, and heavy bombers equipped for conventional \nmunitions that no longer carry nuclear munitions. We will have data and \ninspections on the elimination of strategic nuclear launchers and \ndelivery vehicles. We will have tracking, notification, and inspection \nof the production of ICBMs for mobile launchers of ICBMs to confirm the \nnumber of ICBMs for mobile launchers of ICBMs produced. And we will \nhave data and inspections on the elimination of declared facilities.\n  The bottom line is that every Senator should ponder today that we \nhave zero on-the-ground verification capability for Russian strategic \nforces, given the fact that START I expired on December 5, 2009. Those \nwho wish to reject this treaty and rely on the Moscow Treaty enjoy the \nsame result--zero verification, because the Moscow Treaty contains \nnone.\n  I appreciate that we have had vigorous debate not only on the \nverification procedures but likewise on missile defense and, for that \nmatter, the entire negotiation of the treaty. In my judgment, it is \nimportant, given the outline I have explained this morning, no \nverification and none anticipated until we pass the New START treaty. \nUnless there are those--and there have been throughout the history of \nthese debates--who simply do not like treaties with the Russians, who \nwould prefer no treaty, who anticipate that some day perfection may \ncome and some negotiation will take place that is clearly not in sight, \nif rejection of this treaty were to be recorded. I believe it is \nimperative for our national defense and national security. That is a \npersonal judgment but it is one I strongly advocate. This is why I \nbelieve that progress on the New START treaty is extremely important \nfor the national security of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, procedurally we have two amendments right \nnow that are pending, my amendment No. 4833 and the Thune amendment No. \n4841. Mine is concerning verification. His concerns delivery systems. \nWe will have up until 1:30, when we go into closed session, to debate \nthese. It would be my hope that Members who want to debate would \nconfine their debate only to these two amendments. Because if they \ndon't and we let the time get beyond this, not as many people will be \nheard on these amendments. I know the Senator from North Dakota wants \nto speak. I encourage anyone wanting to speak on the treaty other than \nthese two amendments to defer to those who want to speak on these \namendments. That is not a unanimous consent request. It is something I \nthink is appropriate to do. These are significant amendments. A good \nway to do that, if someone wants to talk about the treaty other than \nthese two amendments and there is someone wanting to talk about the \namendments, I would hope they would defer to those who want to talk \nabout the amendments.\n  Let me make a comment about the Senator from Massachusetts. When we \ntalk about the fact that we have been on this thing longer than any \nother treaty, for years and months and all that, I remind him, I am \nkind of in a unique situation. I am on both the Armed Services and \nForeign Relations Committees. We have had a lot of hearings. That is \ntrue. In the Foreign Relations Committee, we had 16 hearings, a total \nof 30 witnesses. Of the 30 witnesses, 28 were in favor of the treaty, 2 \nwere opposed. What we attempted to do is to get a broader exposure to \nthis very significant treaty on this issue. For that reason, we do need \nto take more time, because we have only heard one side. Then on the \nother matter, the idea that this is just an add-on from a previous \ntreaty, let's keep in mind, when the START I treaty came up, that was \nbetween two superpowers, everyone understand that, the U.S.S.R. and the \nUnited States. That is not the same today.\n  One of the problems I have with this treaty is that it is a treaty \nbetween the United States and Russia. This is not, in my opinion, where \nthe threat is. The threat is with Iran and North Korea. Every time we \nget an assessment on North Korea, we are wrong. They have more than we \nbelieved they have, and then we are put in a position where we know \nthey are trading with countries such as Iran. And Iran right now, \naccording to our intelligence, which is not even classified, would have \na delivery system with a nuclear warhead by 2015. So there is where the \nissue of missile defense comes in.\n  I know the argument on missile defense. We have the Russian Foreign \nMinister Lavroc coming out and saying:\n\n       We have not yet agreed on this [missile defense] issue and \n     we are trying to clarify how the agreements reached by the \n     two presidents correlates . . . with the actions taken \n     unilaterally by Washington.\n\n  And adding:\n\n       The Obama administration had not coordinated its missile \n     defense plans with Russia.\n\n  Then we have, on the opening day of April 8 in Prague, the Russians \nsaying that the treaty can operate and be viable only if the United \nStates refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities, \nquantitatively and qualitatively. We can sit around and say this isn't \ngoing to affect that, but nonetheless, that is on record. We have some \nRussians who believe that. That is not on my amendment. I wanted to \ncomment that there is a reason for taking the time. I will not get into \nthe debate as to whether we should have done it before the election or \nafter.\n  I will say, a lot of the things that have come up in this lameduck \nsession have come up because the chances of getting these things \nthrough is greater than they would be after eight or nine\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\nnew Senators come in. The fact is, these eight or nine new Senators \nhave all joined in a letter asking us, could you refrain from ratifying \nthis very significant treaty until we have a chance to look at it. We \nare the ones. We are the Senate coming in. I think that is a good \nargument.\n  Let me get back to my amendment 4833 and kind of kick it off here. I \nknow we have a lot of people who want to talk about the amendment. Let \nme share my thoughts first. Right now there are, under the New START \ntreaty, 188 inspections over 10 years. That is 18 a year versus what we \nhad with START I, 600 over 15 years. That is 40. So it is a drop from \n40 inspections per year to 18. I believe it would be good to actually \nhave more than we had during START I. Under New START, they inspect to \nverify the elimination of nuclear weapon delivery systems that have \nfundamentally changed from those of START I. START I required the \nelimination of sites. We didn't at that time have to set up a mechanism \nto look and see if these were actually eliminated because we knew at \nthat time they were. Now we have no way of knowing whether the sites \nhave been reactivated. In fact, the test being used under this New \nSTART treaty would be to view the debris that shows that systems were \neliminated. It could very well be that they could destroy a system, \nthere would be a lot of debris. There could be three or four systems \nthey don't destroy, but they could spread the debris around. It is not \na very good test as to what is actually happening.\n  The second problem I have is that under New START, 24 hours of \nadvance noticed is required before an inspection, which is quite a \ndramatic increase. Under the old START treaty it was 9 hours advance \nnotice. If you walk into this and assume the Russians are not going to \ncheat, that is fine. But I am not willing to do that because in a \nminute I will document the things they said they would do and have not \nbeen doing. If anything, we should certainly not have a no-longer \nwarning than under the old START treaty. My amendment seeks to mitigate \nsome of these negotiated disadvantages by increasing the number of \ninspections per year. The amendment triples the number of inspections \nunder the New START from the two types of inspections specified under \nthe New START treaty, type one and type two inspections. Type one \ninspections refer to the ICBM bases, submarine bases, and airbases, to \nconfirm accuracy of declared data on the number and types of deployed \nand nondeployed warheads located on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers.\n  Type two refers to inspections at formerly declared facilities to \nconfirm that those facilities are not being used for purposes \ninconsistent with the treaty. That would have been inconsistent with \nSTART I.\n  That is what we talked about a minute ago. I don't see any \nverification in terms that are meaningful to verification on type two. \nBut type one inspections would increase from 10 to 30 inspections a \nyear. Type two would increase from 8 to 24, a total of 54 inspections.\n\n  On July 20, 2010, the principal deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \npolicy, James Miller, testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I was there. He said that Russian cheating or breakout, as \nthey sometimes say, a kinder phrase, under the treaty would have little \neffect because of the U.S. second-strike strategic nuclear capability. \nI disagree with that. If this is something where we have people who \nagree and disagree, certainly we should fall down on the side of \nprotection for the United States.\n  As we get to the argument saying we don't need as many inspections \nbecause we have a smaller number of facilities to inspect or the \nsmaller size of the nuclear arsenal, as in New START, the larger the \nimpact of cheating has on a strategic nuclear balance, this is kind of \na hard thing for people to understand. But increasing the number of \ntype one and two inspections is critical to New START verification \nbecause the total number of inspections has been dramatically reduced. \nHaving the facilities reduced is of more concern.\n  Let me quote a few people who have weighed in on this issue.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown explained, on October 23, \n1991, when they were looking into the future and saying this was \nsomething they thought was going to happen, in testimony before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee on the original START treaty:\n\n       Verification will become even more important as the numbers \n     of strategic nuclear weapons on each side decreases, because \n     uncertainties of a given size become a larger percentage of \n     the total force as this occurs.\n\n  Is he the only one who believes this? No. Former Secretary of Arms \nControl John Bolton stated just this year, on May 3:\n\n       While [verification] is important in any arms-control \n     treaty, verification becomes even more important at lower \n     warhead levels.\n\n  That is where we are now, lower warhead levels.\n  In 1997, Brent Scowcroft said:\n\n       Current force levels provide a kind of buffer because they \n     are high enough to be relatively sensitive to imperfect \n     intelligence and modest force changes.\n\n  He said:\n\n       As force levels go down, the balance of nuclear power can \n     become increasingly delicate and vulnerable to cheating on \n     arms control limits, concerns about ``hidden'' missiles, and \n     the actions of nuclear third parties.\n\n  Yesterday when we were having this debate, I acknowledged that both \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and I have been aviators for a number of \nyears. I recalled going across Siberia in a flight around the world. \nYou go through time zone after time zone of wilderness, and you think \nof all the places things could be. That is not the way it is in our \ncountry. That is what Brent Scowcroft was saying, that:\n\n       As the force levels go down, the balance of nuclear power \n     can become increasingly delicate and vulnerable to cheating \n     on arms control limits, concerns about ``hidden'' missiles, \n     and actions of nuclear third parties.\n\n  Then in May of this year in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nformer Secretary James Baker summarized that the New START verification \nregime is weaker than its predecessor, testifying to Congress that the \nNew START verification program:\n\n       . . . does not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one \n     that verified the numerous and diverse treaty obligations and \n     prohibitions under START 1. This complex part of the treaty \n     is even more crucial when fewer deployed nuclear warheads are \n     allowed than were allowed in the past.\n\n  So I think we have this unanimity of people who believe as the level \ncomes down, the inspections become more critical. I think we also have \nto look at the fact--and I know it is not nice to say, and this offends \na lot of people--Russia cheats on every arms control treaty we have had \nwith them. We had a recent thing--I am glad it came out--I think it was \nin the summer of this year, with the report on foreign country \ncompliance. This is what our report said.\n  It starts out with the START. It says there are a number of \nlongstanding compliance issues--such as obstruction to U.S. right to \ninspect warheads--raised in the START Treaty's Joint Compliance and \nInspection Commission that remained unresolved when the treaty expired \non December 5, 2009.\n  Then, if you look, they break it down.\n  The Biological Weapons Convention. In 2005, the State Department \nconcluded that ``Russia maintains a mature offensive biological weapons \nprogram and that its nature and status have not changed.'' This was in \nthis report we had. In 2010, the State Department report states this: \nRussia confidence-building measure declarations since 1992 have not \nsatisfactorily documented whether its biological weapons program was \nterminated.\n  They said the same thing 5 years later that they said back in 2005. \nSo we do not know right now. They were supposed to be eliminating that \nprogram, as to the Biological Weapons Convention, and they did not do \nit.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention. In 2005, the State Department \nassessed that ``Russia is in violation of its Chemical Weapons \nConvention obligations because its declaration was incomplete with \nrespect to declaration of production and development facilities.'' In \n2010, the State Department again stated that there was an absence of \nadditional information from Russia, resulting in the United States \nbeing unable to ascertain whether Russia has declared all of its \nchemical weapons stockpile, all chemical weapons production facilities, \nand all of its chemical weapons development facilities.\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\n  So what they are saying now is, 5 years later, after they had been \nwarned in 2005 they had to do this, that they were in noncompliance, \nthey are still in noncompliance. That is as to chemical weapons.\n  As to conventional forces in Europe, the report says: ``The United \nStates notes that Russia's actions have resulted in noncompliance with \nits Treaty obligations.'' The Wall Street Journal recently reported \nthat, according to U.S. officials, the United States believes Russia \nhas moved short-range tactical nuclear warheads to facilities near NATO \nallies as recently as this spring.\n  So I think if you look at the record of Russia, they don't tell us \nthe truth. They agree to something, and then they do not do it. That is \nwhy verification probably--it may be the most significant frailty in \nthis New START treaty that needs to be addressed.\n  For starters, I want to repeat that we have fewer inspections now \nunder this treaty. The idea that you can determine by the debris that \nremains after something is supposed to be destroyed is, to me, a \nnonstarter. The advance notice--the fact that we now give them advance \nnotice three times as long as we did at one time--as weapons decrease, \nI think everybody agrees we need to have more of the opportunities to \ninspect. Then lastly is the fact that Russia cheats.\n  I will yield the floor at this point. I do not see anyone around who \nwants to talk about these two amendments, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of course I will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wish to ask the Senator, there may be some who may wish \nto talk on these two amendments. About how long will the Senator speak \non the general subject of missile defense or the treaty? About how long \nwill the Senator be talking on something other than specifically these \ntwo amendments?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would estimate about 15 to 20 minutes \nwould be the maximum.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday to most of the arguments. \nI do not think there is a need to go back over them. I appreciate the \narguments and concerns of the Senator from Oklahoma. So I think I will \nlet that stand where it was, and we will see if another Senator comes \nto pick up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a very significant and important \nissue. As I have indicated previously, we deal with a lot of issues \nhere in the Senate, some less relevant, some more important. We often \ntreat the serious too lightly, and the light too seriously. In this \ncase, I think everybody understands that negotiating a treaty with the \nRussians dealing with arms reductions is critically important. And that \nis what this is.\n  I do not think, when you talk about nuclear weapons, there are other \nissues that are similar to it. If, God forbid, before sundown today, we \nlearn that a nuclear weapon has been obtained by a terrorist group or a \nrogue nation and detonated in the middle of a major city on this planet \nEarth, and hundreds of thousands of people are killed, life on Earth \nwill change forever.\n  This is a big issue, a very important issue. I just described the \nhorror of a circumstance where a nuclear weapon was detonated in a \nmajor city on this planet. We have 25,000 nuclear weapons that exist on \nthis planet. The question is, are we able to find a way to \nsystematically reduce the number of nuclear weapons and, therefore, \nreduce the threat of the use of nuclear weapons while, at the same \ntime, trying to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists and \nrogue nations?\n  These days, it seems to me, the question of the nuclear threat is \nvery different than when previous treaties were negotiated. The reason \nfor that is, we have found a new enemy on this planet. It is called \nterrorism--terrorists who are very happy to give up their lives as long \nas they can take the lives of others.\n  That terrorist threat, and the threat that a terrorist organization \nmight acquire a nuclear weapon, and then very happily detonate that \nnuclear weapon and kill hundreds of thousands of people--innocent \npeople--that is a very serious problem. That is why there is a new \nurgency to not only arms control and arms reduction negotiations, but \nto the passage of treaties that are, in fact, negotiated.\n  We have successfully negotiated various arms control treaties. I will \nnot go through the list of successes, as I did previously. But we have \nbeen very successful in reducing the number of nuclear weapons and the \nnumber of delivery vehicles--bombers and submarines and \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. We have fields in which sunflowers \nnow grow where missiles were once planted with nuclear warheads aimed \nat our country.\n  That is a success, in my judgment. There is no doubt that what we \nhave done over the years has been successful. Yet there remain on this \nplanet some 25,000 nuclear weapons.\n  I have listened to this debate, and I do not believe there is anyone \ninvolved in this debate who represents bad faith. I think there are \ndifferences of opinion, and I believe people who come here and offer \namendments believe in their heart they are pursuing the right strategy. \nBut in some ways it also seems to me to be kind of the three or four \nstages of denial; that is, you take a position, and when that is \nresponded to, then you take a second position: I wasn't there. If I was \nthere, I didn't do it. If I did it, I am sorry.\n  The stages of denial are pretty interesting to me. Let me go through \na few of them.\n  The first was, some were very worried in this Chamber that if we \nproceeded with START without adequately funding the nuclear weapons \ncomplex and funding the necessary investments in our current nuclear \nweapons stockpile, the investments for modernization, the investments \nfor life extension programs, and so on--if we did that without adequate \nfunding for that, that would be a serious problem.\n  The fact is, President Obama proposed adequate funding in \ncoordination with those who were raising that question. Particularly \nSenator Kyl was raising that question a great deal. He and I talked \nabout it a substantial amount because I chair the subcommittee that \nfunds the nuclear weapons complex and the life extension programs and \nthe modernization programs.\n  So while most other areas of the Federal budget were being trimmed or \nfrozen or held static, we increased, at President Obama's request, the \nnuclear weapons line item in the budget that deals with modernization \nand life extension programs, and so on. We increased that by nearly 10 \npercent in FY 2011 budget; and then another 10 percent in the FY 2012 \nbudget President Obama will send Congress in February; and then, on top \nof a 10-percent increase and a 10-percent increase, another $4 billion \nincrease over the next five years thrown on top of all of that.\n\n  I do not think anyone can credibly suggest there is now a problem \nwith funding. The President kept his promise, and then did more than \nthat--two 10-percent increases, taking us to $7.6 billion, and then, on \ntop of that, adding another $4 billion in 5 years. It is hard to find \nanother part of the budget that has been as robustly funded.\n  Again, as chairman of the subcommittee that funds this, I believe we \nhave done what was necessary, and much more to satisfy the concerns \nexpressed by those who worried that the funding would not be there. \nThis President said it will be there. He made those proposals with two \nbig increases and then an even larger third increase, and that ought to \nlay to rest that subject for good.\n  Will our current stockpile be properly maintained with life extension \nprograms and modernization expenditure? The answer is yes. It is \nclearly yes. The funding has been made available, and there ought not \nto be debate about that any longer.\n  Now the question of time. Some have said--and I heard this morning on \ntelevision one of my colleagues say: Well, this is being rushed through \nat the end of a session. That is not true. That is an example of what I \ndescribed previously on the floor of inventing a reality, and then \ndebating off that new\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\ninvention. It is not true that we are rushing this through. We have had \nmeeting after meeting after meeting. I am on the National Security \nWorking Group, and all through the negotiation with the Russians on \nthis treaty, Republicans and Democrats on that committee were called to \nsecret sessions and briefed all along the way, to say: Here is what is \ngoing on. The negotiators would say: Here is where we are. Here is what \nwe are doing. And we were always kept abreast of all of that. So there \nis nothing at all that is running away quickly at the end of a session \nto try to get this done.\n  In fact, this has been delayed much longer than, in my judgment, I \nwould have preferred. But, nonetheless, we are here, and it seems to me \nthis ought not be part of the routine business of the Congress. This is \nan arms control treaty on nuclear arms reduction. This ought to be one \nof those areas that rises well above that which is the normal business \nin a Congress.\n  But there is no credibility at all to suggest this is being rushed. I \ncan recall day after day sitting in secret sessions with negotiators \ntelling us along the way: Here is what we are doing. They met with \nRepublicans and Democrats. We met altogether in a room in the Capitol \nVisitor Center and had briefing after briefing after briefing on the \nNational Security Working Group, and it includes most of those in this \nChamber who have spoken on this issue.\n  So it is not the case that there were Members of Congress uninformed \nabout what was happening. All of us were informed. This administration, \nI thought, did an exceptional job of coming to us to say: We want to \nkeep you advised and informed of what we are doing. It is not the case \nat the end of this session it is being rushed through. It should have \nbeen done a few months ago. I wish it had been, but it has not been. \nSo, therefore, we find ourselves at this intersection. But it should \nnot let anybody believe this is being pushed and rushed without time to \nconsider. All of us have had ample time over many months, and over a \nyear before that, while the negotiations were taking place to seriously \nconsider and be a part of what this is and what it means for our \ncountry.\n  The other issue that is being raised constantly is, it will limit our \ncapabilities with respect to missile defense. Again, it is not the \ncase. I understand what people have been reading in order to make that \ncase. But every living Secretary of State from the Republican and \nDemocratic administrations have come out in favor of this treaty--every \none.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has made a very assertive, \nstrong statement in support of this treaty. They didn't do that because \nsomehow we are limited on missile defense. In fact, the President has \nwritten to us and said: ``That is not what exists with respect to us \nand an agreement with the Russians.'' It just is not.\n  Yesterday, the argument was, well, this doesn't include tactical \nweapons. No, it doesn't. We do need to limit tactical weapons. I wish \nit had been a part of the Moscow Treaty. I wish it was part of this \ntreaty. It wasn't. But that doesn't mean we should stop progress on the \nstrategic weapons limitations, a reduction of the number of strategic \nnuclear weapons.\n  Why would you not take the progress in the area of limiting strategic \nnuclear weapons and the delivery of vehicles, airplanes, missiles, \nsubmarines, and so on, with which those weapons are delivered--why \nwould you not take the progress that exists with respect to limiting \nstrategic weapons? Of course we should do that. Certainly, I don't \ndisagree at all with those who are worried about tactical weapons. So \nam I. So is this administration. All of us would have loved to have had \nan agreement on tactical nuclear weapons 5 and 10 years ago, but that \nwas not possible and it was not the case. So now we work on this, and \nthis provides measurable reductions in the number of nuclear warheads \nand measurable reductions in the delivery vehicles for those warheads--\nbombers, missiles, submarines, and so on. It would be unthinkable, it \nseems to me, for our country to decide that, no, this is not the \ndirection in which we want to move.\n  As I indicated earlier, on every occasion where we have debated the \nissue of arms control and arms reduction--understanding it is our \nresponsibility; it falls on the shoulders of this country, the United \nStates, to assume the leadership--on every occasion where we have \ndebated the issue of trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on \nthis planet and reduce the number of delivery vehicles and the threat \nfrom nuclear weapons, we have done that exclusive of this new threat \nwhich now casts a shadow over everything we talk about; that is, the \nthreat of terrorism--a new threat in the last decade--terrorists who \nare very anxious to take their own lives if they can kill thousands or \nhundreds of thousands of others. The specter of having a terrorist \ngroup acquire a nuclear weapon and detonate that nuclear weapon on this \nplanet will change life on the planet as we know it.\n  So it is a much more urgent requirement that we finally respond to \nthis by continuing this relentless march to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons and try to make certain we keep nuclear weapons out of \nthe hands of terrorists, to reduce the number of rogue nations that \nwould have nuclear weapons. That is our responsibility. It is our \nleadership responsibility in this country.\n  The signal we send to the world with respect to this vote and others \ndealing with arms control and arms reductions is unbelievably \nimportant. That is why this vote in this Chamber at this point is so \nurgent.\n  I mentioned terrorism, and it is now a few days before Christmas. \nLast Christmas, we were reminded about terrorism once again. A man got \non an airplane with a bomb sewn in his underwear. Before that he was \npreceded by a man getting on an airplane with a bomb in his shoe. They \nwere perfectly interested in bringing down an entire plane full of \npeople. The terrorists who were interested in killing several thousand \nAmericans on 9/11/2001 are even more interested in acquiring a nuclear \nweapon and killing hundreds of thousands of people somewhere in a major \ncity on this planet.\n  That is why this responsibility, the responsibility of continuing to \nnegotiate and negotiate and negotiate treaties that represent our \ninterests--yes, they have to represent our interests, and this one \ndoes. Look at the list of people who support this treaty. I have \nbrought out charts before that show all of the Republicans and \nDemocrats, the folks who have worked on these things for so long, \nSecretaries of State and military leaders and former Presidents.\n  It is our responsibility to make progress. Frankly, as I said, I \ndon't suggest there is bad faith on the part of anybody who stood up \nwith their opinion. That is not my suggestion. I think people in this \nChamber are people of good faith. But it seems to me that some have not \nyet understood the increasing urgency now to address this issue. This \nissue is in our national interests. This issue with the Russians--this \ntreaty with the Russians was negotiated very, very carefully, \nrepresenting our national interests--yes, on verification, representing \nour national interests. It represents our interests in every other way. \nMissile defense--we didn't give up anything with respect to missile \ndefense. So as I hear some of my colleagues come to the floor very \nconcerned about these issues, all of them are responded to easily, in \nmy judgment.\n  Money--we are spending more money than has ever been spent on the \nnuclear weapons complex to make sure our nuclear weapons work. Linton \nBrooks, the previous head of NNSA said: I would have killed for a \nbudget like they now have for the life extension programs and the \nmodernization program. I would have killed for that, he said. He was \nthe man who ran the NNSA under the previous President, President George \nW. Bush. So money is not an issue. Clearly, that is not an issue.\n  Time? This is not being pressed into a tiny little corner with an \nurgent time requirement. This has been delayed and should not have been \ndelayed. But it is sufficiently important to stay here and do this and \nhope the work that has been done on a bipartisan basis can be supported \nby the entire Senate.\n  It is easy to compliment people in the Chamber, and you don't \ncompliment those with whom you disagree, I suppose. But let me \ncompliment Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar because I think the work \nthey have done, which is very strongly bipartisan, to bring\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\nthis treaty to the floor of the Senate for ratification is a \nrepresentation of the best of the Senate. It is the way this place \nreally ought to work. Searching out and holding hearings and hearings \nand hearings, the best thinkers to come and give us advice about all of \nthese issues--they did that. There is nothing this issue is represented \nby with respect to pushing it into a tight timeframe. They have done \nthis the right way--the right kinds of hearings, the right kind of \nconsultation. Now, they have come to the floor of the Senate saying \nthis is urgent. Let's get this done.\n  I just wanted to come today--I was driving to work this morning, and \nI saw the Martin Luther King memorial being built on the Mall. I \nrecalled what he once said. He said, ``The means by which we live have \noutdistanced the ends for which we live.'' He said, ``We have learned \nthe secret of the atom and forgotten the sermon on the mount.''\n  Well, the secret of the atom is something we have indeed learned. In \nrecent years, the specter of having so many nuclear weapons on this \nplanet and the specter of terrorists acquiring one requires us to be \never more vigilant and to proceed to ratify treaties we negotiate over \na long period of time. Again, as I indicated, it is our responsibility.\n  This responsibility for stopping the arms race rests on our \nshoulders. Yes, we must do it in our national interests, protecting \nourselves as we do. In my judgment, this treaty meets every one of \nthose measures. I am pleased to support it and pleased to be here to \nsay that I hope my colleagues will look at what Senator Kerry and \nSenator Lugar have done and come to the floor of the Senate with robust \nsupport for what I think is outstanding work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Retiring Senators\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from South Dakota is here. I know he \nwishes to speak. I will not be long. I wish to take advantage of this \nmoment with the Senator from North Dakota on the floor to say a couple \nof things.\n  First of all, I am very grateful to him personally for the comments \nhe has made about both my efforts and the efforts of Senator Lugar. I \nappreciate them enormously. But more importantly, the Senator is going \nto be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. I wish to say \nthere are few Senators who combine as many qualities of ability as does \nthe Senator from North Dakota. He is one of the most articulate Members \nof the Senate. He is one of the most diligent Members of the Senate. He \nis one of the most thoughtful Members of the Senate.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving with him on the Commerce \nCommittee. I have seen how creative and determined he is with respect \nto the interests of consumers on Internet issues, on fairness issues, \nconsumer issues in which he has taken an enormous interest. He has been \nhead of the policy committee for I think almost 10 years or so. He has \nbeen responsible for making sure the rest of us are informed on issues. \nHe has kept us up to date on the latest thinking. He has put together \nvery provocative weekly meetings with some of the best minds in the \ncountry so we think about these things.\n  So I wanted to say to the Senator from North Dakota personally \nthrough the Chair how well served I think the citizens of North Dakota \nhave been, how grateful we are for his service, and how extraordinarily \nlucky we have been to have someone representing one of the great 50 \nStates as effectively as he has. I think he has been a superb Senator, \nand he will be much missed here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to an amendment I have \npending at the desk, but before I do that, I wish to make some general \nobservations as well about where we are with regard to this process \nbecause there has been a lot said about Republicans not wanting to vote \non this or trying to delay this. But I think one would have to admit \nthat we have now talked about missile defense, which I think is a very \nvalid issue with respect to this treaty. There are very significant \nareas of disagreement with regard to how it treats missile defense. We \nhave had a discussion about tactical weapons, which, in my judgment, \nalso is a very important issue relative to our national security \ninterests and the interests of our allies around the world. We have had \na debate about verification, about which the amendment of Senator \nInhofe is currently pending. Those are all very valid and substantive \nissues to debate and discuss with regard to this treaty.\n  The amendment I will offer will deal with the issue of delivery \nvehicles, which is something that is important as well where this \ntreaty is concerned.\n  So I would simply say that it is consistent with our role in the U.S. \nSenate to provide advice and consent. If it were just consent, if that \nis what the Founders intended, we could rubberstamp this. But we have a \nrole in this process, and that role is to look at these issues in great \ndetail and make sure the national security interests of the United \nStates are well served by a treaty of this importance.\n  So I think the words of the treaty matter, and I think the words of \nthe preamble matter. I am not going to relitigate the debate we have \nalready had on missile defense, but I believe that if we have language \nin a preamble to a document such as this, not unlike the preamble we \nhave in our Constitution which is frequently quoted, it has meaning. To \nsuggest that the preamble doesn't mean anything, that it is a throwaway \nand has throwaway language, to me really misses the point. Obviously, \nit matters to someone. It matters greatly to the Russians, and I don't \nthink, if it didn't, it would be in there. That is why I believe that \nhaving this linkage between offensive strategic arms and defensive \nstrategic arms in the preamble--it is in there for a reason. Somebody \nwanted it in there, obviously, and I think it certainly has weight and \nconsequence beyond what has been suggested here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I would also argue as well that the signing statement we have already \ntalked about where the Russians made it very clear in the signing \nstatement, in Prague on April 8 of 2010, that the treaty can operate \nand be viable only if the United States of America refrains from \ndeveloping its missile defense capabilities qualitatively or \nquantitatively--if you tie that back to article XIV of the withdrawal \nclause of the treaty where it talks about being able to withdraw for \nexceptional circumstances, you can certainly see the pretext by which \nthe Russians may decide to withdraw from this treaty.\n  So missile defense is not an inconsequential issue. It is a very \nimportant issue with regard to this treaty, and the amendment that was \noffered on Saturday and voted on attempted to address that. \nUnfortunately, that failed. I hope we have subsequent opportunities to \nget at the issue of missile defense because I certainly think it is an \nunresolved issue in my view and in the view of many of us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4841\n\n  The amendment I offer today is very straightforward and modest. It \nwould simply increase the number of deployed delivery vehicles--in \nother words, bombers, submarines, and land-based missiles--allowed for \nin the New START treaty from 700 to 720. It simply adds 20 additional \nvehicles to the number in order to match up with the administration's \nplan presented to the Senate for fielding 720 delivery vehicles rather \nthan the 700 called for in the text of this treaty.\n  Before I continue, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Scott Brown \nof Massachusetts be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. For those watching this debate who may be unfamiliar with \nsome of the terminology used in these arms control treaties such as the \nterm ``delivery vehicles,'' it is important to understand that delivery \nvehicles simply means the nuclear triad of systems: bombers, \nsubmarines, and land based intercontinental ballistic missiles or \nICBMs. This triad of delivery vehicles is very valuable because it is \nresilient, survivable, and flexible, meaning that if, God forbid, we \nsuffer a nuclear attack, those who attacked us can never be sure that \nthey have knocked out our ability to respond with a nuclear strike. \nObviously, without the means to deliver nuclear weapons, an adversary \nwould not take seriously our ability to respond to a nuclear attack. As \nthe numbers of delivery vehicles goes\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\ndown, it becomes more and more important to make sure they are \nmodernized and that they work as intended. And as numbers get reduced, \nit begins to have an impact on whether we can effectively retain the \ntriad, making it more likely that our nation would have to eliminate a \nleg of the triad.\n  On July 9, 2009, at an Armed Services Committee hearing, I asked GEN \nJames Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, about the \nadministration's commitment at that time to reduce our strategic \ndelivery vehicles to somewhere in the range of 500 to 1,100 systems, \nand to specify at what point in this range would he become concerned \nthat delivery vehicle reductions would necessitate making our nuclear \ntriad into a dyad. General Cartwright responded that he ``would be very \nconcerned if we got down below those levels about mid point,'' meaning \nthat he would be concerned if the negotiated number fell below 800 \ndelivery vehicles. This treaty caps delivery vehicles at 700, \nsubstantially below the number that General Cartwright stated a year \nand a half ago.\n  Now, the treaty makes this odd distinction between ``deployed'' and \n``non-deployed'' delivery vehicles, and the treaty's proponents will \npoint out that the total cap for the treaty is 800 ``deployed and non-\ndeployed'' systems. And of course, there is a letter from General \nCartwright in the committee report accompanying the treaty stating that \nhe is comfortable with the distinction between deployed and non-\ndeployed delivery vehicles, and the overall limits to delivery \nvehicles. But it is important to understand that the administration has \nnot articulated how it will deploy a nuclear force conforming to the \nnumber of 700. Instead, the administration has presented a plan for how \nit will deploy 720 delivery vehicles. And that is the motivation behind \nthis amendment. I find it very troubling that the administration has \nyet to articulate how it will deploy a nuclear force conforming to the \nnumber of 700. The comprehensive plan for delivery vehicle force \nstructure the administration was required to present to Congress under \nsection 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 Defense authorization bill, known \nas the 1251 report, provides a very troubling lack of specificity \nconcerning force structure under the New START treaty. Specifically, \nthe administration's fact sheet on the section 1251 report explains \nthat the U.S. nuclear force structure under this treaty could comprise \nup to 60 bombers, up to 420 ICBMs, and 240 SLBMs. The only number that \nis a certainty in the 1251 report is the number of SLBMs. I hope the \nmembers from states with bomber bases and ICBM bases will pay attention \nto this important point. Since deployments at the maximum level of all \nthree legs of the triad under the explanation provided by the \nadministration's 1251 report add up to 720 delivery vehicles, it is \nmathematically impossible for the U.S. to make such a deployment and be \nin compliance with the treaty's limit of 700 deployed strategic nuclear \ndelivery vehicles. Clearly, additional reduction decisions will be made \nwith respect to U.S. force structure under this treaty, and obviously \nthose reductions will come out of bombers and/or ICBMs.\n\n  Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen acknowledged in a hearing before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on June 17, 2010, that further \nreductions would still be required to meet the treaty's central limits. \nThey went on to argue that because the United States will have 7 years \nto reduce its forces to these limits, they did not find it necessary to \nidentify a final force structure at this point; meaning the Senate will \ncommit the United States to a delivery vehicle force of 700 without \nknowing how that force will be composed.\n  Compounding this problem of not knowing what the final force \nstructure will look like is the fact that the Obama administration \nconceded to Russian demands to place limits on conventional prompt \nglobal strike systems by counting conventionally armed strategic \nballistic missiles against the 700 allowed for delivery vehicles. For \nthose who are unfamiliar with prompt global strike, it is simply a \nprogram that would allow the United States to strike targets anywhere \non Earth with conventional weapons in as little as an hour. Development \nof these systems is an important niche capability that would allow us \nto attack high-value targets or fleeting targets, such as WMD, \nterrorist, and missile threats. A recent Defense Science Board report \nstates that ``the most mature option for prompt, long-range, \nconventional strike is the ballistic missile'' and that ``Building on \nthe legacy of these [intercontinental ballistic missile] weapon systems \nprovides a relatively low-risk path to a conventional weapon system \nwith global reach.'' Yet this treaty will not permit us to develop this \nlow-risk concept for conventional prompt global strike without it \nhaving an impact on the central limits under this treaty of 700 \ndelivery vehicles.\n  To be very blunt, this treaty was so poorly negotiated that for \nevery ICBM or SLBM deployed with a conventional warhead, one less \nnuclear delivery vehicle will be available to the United States. This \none-for-one reduction in deployed nuclear forces is one we can ill \nafford at the levels of delivery vehicles allowed under this treaty. \nWhen the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, General Chilton, \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee on April 22, 2010, he \nspecifically said that we could not replace the deterrent effects of \nnuclear weapons with a conventional capability on a one-for-one basis \nor ``even ten-for-one.''\n\n  Treaty proponents will point out that there are other potential new \nconventional prompt global strike systems on the drawing board that may \nnot fall under the treaty's limitations, such as a hypersonic glide \ndelivery vehicle. But why are we tying the hands of future \nadministrations that may need to quickly field such systems, especially \nsince converting ICBMs to carry a conventional warhead are the most \nadvanced systems we have right now on conventional prompt global \nstrike?\n  The Senate should not ratify the treaty without knowing what kind of \nconventional prompt global strike systems may be counted and how that \nwill affect our triad at the much reduced delivery vehicle limits. \nAccording to the DOD, an assessment on treaty implications for \nconventional prompt global strike proposals will not be ready until \nearly 2011. If we pass this treaty now, Senators won't know the details \non this important issue until the treaty enters into force, when it is \ntoo late. Adopting my amendment would provide a hedge against the \nissues that are raised by the conventional prompt global strike niche \ncapability and its impact on the treaty's limit of 700 delivery \nvehicles. With a 700 delivery vehicle limit, conventional prompt global \nstrike counting against that number, we will have fewer nuclear \ndelivery vehicles, and this limit will be a disincentive to develop and \ndeploy conventional prompt global strike as a result. Moreover, why \nshould we accept these constraints in a treaty that was about strategic \nnuclear weapons?\n  While we are required under the treaty to cut the number of delivery \nvehicles to the bone, Russia will not have to make any similar cut to \ntheir delivery vehicles, leaving one to wonder what we received in \nreturn for this significant concession. The treaty essentially requires \nthe United States to make unilateral reductions in delivery vehicles, \nas Russia is already well below the delivery vehicle limits and would \nhave drastically reduced its arsenal with or without this treaty. As \nCRS writes, ``[Russia] currently has only 620 launchers, and this \nnumber may decline to around 400 deployed and 444 total launchers. This \nwould likely be true whether or not the treaty enters into force \nbecause Russia is eliminating older missiles as they age, and deploying \nnewer missiles at a far slower pace than that needed to retain 700 \ndeployed launchers.''\n  So I want to put a fine point on that, Mr. President. Essentially \nwhat we are doing here is we have about 856 delivery vehicles in our \narsenal today. We are reducing that down to 700. So we are taking a \nsignificant haircut, a significant cut in the number of delivery \nvehicles that would be available to us. The Russians, on the other \nhand, are currently only at 620 launchers, delivery vehicles, which is \nalready well below the 700. On the attrition path they are on, it would \nvery soon be down to about 400 deployed launchers and 444 total \nlaunchers. So the United States has made huge concessions regarding \ndelivery vehicles in this treaty, and the\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\nRussians have conceded nothing on this point. It seems to me this is \nanother area in which we made significant concessions and received very \nlittle in return.\n  Mr. President, we are binding ourselves to the number of delivery \nvehicles we negotiate with Russia, even though we have security \ncommitments to extend our nuclear deterrent to more than 30 countries, \nwhile Russia has none. Given geographic realities, U.S. strategic \nnuclear forces are part of how the United States provides this extended \ndeterrence. As we face an uncertain future, where other nations like \nChina continue to modernize their nuclear forces, we will need to be \nable to hold more potential targets at risk to deter attacks. That \nmeans we need to be very careful about reducing delivery vehicle \nlevels, and this amendment would simply use the administration's 1251 \nreport force structure plan of 720 delivery vehicles as the ceiling for \ndelivery vehicles under this treaty, rather than the current number of \n700 reflected in the treaty.\n  Some of my colleagues will probably warn that even this modest \namendment is a ``treaty killer'' amendment. But article II, section 2 \nof the Constitution says that the President ``shall have power, by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties.'' When the \nother side admonishes us about ``treaty killer'' amendments, it becomes \napparent that we are supposed to be a rubberstamp for this treaty, \nwanting us to provide our consent but not to provide our advice. It \nshould be made clear what a ``treaty killer'' amendment is. It is any \namendment seeking to remedy an issue with the treaty the Russians \nsteamrolled us on during the negotiation process but which New START \nproponents do not wish to adopt because protecting American interests \nwill annoy the Russians and perhaps jeopardize entry into force of the \ntreaty.\n  One thing should be clear: The Senate cannot kill New START in the \nway some are suggesting. If the Senate gives its consent to New START \nwith amendment to the text, that just means the treaty is sent to \nRussia for its approval with the amendment. The ball will then be in \nRussia's court. As CRS has outlined in its study on the role of the \nSenate in the treaty process: ``Amendments are proposed changes in the \nactual text of the treaty. . . . [They] amount, therefore, to Senate \ncounter offers that alter the original deal agreed to by the United \nStates and the other country.''\n  Simply put, an amendment to the treaty text would not kill the \ntreaty, it would merely require Russian consent to the amendment as a \nmatter of international negotiation. If Russia chooses to reject that \namendment, it will not be the Senate that kills the treaty, it will be \nthe Russian government.\n  As a side note, I believe it is important to recall that General \nChilton's support for New START levels was predicated on no Russian \ncheating. He testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee on April \n22, 2010, that one of the assumptions made when the Nuclear Posture \nReview was completed was ``an assumption . . . that the Russians in the \npost negotiation time period would be compliant with the treaty.'' It \nhas been pointed out many times now how Russia is a serial violator of \narms control commitments.\n  In conclusion, reducing U.S. strategic nuclear forces, especially \nwith delivery systems, is a very serious matter that has received \ninsufficient attention. We have little to gain, and much to lose, if we \ncannot be certain that the numbers in New START are adequate. I think \nit is worth noting that former Defense Secretary Schlesinger testified \nto the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 29, 2010, that ``as \nto the stated context of strategic nuclear weapons, the numbers \nspecified are adequate though barely so.'' Again, this is a modest \namendment that takes into account the administration's own force \nstructure plan of 720 delivery vehicles. This amendment would simply \nuse the administration's 1251 report force structure plan of 720 \ndelivery vehicles as the ceiling for delivery vehicles under this \ntreaty rather than the current number of 700 reflected in the treaty. \nIn light of all of these issues, I ask my colleagues to carefully \nconsider this amendment, and I respectfully ask for a vote in its \nfavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nsimply say that with regard to maintaining a triad and a system of \nbombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs, in order to do that, the 700-number ceiling \nmakes that very complicated.\n  If you assume 420 ICBMs and 240 SLBMs, that leaves room for some \nbombers but not a lot of room. Frankly, if you go down from the 720 \nnumber to the 700 number, if you assume up to 260 bombers--that is, if \nyou assume the 700 number and take it out of bombers, you would be down \nto 40 bombers, 96 B-52s and B-1s that are nuclear capable, nuclear \nweapons we use with nuclear-launch vehicles for extended deterrence \naround the globe. Going down to 40 would be a two-thirds reduction in \nthe number of bombers we have to provide that type of extended \ndeterrence. It strikes me that we are getting perilously close with \nthis number to moving from a triad to a dyad.\n  Furthermore, we are tying our hands when it comes to our ability to \nhave the necessary delivery vehicles at our disposal, if and when that \ntime would ever come.\n  Again, this is a very straightforward amendment. It takes the number \nfrom 700 to 720. It is consistent with the 1251 report and what the \nadministration says they can accommodate in terms of launch vehicles. I \nhope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before I say a few words about the \namendment, let me see if I can get an agreement from my colleagues. We \nhave a lot of colleagues asking when we are going to vote, and we need \nto have some votes. We have only had two votes on this treaty after 6 \ndays. Obviously, I can move to table, but I do not want to do that, at \nleast not yet.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota if we can set up a time to have a \nvote on his amendment at 12:30.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, we \nare prepared to debate. The Senator from Oklahoma wants to talk at \nlength about the verification issue. I do not think we are prepared at \nthis point to enter into a time agreement for any time certain on \nvotes. Until we can get some indication from our colleagues who would \nlike to speak on this amendment, it would be very difficult to do that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, we are getting into \nthe sixth day of debate. Christmas is coming. It is surprising to me \nthat we do not have any indication who would like to speak on this \namendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, we \ndo have others who want to speak, not only on this amendment but also \non the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. These, as I said, are \nvery significant, substantive amendments that deal fundamentally with \nthe issues that are important to this treaty. I do not think we are \nprepared at this point to cut off that debate. Until we get some \nindication from some of our colleagues about who else might want to \ncome down and speak to either of these issues, I object to entering \ninto any kind of time agreement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I accept that. The point I am trying to \nmake is, we have allowed each of the prior amendments to come to an up-\nor-down vote. We have not tabled them, which is an often-used practice, \nas everybody knows. We could have debated all last night; there was \nnobody here to debate. Now we are here debating. We are happy to leave \ntime for debate. But I ask my colleagues if they could inquire into who \nmight want to come so we could at least, out of courtesy to our \ncolleagues, give them a sense of what the schedule might be, and then \nwe can set a time for that debate allowing everybody adequate time.\n  I am not suggesting in any way that the topics we are discussing are \nnot important. They are important, and they are worthy of debate and \nare worthy of discussion. We welcome that discussion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In addition to what Senator Thune said, there are several \npeople who said they want to go into closed session first and address \nissues having to do with my amendment and his amendment before a vote.\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I respect that. I am perfectly comfortable \nif we are able to set a time after that closed session. I think \neverybody would feel good if we can find the time. I understand the \nneed to want to have that session. That is the Senator's right, and we \nrespect that. We certainly can do it. Maybe we can find a time when we \ncome out of that session when we can have a couple of votes back to \nback. I think that would help a lot of people.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his amendment. It is one \nthat is worthy of some discussion. Obviously, some of that discussion \nis going to have to take place in the context of a classified session.\n  He said one of the arguments that will be used is that this will \nresult in going back to the Russians and having to renegotiate the \ntreaty. That is not a casual argument. It is not a small thing. But it \nis not the principal reason--it is one of the reasons, obviously, I \nthink this amendment is ill-advised. But, most importantly, this \namendment is unnecessary.\n  All of us on our side have a very clear understanding of the \nimportance of delivery vehicles with respect to our national defense. \nBut here is what we have to balance the comments of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota against: the President of the United States, the Secretary \nof Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the commander of the U.S. \nStrategic Command, and others have all determined that we can safely \nreduce our deployed ICBMs and our deployed SLBMs and our deployed heavy \nbombers--the three legs of the triad--that they could be reduced to the \n700 number.\n  That figure was picked, obviously, after an enormous amount of \nthinking by all of those parties concerned--the Strategic Command, the \nAir Force folks, the Navy SLBM--and they did so only after seeing the \nresults of force-on-force analyses of exactly where that would leave us \nin terms of America's response should there--happily in the current \natmosphere--be the unlikely event of a nuclear confrontation. \nObviously, we need to think about these issues in that larger context \nof where we are today, what direction we are moving in, and what is the \nreality.\n  As the Senator knows, without going into any details, that force-on-\nforce determination was made not just in the likelihood of a Russian-\nU.S. confrontation but in a multiparty confrontation. Again, we will \ndiscuss some of that later.\n  The gravamen of the Senator's complaint is that he is concerned that \nthe administration has failed to thus far state precisely how it is \ngoing to reduce the deployed ICBMs--intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles--and the SLBMs--submarine-launched ballistic missiles--and \nheavy bombers, how do we meet the treaty's requirement of 700. I want \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to weigh in.\n  I will say quickly, the administration has made it clear that it \nintends to maintain 20 launchers on the 12 ballistic missile submarines \nthat we keep operationally deployed, meaning our submarine force will \naccount for 240 of the 700 limit. We agree on that. That leaves room \nfor 460 deployed delivery vehicles combined from the two other legs of \nthe triad--from the ICBMs and from the heavy bomber forces.\n  The Senator also said the administration has said in its 1251 report \nthat it has not made a final decision on going all the way up to the \n420 ICBMs or all the way up to 60 bombers or somewhere in between. That \ndecision has not been made.\n  In other words, out of the total deployed delivery vehicle limit of \n700, the administration has left itself some room to maneuver, to make \na decision on 20 of its ICBMs and bombers.\n  Under the agreement, we have 7 years of room before we have to meet \nthat limit. When asked about this sort of available time of 7 years, \nGeneral Chilton, the commander of our Strategic Command, told the Armed \nServices Committee for the record:\n\n       The force structure construct, as reported in the section \n     1251 report, is sufficient to meet the Nation's strategic \n     deterrence mission. Furthermore, the New START treaty \n     provides flexibility to manage the force drawdown while \n     maintaining an effective and safe strategic deterrent.\n\n  As a technical matter, the Senator's amendment would require the \nPresident to go back to the Russians, move the limit up from 700 to \n720, even though the military is perfectly comfortable with the level \nwe have. That is when we begin to get into the question, if they are \ntelling us that this is good and comfortable and we can do what we need \nto do in this context, I might add, of a very different Russia, very \ndifferent United States, very different set of strategic demands at \nthis moment, why would we reopen the treaty for renegotiation?\n  I have more to say, particularly on the subject of the Prompt Global \nStrike because the Prompt Global Strike likewise is not impacted \nnegatively by this, and there are a number of reasons we have options \nas to how we arm certain legs in the triad and what we choose to do.\n  It is important to point out also--I think this is important--there \nmay be some concern. I understand the geography of the Senator's \nrepresentation, so there may be some concern from some Senators, and \nthe comments that the Senator made that those of you who have people \nconcerned with the ICBM bases or the SLBM bases or the bomber bases \nneed to be focused on this, let me be clear that the administration has \nmade it clear. None of the three ICBM bases are going to be closed \nbecause of the New START treaty. We are maintaining all of them.\n  What is more, the administration has made it clear that it is \ncommitted to the ICBM force in the years to come. In its updated 1251 \nreport, the Minuteman III will remain in service through 2030 and then \nbe replaced by a follow-on ICBM to be determined.\n  If people are concerned about cutting bombers, Senators should \nremember that to meet the New START's limits, we are not going to need \nto eliminate any bombers. We plan to simply convert some bombers to a \nconventional role, at which point they will no longer count toward the \ntreaty limits.\n  With that stated as part of the Record, I yield 5 minutes, or such \ntime as the Senator from Michigan would like to consume, to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it was my understanding that we had an \ninformal arrangement that we would go back and forth. I would like to \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I completely understand that. We had the two Senators \nspeak. I would like to yield to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for 5 minutes and then come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment of Senator Thune would amend \nthe treaty by changing one of the elements of the treaty, which is the \nnumber of deployed strategic forces that we have. Under the treaty, the \nlimit, of course, is 700. But the critically important part to our \nmilitary is that each side would have the ability to change the mix to \nreach 700 as it suits our respective needs.\n  The amendment of Senator Thune would alter the limit of 700 to 720 \ndeployed SLBMs, heavy bombers equipped with nuclear arms, and ICBMs. \nThese limits, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has \njust said, were agreed upon only after careful analysis by the U.S. \nmilitary leadership, particularly General Chilton who is the commander \nof our U.S. Strategic Command and the man responsible for these \nstrategic systems.\n  Senator Kerry has quoted General Chilton. I want to add one \nadditional quote of his which he testified to before the Armed Services \nCommittee on July 20 of this year. General Chilton stated that the \nforce levels in the treaty meet the current guidance for deterrence for \nthe United States. By the way, that guidance was laid out by President \nGeorge W. Bush.\n\n       The options we provided in this process focused on ensuring \n     America's ability to continue to deter potential adversaries, \n     assure our allies, and sustain strategic stability for as \n     long as nuclear weapons exist. This rigorous approach, rooted \n     in deterrence strategy and assessment of potential adversary \n     capabilities--\n\n  Here are the key words--\n\n     supports both the agreed-upon limits in the new START and \n     recommendations in the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).\n\n  So General Chilton is on record in a number of places very precisely \nand specifically saying that the options which were provided, including \nthe one which was adopted here, rooted in the\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\nstrategy, rooted in the provisions, the guidance as laid out by \nPresident Bush, support the agreed upon limits in the START treaty. I \ndon't know how much more precise and I don't know how much more \nsignificant you can get with the words of the commander who is in \ncharge of these weapons.\n  The 1251 report, the report says up to those numbers. It is not \nspecifically committed to those numbers. The important thing about the \nreport is not just that it says up to in I think at least two of the \nthree cases it also says it is important that we remain flexible as to \nthis number.\n  So the 700 force structure that is in the treaty would retain the \nnuclear triad, retains all three delivery legs, bombers, SLBMs, and \nICBMs. On that point General Chilton said we are going to retain the \nvital nuclear delivery systems, and if there is a failure technically \nin one of the nuclear systems, we can rearrange our deployed force \nstructure and treaty limits to compensate.\n  Some have said the United States will have to make significant \nreductions to reach the 700 level and the Russians will have to make \nnone. According to General Chilton, this argument is a distraction. \nWhat he said is that the ``new START limits''--in his words, the ``new \nSTART limits the number of Russian ballistic missile warheads that can \ntarget the United States, missiles that pose the most prompt threat to \nour forces and our Nation. Regardless of whether Russia would have kept \nits missile force levels within those limits without a new START \ntreaty, upon ratification they would now be required to do so.'' And \nthat certainly is very important to our Strategic Commander, General \nChilton, because he said:\n\n       The constraints of the treaty actually do constrain Russia \n     with regard to deployed launchers and deployed strategic \n     weapons, and that is an important element as well. Without \n     that they are unconstrained.\n\n  He explained that the limits were important because without those \nlimits\n\n       There would be no constraints placed upon the Russian \n     Federation as the number of strategic delivery systems or \n     warheads they could deploy. And I think it is important for \n     the United States--\n\nhe concluded\n\n     that there be limits there, limits that we would also be \n     bound by, obviously.\n\n  General Chilton is not only comfortable with the limits in this \ntreaty, it was his analysis that formed the underpinning for the 700 \nlimit. He doesn't need the strategic, the additional 20 strategic \nnuclear delivery systems to maintain our strong deterrence, and other \nthan to kill this treaty there is no reason to add these 20 additional \nsystems. We should respect General Chilton's judgment that the United \nStates can maintain an effective deterrent and that such a change would \nkill this treaty.\n  I yield the floor and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I do want to be recognized for the \npurpose of further explaining my amendment No. 4833 and also to respond \nto the Senator from Massachusetts. Before doing that I would ask if the \nSenator from South Dakota has any responses he wishes to make at this \ntime, and then I wish to keep the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to \nrespond, if I might, to some of these issues.\n  One of the issues General Chilton, the Stratcom commander, I think \ntestified to was an assumption there would be nobody cheating. As I \nsaid before, history is replete with examples of the Russians cheating \non these agreements. And furthermore, what they agreed to was not--the \ntreaty is 700, but what General Chilton and the nuclear force structure \nplan would call for is 720. It is 240 submarine-launched ballistic \nmissiles, up to 420 ICBMs, and up to 60 bombers. Again that adds up to \n720. All this amendment does is simply make consistent what the nuclear \nforce structure plan as outlined by General Chilton and others would be \nwith what the treaty requirements would be as well.\n  Again I want to make one point about this. I said this earlier but we \nhave 856 launch vehicles, delivery vehicles in our arsenal today. The \ntreaty calls for 700 so we are making a 156-delivery vehicle reduction \nto get down to the 700 number. The Russians today at 620 in effect are \nalready below the 700 number and they are headed down even lower to \nsomewhere in the 400 range. So we have made a significant concession \nwith respect for delivery vehicles at no cost whatsoever to the \nRussians. I would point out also that the concern I have, as I said \nbefore, in taking a 720 number and reducing it to 700 assumes again \nthat even if you keep 240 submarine-launched ballistic missile delivery \nvehicles, assume that, and if you assume 420 ICBMs, you would have to \nreduce the bomber inventory down to 40 to get under the 700 level.\n  I think most people understand it is the bombers, the heavy bombers \nthat have given us the extended deterrence. They are visible, they are \nrecallable, they are psychological, they are political. You put them \ninto a theater, they loiter, they persist, and that is a powerful \ndeterrent to those who would like to proliferate nuclear weapons. If we \ntake our bomber fleet and we reduce down to the limits that would be \ntalked about under this treaty, we are putting at great risk the triad. \nA lot of these bombers need to be updated and they are getting older. \nWe need a next generation bomber which I think is going to be critical \nthat that also be a nuclear bomber. But I think it is important to \npoint out that this particular treaty relative to where we are today \nand to what our needs could be in the future, particularly as it \npertains to bombers, the need for extended deterrence, we are reducing \nto a level that I think makes many of us uncomfortable and gets below \nthe number that was prescribed in the nuclear force structure plan as \nhad been outlined. The 720 as opposed to 700--the 700 number is well \nbelow where I think we need to be and does put in peril the triad which \nhas served us well for a long period of time. In fact, in the early \nstage of the Cold War it was the heavy bombers that provided the bulk \nof the work. When we developed the ICBM, and SLBMs, now some of the \nbombers have been converted to conventional use and they have been \ndoing a great job in that mission as well. But if we are going to have \nextended deterrence in the future we are going to have to have a very \nrobust nuclear fleet that is nuclear capable, and a 700 number puts \nthat in great jeopardy.\n  With that, I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for one question before he yields \nthe floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Is it not true that the 1251 report says that the numbers which they \ntalk about are up-to numbers, in the case of both ICBMs and the nuclear \nbombers?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, it is my understanding that is correct; \nit is up to the 240 SLBMs, up to 420 ICBMs, and up to 60 bombers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the 720 is not proscribed by the 1251 report. Thus the \ntotal of the three numbers, two of which are up-to numbers, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, to answer the question of the Senator \nfrom Michigan, that I believe to be the case. It is not proscriptive. \nAll I am simply saying is if you make an assumption that you are going \nto take the additional 20 delivery vehicles out of the bomber fleet, \nyou would take it from 60 down to 40 at a time when we have about \nalmost 120 bombers in our inventory. That is a significant reduction in \nour ability to provide extended deterrence, and the bombers are the \nbest form of extended deterrence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my intention now--I made my presentation earlier on \nand a similar presentation yesterday and the Senator from Massachusetts \nresponded. I wish to respond to his responses to clarify some of the \nthings that might be a little unclear.\n  First of all, the Senator from Massachusetts said every Senator on \nour side and, most importantly, the unbelievably experienced \nnegotiators who put this treaty together, have made a lifetime of \ntrying to understand these kinds of relationships and the ways in which \nyou adequately verify, and they\n\n[[Page S10787]]\n\nwanted to expand, which I appreciated, how qualified these people were, \nbut here is the problem we have and I think it was articulated by the \nSenator from South Dakota. We have a constitutional responsibility. We \ntake an oath of office to support the Constitution, and one of the \nthings it is up to us--not to anybody but us--to provide for common \ndefense. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution specifically gives \nus not just the right but the obligation for advice and consent, and \nquite often we talk about all these smart people who have agreed with \nthis. That leaves one group out. That is us. We happen to be the ones \nwho are accountable to the people through our election.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts also said that the treaty itself, \ntalking about the amendment, my amendment, he said he opposes an \namendment to the treaty itself which we all understand now after two \nvotes that it would kill the treaty, essentially saying that if you \namend the treaty it is dead.\n  I think we need to stop and reevaluate what our obligation is, not \njust the constitutional obligation, as the CRS has outlined in a study \nof the role of the Senate in the treaty process. Amendments are \nproposed changes in the actual text of the treaty. They amount \ntherefore to Senate counteroffers that alter the original deal agreed \nupon by the United States and the other country.\n  If the Senate gives its consent to New START with amendments to the \ntext, the treaty is sent to Russia for its approval with the \namendments. Both the Russian Duma and the United States Senate have a \nconstitutional right to change portions of this treaty and it is up to \nthem to do. So this reinserts it back into the process. I feel that is \nexactly what our Founding Fathers wanted us to be doing in these \ntreaties and that is what we are trying to do.\n  The third thing that was stated by the Senator from Massachusetts is, \nhe was talking about the concept of the type one inspections and the \ntype two inspections as a new one. Well, it is a new process because \ntype two inspections are inspections on formerly declared facilities. \nObviously in the START I treaty we didn't have formally declared \nfacilities. They came as a result of the first treaty. Type one refers \nto inspections of ICBM bases, submarine bases, and air bases to confirm \nthe accuracy of declared data on the number and types of deployed and \nnondeployed warheads located on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. So I \nwould say that type two inspections weren't even addressed in the first \ntreaty.\n  The Senator also said we said we ought to send this back ``but it \ndoesn't rise to that level in my judgment.'' Now he talks about the \nlevel of significance. All these amendments are significant. Each one \nof us who is an author has a little bit of bias because we have studied \na little bit more in our particular area. I can't think of anything \nthat is more significant than verification. The interesting thing that \nwas brought out by the Senator from North Dakota was General Chilton's \nsupport. I am reading from the report right now. It says General \nChilton's support for the New START level was predicated on no Russian \ncheating or changes in the geopolitical environment.\n  Well, historically they have been cheating on everything. Let me go \nahead and reread what I said before. We had the meeting, the convention \nin 2005, and then again 5 years later in 2010, came out in May or June \nof this year, and in that one, talking about the biological weapons \nconvention in 2005, the State Department concluded that Russia \nmaintains a mature offensive biological weapons program and that its \nnature and status have not changed. That is what they said in 2005. Now \n5 years later the new report came out and the State Department report \nstates the Russian confidence-building measures since 1992 have not \nsatisfactorily documented whether its biological program was \nterminated. Therefore, they are saying the same thing 5 years later, so \nthey lied 5 years ago and it appears that they have not done--or they \ncheated, I should say.\n  Chemical weapons the same thing.\n  In 2005, the State Department assessed that:\n\n       Russia is in violation of its Chemical Weapons Convention \n     obligations because its declaration was incomplete with \n     respect to declaration of production and development \n     facilities.\n\n  Then, in 2010, 5 years later, the State Department again stated there \nwas an absence of additional information from Russia, resulting in the \nUnited States being unable to ascertain whether Russia has declared all \nof its chemical weapons stockpile and all of its chemical weapons \ndevelopment facilities.\n  If we are predicating all that on General Chilton, who said cheating \nhas all of a sudden miraculously stopped, this is a great reform \nmeasure, and I would like to see the evidence of it before we assume \nthat is the case.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts also stated people responsible for \nverification of this treaty would never have been sent to the United \nStates. This treaty would never have been sent to the United States if \nthe treaty did not have adequate verification measures. So it talks \nabout all these verification measures.\n  Then he says: It is the judgment of our military, our State \nDepartment, and our intelligence community that these measures are \nadequate.\n  That may be true with those who are currently answering to our \nPresident who strongly support this treaty. But if we look at the State \nDepartment and the military and the intelligence of the past, those \npeople who have commented, James Baker, as I recall, Secretary of \nState, summarized that the New START verification regime is ``weaker \nthan its predecessor,'' testifying to Congress in May of this year. I \nhappen to have been there. He said the New START verification program:\n\n       . . . does not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one \n     that verified the numerous and diverse treaty obligations and \n     prohibitions under START I. This complex part of the treaty \n     is even more crucial when fewer deployed nuclear warheads are \n     allowed than were allowed in the past.\n\n  Insofar as the military is concerned, Richard Perle, former Assistant \nSecretary of Defense in the Reagan administration, stated on December \n2, a few days ago, that:\n\n       New START has a very weak verification regime, one that \n     establishes a dangerous precedent and lowers our standards \n     for verification.\n\n  Here is the military weighing in.\n  He goes on to say that:\n\n       New START's verification provisions would provide little or \n     no help in detecting illegal activity at locations the \n     Russians did not declare, are off limits to U.S. inspectors, \n     or are hidden from U.S. satellites.\n\n  James Woolsey--when we talk about intelligence, I have a bias because \nJames Woolsey is from Oklahoma. He was the Director of Central \nIntelligence from 1993 to 1995. He was adviser to the SALT I \nnegotiations up through 1970, a delegate at large to the START and \ndefense and space negotiations.\n  He stated, on November 15, that under this treaty, unlike the \noriginal START treaty, Russia is free to encrypt telemetry from missile \ntests, making it harder for us to know what new capabilities it is \ndeveloping. There is no longer the requirement for permanent onsite \nmonitoring of Russia's primary missile production facility, which under \nold START helped us keep track of new mobile missiles entering the \nSoviet force.\n  He goes on and on. That is agreed with by Paula DeSutter, former \nAssistant Secretary for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation at \nthe U.S. State Department, who pointed out on July 12 that New START \nhas glaring holes in its verification regime. New START is ``much less \nverifiable than the original START.''\n  I only say this because my friend from Massachusetts talked about the \nmilitary, the State Department, and the intelligence community. One \nthing that is ingrained in our system is that we have a President who \nis Commander in Chief. He has a lot of influence over the State \nDepartment and the military. We have heard some very well respected \npeople along those lines.\n  One of the arguments or rebuttals the Senator from Massachusetts had \nagainst my opening statement yesterday was that we have fewer sites now \nthan during the development of the START I treaty. This is true. We do \nhave fewer sites. An argument can be made--and most people agree with \nthe fact--that if you have fewer sites, you need more inspections.\n  Former Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity John Bolton stated, on May 3, that\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\n``while [verification] is important in any arms-control treaty, \nverification becomes even more important at lower warhead levels.''\n  Brent Scowcroft and Arnold Kanter weighed in on the same thing in a \njoint statement:\n\n       Current force levels provide a kind of buffer because they \n     are high enough to be relatively insensitive to imperfect \n     intelligence and modest force changes. . . . As force levels \n     go down, the balance of nuclear power can become increasingly \n     delicate and vulnerable to cheating on arms control limits, \n     concerns about ``hidden'' missiles, and the actions of \n     nuclear third parties.\n\n  In May of this year, in front of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nformer Secretary of State James Baker summarized that the New START \nverification regime is weaker than its predecessor, testifying to \nCongress that the New START verification program ``does not appear as \nrigorous or extensive as the one that verified the numerous and diverse \ntreaty obligations. . . .''\n  He goes on to say it is more significant as you reduce your number of \ninspected facilities.\n  Further, the Senator from Massachusetts responded to me by saying \nthey are going to demand the same number of inspections of our military \nbases, and we would have to be prepared to host them three times more \nin inspections. That is true. This is bilateral. Everything we are \nasking them to do, we to have do too. I like that idea. He went on to \ntalk about the inconvenience, but my amendment applies to both the \nUnited States and to Russia. My amendment increases inspections for \nboth sides, which will improve confidence, trust, and transparency. \nMore importantly, it improves our ability to catch the Russians \ncheating and deter Russian cheating. I am fully aware we have to do the \nsame thing the Russians have to do.\n  Furthermore, it was stated by the Senator from Massachusetts, in his \nresponse to my statement:\n\n       So I think it's one thing to ask our strategic nuclear \n     forces to do that ten times a year, or less than once a \n     month. It's another thing for them to be waiting for 30 \n     inspections a year. We have 2 submarine bases, 3 bomber \n     bases, and 3 ICBM bases.\n\n  I might add, Russia has 3 submarine bases, 3 bomber bases and 12 ICBM \nbases. So we are actually not on parity there.\n  Quoting from a letter Secretary Gates sent this summer about whether \nthe Russians would cheat on this treaty in a manner that would be \nmilitarily significant, he said:\n\n       The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs \n     commander, and the U.S. strategic command and I assess that \n     Russia will not be able to achieve militarily significant \n     cheating or breakout.\n\n  In other words, they are not going to cheat. This is this conversion \nI guess they have had.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Just for a moment, for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I just want to be clear. The Senator read my words \naccurately, which were the quote of the general who said ``militarily \nsignificant.'' I don't think he said that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I didn't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to the issue of cheating, what he said was he \ndidn't think there would be anything militarily significant. Again, \nthis is material we could go into, which we will probably, in the \nclassified session. But I just want that distinction to be clear.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thought that is exactly what I said. I apologize for \nthe misunderstanding.\n  Further, the Senator from Massachusetts made the statement that:\n\n       Our analysis of the N.I.E. and the potential for Russian \n     cheating or breakout confirms that the treaty's verification \n     regime is effective.\n\n  I have to always be a little suspect of what comes out of the N.I.E. \nI think all of us are. We don't take it as gospel. This is actually a \ntrue story. Back in the Clinton administration, it was August 24, 1998, \nI asked the question: How long will it be until North Korea has a \nmultistage rocket? The response that came back in August of 1998 was 5 \nto 10 years. Seven days later, on August 31 of 1998, they fired a \nthree-stage rocket.\n  I think we need to look at some of the intelligence estimates. They \nhave been wrong in the past. When you are talking about something as \nsignificant as the issue we are talking about here, about the threat \nthat is out there, then we have to be right.\n  Then, the Senator from Massachusetts quoted Condoleezza Rice. I \nactually agree with her. She said:\n\n       The new start treaty helpfully reinstates on-site \n     verification of Russian nuclear forces which lapsed with the \n     expiration of the original start treaty last year. Meaningful \n     verification was a significant achievement of Presidents \n     Reagan and George H.W. Bush and its reinstatement is crucial.\n\n  I agree with that. Obviously, she is not saying she supports this. \nShe is saying she supports some kind of a verification. There is none \ntoday, so anything is better than nothing. I think that is what she is \nsaying. She also agreed, in her next statement in the Wall Street \nJournal of December 7:\n\n       Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that \n     must and can be addressed in the ratification process. . . .\n\n  Implying that there is nothing wrong with having amendments.\n  Lastly, one of the statements the Senator from Massachusetts made in \nresponse to my comments was:\n\n       Finally, I'd like to point out that we addressed the \n     importance of this verification question in condition of the \n     resolution of ratification. That condition requires that \n     before New START can enter into force and every year \n     thereafter, the President has to certify to the Senate that \n     our national technical means, in conjunction with the \n     verification activities provided for in the New START treaty, \n     are sufficient to ensure the effective monitoring of Russian \n     compliance with the provisions of the New START treaty and \n     timely warning of Russian preparation.\n\n  Here is the problem I have with that. The President can only certify \nwhat he knows. Our intelligence experts are telling him what they are \nseeing in Russia. This amendment provides that the President will have \nmore information. I would think, if that is the concern, we would want \nto give the President more information.\n  Lastly, I see the Senator from Arizona is here, and I know he wants \nto be heard. Let me mention one last thing my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, stated. He was talking about the fact that these \nare killer amendments. I think it is worth restating what we said \nbefore.\n  The CRS has outlined in its study on the role of the Senate in the \ntreaty process:\n\n       Amendments are proposed changes in the actual text of the \n     treaty. [They] amount, therefore, to Senate counteroffers \n     that alter the original deal agreed to by the United States \n     and the other country.\n\n  If the Senate gives its consent to New START with amendments to the \ntext, the treaty is sent to Russia for its approval with an amendment. \nThat means we go back and forth and hopefully come out with a treaty \nthat would be workable.\n  According to the 2005 and 2010 State Department reports on arms \ncompliance, Russia has a bad habit of cheating on these agreements. In \nfact, I think we have covered that adequately at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to talk about both the Thune \namendment and the Inhofe amendment. With respect to the Inhofe \namendment on verification, we are going to go into executive session of \nthe Senate at 2 o'clock this afternoon, where there will be an \nopportunity for all Senators to examine classified materials that have \nbeen presented by our intelligence agencies, some of which relate \nspecifically to the treaty and, in particular, the verification \nprovisions in the treaty. It is too bad it is not possible for us to \ndiscuss with very much specificity the nature of the intelligence we \nwill be discussing, but I will say I think it is a good thing we will \nbe voting on the Inhofe amendment following that session, because a lot \nof the material we are going to be exposed to in executive session \nrelates to the verification provisions of this treaty and past \nexperience with verification.\n  That is about all I wish to say right now, except that I hope \ncolleagues would attend that session because their vote on the Inhofe \namendment would at least be partially predicated on their being briefed \nin that executive session.\n  With respect to the Thune amendment, I very much support it as well. \nThe reason is because the whole point of this treaty was to reduce the \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\nwarheads and the delivery vehicles of the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States. That is the essence of the treaty. There is a lot more \nto it, but it reduces to 1,550 the actual warheads and reduces to 700 \nthe delivery vehicles. There is a special definition or counting rule \nof those delivery vehicles that we don't need to get into here, but the \nreality is, it is 700 deployed delivery vehicles, with another 100 that \ncould theoretically be deployed at a later date.\n  But 700 is the number. That is important for a couple of reasons. As \nwe have talked about before, the Russians will actually have room to \nbuild up. There are a lot of different estimates over the number of \ndelivery vehicles they are planning on having. But because missiles and \nbombers and submarines are expensive, the Russians could be well below \nthat number in a few years. So that number does not help the United \nStates at all. The Russians are already below it by at least--well, \nover 100--and they will be going lower than that.\n  One unfortunate consequence of that is they are MIRVing their ICBM \ndelivery vehicles in a way that, obviously, is going to be much more \ndestabilizing. Throughout the Cold War, both sides developed missiles \nthat allowed them to put more than one warhead on top of a missile. The \nproblem is, that is very destabilizing in a potential nuclear conflict \nbecause of the notion that you lose it if you do not use it.\n  So it was an incentive for either side to launch their missiles \nbefore the other side could attack them and destroy them. If you hit \none missile silo and that missile in the silo has 8 warheads on it or \n10 warheads on it, you have killed 10 warheads, not just one. Those \nwarheads--the way they work is, when the missile gets up to the top of \nits apogee, those warheads are splayed out, and each one has a \ndifferent trajectory down to potentially 8 or 10 different targets. So \nthey are very destabilizing. The incentive is for the person doing the \nfirst strike to kill them all so the other side does not have that \ncapability coming back at you.\n  Well, both the United States and the then-Soviet Union recognized how \ndestabilizing this was and moved toward a single warhead per missile, \nwhich is much less destabilizing, obviously. Since one of the benefits \nof this treaty is allegedly the stability that comes from it, one is \nvery troubled by the idea that, unfortunately, that is not the way it \nworks. The treaty is much more destabilizing, not stabilizing, because \nof this incentive for the Russians to put more than one warhead on each \nmissile. The United States, by contrast, is limiting our missiles to \none warhead apiece. In a way, that puts us at a big disadvantage.\n  Another way it puts us at a disadvantage is we are above the 700, and \nwe are going to have to retire a lot of our delivery vehicles to get \ndown to 700. So the treaty is not symmetrical in this regard. They \ncould actually build up to 700. We will have to bring down to 700.\n  It is also not symmetrical because our obligations around the world \nare much more diverse than are Russia's obligations. Russia will be \ndefending Russia. The United States has an understanding with 31 other \ncountries that our nuclear umbrella is available to them for their \nnuclear deterrence as well. So this requires a more sophisticated \ndefense plan on our part as to how we would deliver various warheads to \nwhat targets, and it essentially expands the number of weapons we need.\n  So it is a big deal to get down to the number of 700. As Senator \nThune has noted--and I will not repeat this--before the treaty was \nnegotiated, a lot of our miliary people were testifying to various \nnumbers that, obviously, led to the conclusion that 700 was way too \nlow. Dr. Schlesinger has, for example, said that 700 might be barely \nenough.\n  The problem is, that, A, we are even going to go below 700 if we \nproceed with something the administration wants to do, many of us here \nwant to do; that is, to develop what is called a conventional Prompt \nGlobal Strike. A conventional Prompt Global Strike is using an ICBM but \nwith a conventional warhead on it, not a nuclear warhead, to strike at \na target of potentially a rogue nation or some terrorist group or \nsomeplace where you have actionable intelligence that is of very short \nlife. You want to destroy a target. You obviously do not want to use a \nnuclear warhead. But you want to get there fast, and it is a long way \naway. So you might need to use, essentially, the same kind of missile \nyou would use to deliver a nuclear warhead.\n  Well, the Russians did not like that, so they said: If you do any of \nthose, you are going to have to count them against your nuclear \ndelivery limit. So if we did 25 of those, let's say, then instead of \n700 vehicles to deliver nuclear weapons, we would only have 675. That \nis why the Thune amendment talks about going back up to 730, which, \nwithout getting into classified material, I believe represents a number \nthat more closely approximates what people think is going to be \nnecessary for the United States on into the future.\n  The other thing that is troubling about it is, the administration has \nyet to commit to a full triad nuclear capable. Even though they have \nsaid they are fully committed to the triad, which means bombers, \nsubmarines, and ICBMs, they have not been willing to say the new \nbombers we build will be nuclear capable or will have cruise missiles \nthat can deliver a nuclear warhead.\n  So while they say ``triad,'' they are not willing to commit to \nanything but a diad. The problem with that is, there is much less \nstability and capability if you only have two ways of delivering your \nnuclear weapons. If there is something wrong with your ICBM force--\nremember, about 2 months ago, the power went out in several States, and \nour ICBMs were actually down for--I have forgotten what it was--an hour \nand a half or something like that because they did not have any \nelectrical power.\n  Well, obviously, nothing happened during that period of time. But a \nsingle point of failure is never desirable in the military context, \nwhere if one thing goes wrong, a lot of weapons or capability is taken \noff the table. The problem is, if you get down to just two ways of \ndelivering these weapons, rather than the three we have today, you are \ngoing to be much less capable. Your deterrent is not going to deter as \nmuch. That is what Senator Thune is trying to get at.\n  Let's at least modestly increase the number of delivery vehicles we \nhave. It is a modest amendment. It is an appropriate amendment. Yet as \nwe have just seen from Reuters today--something we already knew but the \nlatest iteration of it--``Russia warns U.S. not to change nuclear \npact.'' In effect, what they are saying is, the Senate can debate all \nit wants to, but if it makes one change, changes one comma, one thing \nis different in the treaty, well, then what? Then, as my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, said, we would have to see if the Russians were willing \nto agree to it. Otherwise, they would have to renegotiate at least that \npart of the treaty.\n  Well, what is wrong with that? Unless you think the U.S. Constitution \nwas stupid to give the Senate a role in this, it does not seem to me \nthere is anything wrong with the Senate saying: You got about nine-\ntenths of it just fine, President Obama and President Medvedev, your \nnegotiators. These negotiators are good, smart people and they are \ndedicated public servants, but they are not necessarily the last word. \nThe Senate is the last word, according to our Constitution. We gave our \nadvice. The administration did not take our advice in two specific \nways, but yet they expect us to give them their consent to the treaty.\n  The reality is, the Senate should not be a rubberstamp. In the first \nSTART treaty, we said: You have not dealt with a subject here that \nneeds to be dealt with--the potential for Russian submarine-launched \ncruise nuclear weapons. We need to have a side agreement on that. It \ndid not blow up START. We did a side agreement. The world did not end \nwhen the Senate said no to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The \npredictions were that this was going to destroy our relations with \nRussia forever. It did not. Here we are today now told again: If you \nchange one thing in this treaty, then Russia will not go along with it \nand our relationship could deteriorate significantly.\n  Well, if our relationship depends upon ratification of the treaty \nexactly like it is, then it is a lot weaker than the President and Vice \nPresident are making it out to be when they talk about this wonderful \nnew reset relationship. Surely, it could stand the Senate making a \nmodest change to the\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\ntreaty. If it cannot, then I do not buy the argument that this is a \nwonderful reset relationship.\n  So for my colleagues who say: We will not abide by any amendments to \nthe treaty, I say: Well, then, you have just said the Senate is \nirrelevant in the treaty process. We might as well forget about having \nthe Senate consider these treaties in the first place.\n\n  Senator Thune and Senator Inhofe have good amendments. I am looking \nforward to supporting both of them when we return from our closed \nsession this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Arizona made some good points, I think, \nabout the importance of the triad in maintaining our nuclear capability \nand deterrence.\n  I am interested in knowing if the Senator is aware that even if you \nassume the numbers that are in the 1251 report that would take the \nnumber of bombers down to 60--and it is up to 60, but the treaty calls \nfor 700 delivery vehicles, which, if you took that out of bombers, \nwould take you down to 40--that even taking it to 60 would cut in half \nthe number of nuclear bombers.\n  Is the Senator also aware bombers are the best vehicle to enforce \nextended deterrence? The ICBMs, the missiles we have, our adversaries \nsometimes cannot see those. A bomber is visible. A bomber can be sent \ninto theater. It has an impact, a psychological impact, a political \nimpact. It is recallable. It is something that can be out there that \nmakes those who would proliferate nuclear weapons even more concerned \nabout the capability we have to respond.\n  The importance of maintaining that leg of the triad is, in this \nSenator's judgment, critical. It sounds like, from what the Senator is \nsaying, he understands that as well.\n  I want to know if the Senator is aware that the limits that are \nimposed not only in the 1251 report but, more important, in the treaty \nwould significantly reduce the number of nuclear bombers we have at our \ndisposal today.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I say to Senator Thune, I was not aware it \nwould be cut in half. I was aware it would be drastically reduced. That \nis a huge reduction, especially if the administration is unwilling to \ncommit that we are even going to have a nuclear-capable bomber force in \nthe next generation of our triad. They have been willing to say we have \na great triad today. That is true as far as it goes. But part of that \ntriad on the bomber force, for example, are B-52s that were designed--\nwhen--back in the 1950s and built in the 1960s and 1970s.\n  We have to replace all three legs of our triad. The decision has been \nmade on the submarine. That is a good thing. But the decisions have not \nyet been made on the ICBM or on the bomber force.\n  One of our concerns about modernization is that modernization of the \nnuclear warheads is fine--I mean, it is necessary. But if we do not \nalso modernize the method by which we deliver those warheads, then \nmodernizing our warheads is of little significance.\n  The final point to Senator Thune's question, of course, is that other \ncountries, including Russia and China, are all modernizing both their \nwarheads and their delivery vehicles. So the United States does not \nwant to get caught in the position where we are down to very few \nworkable weapons, especially the bomber force, which, as the Senator \nnoted, can also be called back, unlike the missiles that are launched \neither from ground or from submarine. Once they are launched, they are \nlaunched. At least a bomber can be called back.\n  Mr. THUNE. I guess the concern and observation the Senator raised I \nwould make as well. With regard to a follow-on bomber, a next-\ngeneration bomber, much of our bomber fleet today--47 percent of it is \npre-Cuban missile era. So they are older. They need to be replaced. We \nneed a next-generation bomber. The question the Senator raised about \nthe ambiguity coming out of whether a next-generation bomber would, in \nfact, be nuclear is a real concern because that would put at risk the \nexistence of the triad, which I think allows us to maintain the \nflexibility, the versatility we have today in terms of nuclear \ndeterrence.\n  So I would echo what the Senator from Arizona has voiced as a concern \nabout this discussion of a next-generation bomber and whether, one, it \nwill be done, and, two, it will be a nuclear bomber.\n  Mr. KYL. I will conclude by saying, I hope we have at least a short \nmoment or period of debate following the closed session so both Senator \nThune and Senator Inhofe can make a brief closing argument to remind \nour colleagues about what the debate has been all about. I regret more \nof our colleagues were not on the floor to hear the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, of course, we will accommodate, \nhopefully, some brief statements prior to the votes, and I am confident \nwe can agree on some reasonable period, hopefully, not more than 5 \nminutes or something like that, to summarize.\n  But let me say to my friend from Arizona, because I heard him saying \nfairly passionately: What is the point of having the Senate involved if \nit cannot advise and consent and cannot amend the treaty, none of us on \nour side are arguing we should not have that right, that we do not have \nthat right, that this is not a worthy debate, and that we should not \ndebate a legitimate attempt to amend the treaty. That is not what we \nare saying. In fact, if I thought it was a flawed treaty and if I \nthought there were enormous gaps in it, I would try to amend the \ntreaty, I am sure. I think if that were true, we wouldn't have had a \n60-to-30 vote against doing it yesterday. Sixty Senators made the \njudgment that we don't want to; we don't think it rises to that level.\n\n  I would simply say to my colleague, it is not that the amendment--\nthat we shouldn't have the debate and that somehow not doing this now \nrejects the notion that we are capable of doing it; it is that we don't \nthink it is a good amendment. We don't think the amendment rises to the \nlevel where it raises an issue that it merits sending the treaty back \nto the Russians.\n  So we will retain that right--and I will protect that as long as I am \na Senator--to give that proper advice and consent. But I believe we \ngave the proper advice and consent and we rejected an amendment, as I \nhope we will reject these other two amendments, and I will further the \narguments with respect to that later.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is waiting for time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask the indulgence of the Senator from \nPennsylvania for a moment. Let me also reiterate I don't know where \nthis constant questioning of the triad keeps coming from, because the \nSecretary of Defense, in testimony as well as in letters, not to \nmention the Defense Department through the Joint Chiefs and then \nothers, have repeatedly stated their commitment to a viable, forward-\ngoing triad. The triad is not in question here. There will be a triad, \nwe are committed to the triad, and I will have something more to say \nabout that later.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two or three topics \nin this debate on the START treaty, but first and foremost, one that \nspeaks directly to the amendment that is pending. That is the question \nof verification--the ability for the United States to verify by way of \ninspection and other means what the Russian Federation has in terms of \nits nuclear weapons.\n  First of all, I would say as a foundational principle in this debate, \nnothing in this treaty will in any way compromise the safety, security, \neffectiveness, and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. That is critical \nto make that point, and I think the American people understand that. \nBut as the American people are listening to this debate\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\nabout verification, I think it is important to outline the distinctions \nbetween the amendment and I think what is, in fact, the case in the \ntreaty.\n  The treaty itself allows each party up to 18 short-notice, on-site \ninspections, and that is each year, with up to 10 so-called type one \ninspections conducted at operating bases for ICBMs, strategic nuclear-\npowered ballistic missiles, submarines, and finally nuclear-capable \nheavy bombers. So that is the type one inspections, up to 18 of those, \nwhich are short-notice inspections. Secondly, under the type two \ninspections, these are conducted in places such as storage sites, test \nranges, formerly declared facilities, and conversion or elimination \nfacilities.\n  Some have asked whether we lose any valuable elements of the original \nSTART agreement's inspection regime. The Under Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy James Miller replied to that question, a similar question I \nposed during the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the \nverification of the New START treaty. It was a hearing I chaired. He \nsaid that under New START, we will conduct, as I said a moment ago, 18 \ninspections per year for 35 sites; so 18 inspections, 35 Russian sites. \nUnder START I, there were 28 inspections for 70 Russian facilities. We \nare going from a verification regime where there are 28 inspections for \n70 sites to one that goes to 18 inspections for 35 sites. The ratio is \nactually better under this treaty in terms of the numbers of \ninspections and sites.\n  Mr. Miller, Under Secretary of Defense Miller, said that the ratio of \ninspections to facilities ``is improved under the New START treaty \nrelative to the original START treaty.'' That is Under Secretary of \nState Miller. That is not my words but his.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, reiterated \nthis point on March 26 of 2010 when he said that the New START \n``features a much more effective transparent verification method that \ndemands quicker data exchanges and notifications.''\n  In addition, this does not take into account that some of the \ninspections under the New START treaty allow us to do two inspections \nat once, unlike the first START treaty. I would also say the inspection \nregime we have in place under this treaty has also been changed to \nreflect the current security environment, an enhanced relationship with \nthe Russian Federation and more than a decade of our experience in \nconducting inspections. The New START inspection regime is simpler and \ncheaper than that which was conducted under the original START treaty. \nWe conduct fewer overall inspections under this new treaty because \nthere are, in fact, fewer sites in Russia to inspect, and we have \ngotten better at inspecting in the years since this has transpired.\n  I would also say we are standing here today on December 20 of 2010, \n380 days without inspectors on the ground in Russia. That is one of the \nreasons why I say ratification of this New START treaty makes us safer \nthan not ratifying this treaty; in fact, makes us less safer. One of \nthe reasons for that--not the only reason, but one of the reasons--is \nthat 380 days have passed without inspectors on the ground. This is, in \na word, unacceptable to our national security. I think the American \npeople believe that as well.\n  We need to vote on this treaty. While I and many of our colleagues \nwho have worked on this believe there is a sense of urgency, we also \nbelieve the views of the other side of the aisle have been engaged in a \nserious debate. We have had day after day now of debate on the floor. \nOf course, all of the debate here now and last week--almost a full week \nnow--all of that was preceded by months and months of work on the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and other \nparts of the Senate.\n  This is not new. The President made an agreement back in the spring \nof this year. We passed this treaty out of our committee back in the \nfall. We have had a lot of work. More than 900 questions have been \nasked of the administration and more than 900 questions have been \nanswered by the administration; something like 20 separate hearings \namong several committees. We have had a lot of time and a lot of work \nput into this. The pace of this, in my judgment, has not been too fast, \nbut it has been done with a sense of urgency to finally--after all of \nthese months of work, all of these months of debate, all of these \nmonths of hearings, we are at a point now where we can ratify this \ntreaty. I think in the end there is going to be bipartisan and broad \nsupport for ratification and we look forward to that vote.\n  My decision to support the New START treaty came after informed study \nof this issue as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and it is \nbased, in large part, on relying upon and asking questions of folks \nsuch as Admiral Mullen, to name one--someone who has spent years in the \nservice of this country, concerned about and doing something about the \ndefense and the security of this country. So often we hear in this \nChamber we should respect the opinions of commanders on the ground, and \nwe should. We have heard that in the context of the war in Iraq, and we \ncontinue to hear it in the context of the war in Afghanistan. We should \nrespect and take into consideration the determinations and judgments \nmade by commanders on the ground, those who have direct experience with \nmilitary questions and, in this case, have direct experience with the \ndefense of our country.\n  I think when it comes to the New START treaty, we should apply the \nsame rule as well when it comes to Admiral Mullen or any other military \nleader who has an opinion about this treaty. The commanders on the \nground as it relates to this treaty have spoken and they have done so \nwithout equivocation and, I would argue, unanimously. On this vital \ntreaty and on this national security issue, they have spoken with one \nvoice: We need to take action to secure our country and we need to take \naction to defend our country. We need to make sure we are taking \nactions that will result in a nuclear arsenal that will be safe, \nsecure, effective, and reliable, and one of the steps to get there is \nto make sure we ratify this treaty.\n\n  Let me move to one other topic. I know we have colleagues here who \nwish to speak. Let me ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you. I wish to speak about missile defense and I may \nbe able to do it within that time or less. First of all, I wish to \ncommend the work by this administration for the letter that was sent \nrecently that reiterated once again the commitment of the United \nStates. I would argue that is an unwavering commitment to missile \ndefense, consistent with the goal of having a nuclear arsenal and \nhaving defense for this country--but especially as it relates to the \nnuclear arsenal--that is safe, secure, effective, and reliable. This \nNew START treaty does not place any constraints on our ability to \ndefend ourselves. Over the past few days, this has been made clear by \nChairman Kerry on the floor, making these strong arguments, as well as \nthose made repeatedly by our uniformed military leadership.\n  Let me give some flavor of that by reading the following. This is a \nquotation from LTG Patrick O'Reilly who thinks the New START treaty \ncould actually provide more flexibility in implementing our missile \ndefense plans. He said:\n\n       The New START treaty reduces constraints on the development \n     of the missile defense program in several areas. For example, \n     MDA's intermediate-range LV-2 target booster system, used in \n     key tests to demonstrate homeland defense capabilities and \n     components of the new European Phased Adaptive Approach, was \n     accountable under the previous START treaty, because it \n     employed the first range of the now-retired Trident 1 SLBM. \n     Under New START, this missile is not accountable, thus we \n     will have greater flexibility in conducting testing with \n     regard to launch locations, telemetry collection, and \n     processing, thus allowing more efficient test architectures \n     and operationally realistic intercept geometries.\n\n  That is a very technical summation by LTG Patrick O'Reilly. He is the \nDirector of the Missile Defense Agency. He is not just making some \ncasual observation in a think tank or even as a Member of Congress. We \nlisten to a lot of voices here and many of them are respected voices. \nBut I think when we are listening to the Missile Defense Agency \nDirector, who is a lieutenant general, and he talks about this New \nSTART treaty providing more flexibility as it relates to missile \ndefense, I think we should listen very carefully.\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\n  I know Republicans here in Washington have over many days now \ndirectly or indirectly tried to assert that this administration is not \ncommitted to missile defense. They are wrong. I think the record is \nvery clear. The President made clear that this administration is \ninalterably committed--my words--to a missile defense that is \neffective. I would argue as well to a missile defense that ensures we \nhave a safe, secure, effective, and reliable nuclear arsenal. It is \nalso a missile defense that is capable of growing and adapting to \nthreats posed by countries such as Iran.\n  I have heard a lot of folks here on both sides of the aisle stand up \nand make statements about the threat caused by Iran's nuclear program. \nWe should listen to voices that are concerned about that in the context \nof making sure that this ratification is consistent with that, which it \nis. It is consistent with our efforts to ensure that Iran does not have \nthat capability.\n  So what are these capabilities? Well, here is a quick summation.\n  We currently have 30 ground based interceptors at Fort Greely, AK, \nand Vandenberg Air Force Base in California defending the homeland. \nDefense Under Secretary Flournoy and General Cartwright have asserted \nthat we will continue to improve and further augment these existing \nground-based interceptor systems, noting that these ``U.S. based \ndefenses will be made more effective by the forward basing of a TPY-2 \nradar--which we plan by 2011.''\n  In Europe, the United States has worked to defend our allies in NATO. \nThe European Phased Adaptive Approach is a network of increasingly \ncapable sensors and standard missile SM-3 interceptors that will \nprovide a capacity to address near term threats, while also developing \nnew technologies to combat future threats.\n  The first stage, to be completed in 2011, will deploy Aegis ships \nwith SM-3 interceptors in Northern and Southern Europe to protect our \ntroops and Allies from short-range medium regional ballistic missile \nthreats.\n  The second phase, estimated to be operational by 2015, it will field \nupgraded sea- and land-based SM-3s in Southern and Central Europe to \nexpand protection of the continent.\n  The third phase will introduce a more capable version of the SM-3 \nthat is currently under development, which will provide full protection \nfor our allies in Europe from short, medium, and intermediate range \nballistic missiles by 2018.\n  The final phase, planned for 2020, it will field an even further \nimproved SM-3 missile with anti-ICBM capabilities to augment current \ndefense of the U.S. homeland from Iranian long-range missile threats.\n  So when you look at it from each of these three points of view--\nmeaning the three phases--we are going to have in place a system that \nwill defend our homeland and will also help our European allies.\n  Let me conclude with one quotation. I mentioned Admiral Mullen, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs. This is what he said about the so-called \nphased adaptive approach:\n\n       The Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders and I also fully \n     concur with the Phased Adaptive Approach as outlined in the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report. As with the Nuclear \n     Posture Review, the Joint Chiefs and combatant commanders \n     were deeply involved throughout the review process.\n\n  So whether it is the Joint Chiefs, the combatant commanders, or other \ncommentators, we are going to make sure that in the aftermath of the \nratification of this treaty and consistent with and as part of and \nbecause of the ratification of this treaty, our missile defense will be \nas strong as it can be. And we are going to make sure that, without a \ndoubt, we are going to protect the American people and take every step \nnecessary to make sure our nuclear arsenal is safe, secure, effective, \nand reliable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes on the New START Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4847\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside and that amendment No. 4847 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. LeMieux), for himself and Mr. \n     Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 4847.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Treaty to require negotiations to address the \n         disparity between tactical nuclear weapon stockpiles)\n\n       At the end of Article I of the New START Treaty, add the \n     following:\n\n     3. The Parties shall enter into negotiations within one year \n     of ratification of this Treaty to address the disparity \n     between the non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons \n     stockpiles of the Parties, in accordance with the September \n     1991 United States commitments under the Presidential Nuclear \n     Initiatives and Russian Federation commitments made by \n     President Gorbachev in October 1991 and reaffirmed by \n     President Yeltsin in January 1992. The negotiations shall not \n     include discussion of defensive missile systems.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the New \nSTART Treaty--this important treaty that we are discussing between the \nUnited States of America and Russia concerning strategic nuclear \nweapons.\n  I have a lot of concerns about this treaty. Many of those concerns \nhave already been expressed by my colleagues. I have concerns about the \nverification procedures, that they are weakened from the previous START \nTreaty. I have concerns about the linkage of missile defense systems \nwith strategic offensive weapons. Those concerns have been addressed as \nwell, and I share them.\n  The biggest concern I have about this treaty is its failure to deal \nwith what are called tactical nuclear weapons. Now, to those folks at \nhome who may be listening to this, it is probably not readily \napparent--it wasn't initially to me--the difference between what a \nstrategic nuclear weapon is and a tactical nuclear weapon. A strategic \nnuclear weapon is usually considered to be a large vehicle, like an \nintercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. It travels over a very \nlong range. These strategic nuclear weapons can also be delivered by a \nsubmarine or a long-range bomber. A tactical nuclear weapon is \ngenerally much smaller in size. It has a smaller range and has a \ndelivery vehicle that may be on the back of a truck, for example.\n  In many ways, in the world we live in today, where we are not in the \nCold War atmosphere with the former Soviet Union, the tactical nuclear \nweapon is of much more concern than the strategic. The great fear we \nall have is that one of these nuclear weapons would get into the hands \nof a terrorist. A tactical nuclear weapon, by its very nature, is \nportable, and it could be something that is even capable of being moved \nby one person or, as I said before, on the back of a truck.\n  Why this treaty doesn't deal with tactical nuclear weapons is beyond \nme. I realize in the past, when we were in the Cold War environment \nwith the Soviet Union, we didn't deal with tactical nuclear weapons \nbecause we were concerned about these big missiles that could cross the \nocean and strike our country. We were concerned about heavy bombers \ndelivering missiles or bombs that would hit the homeland. That makes \nsense. But we are in a completely different environment now. While we \nshould still be concerned with those strategic weapons, the tactical \nweapons are actually much more of a danger to us because they are the \nvery weapons that could get into the hands of a rogue nation. Those are \nthe very weapons that could get into the hands of a terrorist.\n  This treaty doesn't have anything to do with that. It doesn't address \nit at all. It would be as if we were going to enter into a treaty about \nguns, and we had a big negotiation in a treaty where we talked about \nlong arms, shotguns, and rifles, but we failed to talk about pistols. \nIt doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't make any sense to me \nbecause these are the very weapons about which we should be the most\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nconcerned. It also doesn't make sense to me because of the disparity \nbetween how many tactical nuclear weapons we have versus how many the \nRussians have. This treaty limits the amount of those weapons to each \ncountry to around 1,500. But the Russians have 3,000 tactical nuclear \nweapons, and we have 300. So the Russians have a 10-to-1 advantage over \nus in tactical nuclear weapons. If we approve this treaty, the Russians \nthen will approximately have 4,500 nuclear weapons, and we will have \n1,800. That doesn't make a lot of sense either. They have a 10-to-1 \nadvantage on these tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I think it is incumbent upon us to realize that we have to have a \ntreaty on tactical nuclear weapons. It should have been part of this \ntreaty. It wasn't part of these START treaties in the past because the \ntotal number of weapons that the United States had and the former \nSoviet Union had was immense. When we had 20,000 or 30,000 strategic \nnuclear weapons, the fact that they had 3,000 tacticals didn't matter. \nIt wasn't an important number in the overall scheme.\n  But now that we are in this new world where we are concerned about \nnuclear proliferation, and we don't want terrorists to get these \nweapons, plus the fact that they are going to end up having 4,500 and \nwe are going to end up everything 1,800, it matters a lot.\n  My amendment says that within a year of the ratification of this \ntreaty, the Russians and the United States must sit down and negotiate \na tactical nuclear weapon agreement. It doesn't require that it be \nresolved within a year. It requires that it be started. That seems to \nme--I am a little biased, but that seems to me eminently reasonable. I \nam proud that Senators Chambliss and Inhofe have joined me on this \namendment. Who could be against having the Russians and the United \nStates sit down within a year's time of ratification and begin the \nnegotiation on tacticals? Who could be against that?\n  You will hear from my friends on the other side, who are defending \nthis treaty and voting down all of the amendments being offered on this \nside of the aisle, that we can't amend the treaty because, if we do, it \nis a poison pill, and the Russians will not accept it.\n  If that is true, then we are not really fulfilling much of a \nfunction, are we? Under the Constitution, there are some special \nprivileges that are imbued to the Senate.\n  One of them is the treaty privilege, the treaty power, where all \ntreaties must be confirmed by the Senate on a two-thirds vote. If we \ncan't amend it, and all we are doing is either saying yes or no, to me \nthat limits our ability. If my friends on the other side think this is \na poison pill, I ask them to look at the language. I am just putting in \nthe treaty, if they accept this, that within a year's time, we have to \nsit down at the table and enter into these negotiations on tacticals. \nIt is not a heavy lift, it seems to me.\n  They will say we can't do this because the Russian Duma will not \naccept it. What does that say? If the Russian Duma, their legislature, \nwill not accept an amendment--if the treaty is as it is now, as \nnegotiated by the U.S.--and I have said before that I have concerns \nabout what is there for verification and about missile defense. Putting \nthat aside, if it goes the way it has been drafted and agreed to \nbetween the President and the leaders of Russia, with just this one \namendment that says that the two sides will sit down within a year's \ntime, will the Russian Parliament not approve that? And if they don't \napprove it, if they will not say they will sit down within a year's \ntime and negotiate about the 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons they have, \nabout the security of those weapons, about our ability to verify where \nthey are and about a reduction of them, because of the disparity in the \n3,000 they have and the 300 we have, what does that say about the \nRussians?\n  What it says to me is that they are not, in good faith, really trying \nto come to an agreement about nuclear weapons. Would we want this \ntreaty if the Russian Duma said they are not going to agree to sit down \nwithin a year's time to talk about tactical nuclear weapons?\n  I think this is a very important amendment. I have great respect for \nthe people who have stood up and supported this treaty. I think there \nare problems with it, but I don't see any reason why a fair-minded \nperson could not agree that within a year's time the two parties should \nsit down and talk about what, to me, is the most dangerous part of our \nnuclear challenge with Russia, which is tactical nuclear weapons. We \ndon't know where they are, what they are doing, we can't verify them, \nand there is a 10-to-1 advantage that the Russians have over us.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is at the desk and has been called up. I \nhope we will have the opportunity to debate this amendment in the \ncoming hours and days as we wrap up our consideration of this treaty.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Senate \nratification of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The Secretary \nof State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and the entire \nuniformed leadership of our military believe it is in our national \ninterest. Former Secretaries of State from previous administrations of \nboth political parties have also endorsed the New START Treaty.\n  Relations between the United States and Russia have evolved beyond \nwhat they were during the Cold War. Within this context, and in the \nface of aging nuclear stockpiles, strategic arms reduction is in the \nbest interest of both nations.\n  New START will strengthen strategic nuclear weapons stability, enable \nus to modernize our nuclear triad of strategic weapons and delivery \nsystems, and ensure our flexibility to develop and deploy effective \nmissile defenses and conventional global strike capabilities.\n  It will also promote stability, transparency, and predictability in \nthe U.S.-Russia relationship.\n  The treaty limits strategic offensive nuclear weapons and delivery \nvehicles through effective verification and compliance measures. Our \nnegotiators ensured that the United States would be able to protect our \nability to field a flexible and effective strategic nuclear triad \ncomposed of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles, and nuclear-capable heavy and strategic \nbombers. Our negotiators also ensured that the United States can enable \nmodernization of our strategic delivery systems and the nuclear weapons \nthey carry.\n  Simply put, our country is better off with New START as opposed to \nnot having a treaty at all. There has been no formal verification \nsystem in place since the last treaty expired a year ago. New START \nreestablishes a strategic nuclear arms control verification regime that \nprovides access to Russian strategic nuclear capabilities--\nspecifically, nuclear warheads and delivery systems. It ensures a \nmeasure of predictability in Russian strategic force deployments over \nthe life of the treaty. Access and predictability allow us to \neffectively plan and undergo strategic modernization efforts.\n  Failure to ratify the treaty will prevent us from obtaining \ninformation on Russian strategic nuclear weapons capabilities. Without \nthe treaty going into effect, the United States will have no inspectors \non the ground and no ability to verify Russian nuclear activities. This \nwill result in our country losing insight into Russian strategic \nnuclear force deployments. It would also complicate our strategic force \nstrategy and modernization planning efforts, as well as drive up costs \nin response to the need to conduct increased intelligence and analysis \non Russian strategic force capabilities.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert \nGates, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff ADM Mike Mullen have expressed their support for Senate \nratification of New START. All indicated that ratifying the treaty \nprovides our country with an opportunity to negotiate with Russia on \ntactical nuclear weapons, of which Russia holds a sizable advantage. \nTactical nuclear weapons are the most vulnerable to theft and the most \nlikely to end up in the hands of rogue states and terrorist \norganizations. It is important to understand that we will not be able \nto obtain Russian cooperation on tactical nuclear weapons without \nratifying New START.\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\n  The treaty will not affect our ability to improve our missile \ndefenses either qualitatively or quantitatively, to defend our homeland \nagainst missile attacks, and to protect our deployed forces, allies, \nand partners from growing regional missile threats. Secretary of State \nClinton and Secretary of Defense Gates have testified that our phased \nadaptive approach to overseas missile defense is not constrained by the \ntreaty.\n  Senate ratification of New START will demonstrate that the United \nStates is committed to reducing nuclear weapons, which is important as \nwe advance our nonproliferation goals. This will assist us in obtaining \ninternational consensus regarding nuclear weapons proliferation \nchallenges from rogue states, such as Iran and North Korea. It will \nalso send a positive message in achieving consensus with other \ncountries on nuclear issues.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the United States and Russia \nhold over 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. If the two nations \nthat possess the most nuclear weapons agree on verification and \ncompliance and are committed to nonproliferation, it will improve our \nability to achieve consensus with other countries.\n  Failure to ratify the treaty will have a detrimental effect on our \nability to influence other nations with regard to nonproliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. It will also send conflicting messages \nabout the administration's emphasis and commitment to the \nnonproliferation treaty.\n  Additionally, failure to ratify New START would send a negative \nsignal to Russia that may cause them to not support our objectives with \nrespect to dealing with the Iranian nuclear program. As Secretary of \nDefense Gates has said, without ratification, we put at risk the \ncoalition and momentum we have built to pressure Iran.\n  The debate over New START has facilitated a consensus to modernize \nour nuclear deterrent. The Administrator of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, Mr. Thomas D'Agostino, indicated that for the \nfirst time since the end of the Cold War, there is broad national \nconsensus on the role nuclear weapons play in our defense and the \nrequirements to maintain our nuclear deterrent. The NNSA and the three \nNational Laboratories support Senate ratification of New START and \ncongressional approval of the President's budget to invest in nuclear \nsecurity and modernization. Our nuclear enterprise and stockpile have \nbeen neglected for too long.\n  Consistent with recommendations in the Nuclear Posture Review, we \nneed to move forward with a number of nuclear enterprise sustainment \nprojects, including strengthening our nuclear command and control \nstructure, continuing development and deployment of our triad of \ndelivery systems, maintaining a safe, secure, and effective stockpile, \nand revitalizing our aging infrastructure.\n  On December 1, the Directors of the three nuclear national \nlaboratories signed a letter to the Senate emphasizing that they were \nvery pleased with the administration's plan to spend $85 billion over \nthe next decade to upgrade the nuclear weapons complex. They believe \nthe requested amount will further a balanced program that sustains the \nscience, technology, and engineering base. They also believe that the \nproposed budget will support the ability to sustain the safety, \nsecurity, reliability, and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent \nwithin the limit of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads established by \nNew START.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review also recognizes the importance of \nsupporting a highly capable workforce with specialized skills to \nsustain the nuclear deterrent. It emphasizes three key elements of \nstockpile stewardship: hands-on work on the stockpile; the science, \ntechnology, and engineering base; and the infrastructure at the \nlaboratories and plants.\n  I share the concerns expressed by Secretary Chu regarding our ability \nto recruit the best and brightest nuclear scientists and engineers. We \nneed to infuse a sense of importance and financial stability to the \nstockpile stewardship and life extension programs. Nuclear scientists \nand engineers need to believe the U.S. Government cares about nuclear \nlife extension. An effective science, technology, and engineering human \ncapital base is needed to conduct effective nuclear weapons system \nlifetime extension programs, increase nuclear weapons reliability, \ncertify nuclear weapons without the need to undergo nuclear testing, \nand provide annual stockpile assessments through weapons surveillance.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in \nvoting to ratify New START.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to comment on the \namendment our colleague from Florida spoke about a few moments ago. \nTactical nuclear weapons and how that is addressed was the subject of a \nlong debate yesterday. I wish to reiterate some of those arguments \nbecause we had this debate yesterday. It is an important debate.\n  First of all, if we listen to a couple of folks who have not only \nexperience but have a real interest in our urgent priority of \naddressing tactical nuclear weapons, it becomes clear that the best way \nto address that issue is, in fact, to ratify this treaty. By way of \nexample, if you want to highlight a country that has much at stake when \nthe question is raised about Russian tactical nuclear weapons, you can \npoint to few if any countries that have more at stake than Poland.\n  The Polish Foreign Minister, Mr. Sikorski, said:\n\n       Without a [New START] treaty in place, holes will soon \n     appear in the nuclear umbrella that the United States \n     provides to Poland and other allies under article 5 of the \n     Washington Treaty, the collective security guarantee for NATO \n     members. Moreover, New START is a necessary stepping stone to \n     future negotiations with Russia about reductions in tactical \n     nuclear arsenals and a prerequisite for the successful \n     revival of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe.\n\n  That is not a commentator in Washington; that is the Foreign Minister \nof Poland, whose country has a lot at stake in this debate.\n  Also, we have had a lot of discussions about the treaty and what is \nin the treaty or what would come about as a result of the treaty. It is \nnot as if these arguments just landed here when the bill landed on the \nfloor. We had months and months of hearings in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. Our ranking member, Senator Lugar, was not just \nthere for those hearings but played a leading role in helping us reach \nthe point where we are now. We have a treaty on the floor because of \nhis good work over many months and, I would argue in his case, many \nyears on this issue. The same is true with the Presiding Officer \nsitting in on those hearings and asking questions of the relevant \nparties, many of them military leaders.\n  I note for the record--and I will close with this--that the vote by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee included a resolution of advice \nand consent to ratification. Subsection 11 on tactical nuclear weapons \nsays:\n\n       The Senate calls upon the President to pursue, following \n     consultation with allies, an agreement with the Russian \n     Federation that would address the disparity between the \n     tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation \n     and of the United States and would secure and reduce tactical \n     nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.\n\n  It is right in the resolution, and I argue that addresses squarely \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the New Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty that we call New START. I believe New START is \ndeeply flawed and is a dangerous step toward undermining our national \nsecurity. I believe it does not strengthen verification or transparency \nof Russia's nuclear arsenal. We negotiated this treaty with Russia when \nour time may have been better spent focusing on nuclear threats posed \nby other nations. I believe the treaty is virtually unverifiable. \nSimply put, it is the wrong approach to both reducing the arms race and \nreaching the ideal of living in a nuclear-free world.\n  Many people have expressed the numerous shortcomings of this treaty. \nThis evening I would like to touch on three.\n  First, New START restricts the future of our missile defense. \nPresident Obama campaigned against missile defense and has \nsystematically cut funding for it. It should not be a surprise to \nanyone in America that the administration lacks commitment to a robust \nmissile defense system, but that does not mean the Senate needs to \nsupport it. New START links offensive reductions with missile defense. \nI believe these must be decoupled. Why? The treaty limits launch \nvehicles and restricts the conversion of intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles for missile defense purposes. Converting nuclear \nintercontinental ballistic missiles to conventional missiles is also \nrestricted in the proposed treaty. Most egregiously, statements made by \nsenior Russian officials insist that the treaty's language prohibits \nthe United States from developing an antiballistic missile defense \nsystem without Russian consent. This is completely unacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, Russia is not the only threat the United States faces \nin this world. It is inconceivable that the administration would agree \nto a treaty that imposes such restrictions on our national security.\n  Secondly, we have reached the point where we cannot make reductions \nin our nuclear arsenal without viable plans for a strong, long-term \nstrategy for modernization. Again, Russia is not our Nation's only \nthreat. Without modernizing our nuclear arsenal, the cuts necessitated \nby the New START treaty would likely encourage Iran and other \nproliferators to build up their own arsenals rather than discouraging \nthem as we would like.\n  The United States cannot maintain a credible deterrent or reduce the \nnumber of weapons in our nuclear stockpile without ensuring that we \nhave reliable warning, command, and control systems, and that we put an \nemphasis on the land and sea-based delivery vehicles that give us the \nconfidence we need for protecting ourselves should the worst occur. The \nreduction of our nuclear-capable bombers and land or submarine-based \nmissiles from 1,600 to 700 gives the Russians an immense advantage. \nDelivery vehicles are just one aspect of our nuclear triad, but they \nare a critical component to being able to deter adversaries and should \nnot be restricted under the New START treaty.\n  By some estimates, Russia maintains thousands more small tactical \nnuclear warheads that can be delivered by way of artillery shells, \ncruise missiles, and aircraft. Yet the treaty before us, which freezes \nmissiles at 700 for each side, willfully ignores the massive Russian \nadvantage in tactical weapons.\n  Finally, the most serious and immediate flaw is weakened verification \nrequirements which are vastly less robust than those we had under START \nI. It is puzzling why they would do this. Under START I, 600 \ninspections were conducted. New START requires just 180 inspections \nover the life of the treaty, hardly enough to ensure Russian \ncompliance. The Russians will be able to encript telemetry from missile \ntests. This makes it harder for us to know for certain what new \ncapabilities the Russians are developing.\n  One might ask why did we agree to such. Under New START, there will \nno longer be onsite monitoring of mobile missile final assembly \nfacilities. Before the expiration of START I, the United States used \nthis monitoring or verification because satellites do not provide the \nexact information on mobile weapons systems. Verification requirements \nare too weak to reliably verify the treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed \nwarheads. These measures will neither give us confidence in the process \nnor the assurances we need to assess the integrity of it.\n  Russia has a long history of nuclear duplicity or cheating. Yet New \nSTART has substantially weaker verification mechanisms than START I.\n  Perhaps the clearest reason to suspect the true motivations behind \nthe treaty is the inexplicable rush to ratify it now. The shortcomings \nof New START are numerous, substantial, and serious. The Senate should \nhave the time to examine the treaty's compliance provisions and ensure \nthat loopholes are closed and deficiencies amended.\n  I believe the Senate has a responsibility to the American people to \nensure that first and foremost our country's negotiations have not \nunilaterally hampered in any way our national security. I will not \nsupport subordinating U.S. national security to an untrustworthy \npartner, and neither should the Senate as a whole.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4833\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding in 45 minutes we \nare going to be having a couple votes, one on amendment No. 4833 and \none on the Thune amendment No. 4841, having to do with delivery \nsystems; mine having\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\nto do with verification. That would mean we would have 45 minutes to \ntalk about this.\n  We have already covered it pretty thoroughly. I think we need to have \nan understanding of what we are talking about in terms of verification.\n  There are only 180 inspections that are authorized by the New START \ntreaty, and that is over a 10-year period. So we are talking about 18 \nper year versus the 600 inspections over 15 years in START I. If you do \nyour math, that would be 40 a year in START I, and down to 18 a year in \nNew START.\n  One of the arguments for that is that we have fewer sites to inspect, \nand for that reason we do not need to have as many inspections. I would \ndisagree with that pretty strongly. One thing all the experts seem to \nhave in common and agreeing to is that once you get down to fewer \nsites, the verification becomes more important.\n  John Bolton, on the 3rd of May, said: ``while [verification is] \nimportant in any arms-control treaty, verification becomes even more \nimportant at lower warhead levels.'' I think they all agree. Brent \nScowcroft said the same thing. He said: ``Current force levels provide \na kind of buffer because they are high enough to be relatively \ninsensitive to imperfect intelligence and modest force changes. . . . \nAs force levels go down, the balance of nuclear power can become \nincreasingly delicate and vulnerable to cheating''--``to cheating''--\n``on arms control limits, concerns about `hidden' missiles, and the \nactions of nuclear third parties.''\n  So he is saying the same thing. James Baker said the same thing. He \nsaid, when testifying recently, that the New START verification program \n``does not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one that verified the \nnumerous and diverse treaty obligations and prohibitions under START I. \nThis complex part of the treaty is even more crucial when fewer \ndeployed nuclear warheads are allowed than were allowed in the past.''\n  Do your math, and it figures out. If you have 10 warheads that you \nare going to be inspecting, and they hide 1, that is just 10 percent of \nthem. If it gets down to 2, and they hide 1, that is 50 percent of \nthem. That is what they are saying, that we need to have more, not \nless. Of course, this is less. In fact, if you do the math a little bit \nfurther, as was said by the Senator from Massachusetts--he said: So I \nthink it is one thing to ask our strategic forces to do that 10 times a \nyear, or less than once a month. It is another thing for them to be \nwaiting for 30 inspections a year. Again quoting him: We have two \nsubmarine bases, three bomber bases, and three ICBM bases. On the other \nhand, Russia has 3, 3, and 12. So they actually have 18, and we would \nhave 8, which means, if you do the math further, they would be able to \ninspect one site every 2 years, while we would only be able to inspect \nevery 2 years. They would be inspecting it every 1 year.\n  That is the reason we should be doing this. The other thing is--and \npeople keep forgetting about it because it is not fun to talk about \nit--but the fact is, they cheat and we do not. Everyone has talked \nabout this. We have something that was set up to try to measure who is \ncheating, who is not cheating.\n  We had the START treaty's Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission. \nThat commission reported--they actually had two reports. One report was \nin 2005; one in 2010. In the report in 2005 that was on the Biological \nWeapons Convention, the State Department concluded--and I am quoting \nfrom the report of 2005--``Russia maintains a mature offensive \nbiological weapons program and that its nature and status have not \nchanged.'' That was after it had been in force for 5 years. That was in \n2005.\n  In 2010, that same Commission comes back, and the report states: \nRussia confidence-building measure declarations since 1992 have not \nsatisfactorily documented whether its biological weapons program was \nterminated.\n  Again we have the Biological Weapons Convention reports in 2005 and \n2010, saying they are not complying. In other words, they are cheating. \nIf you sign an agreement and do not do it, then you are cheating. That \nmakes sense. On the Chemical Weapons Convention, the same thing. In \n2005, the State Department assessed that ``Russia is in violation of \nits Chemical Weapons Convention obligations because its declaration was \nincomplete with respect to declaration of production and development \nfacilities.'' So that is what they said in 2005, that they are cheating \non the Chemical Weapons Convention obligations they made, their treaty \nobligations.\n  In 2010, still talking about the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \nState Department again stated: There was an absence of additional \ninformation from Russia, resulting in the United States being unable to \nascertain whether Russia has declared all of its chemical weapons \nstockpile, all chemical weapons production facilities, and all of its \nchemical weapons development facilities.\n  Again, they stated in 2010 that they are still cheating. So it is \nalways difficult, when you look at these. The Senator from \nMassachusetts said: Well, wait a minute now. We have to do the same \nthing they have to do, and in your amendment, if we are going to have \nthree times as many inspections, then we have to do three times as many \nand they have to do three times as many. We have to prepare for them \nhere. I said: Yes, that is my point. We need to have more inspections. \nWe want these inspections to take place. And we want to be sure that \nthe Russians also adhere to their commitment for inspections, which \nthey have never done in the past.\n  When you look at this, we see there are problems with this. When you \ntalk about using the argument that we cannot change something because \nyou are changing the treaty, I think that is what we are supposed to \ndo. We are supposed to be involved in the treaty. The Senator from \nMassachusetts was talking about the number of people who were involved \nin this thing--the military and all these others in putting this thing \ntogether. Well, guess who was left out? Us. And that is what the \nConstitution, under article II, section 2 says, that we in the Senate \nare supposed to ratify--advice and consent. Well, we have been advised, \nbut we have not consented yet. That is what this is all about. The \nprocess works this way.\n  If we do pass an amendment such as my amendment that will be voted on \nin a few minutes to triple the number of inspections, that will change \nthe treaty, and I understand that. That means it will have to go back \nto the Duma in Russia, and they then would have to look at the treaty \nand decide whether they would agree with it, and, if not, have them \nmake a change, and then it comes back to us. It goes back and forth, \nand this is what our forefathers had anticipated would happen. Because \nof all the people who they talk about, the Senator from Massachusetts \ntalks about, who were drafting this, the thing they all have in common \nis, they are not answerable to the people. We are. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, we were both elected. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, he was elected and I was elected; and, therefore, we are the \nears and the eyes in the confirmation process for the public, and I \nthink that is our constitutional obligation. It is very clearly stated.\n  So we do have serious problems. One thing that is kind of in the \nweeds and is a little bit complicated is, when you talk about that my \namendment triples the number of inspections under New START from the \ntypes under the START I treaty, we had two types of inspections. This \nis critical. Type one refers to inspections of the ICBM bases, \nsubmarine bases, air bases--these are the delivery systems--to \ndemonstrate very clearly that we are going to be able to look at those \nsites and see if they are carrying out those obligations under the \ntreaty.\n  But type two refers to inspections at formerly declared facilities. \nThey say we have more inspections right now. That is because we did not \neven have type two facilities in the START I treaty, because when you \ntalk about formerly declared facilities, we are talking about \nfacilities that are closed down. So we want to inspect to make sure \nthey are closed down. So the test they use to see whether they are \nclosed down is--they talk about debris. That is how you satisfy to see \nwhether type two sites have been treated properly. Well, they can have \ndebris left over from closing one site, and then leave five open that \nare supposed to be closed and scatter the debris around to use it \nagain. There has been testimony that is what they would do.\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\n  I would be glad to yield, since we are going to have two votes coming \nup at 6 o'clock on the Thune amendment as well as my amendment, if the \nSenator from South Dakota wishes to talk about his amendment, and then \nI would be glad to resume my discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n6 p.m. today be for debate with respect to the pending Inhofe amendment \nNo. 4833 and pending Thune amendment No. 4841, with the time divided \nbetween the leaders or their designees, with no amendments in order to \neither amendment; that at 6 p.m., the Senate then proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Inhofe amendment; that upon its disposition, the Senate \nthen proceed to vote in relation to the Thune amendment, with 2 minutes \nof debate, equally divided as provided above, prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding some time. We are going to vote on his amendment and on the \namendment I have offered. Both address important subjects in the \ntreaty. The Senator from Oklahoma is dealing with the issue of \nverification and pointing out the shortcomings in the treaty with \nregard to that very important issue. The amendment I will have voted on \ndeals with the issue of delivery vehicles, which, in my judgment, is a \ncritically important element in this treaty as well.\n  As I have said earlier today on the floor, what this amendment does--\nit is very straightforward and it is very simple--is it just increases \nthe number of deployed delivery vehicles, which are the bombers, the \nsubmarines, and the ICBMs allowed for in the treaty from 700 to 720.\n  In terms of background about why that is important--and I want to \ninform my colleagues in the Senate about why it is important we get \nthat number up to 720--I asked at an Armed Services Committee hearing \nat what point between the range of 500 and 1,100 delivery systems that \nGEN James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nwould be comfortable and where we would avoid making our triad into a \ndyad.\n  He said: ``I would be very concerned if we got down below those \nlevels about midpoint,'' meaning that he would be concerned if the \nnegotiated number fell below about 800 delivery vehicles. They have \nmade a distinction--the administration has--between deployed and \nnondeployed, that there are 800 there. And he has subsequently said he \ncould live with a 700 deployed number. But the fact of the matter is \nthat the concern that was voiced initially about dropping down below \nthat midpoint level suggests that we need to at least increase up to \nwhere the administration's I guess you would call it their nuclear \nforce structure plan settled, and that was 720 delivery vehicles.\n  So the amendment raises from 700 to 720 the number of delivery \nvehicles. As I said earlier in my remarks, if you look at what the 1251 \nreport says, it says up to 60 nuclear-capable bombers, up to 420 \ndeployed ICBMs, and 240 deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles \non 14 submarines.\n  If you add up, up to 60 bombers, up to 420 ICBMs and 240 deployed \nSLBMs, you get a number of 720 delivery vehicles. That is what the \nnuclear force structure plan calls for. Yet the treaty specifies 700 \ndelivery vehicles. So there is a 20-delivery vehicle cap there, which I \nthink is important.\n\n  Frankly, if you ask the question about where would those reductions \ncome from, obviously it would come from either ICBMs or bombers. People \nhave suggested it doesn't have to come out of the bombers, but if you \ndid take it out of the bombers, if you reduce the number of bombers \nfrom the 60 that is specified in the nuclear force structure plan to \nget down under 700, you would have to take the bombers from 60 down to \n40.\n  As I said earlier today, we have about 96 B-52 nuclear bombers, about \n20 B-2 nuclear bombers, and those are total deployed and nondeployed, \nthe number we have in our inventory arsenal. We have about 94, I think, \nthat are combat ready. But in any case, we are talking about a \nsignificant reduction in the number of bombers we could deploy at any \ngiven time under the treaty if you get it down to the 700 number.\n  The question as to whether that would come out of ICBMs or whether it \nwould come out of bombers to get from 720 down to 700, it could be some \ncombination of both. But the thing that concerns me about this is we \nhave a bomber fleet that is aging. Most of our bombers today are pre-\nCuban missile crisis-era vintage bombers--about 47 percent of them are. \nWe need a follow-on, a next-generation bomber that will fill that role, \nthat will be survivable in the types of modern-era defenses we are \ngoing to encounter, sophisticated air defense systems that are being \nemployed by some of our potential adversaries around the world. So if \nyou think about what we need in terms of a next-generation bomber, we \nneed a field bomber and we need to do it sooner rather than later and \nit needs to be nuclear.\n  But when asked the question about whether the next bomber would be a \nnuclear bomber, the military and the administration have been very \nambiguous on that point. They haven't been able to answer clearly, with \nany degree of certainty, about whether the next bomber, the follow-on \nbomber, would, in fact, be a nuclear bomber, which would suggest to me \nthe commitment to the bomber wing of the triad is a lot less than it is \nto perhaps the other two legs of the triad.\n  That being said, let's assume for the moment that if we have up to 60 \nbombers, we have up to 420 ICBMs, and we have 240 submarine launchable \nballistic missiles, we are talking about a 720 number, not a 700 \nnumber. So that is why I think this debate is important and why we are \ntrying to be insistent in getting those two numbers to match.\n  The other point I wish to make is with regard to delivery vehicles in \nthe treaty. We start out right now with about 856 delivery vehicles, if \nyou add up ICBMs, submarine launchable ballistic missiles, and heavy \nbombers. We will end up down at 700. So we are going to take about 156 \nof our delivery vehicles, reduce that, retire those, and get down to \nthat 700 number. The Russians, on the other hand, start at about 620. \nSo they are already well below the 700 number called for in the treaty. \nIt has been suggested that through attrition they will probably get \ndown to somewhere in the 400s in delivery vehicles. So this particular \nprovision in the treaty costs them nothing. We give up 156 delivery \nvehicles. They give up nothing. In fact, they can come up to the 700 \nnumber. They could increase the number of delivery vehicles they \ncurrently have to come up to that 700 number.\n  So I think it is important to point out the difference that exists \ntoday and the disparity that exists between the Russian number of \ndelivery vehicles and the number the United States has at our disposal \nand the number called for in the treaty and why that disparity is so \nimportant.\n  Just one final point, if I might, with regard to the nuclear posture \nof the country. We also have to defend not only the United States but \nabout 30 other countries around the world that fall under the nuclear \numbrella, under our deterrence. The Russians have none. So these \ndelivery vehicle numbers become even more important, given the \ngeographic realities the United States has to deal with in terms of our \nstrategic nuclear forces and what they are expected to do in terms of \nproviding extended deterrence not only to the United States but to many \nof our allies around the world.\n  So I think it is important in this treaty debate--this particular \npart of it--that we get a vote on this amendment. It has been suggested \nthat if this amendment gets adopted, we will have to go back to the \nRussians. That is part of our goal of advice and consent in the Senate. \nIf it were just consent, we would be nothing more than a rubberstamp. I \nthink we have an important role; that is, to look at these critical \nissues, and where there are areas of disagreement, to provide our \nadvice. I think, in a very straightforward way, we can vote on an \namendment that would increase from 700 to 720 the number of delivery \nvehicles specified in the treaty. It is a very straightforward \namendment and one that would then go back, obviously, to\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nthe Russians, but it is certainly consistent with the Senate's \ntraditional and historic role of advice and consent.\n  Former Defense Secretary Schlesinger testified to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on April 29, 2010, that: ``As to the stated context \nof the strategic nuclear weapons, the numbers specified are adequate, \nthough barely so.''\n  Well, ``barely so'' does not seem to be good enough for me when we \nare talking about the important obligations we have in defending \nAmerica's vital national security interests as well as those of many of \nour allies around the world. I don't think settling for barely enough \nor barely so is sufficient.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I think, as I \nsaid earlier, the triad is critical to our nuclear deterrence and \nmaintaining both ICBMs and SLBMs, but then also having a very robust \nbomber component of that is critical. That is why investing in a next-\ngeneration, follow-on bomber that is nuclear is important. I think the \nambiguity that surrounds the question, the uncertainty that surrounds \nthe question about whether a follow-on bomber would be nuclear speaks \nvolumes about the commitment to that leg of the triad, but it is also \nimportant to remember bombers are the best form of extended deterrence.\n  If you want to make those who would proliferate nuclear weapons pay \nattention, you send a bomber in. A bomber is very visible, it is \nrecallable, it is survivable, and it brings great psychological and \npolitical advantage to our country when it comes to trying to \ndiscourage proliferation by other countries around the world.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment. The delivery vehicle issue is, to me, critical to \nthis debate not only in terms of the numbers but also the modernization \nof those various elements of the triad. The triad, over time, has given \nus great survivability, great flexibility, and if ever called upon, we \nwant to be as prepared as we possibly can be to encounter any nuclear \nthreat that might exist to the United States. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment.\n  I will reserve my time and yield back now to the Senator from \nOklahoma, who I think probably wants to continue to talk about the \nverification issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I concur in everything the \nSenator from South Dakota said, and I join him in encouraging people to \nvote favorably on his amendment. It seems as though the other side has \nhad the opportunity to do a lot more testing, a lot more modernization \nthan we have, and I am very much concerned about that.\n  I wish to elaborate on one thing. The fact that there is--that the \nother side--and I read all the quotes from the previous Commissions \nthat took place in 2005 and 2010 to demonstrate very clearly that the \nRussians would sign a treaty and then they will cheat. They would not \ncomply with the treaty. We saw it with the chemical weapons treaty and \nthe biological weapons treaty and START I. So there is no reason to \nbelieve they are going to do this. So in terms of verification, we have \nto try to do something where we are convinced, knowing full well in \nadvance that they are going to cheat.\n  That brings up one issue that I haven't mentioned before in this \ntreaty; that is, the length of time we have between notification and \nactually causing an inspection. Under the START I treaty it was 9 \nhours, and it has gone up to 24 hours in this treaty. In other words, \nif someone is going to cheat, if someone is going to hide something so \nwe would not know where to look and we might not be able to find \nsomething, why give them three times as much time as we did under START \nI, when we know more today about the fact that they cheat than we knew \nbefore? The second issue is, it becomes more important--as you get \ncloser to the inspections and as there are fewer facilities to inspect, \neach one becomes more important, and we have had an opportunity to see \nthat everyone seems to agree with that.\n\n  Former Secretary Harold Brown explained this in his testimony before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That was way back in 1991. He \nsaid:\n\n       Verification will become even more important as the numbers \n     of strategic nuclear weapons on each side decreases, because \n     uncertainties of a given size become a larger percentage of \n     the total force as this occurs.\n\n  I think I used the example that if you had 10 and you cheat on 1, \nthat is 10 percent, but if you have 2 and you cheat on 1, that is 50 \npercent.\n  That statement is agreed with by John Bolton, who said:\n\n       While [verification is] important in any arms-control \n     treaty, verification becomes even more important at lower \n     warhead levels.\n\n  Again, he agrees.\n  Scowcroft, the same thing. He said:\n\n       . . . as force levels go down, the balance of nuclear power \n     can become increasingly delicate and vulnerable to cheating \n     on arms control limits, concerns about ``hidden'' missiles, \n     and the actions of nuclear third parties.\n\n  So I think everyone does understand and does agree that as they \ndecrease, then each one becomes more significant in terms of being \ninspected.\n  In this amendment, we are changing it from the 180 inspections over a \n10-year period to what they would have under New START versus the old \none, which was 600 inspections over 15 years. Do the math on that, and \nyou come up with 18 inspections a year as opposed to 40 inspections a \nyear.\n  They are trying to say there are only 36 sites, which means--if this \nis true--we would only get to inspect each site in Russia once every 2 \nyears, while the math works out that they would be able to do our side \nonce every year. So that is something that is very concerning to me.\n  We talked a lot about where we are in this process. We have talked \nabout our constitutional obligations, about what we are supposed to do \nunder the Constitution. We talked about what we are supposed to provide \nfor the common defense in article II, section 2 of the Constitution, \nwhich gives the President the prime role, but we have to advise and \nconsent. I saw something recently, just today I think it is, that came \nout--yes, it was just today. It came out from Foreign Minister Sergey \nLavrov in his statement. He said:\n\n       ``I can only underscore that the Strategic Nuclear Arms \n     Treaty, worked out on the strictest basis of parity, in our \n     view fully answers to the national interests of Russia and \n     the United States,'' Interfax quoted Lavrov as saying in an \n     interview.\n       ``It cannot be opened up and become the subject of new \n     negotiations,'' Lavrov said.\n\n  Who is this guy telling us what we can do under our Constitution? I \nfind it almost laughable because it is just as if all he has to do is \nsay that and we have to follow the course.\n  But he said Russian lawmakers would closely examine the U.S. \nratification resolution and any declarations or notes accompanying it \nto ensure no significant changes were made.\n  If changes are made, then they have not kept up their responsibility.\n  I would only remind my colleagues that:\n\n       As CRS has outlined in its study--\n\n  And this is a study they did not too long ago--\n\n     on the role of the Senate in a treaty process: Amendments are \n     proposed changes in the actual text of the treaty . . . \n     [They] amount, therefore, to Senate counter offers that alter \n     the original deal agreed to by the United States and the \n     other country.\n\n  If the Senate gives its consent to New START with an amendment to the \ntext, the treaty is sent back over to Russia and the Duma meets and \nthey decide what they are going to do with it. Then, of course, they \nmake changes and then it comes back over here. This is something that \nhas been going on for 200 years.\n  All of a sudden, why are we in a position where we are not going to \ndo it and we look at our constitutional responsibility as something \nthat is in the past?\n  So I feel we have this obligation, and I know so far every amendment \nthat would have amended the treaty has been defeated, and it has been \ndefeated on party--well, not necessarily on party lines but, by and \nlarge, on party lines. This is something very concerning to me.\n  The other issue is, when we talk about tripling the number of \ninspections under the New START, we have heard it said several times: \nWell, there are fewer sites. But I would like to suggest that the type \ntwo--keep in mind type one refers to inspections of ICBM bases, air \nbases, those facilities that are active today.\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 14 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Did my colleague need to finish up a thought? If so, I am \nhappy to yield him a minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for the \ndiscussion we had yesterday and again today about verification. I know \nit is an issue he thinks is critical. I think every Senator here is \nabsolutely convinced we need to have the strongest verification regime \npossible. The fact is that this treaty, the New START treaty, has \nexactly that. It has an effective verification system. Does it have a \nperfect system? No treaty that has ever been passed or been negotiated \nwould be that one-sided and be able to achieve that. It is an effective \nverification system, which is the standard we have used ever since \nPresident Reagan negotiated those treaties, and Paul Nitze, one of our \ngreat arms control statesmen, really defined that concept of effective \nverification.\n  I wish to quote what Secretary Gates said about this. I don't need to \nremind colleagues, but I guess people in the public who don't \nnecessarily focus on it might be impacted to know that Secretary Gates \nwas appointed by President George Bush, and he was held over as \nSecretary of Defense by President Obama. By everybody's judgment here \nin the Senate, he is a man of great credibility and distinction who has \nworked through many different layers of American government. He is one \nof the people for whom we have great respect. In a letter he wrote to \nSenator Isakson this summer, he said:\n\n       I believe that the number of inspections provided for by \n     the New START Treaty, along with other verification \n     mechanisms, provides a firm basis for verifying Russia's \n     compliance with its Treaty obligations while also providing \n     important insights into the size and composition of Russian \n     strategic forces.\n\n  I know the Senator from Oklahoma is concerned about the number of \ninspections. He has several times raised the question of cutting the \ninspections from the original START to the New START. I want to walk \nthrough it again so we are absolutely clear.\n  Comparing the number of inspections under START I to the number of \ninspections under New START is literally an apples-to-oranges \ncomparison for three reasons--one, today we are only conducting \ninspections in one country instead of four. Under START I, we had \nBelarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes, as long as I don't lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nextended by 10 minutes--5 minutes for the Senator from Massachusetts \nand 5 additional minutes for the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure because \npeople were planning schedules around it.\n  We have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Secretary Gates said this about the--well, \nlet me finish that thought about the difference. So when we had those 4 \ncountries, we had 70 sites that were subject to inspection. Under this \ntreaty, there were 35 sites subject to inspection, but they are all in \none country--Russia--because all of the weapons were moved to Russia \nafter the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  Secondly, we are inspecting half as many facilities, and when we \ninspect those facilities, we, thirdly, have a type one inspection and a \ntype two inspection, which allows us to be able to go in and look at \nthe missile but to also do an update inspection, which is sort of a \ngeneral inspection of the up-to-date status of the various things we \nlook at in the course of an inspection, which, in effect, really \ndoubles the amount of inspections we have because under START I, if you \nwent in and did an update inspection, that was it. You didn't get to do \nthe missile inspection or vice versa. We really have a two-for-one \nhere. It is disingenuous to reflect that in the comments about how we \ncount here. We are talking about a completely comparable inspection \nregime under New START as under START I.\n  Finally, we addressed this question of verification in condition 2 of \nthe resolution of ratification. That condition requires that before New \nSTART can enter into force--and every year thereafter--the President of \nthe United States has to certify to the Senate that our national \ntechnical means, in conjunction with New START's verification \nactivities, are sufficient to ensure adequate and effective monitoring \nof Russian compliance. So we are going to remain right in the center of \nthis issue of verification every year this treaty is in force, and the \nSenate is going to be part of that process.\n  Let me briefly turn back to something Senator Thune said earlier. He \nsaid this treaty was negotiated with the assumption that the Russians \nweren't going to cheat. No, Mr. President, it is not accurate that \nthere was any such assumption whatsoever, and that is precisely why we \nhave a verification structure here. It is why we are taking this \ndiscussion so seriously, because we don't take people at their word. We \nhave to verify. That is what the verification regime is for.\n  Let me also be clear on what Secretary Gates said here. Senator \nInhofe quoted the Secretary saying that the Russians would not be able \nto achieve any militarily significant cheating under this verification \nregime. That is the judgment of our intelligence community, but it \ndoesn't mean that they think or that we think they might not try to \ncheat. It means that if they do, it is going--if it is militarily \nsignificant, we will see it, we will know it, and we will understand \nexactly what they are doing. So we can respond, as Secretary Gates has, \nby increasing the size of our force, by increasing the alert level of \nSSBNs and bombers, and by uploading warheads on bombers, SSBNs, and on \nICBMs. There are all kinds of things we can do to respond the minute we \nnotice that kind of militarily significant event.\n  It is my judgment that this amendment does not give us anything in \nthe way of additional confidence, but it certainly will give us months \nof unnecessary and even counterproductive renegotiation of the treaty. \nThat means that by reaching for three times the number of inspections, \nwe would guarantee that for months and months we will have zero, \nabsolutely none. That is the tradeoff.\n  I think we need to get our verification team back in place, and I \nthink that is what is most imperative in terms of the national security \ninterests of the country.\n  I thank Senator Thune for his amendment. I thank him also for the \nconstructive discussion we have had about these numbers with respect to \nmissiles and bombers in order to maintain our nuclear deterrent.\n  I think this is another place where it is pretty important for all of \nus to listen to our military. They have made the judgments here, and \nthey have been very transparent about how they have made those \njudgments. We have been able to query them in the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Intelligence Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand the National Security Working Group. They have arrived at the \njudgment--not a political judgment but a military judgment--that the \ntreaty's limit of 700 delivery vehicles is perfectly adequate to defend \nour Nation and our allies at the same time.\n  As the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, GEN James Cartwright, who \nwas a former strategic commander, said:\n\n       I think we have more than enough capacity and capability \n     for any threat that we see today or that might emerge in the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  This amendment seeks to insert sort of our arbitrary judgment that, \noh, we ought to have 20 additional. I remind the Senators what LTG \nFrank Klotz, the commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command, \nsaid. That is the command that oversees ICBMs and bombers. Just last \nFriday, he said:\n\n       I think the START Treaty ought to be ratified, and it ought \n     to be ratified now, this week.\n\n  The military came to this conclusion after the Department of Defense \nconducted a very thorough review of our\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nnuclear posture, including detailed force-on-force analyses. We shared \nsome of that discussion in the classified session earlier. Our nuclear \ncommanders have done the math, run the scenarios, and they have \nconcluded that we only need 700 delivery vehicles.\n  General Chilton, head of the Strategic Command, said:\n\n       The options we provided in this process focused on ensuring \n     America's ability to continue to deter potential adversaries, \n     assure our allies, and sustain strategic stability for as \n     long as nuclear weapons exist. This rigorous approach, rooted \n     in deterrent strategy and assessment of potential adversary \n     capabilities, supports both the agreed-upon limits in New \n     START and recommendations in the Nuclear Posture Review.\n\n  I do know the Senator expressed some concern about our ability to \nfield Prompt Global Strike systems. It is true that conventionally \narmed ICBMs will count toward the treaty's limits, but again, let's \nlisten to what the military says.\n  Secretary Gates stated for the record that:\n\n       Should we decide to deploy them, counting this small number \n     of conventional strategic systems and their warheads towards \n     the treaty limits will not prevent the United States from \n     maintaining a robust nuclear deterrent.\n\n  Admiral Mullen said as far back as March that the treaty protects our \nability to develop a conventional global strike capability should that \nbe required.\n  I also point to our resolution of ratification, condition 6, \nunderstanding 3, and declaration 3, all of which go toward preserving \nour ability to deploy conventional Prompt Global Strike forces.\n  Finally, the Senator raised the possibility that we are moving from a \ntriad to a dyad. I wish to be especially clear on this point. The \nadministration has stated forcefully and again today reiterated in a \nletter sent to us by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \nMullen, in which he reiterates the administration's commitment to the \ntriad. As it said in the ``update'' section of the 1251 report:\n\n       The administration remains committed to the sustainment and \n     modernization of U.S. strategic delivery systems.\n\n  Regarding heavy bombers, that same report says:\n\n       DOD plans to sustain a heavy bomber leg of the strategic \n     triad for the indefinite future and is committed to the \n     modernization of the heavy bomber force.\n\n  To be clear, our existing nuclear bombers will be in operation at \nleast for the next 20 years, and probably at most this treaty could be \na 10- to 15-year treaty. Our existing bombers will outlive this treaty.\n  The administration has also made clear that we are committed to the \ntriad in the resolution of ratification, including our nuclear bombers. \nI might add that they have also said they are not going to close bases, \nand they are not going to reduce the total number of bombers.\n  I believe there should not be concern on these points.\n  This amendment, once again, is one of those that would force \nrenegotiation of the entire treaty. I might mention for my colleagues \nthat one of the reasons that is so important to all of us--we can all \nremember negotiating around here many times on different bills and \npieces of legislation. We always begin that negotiation--I can remember \nSenator George Mitchell, when he was majority leader and we did the \ncomplicated Clean Air Act reauthorization in 1990, he would begin every \nsession by reminding people that nothing is agreed upon until \neverything is agreed upon. We negotiate that way here all the time.\n  So if all of a sudden nothing is agreed upon and that is the way this \ntreaty was negotiated--if nothing is agreed upon until everything is \nagreed upon, when you take one piece out of there and change it \nunilaterally, nothing is agreed upon. At that point, you reopen all of \nthe other issues, and some of them are contentious, which are \ndifficult, which people may have a different view on, and which will \naffect our relationship.\n  If this weren't so substantive and I thought we were buying a pig in \na poke, I would say I understand why we have to do that.\n  But the military, our national security people, our national \nintelligence community--there is not anybody who works at this day to \nday--our Strategic Command, our National Defense Missile Command--all \nof them say: Ratify this treaty. And that is what I believe we ought to \ndo as soon as possible.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wonder if I might engage in a colloquy \nbriefly with my colleague from Massachusetts and then propound a \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, there are two votes scheduled on the Thune \namendment and the Inhofe amendment. Have we locked in the LeMieux \namendment yet?\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not believe so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, does my colleague anticipate that it is \npossible there would be a third vote tonight, depending upon whether \nSenator LeMieux is ready to have that vote?\n  Mr. KERRY. I suspect the majority leader would be delighted to have \nanother vote if we can. I am speaking without authorization.\n  Mr. KYL. At some point, just for the benefit of Members, there could \ntheoretically be a third amendment tonight if Senator LeMieux is ready \nto have that vote and if there is no objection by any other Member.\n  The other point, I inform my colleague, is I have the exact numbers \nof the five amendments I would like to get pending. Let me make that \nrequest at this time. They are amendments Nos. 4900, McCain amendment; \n4893, Kyl amendment; 4892, Kyl amendment; 4867, Kyl amendment; and No. \n4860, Kyl amendment. These are all proposed amendments to the \nresolution of ratification.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up five \namendments to the resolution of ratification; provided further that \nthese be the only amendments in order to the resolution of ratification \nat this time; and I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the amendments solicited, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the treaty.\n  Before my colleague responds, I will also say this: I believe there \nare only four other amendments pending, and one of them is mine. I will \nagree to waive my right to bring that up. I cannot say for the others, \nand I need to talk with those Members during the vote. I do not know \nwhether they would want votes on their amendments. In any event, there \nare no more than three of them. So it is a locked-in number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nmake clear that as we move to these amendments with respect to the \nresolution of ratification, we are going to preserve the right, then, \nto go back only to those three that are pending. And the Senator has \nagreed to make a good-faith effort to see if that could be reduced to \nsimply one; is that accurate?\n  Mr. KYL. No. I am saying one is mine, and I would eliminate it now.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand that the Senator, in our conversation \nearlier, was going to try to see if the other two could also make the \nsame decision he has made so we, in effect, have one on the treaty \nitself.\n  Mr. KYL. If that was the impression, I do not think I can do that. \nBut in any event, I did not try to do that. There are four all told. I \nwould eliminate my one, and there would be a fixed number--only three \npossibilities after that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Could we then say for the record which amendment is being \nwithdrawn at this point?\n  Mr. KYL. It would be the only Kyl amendment remaining pending to the \ntreaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold. There is no Kyl \namendment pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, if I may say to my colleague, the \nmajority leader would like to work with us in this process. I think \nwhat we should do, if I may ask my colleague to do this, I would like \nto take a moment, if we can, to work through this with the majority \nleader. We can do it during the votes, and then at the end of the votes \nwe can hopefully propound something that has his engagement.\n  Mr. KYL. I can tell my colleague that the amendment I would be \nagreeing not to bring up is amendment No.\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\n4854. I misspoke when I said it is pending. It is filed to the treaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. That helps us a lot. That clarifies \nit. What I would like to do is work with the majority leader and the \nSenator from Arizona, and I am sure we can come together, and at the \nend of the vote we can propound an appropriate UC.\n  Mr. KYL. I am not willing to withdraw my request. What I am afraid \nof, quite frankly, is that we are not going to be able to get unanimous \nconsent before a cloture vote on the treaty and we are going to be iced \nout here.\n  I have propounded a unanimous consent request. I will be happy to \nread it again. If there is an objection, fine. I want to get agreement \non this, if at all possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Arizona could repeat his \nrequest, that would be helpful.\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to call up five amendments to the \nresolution of ratification; provided further that these be the only \namendments in order to the resolution of ratification at this time; and \nI ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \namendments solicited, the Senate then resume consideration of the \ntreaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I personally am supportive \nof our trying to do that. I have said to the Senator in good faith that \nwe need to have some amendments to the resolution of ratification. We \nare working on them. I am confident that we will be able to accommodate \nhis request, but I am in a position where I need to have the input of \nthe majority leader to do that. I will personally advocate we do it.\n  At this moment only, I must object to that request, but I look \nforward to trying to propound it after the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the explanation. That \nordinarily would be information given to the two leaders, and we did \nnot do that in this case. I do appreciate this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, it is my understanding that I have a \nminute in which to wrap up debate on this amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the time has been used.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to have a couple minutes to \nsummarize a couple points. I had 5 minutes which I think just got \nburned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I will make a couple quick points before \nwe vote on the delivery vehicle amendment, and the first one is this \nbecause it has been observed that this would impact Prompt Global \nStrike. The supporters of the treaty have said it will not impact \nPrompt Global Strike. The fact is that the 700 number of delivery \nvehicles--if, for example, we were to mount a conventional warhead on \nan ICBM to strike a target in some geographic area that is hard to hit \nand we need to get there in short order, the ICBM currently is the best \nway to do that. If we do that, it reduces the number of nuclear \ndelivery vehicles we have one for one. If we were to do that on 20 \nICBMs, we would mount conventional warheads on those, and it would \nreduce by 20 the number of nuclear delivery vehicles we would have. \nThat is a fact in the treaty.\n  The final point I will make about the number 700, because it has been \npointed out that military personnel in the country support that number, \nbut I also want to mention that it is important to recall that General \nChilton's support for New START levels was predicated on no Russian \ncheating. He testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nApril 22, 2010, that one of the assumptions made was an assumption that \nthe Russians in the postnegotiation time period would be compliant with \nthe treaty. We all know it has been pointed out many times on the floor \nhow Russia is a serial violator of arms control commitments. I think it \nis important, as we discuss the 700 number, that people bear in mind \nthat number was agreed upon by our military commanders assuming there \nwould be no cheating by the Russians.\n  There still is a conflict between the 720 called for in the nuclear \nforce structure plan and the 700 in the treaty. All I am simply saying \nis, let's make those two numbers consistent. Let's get the 700 number \nup to 720.\n  With that, I yield back my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to asking for the yeas \nand nays? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does Senator Inhofe want to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. THUNE. I also request the yeas and nays on the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 4 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on the LeMieux amendment.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, this amendment says simply one thing: \nthat within 1 year's time of the ratification of this treaty, the \nUnited States and Russia would sit down and negotiate a tactical \nnuclear weapons treaty. Why do I bring this forward? Because we know--\nand we heard a lot about it today in our closed session--that there is \na tremendous disparity between the number of tactical nuclear weapons \nour country has at 300 and the Russians have at 3,000--10 to 1. If this \ntreaty is ratified, the Russians will have 4,500 nuclear weapons. We \nwill have 1,800.\n  This is not a poison pill. You will hear that; it is not. It does not \nchange a material term of this agreement. It just says within a year's \ntime, we will sit down and enter into these negotiations. We need to \nput it into the treaty because that is the only way we can make sure it \nwill happen.\n  If we send this treaty with this amendment back to the Russian Duma \nand they don't approve it, what does that say? It says they know they \nhave a significant advantage over us. It is the right thing to do. It \nis something I think all of our colleagues should be able to agree to. \nIt is not a poison pill. Let's approve it. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I will be very brief.\n  I completely agree with the intention of the Senator. I think all of \nus agree we have to negotiate a tactical nuclear weapons treaty with \nRussia. Unfortunately, this, according to our NATO allies, according to \nour national security representatives, will actually prevent us from \ngetting to the place where we negotiate that because the first thing we \nhave to do to get the Russians to the table is pass the START treaty.\n  If we pass the New START treaty, we can engage in these discussions. \nIf we don't pass it, they have no confidence. We simply go back to \nground zero and begin negotiating all the pre-START items again before \nwe can ever get there. We cannot just pass this unilaterally and order \nthem to get there. We have to get them to enter into those \nnegotiations. The way to do that is to preserve the integrity of the \nSTART treaty and then get to those agreements. We have that in the \nresolution of ratification.\n  There is language that urges the President and embraces this notion \nof the Senator from Florida. I congratulate him for wanting to target \nit. It is important to target it, and we will do it in the resolution \nof ratification.\n  I yield back any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4847.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4904, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a condition and a additional element of the \n  understanding regarding the effectiveness and viability of the New \n            START Treaty and United States missile defenses)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Effectiveness and viability of new start treaty and \n     united states missile defenses.--Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate, and shall communicate to the Russian Federation, \n     that it shall be the policy of the United States that the \n     continued development and deployment of United States missile \n     defense systems, including qualitative and quantitative \n     improvements to such systems, including all phases of the \n     Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defenses in Europe \n     maintaining the option to use Ground-Based Interceptors, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation. Consequently, while the United States \n     cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the Russian \n     Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the Treaty, \n     the continued improvement and deployment of United States \n     missile defense systems do not constitute a basis for \n     questioning the effectiveness and viability of the Treaty, \n     and therefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying \n     the withdrawal of the Russian Federation from the Treaty.\n       At the end of subsection (b)(1)(C), strike ``United \n     States.'' and insert the following: ``United States; and\n       (D) the preamble of the New START Treaty does not impose a \n     legal obligation on the United States.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that we now \nreturn to the treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the treaty.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the New START \ntreaty. Before I begin, I would like to thank Senator Kerry and Senator \nLugar for their leadership on this important arms control agreement.\n  When I first began to consider this treaty, I considered the \nfundamental question of whether we are better off with it or without it \nsince the previous START treaty expired a year ago. By reducing the \nnumber of deployed nuclear weapons in a mutual and verifiable way, I \nbelieve that this treaty does enhance our security, but it is not \nwithout flaws.\n  Our choice is not, however, between some ideal treaty and the New \nSTART treaty. It is between this treaty and having no inspection regime \nin place at all since the previous START treaty expired in December of \n2009.\n  In evaluating this treaty, I scrutinized several issues including the \neffect on our Nation's security, the need to modernize our nuclear \ndeterrent, the effectiveness of verification and inspection regimes, \nand the impact on missile defense.\n  These and other issues were fully covered in classified briefings as \nwell as in the seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings that I \nattended that included testimony from Secretary of Defense Gates, \nSecretary of State Clinton, Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and General Chilton, the commander of our nuclear \nforces. We also heard testimony from the three current directors of our \nnational nuclear laboratories and a number of former government \nofficials and national security experts.\n  I met personally with Rose Gottemoeller, the top U.S. treaty \nnegotiator, and sought counsel from GEN Brent Scowcroft, who has served \nas an adviser to four Republican Presidents and was the National \nSecurity Adviser to President George H. W. Bush.\n  I also have met with a wide range of Mainers--foreign policy experts, \nreligious leaders, and former members of the military--who expressed \ntheir views on the treaty to me.\n  Clearly, the New START treaty enjoys broad bipartisan support. \nSecretaries of State for the past five Republican Presidents, including \nGEN Colin Powell, support its ratification, as does former Maine \nSenator and former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen.\n  No Member of this body should support a treaty simply because it has \nstrong bipartisan support. But neither should we withhold our support \nfor a treaty simply because it was negotiated and signed by a President \nfrom a different political party.\n  The fact is that the New START treaty is a modest arms control \nagreement. The treaty does not require the destruction of a single \nnuclear weapon. Under the New START framework, a 30-percent reduction \nin the number of deployed warheads in the arsenals of the United States \nand Russia will be required.\n  As such, the New START treaty places the United States and the \nRussian Federation on a path to achieve mutual and verifiable \nreductions over the next 7 years. Failure to ratify a treaty that makes \nmodest reductions in the deployment of nuclear weapons would represent \na giant step backwards in the commitment of the United States to arms \ncontrol. If we cannot reduce the deployed nuclear stockpiles of the two \ncountries that hold 9 of every 10 nuclear weapons in the world, how can \nwe expect other countries not to seek any nuclear weapons?\n  Yet the New START treaty has significance beyond its function as an \narms control agreement. New START is one component of our bilateral \nrelationship with the Russian Federation. In April 2009, I traveled to \nMoscow with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl \nLevin. At that time, I indicated that while I supported the President's \ncommitment to reset the U.S.-Russian relationship, it was ultimately up \nto the Russians to see if they wanted to have a stronger relationship.\n  Since then, Russia has expanded the use of northern supply routes for \nour military forces in Afghanistan and has cancelled the sale of \nadvanced surface to air missiles to Iran. These are positive steps.\n  During that same trip to Moscow, Chairman Levin and I sought to \nencourage Russian officials to cooperate on missile defense in Europe. \nAnd this issue of missile defense raises an important point about the \nU.S.-Russian relationship. Just because our relationship with the \nRussians is important does not mean that we must compromise on an issue \nvital to our national security. One of those issues is missile defense.\n  I was troubled when I read the unilateral statements made by Russian \nleaders who sought to make a binding tie between missile defense and \nthe New START agreement.\n  The Kerry-Lugar resolution of ratification eliminates any doubt that \nthe United States will continue to develop missile defense systems. The \nproposed resolution of ratification clarifies that the treaty places no \nlimitation on the\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\ndeployment of U.S. missile defense systems except for those contained \nin article 5. It further clarifies that the Russian unilateral \nstatement regarding missile defense ``does not impose a legal \nobligation on the United States.''\n  The resolution of ratification goes beyond expressing the position \nthat the United States will deploy an effective national missile \ndefense system. It declares that the United States is committed to \nimproving its strategic defensive capabilities, both quantitatively and \nqualitatively, during the lifetime of the treaty.\n  In addition to developing a robust missile defense capability, it is \nequally imperative that the United States maintain a modernized nuclear \nweapons program as we consider further reductions in nuclear arms.\n  In March, I traveled with my good friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \nto discuss nuclear modernization with our allies. I learned a great \ndeal from an in-depth briefing with French physicists about our need to \nmodernize our own nuclear arsenal.\n  As Secretary of Defense Gates has noted, ``The United States is the \nonly declared nuclear power that is neither modernizing its nuclear \narsenal nor has the capability to produce a new nuclear warhead.'' The \nPerry-Schlesinger Strategic Posture Commission noted that the nuclear \nweapons complex ``physical infrastructure is in serious need of \ntransformation.''\n  In response, the administration has made a commitment to invest $14 \nbillion in new funding over the next 10 years for the nuclear weapons \ncomplex. As a result, the safety, stability, and reliability of our \nnuclear deterrent can be improved. The new investments will double the \nsurveillance within the nuclear stockpile from fiscal year 2009 to \nfiscal year 2011. Finally, the Administration has proposed nearly $9 \nbillion for our plutonium and uranium facilities, and it has made a \ncommitment to request additional funding necessary for those facilities \nonce the designs are completed.\n  While the New START treaty contributes to reducing the threat of \nnuclear war and strengthens nuclear nonproliferation efforts, it is \ndisappointing to me that the treaty reflects an outdated view of one of \nthe primary threats to our national security. This treaty does not \naddress the significant disparity between the number of nonstrategic \nnuclear weapons in Russia's stockpile compared to our own.\n  The Perry-Schlesinger Strategic Posture Commission reported that \nRussia had an estimated 3,800 tactical nuclear weapons compared to \nfewer than 500 in our own stockpile. By maintaining a distinction \nbetween the threats of nuclear attack that warrant the ratification of \na treaty from those nuclear threats that do not simply based upon the \ndistance from which a nuclear weapon is launched or the method by which \nsuch a weapon is launched, we preserve a Cold War mentality regarding \nthe nuclear threats facing our country.\n  The large numerical disparity in the number of warheads each country \nmaintains is not the only reason they warrant a higher priority than \nthey were given by either country in this treaty.\n  As the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I believe that the characteristics of tactical \nnuclear weapons, particularly their vulnerability for theft and \npotential for nuclear terrorism, make reducing their numbers essential \nto our national security.\n  President Obama correctly described the greatest threat facing our \nNation in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review when he said that ``the \nthreat of global nuclear war has become remote, but the risk of nuclear \nattack has increased . . . today's most immediate and extreme danger is \nnuclear terrorism.''\n  Several arms control groups, including the Stimson Center, the Center \nfor Nonproliferation Studies, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, \nhave each stated that the danger of these weapons rests not only in the \ndestructive power of each weapon but also because they are vulnerable \nto theft by rogue nations and terrorist groups.\n  Earlier this month, I wrote to Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton \nabout my concerns regarding this issue and requested a commitment from \nthem to seek reductions in the number of Russian tactical nuclear \nweapons.\n  I would like to read a portion of their response for those of my \ncolleagues who share my concern regarding this disparity:\n\n       The Administration is committed to seeking improved \n     security of, and reductions in, Russian tactical nuclear \n     weapons. We agree with the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee's call, in the resolution of advice and consent to \n     ratification of the New START treaty, to pursue an agreement \n     with the Russians to address them. These negotiations offer \n     our best chance to constrain Russian tactical nuclear \n     weapons, but we believe Russia will be unlikely to begin such \n     negotiations if the New START treaty does not enter into \n     force.\n\n  The letter further states that:\n\n       With regard to future agreements, we strongly agree with \n     you that the characteristics of tactical nuclear weapons--\n     particularly their vulnerability to theft, misuse, or \n     acquisition by terrorists--make reducing their numbers and \n     enhancing their safety and security extremely important.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the Secretaries and their \nresponse be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  So where does that leave us? Does the New START treaty lead to mutual \nand verifiable reductions in nuclear arms? Does the New START treaty \nrenew our Nation's commitment to arms control? Given the commitments by \nthe administration, will it reinvigorate our nuclear nonproliferation \nefforts?\n  The answers to these questions were most succinctly addressed in a \nstatement by the leader who negotiated and signed the first START \ntreaty, former President George H.W. Bush. I will conclude by \nassociating myself with his comments on the issue, which I will read in \nfull: ``I urge the United States Senate to ratify the [New] START \ntreaty.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: I want to thank the Administration \n     for making its experts available to discuss the proposed New \n     START and its associated issues, including the importance of \n     modernizing the nuclear weapons complex in light of proposed \n     reductions in our deployed nuclear forces. I support the \n     recent commitment President Obama made to increase the \n     investments for nuclear modernization by $4.1 billion and to \n     fully fund the costs associated with new facilities as the \n     design for these facilities are completed. The Administration \n     has also answered many of my concerns about verification and \n     inspections. Although I believe the verification and \n     inspection requirements of the now expired START treaty were \n     preferable, the explanations regarding the new verification \n     methods have helped to assuage my concerns.\n       There is, however, a remaining issue that must be resolved \n     before I can conclude that the treaty warrants my support. \n     The New START treaty does not address the significant \n     disparity between the number of non-strategic nuclear weapons \n     in the stockpiles of the Russian Federation and the United \n     States. By maintaining a distinction between the threats of \n     nuclear attack that warrant the ratification of a treaty from \n     those nuclear threats that do not simply based upon the \n     distance from which a nuclear weapon is launched or the \n     method by which such a weapon is delivered, we preserve an \n     outdated model regarding the nuclear threats facing our \n     country. Any nuclear attack on our country or one of our \n     allies, not just those that are launched quickly from a great \n     distance, would be devastating.\n       The characteristics of tactical nuclear weapons, \n     particularly their vulnerability for theft and misuse for \n     nuclear terrorism, make reducing their numbers important now. \n     Several arms control groups, including the Stimson Center, \n     the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, and the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, have stated that the danger of tactical \n     nuclear weapons rests not only in the destructive power of \n     each weapon, but also because they are vulnerable to theft by \n     terrorist groups. President Obama's 2010 Nuclear Posture \n     Review echoes the concern of nuclear terrorism: ``The threat \n     of global nuclear war has become remote, but the risk of \n     nuclear attack has increased . . . today's most immediate and \n     extreme danger is nuclear terrorism. Al Qaeda and their \n     extremist allies are seeking nuclear weapons.''\n       Non-strategic delivery systems are also as capable as some \n     of the strategic delivery vehicles covered under New START of \n     delivering a swift nuclear attack. For example, the Russian \n     Federation is capable of deploying submarine-launched cruise \n     missiles armed with nuclear warheads. According to press \n     reports, a new type of Russian attack submarine capable of \n     launching nuclear-armed cruise missiles is expected to enter \n     service in late 2010. My understanding is that, unlike \n     submarine launched ballistic\n\n[[Page S10805]]\n\n     missiles, these nuclear-tipped cruise missiles would not be \n     counted under New START. In addition, I was troubled to learn \n     of reports in the New York Times that the Russian Federation \n     moved short-range tactical nuclear weapons closer to the \n     territory of our NATO allies and U.S. deployed forces in \n     Europe earlier this year, apparently in response to the \n     deployment of missile defense capabilities there.\n       Insufficiently addressing these weapons may make it more \n     difficult to achieve future nuclear arms control agreements. \n     According to the independent Perry-Schlesinger Strategic \n     Posture Commission report, the Russian Federation has about \n     3,800 tactical nuclear weapons and the United States has less \n     than 500 tactical nuclear weapons. If the New START treaty is \n     ratified, the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons by \n     both countries will be evenly balanced. Absent a significant \n     unilateral reduction in tactical nuclear warheads by the \n     Russian Federation, any effort to reduce the disparity in \n     these weapons may lead to unacceptable concessions regarding \n     U.S. capabilities that are not tied to the size of the \n     nuclear stockpiles maintained by each country, such as \n     concessions regarding missile defense or conventional prompt \n     global strike.\n       Including non-strategic weapons in strategic arms \n     negotiations is not unprecedented. On July 31, 1991, the day \n     START I was signed by President George H.W. Bush and Mikhail \n     Gorbachev, the U.S.S.R. publicly committed to providing the \n     United States with annual declarations regarding the \n     deployments of nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles for the \n     duration of START I. In addition, the Soviet Union committed \n     to deploying no more than a single warhead on each cruise \n     missile and to not exceed the deployment of more than 880 \n     nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles in any one year.\n       On July 27, 2010, Dr. Keith Payne, former Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for foreign policy and a member of the \n     Perry-Schlesinger Commission, testified before the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee that the reason he believed tactical \n     nuclear weapons were not included in the New START treaty was \n     because, ``the Russians did not want to engage in \n     negotiations on their tactical nuclear weapons.'' I think \n     they will be very wary about ever engaging in serious \n     negotiations on their tactical nuclear weapons. I also \n     understand, and would expect, that any reductions of non-\n     strategic nuclear weapons in Europe would rest, in part, upon \n     the position of our NATO allies.\n       Nonetheless, the concerns I have regarding non-strategic \n     weapons remain outstanding as I consider whether or not the \n     New START treaty warrants my support. As such, I request that \n     you provide, in writing, the Administration's plan to address \n     the disparity between the numbers of non-strategic warheads \n     of the Russian Federation compared to the United States, in \n     order that I may consider this information prior to a vote on \n     the ratification of the New START treaty.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your \n     service to our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Susan M. Collins,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter of December \n     3, 2010, regarding the New START Treaty. We believe \n     ratification of the Treaty is essential to preserving core \n     U.S. national security interests.The Treaty will establish \n     equal limits on U.S. and Russian deployed strategic warheads \n     and strategic delivery systems, and will provide the U.S. \n     with essential visibility into Russian strategic forces \n     through on-site inspections, data exchanges, and other \n     verification provisions.\n       As you note, the Strategic Posture Commission expressed \n     concern regarding Russian tactical nuclear weapons. At the \n     same time, the Commission recommended moving forward quickly \n     with a new treaty focused on strategic weapons. With the \n     expiration of the START Treaty in early December 2009, for \n     the past year the U.S. has had no inspectors with ``boots on \n     the ground'' to verify Russian strategic forces.\n       The Administration is committed to seeking improved \n     security of, and reductions in, Russian tactical (also known \n     as non-strategic) nuclear weapons. We agree with the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee's call, in the resolution of \n     advice and consent to ratification of the New START Treaty, \n     to pursue an agreement with the Russians to address them. \n     These negotiations offer our best chance to constrain Russian \n     tactical nuclear weapons, but we believe Russia will likely \n     be unwilling to begin such negotiations if the New START \n     Treaty does not enter into force. We will consult closely \n     with Congress and our Allies in planning and conducting any \n     follow-on negotiations.\n       At the NATO summit in Lisbon in November 2010, Allied \n     leaders expressed their strong support for ratifying the New \n     START Treaty now, and welcomed the principle of including \n     tactical nuclear weapons in future U.S.-Russian arms control \n     talks. The U.S. remains committed to retaining the capability \n     to forward-deploy tactical nuclear weapons in support of its \n     Alliance commitments. As such, we will replace our nuclear-\n     capable F-16s with the dual-capable F-35 Joint Strike \n     Fighter, and conduct a full scope Life Extension Program for \n     the B-61 nuclear bomb to ensure its functionality with the F-\n     35 and enhance warhead surety.\n       Your letter notes recent press reports alleging that Russia \n     has moved tactical nuclear warheads and missiles closer to \n     Europe. We note that a short-range ballistic missile unit has \n     long been deployed near Russia's border with Estonia, and \n     earlier this year the Russians publicly announced that some \n     SS-26 short-range ballistic missiles would be located there. \n     Although this deployment does not alter either the balance in \n     Europe or the U.S.-Russia strategic balance, the U.S. has \n     made clear that we believe Russia should further consolidate \n     its tactical nuclear weapons in a small number of secure \n     facilities deep within Russia.\n       With regard to future agreements, we strongly agree with \n     you that the characteristics of tactical nuclear weapons--\n     particularly their vulnerability to theft, misuse, or \n     acquisition by terrorists--make reducing their numbers and \n     enhancing their safety and security extremely important. That \n     is why when President Obama signed the New START Treaty in \n     April, he made clear that ``going forward, we hope to pursue \n     discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and \n     tactical weapons, including non-deployed weapons.''\n       Thank you for the opportunity to address the important \n     matters you have raised in connection with the new START \n     Treaty. We look forward to continuing to work with you on \n     this and other issues of mutual interest, and urge your \n     support of New START.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n     Robert M. Gates,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Predisaster Hazard \n     Mitigation Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has been \n     successful and cost-effective. Funding from the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program has successfully reduced loss of \n     life, personal injuries, damage to and destruction of \n     property, and disruption of communities from disasters.\n       (2) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has saved \n     Federal taxpayers from spending significant sums on disaster \n     recovery and relief that would have been otherwise incurred \n     had communities not successfully applied mitigation \n     techniques.\n       (3) A 2007 Congressional Budget Office report found that \n     the predisaster hazard mitigation program reduced losses by \n     roughly $3 (measured in 2007 dollars) for each dollar \n     invested in mitigation efforts funded under the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program. Moreover, the Congressional Budget \n     Office found that projects funded under the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program could lower the need for post-\n     disaster assistance from the Federal Government so that the \n     predisaster hazard mitigation investment by the Federal \n     Government would actually save taxpayer funds.\n       (4) A 2005 report by the Multihazard Mitigation Council \n     showed substantial benefits and cost savings from the hazard \n     mitigation programs of the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency generally. Looking at a range of hazard mitigation \n     programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \n     study found that, on average, $1 invested by the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency in hazard mitigation provided the \n     Nation with roughly $4 in benefits.

Mr. President, today, I rise to thank a longtime member \nof my staff who is retiring from the Senate. Mary Day began working in \nmy Cedar Rapids office in 1987 as a constituent services specialist, \nand in 1996 rose to become the regional director based in the same \noffice.\n  You would be hard pressed to find somebody in the region who doesn't \nknow Mary. It is no wonder. She is a tireless worker for the 14-county \narea in eastern Iowa, and her infectious sense of humor, genuine \ndemeanor, and kindness was sought by those she came across in her daily \ntravels around the region.\n  There isn't anybody who knows the pulse of the community like Mary. \nShe has been through the good, the bad, and the ugly. She has seen \nhistoric floods and business downturns. Through it all, Mary has \nremained a good-hearted, conscientious and effective staff member.\n  We spent many hours over the years traveling from county to county in \nher region. Mary wasn't always the most spirited or active person in \nthe early hours of the day, but she was forever reliable and dependable \nno matter what hour of the day.\n  Not only has Mary been dedicated to the people of Iowa, but she also \nserved as a mentor, confidant, and friend to others on my staff. Her \ncolleagues say that Mary was their ``go-to'' person. She knew the \nbureaucracy inside and out and had sound advice on how to handle just \nabout any situation.\n  The people of Iowa have been fortunate to have somebody like Mary Day \nworking on their behalf for the last 23 years. I have been privileged \nto have her represent me in such a well-respected and honest manner.\n  Thank you, Mary, for everything you have done for me and the people \nof Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10807-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10807-S10808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WYTHE WILLEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nand a trusted adviser, Wythe Willey, who lost a 2-year battle with \ncancer on Saturday. Wythe Willey was a person who left a mark. If you \never met him, you would be hard pressed to forget him. He was an Iowa \nfarm boy through and through. Whether he was living in Des Moines or \nCedar Rapids, he valued his friendships and he valued everybody he met \nalong his life's journey.\n  Wythe had a passion for agriculture, and particularly for the cattle \nbusiness, but also for politics. He had one of the most astute \npolitical minds I have ever come across. To sit and talk politics with \nWythe was an invigorating endeavor. His political sense and \nunderstanding of the issues at the State and Federal level never failed \nto bring additional insight to anybody who would listen.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S10807, December 21, 2010, the Record reads: . . . Wyth \nWilley . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Wythe Willey \n. . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  There is a saying among my former and current staff, ``once a \nGrassley staffer, always a Grassley staffer.'' Wythe was the epitome of \nthat motto. He worked on my Iowa staff from 1981-1987. When he left, he \nhad already left his mark, but he was far from being done helping the \npeople of Iowa. During the time on my staff, and the years since then, \nWythe helped me by heading a committee to vet Federal judicial, U.S. \nattorney, and U.S. marshal nominees.\n  Even when he was involved in government and politics, Wythe's heart \nwas always with his family farm. No matter where his professional \ncareer\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\ntook him, he continued to run the century-old farm near Maquoketa. \nCattlemen across Iowa and the country knew few supporters who fought \nfor their interests more than Wythe. As president of both the Iowa \nCattlemen's Association and the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation he was, in that position, tireless in his advocacy to give \nIowa beef producers an opportunity to benefit from the market.\n\n  I have a lot of good memories of Wythe, including how he stole the \ntax counsel from my Washington office and ended up marrying her. They \ndid not think I knew much about it, but I remember when Susan started \nspending more and more time in Iowa. Wythe and Susan were one of the \nfirst of several Grassley office romances and set a precedent for years \nto come.\n  One last memory I will never forget is when I learned he was \nsupporting my candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 1980. At that time, \nWythe worked for the Governor who had backed my opponent in the \nprimary. I can never thank him enough for his trust in me, especially \nwhen it was not an easy thing to do because of his closeness to the \nGovernor at that time.\n  Wythe remained a loyal friend and trusted adviser up to his death, \nand for that I am forever thankful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10808-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10808-S10810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES OF RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Robert Bennett, who will be retiring from \nthe Senate at the end of the 111th Congress.\n  I have worked with Bob since coming over to the Senate in 1998. I \nhave also had the privilege of serving on the Senate Energy and Banking \nCommittees with Bob. In fact, we sat next to each other for years in \nthe Banking Committee.\n  He is a man of integrity and devotion. As a young man, he worked as a \nstaffer on Capitol Hill and moved on to become a successful \nentrepreneur in Washington, DC. In 1992, he followed in his father's \nfootsteps and was elected to the U.S. Senate. Over the course of his \nthree consecutive terms in the Senate, Bob has fought hard for our \nshared conservative values of fiscal discipline, securing our borders, \nand energy independence.\n  Bob has served the people of Utah proudly as their Senator. His \nleadership on the Banking Committee and in the Senate will be missed.\n  I am honored to know him and to have worked with him. I would like to \nthank Bob for his contributions to the Senate and to the country we \nboth love. I wish him and his family the best in all of their future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to join my fellow Senators to honor a colleague \nand a friend, Senator Christopher Samuel ``Kit'' Bond, who, like me, \nwill be retiring from the Senate at the close of this Congress.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Bond on a variety of \nissues in the Senate for over a decade. He is an advocate of our \nNation's military, infrastructure and energy needs, and intelligence \ncommunity. The two of us have stood together on numerous issues--most \nnotably advancing coal technology and maintaining a strong national \ndefense.\n  Representing Missouri, home to major military bases and \ninstallations, Senator Bond has been instrumental to ensure that all \ncitizens who are a part of our armed services--including \nservicemembers, family members, and survivors of veterans--are provided \nthe world-class care and benefits they have earned. Additionally, \nwhether the items of the day were funding for our Armed Forces and \nintelligence communities or improving U.S. relations among the \ninternational community, Senator Bond brought a voice of wisdom and \nreason to the Senate and governing bodies worldwide.\n  The Senate will not be the same without Senator Kit Bond. In a time \nwhen America has needed leadership in the Senate to address threats \nfrom conventional and unconventional means, Senator Kit Bond has \ncontinued to rise to the occasion by giving those who defend us the \ncritical tools needed to prepare and protect our nation. I will miss my \nfriend Kit Bond.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend from Kansas, Senator \nSam Brownback.\n  Born in Parker, KS, Sam has dedicated his time to serving the great \npeople of Kansas. Beginning his service as the secretary of agriculture \nin Kansas, Sam has represented Kansas with dignity and honor.\n  Following his election in 1994, I have had the opportunity to work \nwith Senator Brownback in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. While in the Senate, Sam and I worked tirelessly on the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources to utilize the energy \nresources we have in this great country.\n  Sam has created a long list of accomplishments on a wide range of \nissues for the people of Kansas and this Nation. I know his family and \nthe people of Kansas are proud to call him one of their own. His \nleadership in the Senate will be missed, but our loss is a gain for the \nState of Kansas as Sam prepares for his new role as Governor. It has \ntruly been an honor serving with him during these many years.\n  I would like to thank Sam for his contributions to the Senate and \nwish him and his family well as they embark on this new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor my colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator  Gregg, who is retiring from the U.S. Senate after serving 18 \nyears in this Chamber and serving 8 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Born and bred in New Hampshire, Judd has dedicated his life to public \nservice. Judd served on the Executive Council of New Hampshire in 1978 \nbefore running for national office. In 1980, he was elected to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and was elected to three additional terms \nbefore returning to New Hampshire. In 1988, Judd became the Governor of \nNew Hampshire, a seat formerly held by his father Hugh. During his two \nterms as Governor, Judd managed to balance the State's budget and left \nConcord with a surplus. Following his tenure as Governor, Judd returned \nto Washington in 1993 and has represented New Hampshire in the Senate \never since.\n  While working in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to serve with \nJudd on the Banking Committee and the Budget Committee, where he \ncurrently serves as the ranking member. I have respect for the manner \nin which Judd has conducted himself in the role of ranking member and \nthe Republican leader on the Budget Committee. I also admire the fact \nthat he always keeps our national deficit in mind when making touch \ndecisions, whether or not these decisions are going to be popular.\n  Judd has a long list of accomplishments to show for the people of New \nHampshire and the United States. His leadership in the Senate will be \nmissed, and it has truly been an honor serving with him.\n  I would like to thank Judd for his contributions to the Senate and \nwish him well as he closes a chapter in his life and begins another.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, \nSenator George Voinovich. Over the past 12 years I have had the \nopportunity to work with Senator Voinovich on many issues that impact \nour adjoining States and this Nation. While working with Senator \nVoinovich, I gained respect for his firm commitment to his principles.\n  Prior to our time together in the Senate, I only knew of Senator \nVoinovich through his reputation as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of \nOhio. In these positions, he cut spending, fought corruption, and \ncreated jobs. These experiences taught Senator Voinovich how to make \ntough decisions, and he never lost that quality here in the Senate.\n  Senator Voinovich also never forgot his roots. As a child of \nYugoslavian parents, the Senator never lost interest in the Balkans, \nand through his work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he made \nsure that this region was not forgotten by the U.S. Government. I also \nworked closely with him on Department of Energy issues because Ohio and \nKentucky have neighboring DOE uranium sites.\n  Although Senator Voinovich accomplished many things in his life, his \ngreatest achievement has been as a father and husband. George and his \nwife\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nJanet have been married for over 47 years. I wish him nothing but the \nbest as he embarks on a new chapter in his life.\n\n\n                             George LeMieux\n\n  Mr. President, today I would like to honor my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator George LeMieux, who will be retiring from the \nSenate at the end of the 111th Congress.\n  George has humbly served the people of Florida for many years as \ndeputy attorney general, chief of staff to the Governor, and most \nrecently as a Member of the U.S. Senate. While his time in the Senate \nmight have been short, his list of accomplishments is not. George has \nproven to be a principled leader that is unafraid to tackle the \ndifficult issues facing our Nation. He has offered thoughtful and \nproactive solutions to problems that many would rather defer to a \nfuture Congress and a future generation. The people of Florida should \nbe proud to have been represented by a man of such dedication and \ncharacter.\n  I am honored to know George and to have worked with him. I would like \nto thank him for his contributions to the Senate and wish him and his \nfamily the best in all of their future endeavors.\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer some remarks on the \ndeparture of my friend, the junior Senator from Indiana. Senator Evan \nBayh has served the good people of his State for two full terms and \nwill be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. He will most \ncertainly be missed.\n  Senator Bayh was born in Shirkieville, IN, in 1955. He is, of course, \nthe son of the distinguished Senator Birch Bayh, who served in this \nChamber for 18 years. Evan attended college at Indiana University, \nwhere he graduated with honors. He received his law degree from the \nUniversity of Virginia. After graduating from law school and serving a \nyear as a clerk to a Federal judge, Evan returned to Indiana to go into \nprivate law practice.\n  Senator Bayh's career in public service began in 1986, when he was \nelected to serve as Indiana's secretary of State. He held that position \nfor 2 years before he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1988.\n  As Governor, Senator Bayh earned a reputation as a fiscal \nconservative and a voice of moderation. He was able to work with \nmembers of both parties to achieve the best results for the people of \nIndiana. During his tenure, taxes in Indiana remained low, while the \nState enjoyed multiple budget surpluses. He also had great successes in \nareas such as education, crime, and job creation. Indeed, he was a very \neffective Governor throughout his two terms in office.\n  Two years after completing his second term, Evan was elected to serve \nin the same Senate seat held by his father. And, he brought with him \nthe reputation and skills that had made him such a successful Governor.\n  As Indiana's Senator, Senator Bayh has demonstrated that one can be a \nproud member of their party and still find ways to work with the other \nside. No one can doubt that Evan is a Democrat. He comes from a family \nof Democrats and I think his credentials as a supporter of his party's \nagenda are beyond dispute. However, he has often been looked to as a \ndeal-maker here in the Senate. Senator Bayh has demonstrated sound \njudgment and strong leadership throughout his career in public service. \nThat, coupled with his willingness to reach across the aisle and find \ncommon ground, has made his one of the most respected voices in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Bayh announced his retirement. As he \nexplained his decision not to run for re-election, said the following:\n\n       For some time, I have had a growing conviction that \n     Congress is not operating as it should. There is too much \n     partisanship and not enough progress--too much narrow \n     ideology and not enough practical problem-solving. Even at a \n     time of enormous challenge, the peoples' business is not \n     being done.\n\n  In a lot of ways, I agree with Senator Bayh's assessment of Congress. \nToo often, the peoples' business gets set aside in favor of politics \nand partisan agendas. While I think we all hope that things will get \nbetter in the future, one thing is certain: we need more people like \nEvan Bayh in both parties.\n  I am certain that Senator Bayh will be successful in whatever \nendeavor he chooses. But, while I am sure he doesn't need it, I want to \nwish him and his family the very best of luck.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer some remarks on the departure of \nmy friend, the junior Senator from Wisconsin. Senator Russ Feingold, \nthe fierce and independent Democrat who has served the good people of \nhis State for 18 years, will be departing at the end of this session. \nHe will certainly be missed.\n  Senator Feingold was born in 1953 in Janesville, WI. He received his \nbachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and then went to \nUniversity of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. After returning to the \nU.S., he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School and then went \nback to Wisconsin to begin a career as a lawyer in private practice.\n  While Russ was a long-time political activist, having volunteered and \nworked on a number of election campaigns, he began his career in public \nservice in 1982 when he was elected to serve the first of two terms in \nthe Wisconsin State Senate. Ten years later, he was elected to serve in \nthe U.S. Senate, and he has been here ever since.\n  I don't think it is any secret that Russ and I tend to disagree on \nmost issues. But, I have always admired his commitment to his \nprinciples and his devotion to his beliefs. Now, I may give Democrats a \nhard time every now and then with my criticism, particularly when I \nfind myself at odds with their agenda. But, I have never been able to \nfault Senator Feingold personally because I believe he is principled \npublic servant who is simply trying to do what he believes is best for \nthe country. He has been willing to do so even when it has been \nunpopular or when the majority of his own party was moving in a \ndifferent direction.\n  Russ has a reputation for being contrarian at times. To be honest, I \nthink he is probably proud of that fact. While he has certainly earned \nthat reputation, I have always believed his actions and his positions--\nincluding those I have strongly disagreed with--have been rooted in his \nsincerely held beliefs.\n  Throughout his time in the Senate, Senator Feingold has been a \nfierce, articulate, and effective advocate for his ideals. While he and \nI have rarely been in agreement, he has always had my respect and \nadmiration. I want to wish him the best of luck in any future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                            Christopher Dodd\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer some remarks on the departure of \nmy good friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut. After five terms \nand 30 years in the Senate, Senator Christopher Dodd will be leaving us \nat the end of this session. He will most certainly be missed.\n  Chris was born in Willimantic, CT, in 1944. He was the fifth of six \nchildren born to his parents, Grace Mary Dodd and another Connecticut \nSenator, Thomas J. Dodd. Senator Dodd graduated from Providence College \nand then spent 2 years in the Peace Corps. When he returned to the \nU.S., he enlisted in the Army National Guard and later served in the \nU.S. Army Reserves. After graduating from the University of Louisville \nSchool of Law in 1972, Chris practiced law in New London. However, just \n2 years later, he would answer the call to public service. Chris was \nelected to the House of Representatives in 1974 and has represented the \ngood people of Connecticut in Congress ever since. All told, Senator \nDodd spent three terms in the House before coming to the Senate in \n1980.\n  Throughout his time in the Senate, Chris has been an unwavering \npresence. He's chaired the Rules Committee and the Banking Committee. \nHe has been among the most prominent members of the HELP and Foreign \nRelations Committees. Over the years, our paths have crossed numerous \ntimes. Of course, most of the time, we have been on opposing sides. \nBut, there have been a few times--some significant times--where we have \nbeen able to put our differences aside and work together.\n  Most recently, I worked with Senator Dodd on passing the Edward M. \nKennedy Serve America. Chris talks often of his service of the Peace \nCorps and the lessons he learned during that time. As a Senator, has \nbeen a tireless\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\nadvocate for the Peace Corps program and for volunteerism in general. \nIn that regard, he and I have much in common. As a young man, I served \na full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints. I too learned much about the benefits of selfless, volunteer \nservice while serving as a missionary and those 2 years were \ninstrumental in my understanding of the world and instilled me with a \ndesire to serve and help others. The Serve America Act was meant to \nembody these ideals and provide similar opportunities for others. It \ncould have very easily been a purely Democratic endeavor. But, in the \nend, we were able to work together in drafting and passing this \nlegislation. With Chris's help, the Serve America Act became one of \nvery few bills passed during this Congress with a broad, bipartisan \nmajority here in the Senate. It was, in my opinion, a piece of \nlegislation that represents the best of what both parties have to \noffer. Fittingly, we named the bill after Chris and my mutual friend, \nthe late Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  I want to wish Senator Dodd and his wife Jackie the very best of luck \ngoing forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10810-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to recognize today's \nachievement of the passage of the landmark bipartisan Food Safety \nModernization Act out of the Senate.\n  The first responsibility of government is to protect its citizens. \nEnsuring a rapid response to outbreaks of contaminated food is critical \nto maintaining public trust in our food supply. This bill will make \nnecessary changes to help keep consumers safe, and I look forward to \npassage in the House and the bill being signed into law.\n  This food safety legislation is going to be a tremendous benefit to \nour Nation, and to protecting our citizens from foodborne illnesses, as \nwell as potential acts of terrorism aimed at our food supply. I urge \nthe Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to work very closely with the \nbusiness community in the rulemaking process to be sure that we are not \nadding additional regulations that may already be covered and regulated \nunder other areas, such as the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act and the \nBioterrorism Act.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts to make this \nlegislation strong, and to protect the American people while balancing \nthe legitimate concerns that businesses have that do not over reach or \nover legislate in this bill. The rulemaking process must not be \nduplicative or attempt to regulate areas that already protect public \nsafety in other areas of law, statute and regulation. It is my hope \nthat the FDA will be practical in applying this legislation to \nmanufacturers of ingredients such as food processing aids, and will \ndirect their resources where the real food safety dangers occur and are \noccurring. The use of indirect food additives and processing aids have \nnot been determined to be the source of food borne illness outbreaks \nand I believe it is important that the FDA continue to focus its scarce \nresources on the key elements that this legislation hopes to address in \nthe Food Safety area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10810-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELDERLY HOUSING\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the passage of S. \n118, the section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act. Earlier \nthis Congress, Senator Schumer and I introduced S. 118 to modernize and \nimprove section 202 housing for seniors across the country. This piece \nof legislation will help ensure that seniors have accessible, safe and \naffordable housing so they can live independently and with dignity, \nwhile also saving the government money by keeping people out of \nexpensive nursing homes.\n  HUD's senior housing program, also known as the section 202 program, \nprovides capital grants to enable the development of supportive housing \nexclusively for the very low-income elderly population. Unfortunately, \nthe 202 program has been unable to address the growing demand. For \nevery available unit, there are ten seniors waiting to move in. Under \nthe current law, the development and preservation of existing 202 \ncommunities can be time-consuming, bureaucratic and often require \nduplicative waivers and special permission from HUD to complete.\n  Additionally, the program provides rental subsidies and grants to \nfund supportive services for seniors, such as in-home care and \ntransportation. Over one-third of the section 202 population is \nconsidered disabled enough to be at risk for being put in a nursing \nhome. By reducing the need for costly nursing home stays, access to \nthese types of services saves both seniors and the government money.\n  Modernizing the elderly housing program will promote the preservation \nand renovation of existing 202 developments. Many properties are in \nneed of both rehabilitation and increased access to services that help \nseniors to remain in their homes. This legislation will help provide \nthe modernization they desperately need.\n  I want to thank the American Association of Homes and Services for \nthe Aging as well as the Wisconsin Association of Homes and Services \nfor the Aging for being champions of this legislation and for working \nwith us to develop a comprehensive bill that will help meet the growing \nneed for senior housing in this Nation.\n  I also want to thank Senator Dodd and his staff for all of his \nefforts to move this legislation. He has always been great to work with \nand he will be greatly missed next year. And I want to extend my \nappreciation to Senator Shelby and his staff for working with us on \nthis bill.\n  Senior citizens deserve to have housing that will help them maintain \ntheir independence. It is my hope that with the passage of S. 118, many \nmore Americans have a place to call home during their golden years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10810-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10810-S10813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JANE GOODALL\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in July I introduced S. Res. \n581, a resolution honoring the educational and scientific significance \nof Dr. Jane Goodall on the 50th anniversary of the beginning of her \nwork in what is today Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. I would \nlike to urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which also has a \ncompanion bill that was passed with unanimous support in the House of \nRepresentatives on July 28 of this year; and I would like to have \nprinted in the Record the article printed in the October 2010 edition \nof National Geographic. The article, entitled ``Fifty Years at Gombe,'' \ndescribes Dr. Goodall's lifetime of dedication and contribution to our \nunderstanding of chimpanzees and the natural world, as well as her \nunique and heroic personality. As described in the article, Dr. Goodall \n``made three observations that rattled the comfortable wisdoms of \nphysical anthropology: meat eating by chimps--that had been presumed \nvegetarian--tool use by chimps--in the form of plant stems probed into \ntermite mounds--and toolmaking--stripping leaves from stems--supposedly \na unique trait of human premeditation. Each of those discoveries \nfurther narrowed the perceived gap of intelligence and culture between \nHomo sapiens and Pan troglodytes.''\n  As a leading researcher, conservationist, and humanitarian, Dr. \nGoodall has made remarkable contributions to our understanding of the \nspecies with whom we live. She has led by example in efforts to ensure \nthat these species continue to thrive and to ensure that surrounding \ncommunities are also able to thrive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From National Geographic Magazine, Oct. 2010]\n\n                          Fifty Years at Gombe\n\n                           (By David Quammen)\n\n       In 1960 a spirited animal lover with no scientific training \n     set up camp in Tanganyika's Gombe Stream Game Reserve to \n     observe chimpanzees. Today Jane Goodall's name is synonymous \n     with the protection of a beloved species. At Gombe--one of \n     the longest, most detailed studies of any wild animal--\n     revelations about chimps keep coming.\n       Most of us don't enter upon our life's destiny at any \n     neatly discernible time. Jane Goodall did.\n       On the morning of July 14, 1960, she stepped onto a pebble \n     beach along a remote stretch of the east shore of Lake \n     Tanganyika. It was her first arrival at what was then called \n     the Gombe Stream Game Reserve, a small protected area that \n     had been\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\n     established by the British colonial government back in 1943. \n     She had brought a tent, a few tin plates, a cup without a \n     handle, a shoddy pair of binoculars, an African cook named \n     Dominic, and--as a companion, at the insistence of people who \n     feared for her safety in the wilds of pre-independence \n     Tanganyika--her mother. She had come to study chimpanzees. Or \n     anyway, to try. Casual observers expected her to fail. One \n     person, the paleontologist Louis Leakey, who had recruited \n     her to the task up in Nairobi, believed she might succeed.\n       A group of local men, camped near their fishing nets along \n     the beach, greeted the Goodall party and helped bring up the \n     gear. Jane and her mother spent the afternoon putting their \n     camp in order. Then, around 5 p.m., somebody reported having \n     seen a chimpanzee. ``So off we went,'' Jane wrote later that \n     night in her journal, ``and there was the chimp.'' She had \n     gotten only a distant, indistinct glimpse. ``It moved away as \n     we drew level with the crowd of fishermen gazing at it, and, \n     though we climbed the neighbouring slope, we didn't see it \n     again.'' But she had noticed, and recorded, some bent \n     branches flattened together in a nearby tree: a chimp nest. \n     That datum, that first nest, was the starting point of what \n     has become one of the most significant ongoing sagas in \n     modern field biology: the continuous, minutely detailed, 50-\n     year study, by Jane Goodall and others, of the behavior of \n     the chimps of Gombe.\n       Science history, with the charm of a fairy-tale legend, \n     records some of the high points and iconic details of that \n     saga. Young Miss Goodall had no scientific credentials when \n     she began, not even an undergraduate degree. She was a \n     bright, motivated secretarial school graduate from England \n     who had always loved animals and dreamed of studying them in \n     Africa. She came from a family of strong women, little money, \n     and absent men. During the early weeks at Gombe she \n     struggled, groping for a methodology, losing time to a fever \n     that was probably malaria, hiking many miles in the forested \n     mountains, and glimpsing few chimpanzees, until an elderly \n     male with grizzled chin whiskers extended to her a tentative, \n     startling gesture of trust. She named the old chimp David \n     Greybeard. Thanks partly to him, she made three observations \n     that rattled the comfortable wisdoms of physical \n     anthropology: meat eating by chimps (who had been presumed \n     vegetarian), tool use by chimps (in the form of plant stems \n     probed into termite mounds), and toolmaking (stripping leaves \n     from stems), supposedly a unique trait of human \n     premeditation. Each of those discoveries further narrowed the \n     perceived gap of intelligence and culture between Homo \n     sapiens and Pan troglodytes.\n       The toolmaking observation was the most epochal of the \n     three, causing a furor within anthropological circles because \n     ``man the toolmaker'' held sway as an almost canonical \n     definition of our species. Louis Leakey, thrilled by Jane's \n     news, wrote to her: ``Now we must redefine `tool,' redefine \n     `man,' or accept chimpanzees as humans.'' It was a memorable \n     line, marking a very important new stage in thinking about \n     human essence. Another interesting point to remember is that, \n     paradigm shifting or not, all three of those most celebrated \n     discoveries were made by Jane (everyone calls her Jane; there \n     is no sensible way not to call her Jane) within her first \n     four months in the field. She got off to a fast start. But \n     the real measure of her work at Gombe can't be taken with \n     such a short ruler.\n       The great thing about Gombe is not that Jane Goodall \n     ``redefined'' humankind but that she set a new standard, a \n     very high standard, for behavioral study of apes in the wild, \n     focusing on individual characteristics as well as collective \n     patterns. She created a research program, a set of protocols \n     and ethics, an intellectual momentum--she created, in fact, a \n     relationship between the scientific world and one community \n     of chimpanzees--that has grown far beyond what one woman \n     could do. The Gombe project has enlarged in many dimensions, \n     has endured crises, has evolved to serve purposes that \n     neither she nor Louis Leakey foresaw, and has come to embrace \n     methods (satellite mapping, endocrinology, molecular \n     genetics) and address questions that carry far beyond the \n     field of animal behavior. For instance, techniques of \n     molecular analysis, applied to fecal and urine samples that \n     can be gathered without need for capture and handling, reveal \n     new insights about genetic relationships among the chimps and \n     the presence of disease microbes in some of them. Still, a \n     poignant irony that lies near the heart of this scientific \n     triumph, on its golden anniversary, is that the more we learn \n     about the chimps of Gombe, the more we have cause to worry \n     for their continued survival.\n       Two revelations in particular have raised concern. One \n     involves geography, the other involves disease. The world's \n     most beloved and well-studied population of chimpanzees is \n     isolated on an island of habitat that's too small for long-\n     term viability. And now some of them seem to be dying from \n     their version of AIDS.\n       The issue of how to study chimpanzees, and of what can be \n     inferred from behavioral observations, has faced Jane Goodall \n     since early in her career. It began coming into focus after \n     her first field season, when Louis Leakey informed Jane of \n     his next bright idea for shaping her life: He would get \n     her into a Ph.D. program in ethology at Cambridge \n     University.\n       This doctorate seemed a stretch on two counts. First, her \n     lack of any undergraduate degree whatsoever. Second, she had \n     always aspired to be a naturalist, or maybe a journalist, but \n     the word ``scientist'' hadn't figured in her dreaming. ``I \n     didn't even know what ethology was,'' she told me recently. \n     ``I had to wait quite a while before I realized it simply \n     meant studying behavior.'' Once enrolled at Cambridge, she \n     found herself crosswise with departmental elders and the \n     prevailing certitudes of the field. ``It was a bit shocking \n     to be told I'd done everything wrong. Everything.'' By then \n     she had 15 months of field data from Gombe, most of it \n     gathered through patient observation of individuals she knew \n     by monikers such as David Greybeard, Mike, Olly, and Fifi. \n     Such personification didn't play well at Cambridge; to impute \n     individuality and emotion to nonhuman animals was \n     anthropomorphism, not ethology. ``Fortunately, I thought back \n     to my first teacher, when I was a child, who taught me that \n     that wasn't true.'' Her first teacher had been her dog, \n     Rusty. ``You cannot share your life in a meaningful way with \n     any kind of animal with a reasonably well-developed brain and \n     not realize that animals have personalities.'' She pushed \n     back against the prevailing view--one thing about gentle \n     Jane, she always pushes back--and on February 9, 1966, she \n     became Dr. Jane Goodall.\n       In 1968 the little game reserve underwent its own \n     graduation, becoming Tanzania's Gombe National Park. By then \n     Jane was receiving research funding from the National \n     Geographic Society. She was married and a mother and famous \n     worldwide, owing in part to her articles for this magazine \n     and her comely, forceful presence in a televised film, Miss \n     Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees. She had institutionalized \n     her field camp, in order to fund and perpetuate it, as the \n     Gombe Stream Research Center (GSRC). In 1971 she published In \n     the Shadow of Man, her account of the early Gombe studies and \n     adventures, which became a best seller. Around the same time, \n     she began hosting students and graduate researchers to help \n     with chimp-data collection and other research at Gombe. Her \n     influence on modern primatology, noisily bruited about by \n     Leakey, is more quietly suggested by the long list of Gombe \n     alums who have gone on to do important scientific work, \n     including Richard Wrangham, Caroline Tutin, Craig Packer, Tim \n     Clutton-Brock, Geza Teleki, William McGrew, Anthony Collins, \n     Shadrack Kamenya, Jim Moore, and Anne Pusey. The last of \n     those, Pusey, now professor and chair of evolutionary \n     anthropology at Duke University, also serves the Jane Goodall \n     Institute (established in 1977) as director of its Center for \n     Primate Studies. Among other duties, she curates the 22 file \n     cabinets full of field data--the notebooks and journal pages \n     and check sheets, some in English, some in Swahili--from 50 \n     years of chimp study at Gombe.\n       That 50-year run suffered one traumatic interruption. On \n     the night of May 19, 1975, three young Americans and a Dutch \n     woman were kidnapped by rebel soldiers who had come across \n     Lake Tanganyika from Zaire. The four hostages were eventually \n     released, but it no longer seemed prudent for the Gombe \n     Stream Research Center to welcome expatriate researchers and \n     helpers--as Anthony Collins explained to me.\n       Collins was then a young British biologist with muttonchop \n     sideburns and a strong interest in baboons, the other most \n     conspicuous primate at Gombe. In addition to his baboon \n     research, he has continued to play important administrative \n     roles in the Jane Goodall Institute and at GSRC itself, off \n     and on, for almost 40 years. He recalls May 19, 1975, as \n     ``the day the world changed, as far as Gombe was concerned.'' \n     Collins was absent that night but returned promptly to help \n     cope with the aftermath. ``It was not entirely bad,'' he told \n     me. The bad part was that foreign researchers could no longer \n     work at Gombe; Jane herself couldn't work there, not without \n     a military escort, for some years. ``The good thing about it \n     was that the responsibility for data collection went \n     straightaway, the following day, to the Tanzanian field \n     staff.'' Those Tanzanians had each received at least a year's \n     training in data collection but still functioned partly as \n     trackers, helping locate the chimps, identifying plants, and \n     making sure the mzungu (white) researchers got back to camp \n     safely each night before dark. Then came the kidnapping, \n     whereupon the Tanzanians stepped up, and ``on that day the \n     baton was passed to them,'' Collins said. Only one day's \n     worth of data was missed. Today the chief of chimpanzee \n     researchers at Gombe is Gabo Paulo, supervising the field \n     observations and data gathering of Methodi Vyampi, Magombe \n     Yahaya, Amri Yahaya, and 20 other Tanzanians.\n       Human conflicts overflowing from neighboring countries \n     weren't the only sort of tribulation that affected Gombe. \n     Chimpanzee politics could also be violent. Beginning in 1974, \n     the Kasekela community (the main focus of Gombe research) \n     conducted a series of bloody raids against a smaller subgroup \n     called Kahama. That period of aggression, known in Gombe \n     annals as the Four Year War, led to the death of some \n     individuals, the annihilation of the Kahama subgroup, and the \n     annexation of its territory by Kasekela. Even within the \n     Kasekela community, struggles among males for the alpha \n     position are highly political and physical, while among \n     females there have been cases of one mother killing a rival \n     mother's infant. ``When I first started at Gombe,'' Jane has \n     written, ``I thought the chimps were nicer\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\n     than we are. But time has revealed that they are not. They \n     can be just as awful.''\n       Gombe was never Eden. Disease intruded too. In 1966 came an \n     outbreak of something virulent (probably polio, contracted \n     from humans nearby), and six chimps died or disappeared. Six \n     others were partially paralyzed. Two years later, David \n     Greybeard and four others vanished while a respiratory bug \n     (influenza? bacterial pneumonia?) swept through. Nine more \n     chimps died in early 1987 from pneumonia. These episodes, \n     reflecting the susceptibility of chimps to human-carried \n     pathogens, help explain why scientists at Gombe are acutely \n     concerned with the subject of infectious disease.\n       That concern has been heightened by landscape changes \n     outside the park boundaries. Over the decades people in the \n     surrounding villages have struggled to live ordinary lives--\n     cutting firewood from the steep hillsides, planting crops on \n     those slopes, burning the grassy and scrubby areas each dry \n     season for fertilizing ash, having babies, and trying to feed \n     them. By the early 1990s deforestation and erosion had made \n     Gombe National Park an ecological island, surrounded by human \n     impact on three sides and Lake Tanganyika on the fourth. \n     Within that island lived no more than about a hundred \n     chimpanzees. By all the standards of conservation biology, it \n     wasn't enough to constitute a viable population for the long \n     term--not enough to ensure against negative effects of \n     inbreeding, and not enough to stand steady against an \n     epidemic caused by the next nasty bug, which might be more \n     transmissible than polio, more lethal than flu. Something had \n     to be done, Jane realized, besides continued study of a \n     fondly regarded population of apes that might be doomed. \n     Furthermore, something had to be done for the people as \n     well as for the chimps.\n       In a nearby town she met a German-born agriculturist, \n     George Strunden, and with his help created TACARE (originally \n     the Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education \n     project), whose first effort, in 1995, established tree \n     nurseries in 24 villages. The goals were to reverse the \n     denudation of hillsides, to protect village watersheds, and \n     maybe eventually to reconnect Gombe with outlying patches of \n     forest (some of which also harbor chimpanzees) by helping the \n     villagers plant trees. For instance, there's a small \n     population of chimps in a patch of forest called Kwitanga, \n     about ten miles east of Gombe. To the southeast, about 50 \n     miles, an ecosystem known as Masito-Ugalla supports more than \n     500 chimps. If either area could be linked to Gombe by \n     reforested corridors, the chimps would benefit from increased \n     gene flow and population size. Then again, they might be hurt \n     by sharing diseases.\n       By any measure, it's a near-impossible challenge. \n     Proceeding carefully, patiently, Jane and her people have \n     achieved some encouraging gains in the form of community \n     cooperation, decreased burning, and natural forest \n     regeneration.\n       On the second morning of my Gombe visit, along a trail not \n     far above the house in which Jane has lived intermittently \n     since the early 1970s, I encountered a group of chimpanzees. \n     They were noodling their way cross slope on a relaxed search \n     for breakfast, moving mostly on the ground, but occasionally \n     up into a Vitex tree to eat the small purple-black berries, \n     and were seemingly indifferent to my presence and that of the \n     Tanzanian researchers. They included some individuals whose \n     names, or at least their family histories, were familiar. \n     Here was Gremlin (daughter of Melissa, a young female when \n     Jane first arrived), Gremlin's daughter Gaia (with a clinging \n     infant), Gaia's younger sister Golden, Pax (son of the \n     notoriously cannibalistic Passion), and Fudge (son of Fanni, \n     grandson of Fifi, great-grandson of Flo, the beloved, ugly-\n     nosed matriarch famous from Jane's early books). Here also \n     was Titan, a very large male, 15 years old, and still rising \n     toward his prime. The rules at Gombe National Park say that \n     you must not approach closely to a chimpanzee, but the tricky \n     thing on a given day is to keep the chimps from approaching \n     closely to you. When Titan came striding up the trail, burly \n     and confident, we all squeezed to the edge and let him \n     swagger past, within inches. A lifetime of familiarity with \n     innocuous human researchers, their notebooks, and their check \n     sheets, has left him blase.\n       Another reflection of casualness: Gremlin defecated on the \n     trail not far from where we stood, and then Golden too \n     relieved herself. Once they had ambled away, a researcher \n     named Samson Shadrack Pindu pulled on yellow latex gloves and \n     moved in. He crouched over Gremlin's dollop of fibrous olive \n     dung, using a small plastic scoop to transfer a bit into a \n     specimen tube, which he labeled with time, date, location, \n     and Gremlin's name. The tube contained a stabilizing liquid \n     called RNAlater, which preserves any RNA (from, for instance, \n     a retrovirus) for later genetic analysis. That tube and \n     others like it, representing one fecal sample every month \n     from as many chimps as possible, were destined for the \n     laboratory of Beatrice Hahn at the University of Alabama in \n     Birmingham, who for ten years has been studying simian \n     immunodeficiency virus at Gombe.\n       Simian immunodeficiency virus in chimpanzees, known \n     technically as SIVcpz, is the precursor and origin of HIV-1, \n     the virus that accounts for most cases of AIDS around the \n     world. (There is also an HIV-2.) Notwithstanding the name, \n     SIVcpz had never been found to cause immune system failure in \n     wild chimpanzees--until Hahn's expertise in molecular \n     genetics converged with the long-term observational data \n     available at Gombe. In fact, SIVcpz was thought to be \n     harmless in chimps, an assumption that raised questions about \n     how or why it has visited such a lethal pandemic upon humans. \n     Had a few, fateful mutations changed an innocuous chimp virus \n     into a human killer? That line of thought had to be modified \n     after publication of a 2009 paper in the journal Nature, with \n     Brandon F. Keele (then at Hahn's lab) as first author and \n     Beatrice Hahn and Jane Goodall among the co-authors. The \n     Keele paper reported that SIV-positive chimps at Gombe \n     suffered between ten times and 16 times more risk of death at \n     a given age than SIV-negative chimps. And three SIV-positive \n     carcasses have been found, their tissues (based on lab work \n     at the molecular level) showing signs of damage resembling \n     AIDS. The implications are stark. An AIDS-like illness seems \n     to be killing some of Gombe's chimps.\n       Of all the bonds, shared features, and similarities that \n     link our species with theirs, this revelation is perhaps the \n     most troubling. ``It's very scary, knowing the chimps seem to \n     be dying at a younger age,'' Jane told me. ``I mean, how long \n     has it been there? Where does it come from? How is it \n     affecting other populations?'' For the sake of chimpanzee \n     survival throughout Africa, those questions urgently need to \n     be studied.\n       But this gloomy discovery also carries huge potential \n     significance for AIDS research in humans. Anthony Collins \n     pointed out that although SIV has been found elsewhere in \n     chimp communities, ``none of them is a study population \n     habituated to human observers; and certainly none of them is \n     one which has genealogical information going right back in \n     time; and none is so tame that you can take samples from \n     every individual every month.'' After a moment, he added, \n     ``It's very sad that the virus is here, but a lot of \n     knowledge can come out of it. And understanding.''\n       The fancy new methods of molecular genetics bring more than \n     just dire revelations about disease. They also bring the \n     exciting, cheerful capacity to address certain long-standing \n     mysteries about chimpanzee social dynamics and evolution. For \n     instance: Who are the fathers at Gombe? Motherhood is \n     obvious, and the intimate relations between mothers and \n     infants have been well studied by Jane herself, Anne Pusey, \n     and others. But because female chimps tend to mate \n     promiscuously with many males, paternity has been far harder \n     to determine. And the question of paternal identity relates \n     to another question: How does male competition for status \n     within the hierarchy--all that blustering effort expended to \n     achieve and hold the rank of alpha--correlate with \n     reproductive success? A young scientist named Emily \n     Wroblewski, analyzing DNA from fecal samples gathered by the \n     field team, has reached an answer. She found that the higher \n     ranking males do succeed in fathering many chimps--but that \n     some low-ranking males make out pretty well too. The strategy \n     involves investing effort in a consortship--an exclusive \n     period of spending time as a pair, traveling together, and \n     mating--often with younger, less desirable females.\n       Jane herself had predicted this finding, from observational \n     data, two decades earlier. ``The male who successfully \n     initiates and maintains a consortship with a fertile \n     female,'' she wrote, ``probably has a better chance of \n     fathering her child than he would in the group situation, \n     even if he were alpha.''\n       Impelled by broader imperatives, Jane ended her career as a \n     field biologist in 1986, just after publication of her great \n     scientific book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe. Since then she has \n     lived as an advocate, a traveling lecturer, a woman driven by \n     a sense of public mission. What's the mission? Her first \n     cause, which arose from her years at Gombe, was improving the \n     grim treatment inflicted on chimpanzees held in many medical \n     research labs. Combining her toughness and moral outrage with \n     her personal charm and willingness to interact graciously, \n     she achieved some negotiated successes. She also founded \n     sanctuaries for chimps who could be freed from captivity, \n     including many orphaned by the bush-meat trade. That work led \n     to her concerns about human conduct toward other species. She \n     established a program called Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots, \n     encouraging young people around the world to become active in \n     projects that promote greater concern for animals, the \n     environment, and the human community. During this period she \n     became an explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic \n     Society. She now spends about 300 days a year on the road, \n     giving countless interviews and schoolroom talks, lecturing \n     in big venues, meeting with government officials, raising \n     money to turn the wheels of the Jane Goodall Institute. \n     Occasionally she sneaks away into a forest or onto a prairie, \n     sometimes with a few friends, to watch chimps or sandhill \n     cranes or black-footed ferrets and to restore her energy and \n     sanity.\n       Fifty years ago Louis Leakey sent her to study chimpanzees \n     because he thought their behavior might cast light on human \n     ancestors, his chosen subject. Jane ignored that part of the \n     mandate and studied chimps for their own sake, their own \n     interest, their own value. While doing that, she created \n     institutions and opportunities that have yielded richly in \n     the work of other scientists, as well as a luminous personal \n     example that has brought many young women and men into \n     science and conservation. It's important to\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\n     remember that the meaning of Gombe, after half a century, is \n     bigger than Jane Goodall's life and work. But make no \n     mistake: Her life and work have been very, very big.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10813-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   PENNSYLVANIA VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I congratulate the \nPennsylvania State University's women's volleyball team on their fourth \nconsecutive NCAA championship. With its December 18, 2010, sweep of the \nUniversity of California, the Nittany Lions became the only team in \ndivision I women's volleyball history to win four consecutive national \ntitles. Prior to this streak, no NCAA women's volleyball team had ever \nwon consecutive national championships.\n  The team was led by Head Coach Russ Rose. Coach Rose has coached the \nNittany Lions for the last 32 years. He coached Penn State to an NCAA \nchampionship in 1999, and together with the recent four consecutive \nchampionships, his five NCAA titles are more than any other coach in \ndivision I volleyball history. Coach Rose was aided by assistant \ncoaches Dennis Hohenshelt and Kaleena Davidson, as well as director of \nVolleyball Operations Adam Hughes.\n  The team members have also distinguished themselves individually. \nFreshman Deja McClendon was named by the American Volleyball Coaches \nAssociation as the national freshman of the year. Her performance \nduring the championship tournament led to her being named the Most \nOutstanding Player of the final four. Senior Blair Brown became the \nsixth straight Nittany Lion to be named the Big Ten Player of the Year. \nShe was also recently named as a finalist for the 2010-11 Honda Sports \nAward. The award is given to the top female collegiate athlete in the \nsport. Brown, along with fellow seniors Arielle Wilson and Alyssa \nD'Errico were members of each of the four national championship teams, \nand have won 24 consecutive tournaments together.\n  Members of the 2010 championship team include: Ariel Scott, Katie \nKabbes, Fatima Balza, Jessica Ullrich, Kristin Carpenter, Maddie \nMartin, Arielle Wilson, Erica Denney, Blair Brown, Darcy Dorton, Alyssa \nD'Errico, Megan Shifflett, Cathy Quilico, Maggie Harding, Katie Slay, \nDeja McClendon, Krosby Pabst, Mikinzie Moydell, and Ali Longo.\n  The hard work and dedication of these young women is exemplary. I \ncongratulate them, their coaches, and the students, faculty, staff and \nalumni of the Pennsylvania State University on a record-setting \nseason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10813-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10813-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/20/senate-section/article/S10813-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10813-S10814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-8561.

A bill to amend the Classified Information Procedures Act to \nimprove the protection of classified information and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Classified Information Procedures Act, \nCIPA, was enacted in 1980 with bipartisan support to address the \n``disclose or dismiss'' dilemma that arose in espionage prosecutions \nwhen a defendant would threaten the government with the disclosure of \nclassified information if the government did not drop the prosecution. \nPreviously, there were no congressionally mandated procedures that \nrequired district courts to make discovery and admissibility rulings \nregarding classified information in advance.\n  CIPA has worked reasonably well during the last 30 years, but some \nissues have arisen in a number of notable terrorism, espionage, and \nnarcotics cases that demonstrate that reforms and improvements could be \nmade to ensure that classified sources, methods, and information can be \nprotected and to ensure that a defendant's due process and fair trial \nrights are not violated. In 2009, when the Congress enacted the \nMilitary Commissions Act, MCA, the Congress drew heavily from the \nmanner in which the Federal courts interpreted CIPA when it updated the \nprocedures governing the use of classified information in military \ncommission prosecutions. At that time, however, the Congress did not \nupdate CIPA. Indeed, since its enactment in 1980, there have been no \nchanges to the key provisions of CIPA.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary's Terrorism and Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, I have chaired a number of hearings during which \nwitnesses have testified about the capacity of our civilian courts to \ntry alleged terrorists and spies. The first subcommittee hearing that I \nchaired was on July 28, 2009, and was entitled ``Prosecuting \nTerrorists: Civilian and Military Trials for GTMO and Beyond.'' The \nsecond Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing that I \nchaired was on May 12, 2010, and was entitled ``The Espionage Statutes: \nA Look Back and A Look Forward.'' The testimony I have heard in regard \nto terrorism, espionage, and our civilian courts has convinced me that \nwhile our courts have the capacity and the procedures in place to try \nalleged terrorists and spies, reforms and improvements could be made to \nCIPA to codify and clarify the decisions of the Federal courts.\n  As a result, today I am introducing the CIPA Reform and Improvement \nAct, CRIA, of 2010. CRIA contains reforms and improvements to ensure \nthat the statute maintains the proper balance between the protection of \nclassified sources, methods and information, and a defendant's \nconstitutional rights. Among other things, this legislation, which \nincludes the applicable changes that the Congress made when it enacted \nthe Military Commissions Act of 2009, will codify, clarify, and unify \nFederal case law interpreting CIPA; ensure that all classified \ninformation, not just documents, will be governed by CIPA; ensure that \nprosecutors and defense attorneys will be able to fully inform trial \ncourts about classified information issues; and will clarify that the \ncivil state secrets privilege does not apply in criminal cases. CRIA \nwill also ensure high-level DOJ approval before the government invokes \nits classified information privilege in criminal cases and will ensure \nthat the Federal courts will order the disclosure and use of classified \ninformation when the disclosure and use meets the applicable legal \nstandards. This legislation will also ensure timely appellate review of \nlower court CIPA decisions before the commencement of a trial, \nexplicitly permit trial courts to adopt alternative procedures for the \nadmission of classified information in accordance with a defendant's \nfair trial and due process rights, and make technical fixes to ensure \nconsistent use of terms throughout the statute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. LIEBERMAN (for Mr. Kerry (for himself and Ms. Collins)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1746, to amend the Robert T. \nStafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to reauthorize \nthe pre-disaster mitigation program of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Predisaster Hazard \n     Mitigation Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has been \n     successful and cost-effective. Funding from the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program has successfully reduced loss of\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\n     life, personal injuries, damage to and destruction of \n     property, and disruption of communities from disasters.\n       (2) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has saved \n     Federal taxpayers from spending significant sums on disaster \n     recovery and relief that would have been otherwise incurred \n     had communities not successfully applied mitigation \n     techniques.\n       (3) A 2007 Congressional Budget Office report found that \n     the predisaster hazard mitigation program reduced losses by \n     roughly $3 (measured in 2007 dollars) for each dollar \n     invested in mitigation efforts funded under the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program. Moreover, the Congressional Budget \n     Office found that projects funded under the predisaster \n     hazard mitigation program could lower the need for post-\n     disaster assistance from the Federal Government so that the \n     predisaster hazard mitigation investment by the Federal \n     Government would actually save taxpayer funds.\n       (4) A 2005 report by the Multihazard Mitigation Council \n     showed substantial benefits and cost savings from the hazard \n     mitigation programs of the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency generally. Looking at a range of hazard mitigation \n     programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \n     study found that, on average, $1 invested by the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency in hazard mitigation provided the \n     Nation with roughly $4 in benefits. Moreover, the report \n     projected that the mitigation grants awarded between 1993 and \n     2003 would save more than 220 lives and prevent nearly 4,700 \n     injuries over approximately 50 years.\n       (5) Given the substantial savings generated from the \n     predisaster hazard mitigation program in the years following \n     the provision of assistance under the program, increasing \n     funds appropriated for the program would be a wise \n     investment.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREDISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Allocation of Funds.--Section 203(f) of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5133(f)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(f) Allocation of Funds.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The President shall award financial \n     assistance under this section on a competitive basis and in \n     accordance with the criteria in subsection (g).\n       ``(2) Minimum and maximum amounts.--In providing financial \n     assistance under this section, the President shall ensure \n     that the amount of financial assistance made available to a \n     State (including amounts made available to local governments \n     of the State) for a fiscal year--\n       ``(A) is not less than the lesser of--\n       ``(i) $575,000; or\n       ``(ii) the amount that is equal to 1 percent of the total \n     funds appropriated to carry out this section for the fiscal \n     year; and\n       ``(B) does not exceed the amount that is equal to 15 \n     percent of the total funds appropriated to carry out this \n     section for the fiscal year.''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 203(m) of the \n     Robert T.
