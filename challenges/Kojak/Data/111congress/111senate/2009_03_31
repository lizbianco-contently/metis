The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me start this morning by commending \nChairman Kent Conrad for his leadership of our Budget Committee and \nespecially for the hundreds of hours he and his staff have dedicated to \ngetting this budget done and accommodating both the priorities and \nconcerns of so many of us in this body. Putting together a budget is \nnever an easy process, but I believe our chairman has achieved a good \nbalance that will set\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nus on a course to both reducing our deficit and investing in the areas \nthat we know will make us stronger in the future--energy, health care, \nand education.\n  I know that in addition to his work on this budget, this is a \nparticularly difficult time for the State of North Dakota and the \nfamilies and businesses there. I want to say to Chairman Kent Conrad, \nwho will be on the floor shortly, that all of our hearts go out to him \nand his State as they struggle with these horrific storms that are \ngoing through his area.\n  A budget is a statement of priorities. Ours is very clear: We put the \nmiddle class first, and we get our country back on track by investing \nin our future.\n  To be clear, we have inherited some very great challenges. We now \nface the worst economic crisis in generations. Since December 2007, we \nhave lost 4.4 million jobs, including 2.6 million of those in the past \n4 months. So before we consider where we are going, it is important to \ntalk a little bit about where we have been.\n  For weeks now, my friends on the other side of the aisle have been \nbemoaning deficits and debt with not a moment of consideration for \ntheir own record on those issues. Back in 2001, Republicans controlled \nthe full power of our Government. Under the leadership of President \nBush and Republicans in Congress, record surpluses created under \nPresident Clinton became record deficits. These Republican deficits \ngrew and grew and now today add up to trillions of dollars in new debt \nthat is going to be shouldered by future generations of Americans.\n  With this perspective, I hope our Republican friends will start \nacknowledging and owning up to the fact that we now have two choices. \nChoice 1 is to continue down the Republican deficit path, no \ninvestments in our future, a widening gap between the rich and the \nmiddle class, and more massive deficits. Choice 2 is represented in the \nbudget before us today: improve the economy by investing in energy, \neducation, and health reform so that we as a country are stronger in \nthe future; cut taxes for our middle class and address the deficit so \nthat our children do not bear the burden of bad decisions today.\n  After 8 years of the Bush administration's shortsighted budgets and \nmisplaced priorities, we are now working with President Obama to invest \nin our needs and to chart a new course for America. We are choosing a \nnew path.\n  The American people deserve an economic plan that works for everyone \nin this country. Our budget makes responsible choices that will help \nget this country's economy rolling again. I came to the floor today to \ntalk about a few of those priorities and choices we have made.\n  We face pressing transportation needs across our country, and \nmaintaining and creating new infrastructure is key to this country's \neconomic strength.\n  Just a couple of months ago, the American Society of Civil Engineers \nissued its annual report card on the condition of America's \ninfrastructure, and the results were very dismal. The leading experts \non the state of our Nation's infrastructure have reduced the grade \npoint average of our entire system of roads and bridges and mass \ntransit to a D--that is ``D'' as in dog. Our Nation's roads also got a \nD-minus since a third of our major roads are considered to be in poor \nand mediocre condition, and more than a third of our urban highways are \ncongested. American families today spend about 4.2 billion hours a year \nstuck in traffic, and that is costing our economy almost $80 billion in \nlost productivity each and every year. These roads are in every one of \nour States. It is time to fix them.\n  As we are all aware, the available funding balance in the highway \ntrust fund is falling rapidly. Thankfully, in our budget the \ntransportation reserve fund will provide the mechanism that will allow \nus to reform our transportation financing system and provide the kinds \nof spending levels in the upcoming Transportation authorization bill \nthat are going to be necessary to maintain our highways and our transit \nsystems. Fixing our transportation is about getting our economy strong, \nbut it is about safety as well. I think all of us remember when that \nMinnesota bridge went down. We do not want to see that again. It is \ntime to fix our roads and our transportation. This budget takes a major \nstep forward.\n  Second, education. We all know and we all say that education is the \nkey to our future strength. In this new global economy we exist in, a \ngood education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity; it is a \nrequirement for success. We will not recover and be strong in the long \nterm unless we both create jobs and make sure America's workers have \nthe education and skills to fill those jobs we create. So this budget \ninvests strongly in education and in ensuring that American students do \nnot fall behind as they make their way into this global marketplace.\n  This budget helps retrain America's workers for careers in high-\ngrowth and emerging industries such as health care or renewable energy \nor energy-efficient construction so that those workers can stay in the \nmiddle class. We increase Pell grants and make tax credits for tuition \npermanent. We want all students to achieve a postsecondary education, \nwhether it is through a registered apprenticeship or through a \ncommunity college or university, and this budget helps take us in that \ndirection.\n  As a nation, we have to change the way we think about preparing young \npeople for careers today, starting with making education work better. \nThis current economic crisis has cost us dearly.\n  Every weekend I go home to Washington State, I hear about another \nbusiness closing, another family who has lost their job, another senior \ncitizen who does not know how they are going to make it. So we all know \nthat if we make changes and we make smart investments, that is how we \nare going to move our country forward again and give confidence back to \nthe American people that we are a strong country. Investing in \neducation is one of those smart investments. We do that in this budget.\n  Our health care system--something we all talk about--is broken. We \nknow it needs real reform. Today, we have a historic opportunity to \nfinally tackle that challenge. These investments we make in health care \nare not luxuries; they are essential to our future strength. That is \nwhy we need to prioritize the health profession's workforce and access \nto quality health care in our rural areas, and we have to ensure that \npreventive measures are given priorities so that American families are \nnot left with giant bills for expensive care down the road.\n  Some critics of this budget argue that now is not the time to tackle \nhealth care reform. I believe that is very shortsighted reasoning. \nThere is a direct connection between our Nation's long-term prosperity \nand developing health care policies that stem the chronic bleeding in \nbusiness and in our State and national budgets across the country.\n  Mr. President, there was a recent editorial in the Everett Herald, a \nhometown newspaper in my State, that made this point, and I want to \nread it to you. It says:\n\n       Yes, the economy is the most urgent challenge. But our \n     broken health care system and addiction to oil threaten to \n     become our long-term undoing.\n       They're all intertwined. Failing to find solutions to our \n     long-term problems will likely stunt future economic \n     expansions, creating longer and deeper downturns.\n\n  That is not something any one of us wants to see, which brings me to \nour next investment. As we are all aware, energy issues are some of the \nmost pressing facing our Nation today. Our dependence on foreign oil \nhas left us beholden to other nations as middle-class families have \npaid the price at the pump. By making renewable energy a priority in \nthis budget, we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy \nin the future and help create green jobs here at home and leave a \ncleaner environment for future generations. These are smart investments \nin this budget.\n  In an issue near and dear to my heart, I commend both the committee \nand President Obama for finally making our veterans a priority in this \nbudget process. Our men and women in uniform and their families have \nserved and sacrificed for our Nation. After years of being underfunded \nand overshadowed, this budget finally does right by them. I again \ncommend Senator Conrad, the budget chairman, and President Obama for \nputting this issue forward.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\n  This budget is finally honest with the American people about the cost \nof war, not just by paying for veterans care but by paying for the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, on budget, for the first time since they \nstarted--over 6 years ago.\n  I also wish to note that this budget meets our commitment to nuclear \nwaste cleanup in my State and across the country. Workers at Hanford \nNuclear Reservation and residents of that community sacrificed many \nyears ago to help our Nation win World War II. Hanford and those other \nsites are now home to millions of gallons of waste. Our Government \nneeds to live up to its promise to clean them up, and this budget \nrightfully does that.\n  Let me talk a minute about agriculture because agricultural \nproduction is the largest industry for many States across the country, \nas it is in my State, with farming and ranching. Protecting our \nagricultural sector is critical to our economy, to our environment, and \nto our quality of life. We need to work to keep our rural communities \nstrong and to ensure a bright future for all our farm families. \nProduction agriculture--such as Washington State's wheat farming--is a \nvery volatile business and a workable safety net, such as in the farm \nbill, is vital to the security of our family farms.\n  I have long supported the Market Access Program, which provides funds \nfor our producers to promote their products overseas and expanding \ninternational markets. These are critical for our agricultural \ncommunities today as they try to compete in a global economy. \nEspecially in these difficult economic times, when our foreign \ncompetitors are trying to limit our market access with high tariffs, \nthe last thing we should be doing is cutting programs such as the \nMarket Access Program, which will help our growers in a competitive \nglobal marketplace. As we work to get our country back on track, I am \ngoing to continue to find ways to support one of the staples of our \neconomy and that is our agricultural community.\n  America has paid dearly for the Bush administration's failure over \nthe last 8 years to invest in our country and to invest in our people. \nWe don't have to tell that to the American people today. They are \nwaking up every single day and seeing rising health care costs, pink \nslips, a crumbling infrastructure and bills and mortgages they can't \nafford to pay. We tried it the other way for the last 8 years. Now it \nis time to invest in America again. It is time to give our middle class \na break and it is time for honesty and it is time for bold decisions.\n  This budget that Senator Conrad and the Budget Committee have brought \nto all of us to consider today isn't perfect, of course--no budget is--\nbut what it does do is extremely important. It invests in our future--\nour future, America's future--and puts this country back on track.\n  I wish to thank Senator Conrad, again, and his committee for working \nso hard to bring this budget forward to us, and I look forward to \nsupporting it when we pass it later this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Auto Bailout Plan\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the significance of the U.S. auto \nindustry as the symbol of American creativity, industriousness, and \nprosperity is hard to overstate. So is the importance of its continued \nsurvival to millions of American workers who design, build or sell our \ncars here and around the world. This is precisely why many of us have \nbeen insisting for years that management and labor take the tough but \nnecessary steps to keep these companies viable not only in a recession \nbut also in good times.\n  Unfortunately, many of these tough decisions have been put off time \nand again, and the day of reckoning has come for two of the big three \nautomakers. Yesterday, the administration announced that GM and \nChrysler had failed to come up with viable plans for survival, despite \ntens of billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts aimed at avoiding this \nvery situation.\n  The immediate result of this failure on the part of the automakers \nwas the administration's decision to fire GM'S CEO and the promise of \neven more bailout money if these companies take the same kinds of steps \nRepublicans have been demanding, literally, for years. Last fall, when \nthe recession took hold, Republicans said emergency support was \njustifiable for entities whose failure threatened to paralyze the \nNation's entire economy. Taxpayer support for individual industries was \nnot. Our reasoning was, taxpayers should understand an effort to save \nan entire credit system--literally the lifeblood of the Main Street \neconomy--but they wouldn't support the Government picking winners and \nlosers based on political or regional calculations.\n  While no one takes pleasure in the continued struggles of the \nautomakers, those warnings and that principle appear to have been \nvindicated by recent events. If our proposal had prevailed last fall, \nthese two companies would have been forced to make the serious \nstructural changes that billions of dollars in taxpayer money since \nthen have not been able to produce. Republicans said the expectation of \nbailouts disincentivizes reform, and it appears we were absolutely \nright.\n  In early December, I said a tentative compromise between labor and \nmanagement didn't go nearly far enough; what was needed was a firm \ncommitment on the part of these companies to reform either in or out of \nbankruptcy, get their benefit costs under control, make wages \ncompetitive with foreign automobile makers immediately, and end the \npractice of paying workers who don't work. I also said automakers had \nto rationalize dealer networks in response to the market.\n  The previous administration took a different view. It said an \nemergency infusion of taxpayer money would be enough to force these \ncompanies and labor leaders to act. The current administration agreed \nwith that assessment, and last month, when the automakers came back \nagain for more money, the current administration complied with an \nadditional $5 billion infusion of taxpayer dollars. The latest infusion \nappears to have had little or no effect.\n  Yesterday, we got the verdict: 4 months and $25 billion taxpayer \ndollars after Republicans called for tough but needed reform, the \nautomakers are no further along than they were in December. As a \nresult, the current administration has decided the bailouts can't go on \nforever, although they are still putting the cutoff date well into the \nfuture. The taxpayer regret for this bailout is that it could have cost \na lot less than $25 billion. The answer to this problem was obvious \nmonths ago.\n  Throughout this debate, some have tried to propagate the falsehood \nthat this is a regional issue; certain Senators oppose bailout because \ndomestic automakers don't operate in their States. If that were true, I \ncertainly wouldn't be standing here. Thousands of Kentuckians work at \nFord assembly plants in Louisville, thousands more work for domestic \nsuppliers throughout Kentucky, and for more than 30 years, every \nCorvette in America has rolled off a production line in Bowling Green, \nKY.\n  Those of us who oppose unlimited bailouts for struggling automakers \ndon't want these companies to fail. We want them to succeed. If our \nproposals had been adopted, we believe they would be in a much better \nposition to do so.\n  Hard-working autoworkers at places such as Ford and GM in Kentucky \nhave suffered because of the past decisions of unions and management. \nIt is not their fault labor and management made the decisions that put \nthem in this mess. It is no coincidence that Ford--the only U.S. \nautomaker that has refused taxpayer bailout money to date--is also the \nmost viable, even after the financing arm of one of its bailed-out \ncompetitors used taxpayer funds to provide its customers with better \nfinancing deals. Companies that make the tough choices and steer their \nown ship are better off in the short and the long term.\n  Everyone wants the domestic automakers to get through the current \ntroubles and to thrive. But it is going to take more than tough talk \nafter the fact or the firing of CEOs. It is encouraging to see the \nadministration is coming around to our point of view. It is a shame the \ntaxpayers had to put up $25 billion to get to this point.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on two of the amendments \nwe will be considering today on the budget. One protects Americans from \na new\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nnational energy tax in the form of an increase in electricity and \ngasoline prices at a time when they can least afford it, and one brings \ntransparency to the budget process.\n  The first amendment we will consider, sponsored by the junior Senator \nfrom South Dakota, says the reserve fund in the budget resolution for \nclimate change cannot be used for legislation that would increase \nelectricity or gasoline prices for American consumers.\n  An increase in electricity and gas prices would disproportionately \naffect people at the lower end of the economic ladder, and American \nfamilies cannot afford a tax increase at a time when many are \nstruggling to make ends meet. Passing this amendment would protect them \nfrom the additional burden of the new national energy tax included in \nthe administration's budget.\n  The second amendment, sponsored by the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nbars the use of reconciliation when considering climate change \nlegislation, thus assuring an open, bipartisan debate on this job-\nkilling and far-reaching proposal.\n  Democratic budget writers who support reconciliation know their plans \nfor a new national energy tax are unpopular with both Republicans and \nDemocrats. That is why they are trying to fast-track this legislation \ndown the road and prevent its critics from having their say. The \nstrategy of the reconciliation advocates is clear: Lay the groundwork \nfor a new national energy tax that could cost American households up to \n$3,100 a year, keep it quiet, then rush it through Congress, leaving \ntransparency and debate in its wake.\n  Americans deserve better. They expect a full and open debate, \nparticularly on a piece of legislation as far-reaching as this. The \nproposal by the junior Senator from Nebraska would ensure that.\n  Here are two Republican ideas Americans support. I would urge my \ncolleagues to do the same by voting in favor of both the Johanns and \nthe Thune amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand I now have the right to offer \nan amendment, but prior to offering the amendment, I wish to make a \ncouple comments.\n  I have watched this debate develop, and it develops with a certain \ntempo every year. One of the comments that has been made in the paper \nby the chairman--and it was also made by the President, interestingly \nenough--is that if we disagree with the budget as brought forward by \nthe President, we should offer our own budget. Historically, the way \nthis has happened is that the party in the minority has not offered a \nbudget. Traditionally, the party in the minority has offered a series \nof amendments to try to improve the majority's budget.\n  That is the tack we have taken this year. That seems like a more \nlogical tack to me because it is a more bipartisan approach. We are \nsimply trying to reach out to the majority and say: Hey, listen. If you \naccept this amendment and this amendment and this amendment, your \nproduct--the budget you have brought forward--is going to be a much \nbetter product. For example, if you reduce the amount of spending in \nyour bill because your bill spends too much; if you reduce the amount \nof taxes in your bill because your bill taxes too much; and if you \nreduce the amount of borrowing in your bill because your bill \ndefinitely borrows too much, then the amendments which we offer to \naccomplish those three points would significantly improve your bill.\n  In addition, we are going to offer amendments which address positive \npolicy initiatives. For example, we will offer an amendment to try to \nimprove the energy policy of our Nation by allowing Americans to \nproduce more American energy rather than buy it overseas, and to \nconserve more American energy--which is the approach we should take. We \nwill allow Americans to produce more American energy by allowing more \ndrilling in an environmentally safe way, by allowing more nuclear \nplants, by allowing more wind and solar energy, at the same time \nconserving. We will offer that amendment.\n  We will offer an amendment to improve the budget by offering a \npositive policy on health care where every American could be insured \nbut where we do not add another $1 trillion in spending and don't step \noff on the course of nationalizing our health care system. We will \noffer amendments which will try to get under control the real threat we \nhave as a nation, from the fiscal policy standpoint, which is the out-\nyear debt, the fact we will be passing on to our children debts which \nare not sustainable, debts of a trillion dollars a year as far as the \neye can see. That is not sustainable. So we will offer policies in that \narea, relative to trying to have a more balanced approach toward \nspending around here rather than a profligate approach toward spending.\n  That is the approach we take to improve this budget by amendment. It \nis a bipartisan approach. We are not going to set up our budget versus \ntheir budget and have a partisan debate. We are going to suggest they \nchange their budget and make it a more positive document and more \nbipartisan document. Interestingly enough, this is exactly the same \napproach taken by the chairman when he was in the minority and I \nhappened to be the chairman, and I respected that approach and I did, \non occasion, ask where is your budget and he came back with his \nstatements, which were eloquently and brilliantly presented, that said \nhe would do it by amendment. In fact, they were so eloquently and \nbrilliantly stated I brought some of the statements here so other \nMembers can see the eloquence of our chairman on the subject.\n  March 10, 2006, when I offered a budget and I asked: Where is your \nbudget, Senator? And he said:\n\n       We will offer a series of alternatives by amendment.\n\n  Concise. People are concise from North Dakota. Sort of like New \nHampshire. That is why we like each other. Then he made another \nstatement when I asked the question where is your budget, Mr. Chairman, \nand said, on March 14--a more expansive statement:\n\n       Mr. President, the chairman says we have offered no budget.\n\n  I did say that.\n\n       The chairman well knows the majority has the responsibility \n     to offer a budget. Our responsibility is to critique that \n     budget.\n\n  We have great admiration for the chairman. I listened to his words \nwhen I was chairman. We are following that course of action. So I hope \nthat as we move down the road with this discussion that we have no more \nstatements in the newspaper to the effect there is no budget being \noffered by the Republican side.\n  On another subject, I heard--and I listened to what the President \nsaid on the issue of this auto bailout issue. I have deep reservations \nabout this. I have been a strong supporter of the initiatives that this \nadministration has taken trying to stabilize our financial industry. \nThe financial industry is the core systemic element of our economic \nwell-being as a nation. The availability of credit at a reasonable \nprice, reasonably easy to obtain, is the essence of a strong and \nvibrant capitalist system. It goes to the core question of Main Street \nand how you make Main Street work.\n  If you think of us as a body, a nation as a body, the financial \nsystem is the blood system, it is the arteries, it is what moves the \nblood through the system. So it is critical that we have a viable \nfinancial system. I have been very supportive of the administration's \ninitiatives in this area. I have been very supportive of Secretary \nGeithner's initiatives and I have been very supportive of Secretary \nGeithner. But this idea that we should step in to underwrite the \nautomobile industry is something with which I have real problems. I had \nproblems when the prior administration did it at the end, in the final \ndays, and I have problems with it now. It is an important industry--no \nquestion. But, remember, cars are produced in this country that are not \nnecessarily produced by these two companies, GM and Chrysler. There are \nalso cars produced by Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW. A\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nvariety of companies have manufacturing facilities in this country, so \nit is not as though the entire system is threatened relative to \nemployment of the people in the auto industry. It is these specific \ncompanies that are having problems and they are important but they are \nnot systemic.\n  Equally significant is the fact that these companies have had \nproblems for a long time in the production of a product that is \ncompetitive. Before we start putting tax dollars into these companies, \nthere has to be a very specific plan that shows they will be viable, \nthat these tax dollars will not be good dollars chasing bad dollars, \nand that means there has to be a plan, No. 1, to produce products \npeople want to buy; and, No. 2, reduces significantly the debt so the \nbondholders actually take a fairly significant haircut; and, No. 3, \nbrings their employment contracts in line with the employment contracts \nof their competitors. None of that has happened so far. It is very hard \nto justify putting money into this industry in this present climate and \nunder the failure of proposals to come forward to accomplish that.\n  Something else the President said has raised a question to me. That \nis, he is saying that the Government is going to insure the warranties \nof these automobile manufacturers, specifically GM. Because if Chrysler \naffiliates with Fiat, that would not be necessary, I presume. That is a \nfairly significant step for the U.S. Government to take, that we are \ngoing to insure the warranties on cars. Is that the business of the \nGovernment? Is that the purpose of the Government? Does that mean we \nput a new telephone line in my office in Portsmouth for people who have \nproblems with their transmissions? That they are supposed to call me?\n  Let's be honest about this. This is probably not a course of action \nthat makes a whole lot of sense, that the Government is going to get \ninto the business of underwriting the warranties of a manufacturer.\n  I have deep reservations about the course of action here. I do hope \nbefore we put any more money into this--in fact, I hope we will not put \nanymore money into it, but if there is more money going into it, there \nis at least a clear and defined plan that shows these companies will be \nviable, which means they have to put on the table a plan that shows \nthey are going to make products we support, that people want to buy, \nbondholders are taking a fairly significant hit, and their union \ncontract and the legacy contracts are adjusted to be more in line with \nthe competition.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 739\n\n  On the specifics of the amendment which I am offering at this point, \nI ask the clerk to report my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 739.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the consideration of any budget resolution, or \namendment thereto, or conference report thereon, that shows an increase \n in the public debt, for the period of the current fiscal year through \n the next 10 years, equal to or greater than the debt accumulated from \n                       1789 to January 20, 2009)\n\n       On page 68, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. LIMITATION ON BUDGET RESOLUTIONS INCREASING THE \n                   PUBLIC DEBT.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--In the Senate, it shall not be in \n     order to consider any budget resolution, or amendment \n     thereto, or conference report thereon, that shows an increase \n     in the public debt, for the period of the current fiscal year \n     through the next 10 years, equal to or greater than the debt \n     accumulated from 1789 to January 20, 2009.\n       (b) Form of Point of Order.--A point of order under \n     subsection (a) may be raised by a Senator as provided in \n     section 313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (e) Determinations of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of net direct spending shall be \n     determined on the basis of estimates provided by the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n       (f) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2010.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This is a pretty simple amendment. It comes about as a \nresult of one of the elements that I see as the core of the problem \nwith the President's budget, and that is that we, under the budget as \nproposed by the President, are going to pass on to our children an \nunsustainable Government and a debt which will essentially put them in \na position where their quality of life will be dramatically reduced \nbecause of the burden of the debt they have to pay relative to the \nFederal deficits that have been run up. The President's budget \ndoubles--you have heard this before--doubles the national debt in 5 \nyears, triples it in 10 years. These are massive expansions in debt. It \nis hard to put these numbers into context, but they represent the fact \nthat every household in America, by the year 2019, will have $130,000 \ndebt on its back added as a result of this Presidency, and $6,000 of \ninterest payments that they will bear as a result of this Presidency.\n  That means the debt added to their backs and the interest added to \ntheir backs probably will exceed their mortgage payments--to pay for \nthe Federal Government. So it doubles it in 5 years, triples it in 10 \nyears. The burden will be extraordinary on our children because they \nare the ones who will have to pay the cost of this. It will lead to a \ndecrease in the quality of life of our Nation because the burden of \npaying this will lead to one of two options: Either we inflate the \ncurrency, thus reducing the value of the dollar--and inflation is a \ndangerous thing for society to have happen to it; it makes everybody's \nwork less valuable and it makes the products they produce more \nexpensive--or, alternatively, the tax burden to pay for this will have \nto go so high on all Americans--this is not just the wealthy; the \nwealthy already are going to be taxed under this budget--it will go so \nhigh on all Americans that their discretionary income which they might \nuse to buy a house, which they might use to send their children to \ncollege, which they might use to buy a car, to live a better lifestyle, \nwill be eliminated or significantly reduced, anyway, because they will \nhave to go through the burden of paying taxes to cover the debt that we \nare running up now. We are, our generation, running it up and we are \nhanding it on to the next generation. It is very wrong for one \ngeneration to do this to another generation.\n  We will be creating under this budget, or the President is proposing \nto create under his budget, a wall of debt which goes up and up, a wall \nof debt which will be sitting on top of the American economy and the \npeople of this country. The American people are not going to be able to \nget over this wall of debt. They will run right into it and the economy \nis going to run right into it, and it is going to have a devastating \nimpact on us.\n  Other countries are going to be worried about this. Other countries \nthat buy our debt and support our ability to function as a nation are \ngoing to be worried about the size of this debt. In fact, the Premier \nof China has already said--and he is the largest holder of American \ndebt instruments outside of the United States--has already said that he \nis concerned about this. If China or other nations start to get \nconcerned and are not willing to buy our debt, then that puts us in a \ndifficult position because if we are going to run up all this debt and \nwe have nobody who can buy the debt, that is when you hit inflation. \nThat is when serious things happen.\n  We do not have to look too far to see it already happening in other \nnations. Ireland. Ireland got its debt so out of kilter it just had its \ncredit rating reduced. A whole nation, which is considered to be a \npretty vibrant nation and which for a period was considered to be the \nmost vibrant economy in Europe, had its credit rating reduced. That is \na huge event for Ireland and it reflects the fear that the Irish \neconomy will not be able to support the deficits and the debt that are \nbeing run up.\n  How large was the Irish debt and deficit that led to this credit \nrating--credit downgrade? Their deficit was 12.4 percent of GDP. You \nsay that is pretty darn high, no wonder the credit rating agencies said \nthe Irish debt may not be sound or as sound as other nations.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n  How high is our deficit going to be? Under this budget resolution, \nthis year it is already going to be 12.2 percent. We are closing in. \nUnder the President's budget proposal, it will exceed 13 percent this \nyear if the proposals in his budget are enacted. We are closing in on \nthe Irish situation. We are spending a lot of money we do not have and \nwe are running up a lot of debt we can not afford. In fact, stated \nanother way, if you look at all the debts, all the deficit and all the \ndebt run up on the United States since the beginning of our country--\n1789, when we began running up debt, that is when George Washington was \nPresident--this is a picture of all the Presidents here. If you look at \nall the debt they ran up on our Nation from George Washington through \npeople such as Buchanan, Polk, Lincoln, of course, Grant, Garfield, \nWilson, Harding, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, right up through George W. \nBush--all the debt run up by all these people, all these Presidents \nthroughout all their administrations, the President of the United \nStates, President Obama, is suggesting that he, under his budget, we \nshould double that--double this cumulative debt run up on our country \nsince 1789 in about the first 5 years of his Presidency.\n  That is incredible. That is an incredible explosion in debt. It gets \nback to this chart I held up that says we are going to double the debt \nin 5 years under this Obama proposal--President Obama's proposal--and \ntriple it in 10 years. It is incredible.\n  I do not think that is affordable. I don't think our Nation can do \nthat. So I have offered the amendment I call the 1789 amendment. We are \ngoing to refer to it as the 1789 amendment. Actually it says there will \nbe a point of order against a budget that proposes that the debt of \nthis Nation should be doubled during the period of that budget--that if \nthat debt would double, that a budget which would propose that debt \nwould double the amount of debt run up since 1789 through January 20, \n2009--if a budget comes to this floor which doubles the debt of the \nUnited States, which has been run up since 1789, through 2009--run up \nunder all the Presidents of the United States prior to President Obama, \nthere would be a point of order against that budget.\n  Does a point of order mean the budget can't be passed? No. The budget \ncan be passed. It is just going to take 60 people to pass it rather \nthan 51. That seems reasonable, that if you are going to leave our \nchildren with a doubling of the debt in 5 years and a tripling of the \ndebt in 10 years, that you ought to be willing to get 60 votes to do \nthat.\n  The reason for this, of course, is to highlight and make it clear to \nthe American public what we are doing to ourselves. I do not expect to \nwin the point of order very often--especially if my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have 58 votes. But that point should be made so \nthe American people see in a very clear way what is happening to them. \nThat is what this is about--making it very clear to the American people \nthat if the deficits are going to go up in this way, that if a \nPresident proposes to run a $1-trillion-a-year deficit for 10 straight \nyears on average--$1 trillion, think about that for a moment, a $1 \ntrillion a year deficit for 10 straight years on average--wow. We used \nto get concerned around here, and rightly so, whether we were running a \ndeficit in the range of $200 billion.\n  We are now talking about $1 trillion a year under this President's \nbudget, as the deficit that is proposed. Five to 6 percent of the gross \nnational product will be deficit spending, with the practical \nimplication that it adds to the debt almost $9.3 trillion, tripling the \ndebt, taking the debt as a percentage of GDP up past 80 percent, which \nis an unsustainable number. It is so unsustainable, in fact, that we \nwouldn't even be able to get into the European Union if we wanted to \nbecause they don't allow countries in that have that amount of debt. \nCan you imagine that? We are worse off than all the countries in Europe \nthat are part of the European Union because of the level of debt being \nproposed in this budget.\n  Nobody wants to use Europe as an example, but that is a pretty \nsignificant benchmark. We will be headed toward a situation where the \nvalue of our currency is at risk, where our ability to sell debt will \nbe limited or affected, where we have a potential for massive \ninflation, and where we essentially will pass on to our children a \ncountry they cannot afford because the tax burden to support the \ngovernment will be so overwhelming. We should not do that. I don't \nthink we should do it.\n  The history of this Nation is that every generation passes to the \nnext generation a better and more prosperous country. The implications \nof this budget are that we will be unable to pass to the next \ngeneration a better and more prosperous country. This amendment, which \nwe call the 1789 amendment, says, if we want to pass a budget that \ndoubles the debt over all the debts that have been run up in this \nNation since 1789, we need to get 60 votes rather than 51. We have to \nget nine more people to agree. That seems a reasonable threshold and, \nhopefully, a transparent event that will make it clear as to what the \nbudget is doing to the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nfor his use of my previous quotes. I am delighted to see my name up \nthere on those wonderful charts.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was going to put them in lights, but they don't allow \nthat as part of the rules.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be an even nicer touch.\n  The one thing I would say that was left out was when there was a new \nadministration and a complete change in direction in 2001, I did offer \na complete alternative. My colleague is very unhappy with the \nPresident's budget. This is their opportunity, if they are as unhappy \nas they say, to offer an alternative. But they don't have one. They \ndon't have an alternative. They don't have an alternative budget. They \ndon't have an alternative vision. All they want to do is say no. They \nwant to say no to the President's budget. They want to say no to the \nbudget that has come from the Budget Committee. They say no to their \neven offering an alternative.\n  When the situation was reversed, a new President in 2001, with a \nradically different vision, we offered a full alternative. I am proud \nwe did.\n  When I hear the other side talk about the growth of debt, I have to \nask, where were they the last 8 years? Where were they? Where were they \nwhen the previous administration doubled the debt of the country? In \nfact, they more than doubled it. Where were they when the previous \nadministration tripled foreign holdings of U.S. debt?\n  As this chart shows, it took 224 years and 42 Presidents to run up $1 \ntrillion of U.S. debt held abroad, and the previous President ran that \nup by more than $2 trillion. He tripled the amount of U.S. debt held \nabroad. We have become increasingly dependent on the kindness of \nstrangers.\n  Last year, under their administration, 68 percent of the new debt of \nthis country was financed by foreign entities. Where were they when \nthat was happening?\n  This President inherits the colossal mess left behind by the previous \nadministration, a debt that had more than doubled, foreign holdings of \nU.S. debt more than tripled, and the worst economic slowdown since the \nGreat Depression. This President has been in office 3 months. Under the \nterms of the amendment they are now offering, they act as though he is \nresponsible for debt runup during the previous administration. Please. \nThat has zero credibility. They are saying that debt runup in the last \nquarter of the last administration is attributed to this \nadministration. They say the budget that this President is inheriting \nfor this year is the responsibility of this President. I don't think \nso. That is not the way I ever did the calculations.\n  When their administration was in power, I always held their \nadministration harmless for the first year since they were inheriting \nthe budget of the previous administration and the economics of the \nprevious administration. Now they want to try to stick President Obama \nwith the failures of the last administration and say debt runup in the \nprevious administration is his debt. I don't think so. That is not \nfair. That is not going to sell.\n  Here is what happened when they were in charge. We now have China as\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nthe No. 1 financier of U.S. debt. We owe them $740 billion. Japan is \nnot far behind. We owe them $635 billion. Where were they when this \ndebt was being run up? I will tell you where they were. They were in \nfull lockstep support of the previous administration. They voted for \nevery dollar of the debt that was run up.\n  One place I will agree with them is that it is dangerous to have run \nup that debt. Unfortunately, with this economic slowdown, we are going \nto have a lot more debt, a lot more deficits, until we are able to lift \nout of this and then pivot and get back to a more sustainable course.\n  China is worried about the U.S. debt. They were worried about it \nbefore this administration, they were worried about it in the previous \nadministration, and well they should be. If we look at any analysis of \nthe debt we have from 2001 to 2014, who is responsible for the debt \nbuildup?\n  This red bar is what the Bush administration will have been \nresponsible for. The green is the recession and interest on inherited \ndebt. The contribution of this budget is the small yellow piece because \nwe have the Titanic of debt coming at us. It is a result of the \npolicies inherited by this administration, the result of the economic \ncollapse inherited by this administration. That is the reason we have \nthe circumstance we face today.\n  Let me quote Senator Gregg. He was kind enough to quote me. I would \nlike to quote him. This is what he said on March 11. He was quoting me \nfrom 2006. I stand by those quotes. This is March 11, Senator Gregg:\n\n       I'm willing to accept this [short-term debt deficit] number \n     and not debate it, because we are in a recession, and it's \n     necessary for the government to step in and be aggressive, \n     and the government is the last source of liquidity. And so \n     you can argue that this number, although horribly large, is \n     something we have to live with.\n\n  He was right on March 11--by the way, my daughter's birthday, and the \nday before my birthday. Usually he gives me a gift on my birthday. No \ngift this year. I am very hurt by this. I don't know why Senator Gregg \nabsolutely forgot my birthday. He remembers my quotes, but no \nremembrance of my birthday. That is OK. I still like him very much. He \nis a very nice person. But the place where he and I absolutely agree is \nthe second 5 years. We have to do a lot more to get the debt under \ncontrol under the President's budget, even my budget, which \ndramatically reduces the deficit and debt. The truth is, we have to do \nmore. It is in the country's interest that we do.\n  Let's talk a minute about what we are accomplishing in the budget \nbefore us. We are dramatically reducing the deficit, from $1.7 trillion \nthis year, an all-time record, because of the dramatic economic \nslowdown. That means less revenue, more expenditure, exploding deficit, \nand $1.3 trillion of this $1.7 trillion is exclusively the \nresponsibility of the previous President.\n  A new President walks into a situation. He didn't construct the \nconditions for this year. That is the previous administration. So $1.3 \ntrillion of this year's deficit reflects the policies of the previous \nadministration. We hold President Obama responsible for $400 billion of \nthe deficit this year because that is the effect of his stimulus \npackage and other legislation that passed.\n  So, yes, he has a responsibility for some of this deficit this year, \nbut it is about one-fourth of what we will experience this year. Then \nwe are dramatically reducing the deficit by $500 billion for the next \nyear. The next year we bring it down another $300 billion, the next \nyear another $300 billion, and, by 2014, we take it down to $508 \nbillion, a more than two-thirds reduction in the 5 years of this budget \nas a share of gross domestic product, which is what economists say \nought to be the comparison.\n  Why do they say it? Because if you look at it in dollar terms, that \ndoes not take account of inflation. If you do it as a share of gross \ndomestic product, that takes account of inflation. You can see we are \neven more dramatically reducing the deficit under that metric, from \n12.2 percent of gross domestic product today down to less than 3 \npercent in the fifth year, which economists all say is what we need to \ndo to stabilize the growth of the debt. We need to get to 3 percent of \nGDP or less. We do that in the fifth year and bring down the deficit as \na share of GDP each and every year of the 5 years of the budget.\n  My colleagues on the other side have offered an amendment that says--\nand I hope colleagues are listening because we are going to vote on \nthis, and we will be voting pretty soon on this proposal--if the debt \nis at a certain level, it will require 60 votes to write a budget \nresolution.\n  Let's think about that. Let's think of the implications of what they \nare offering. They say, if the debt is not below a certain level, you \ncannot write a budget resolution unless you get a supermajority vote. \nDo we want to do that? I would say to my colleagues, the budget \nresolution is the vehicle that has all the budget disciplines in it, \nall the supermajority points of order against spending, and they would \njeopardize those very disciplines that can help us hold down deficits \nand debt.\n  What sense does that make? I ask my colleagues, does it make any \nsense at all to be saying we are going to make it harder to write a \nbudget resolution that provides the disciplines to hold down spending, \nthat provides all those supermajority points of order against \nadditional spending? I say to my colleagues, the cure they are offering \nis worse than the disease. Please, colleagues, let's not go with that \nidea.\n  I will tell you, in the committee, they actually offered--which I \nthought was the most bizarre; and I have been on the Budget Committee \n22 years--in the committee they actually offered a proposal to tie our \nstandards on deficits and debt to Europe. So we are going to adopt the \nEuropean Union model under the amendment they offered in the committee. \nCould you imagine?\n  Now the question of what our fiscal policy should be would be tied to \nFrance, would be tied to Italy, would be tied to Spain, would be tied \nto Germany, would be tied to Belgium.\n  This is America. This is an American budget for the American people. \nWe ought not to be tying ourselves to the French, the Italians. I love \nthe Italians. My wife is Italian. But, my goodness, they are talking \nabout tying our budget standards to the European Union? I do not think \nso.\n  I say to my colleagues, this amendment they are offering--well \nintended, absolutely well intended; I do not question their motivation \nat all, but I do question very much the specifics of the proposal they \nhave offered.\n  Mr. President, I would ask to have an update on how much time remains \non the budget resolution and what is the time between the sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the beginning of consideration of the \npending amendment, the majority controlled 19 hours 47 minutes, the \nminority controlled 19 hours 40 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And we are at just after 11 o'clock.\n  What is the order that was entered last night?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After the consideration of the pending Gregg \namendment, Mrs. Boxer of California is to be recognized. She will be \noffering an amendment. Then, Senator, you will be recognized to offer \nan amendment or your designee to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Sessions, are you seeking time on the \nGregg amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We still have time remaining.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on the Gregg amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 19 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask Senator Sessions, how much time would he seek?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the time of the \nminority to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I say, after Senator Sessions has \nused that time, or whatever additional time he might require, our \nintention would be to go to Senator Boxer. We cannot lock that in \nbecause Senator Gregg is not here, and we have an agreement we do not \ntake advantage of each other in a procedural way. So I would not seek \nto, in any way, alter the time that remains.\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n  I yield to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support the Gregg amendment because it \nat least requires us to focus on the enormity of the wrong we are now \ncommitting.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber--you have seen a lot of charts and a \nlot of obfuscation and numbers thrown around--this chart is not \ndisputable. These numbers come directly from the Congressional Budget \nOffice's analysis of the Obama 10-year budget. That budget says that \ntoday our debt is $5.8 trillion--$5,800 billion since the founding of \nthe Republic. It will double, in 5 years, to $11.8 trillion--$11,800 \nbillion in 5 years. It will, in 5 more years, triple to $17 trillion of \ndebt. We all know that nothing comes from nothing.\n  We have to pay interest on that debt. CBO has calculated that. We are \ncurrently paying $170 billion a year in interest--$170 billion. My home \nState of Alabama's entire budget is under $10 billion. The federal \ngovernment spends $40 billion a year on highways. We spend $100 billion \non education. We are currently spending $170 billion just on interest \non our debt. When this budget gets through, in calculating the interest \nrate, with some increases--because these debt levels are going to \nrequire higher interest to get people to loan us money--it will be $800 \nbillion in interest at the 10th year, which is bigger than the defense \nbudget, bigger than education, bigger than anything else in our \naccount.\n  I know the chairman has the budget on the floor and has said it is a \n5-year budget, but the House has a 10-year budget. Director Orszag, the \nPresident's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, has said \nthe Senate's budget is 98 percent of the President's budget. So it is \nnot a fundamental change. It is, essentially, the President's budget. \nThis is what the President's budget does. I would contend it is, \nessentially, indisputable that this is what he calls for. He made \nchoices. He could have cut spending in some other places, but he \nincreased spending.\n  I will add this: He does not project these deficits arising from slow \neconomic growth. Under the President's budget, he projects robust \ngrowth, good growth. The only negative year is this year. Next year, he \nprojects solid growth. The next year, I think, 4 percent; 3 years in a \nrow of over 4 percent growth, which is very robust. No recession is \nprojected in this 10-year period. So we have good years, fat times, and \nall the while we are increasing our debt, tripling it.\n  Senator Gregg is saying, let's at least have a vote that requires 60 \nvotes of the Senate, such as we do on any other important piece of \nlegislation, as to whether we will exceed doubling the debt.\n\n  Let me tell you the consequences of this. Last week we had difficulty \nselling our debt. The Brits' debt auction failed. The British are \nfollowing our model of huge spending increases and surging debt. That \nidea is being rejected by Central Europe, Germany, France, the Czech \nRepublic, and others. They reject that. They have refused the \nmortifying request of our own Secretary of Treasury that they go \nfurther into debt, spend more money as part of this wild plan to \nstimulate the economy with unprecedented debt. They have said no. It is \nirresponsible. In fact, the EU President said it is the road to hell.\n  The idea is, we have to pay this. This has a cost to the future. Yes, \nit gets money into our economy today, and in the short run there has to \nbe some benefit, although Nobel Prize laureate Gary Becker says it is \nso poorly drafted--this money we are spending--that we are not going to \nget nearly as much financial stimulus as we should be getting from it.\n  And you would say: Well, we will soon begin to pay this debt down. \nThe President says he is worried about it. We are going to pay the debt \ndown. But the debt is not going down. The annual deficit, in the last 4 \nyears, surges until CBO scores the 10th-year deficit, in 1 year, at \n$1.2 trillion. The highest deficit we have ever had prior to this year \nwas $455 billion, and in good economic times, they are projecting a \n$1.2 trillion deficit. That is the annual deficit, adding to these \nnumbers, as shown on the chart. That is why it triples. They keep going \nup, up, up.\n  There is no constraint in spending whatsoever. There is no plan to \ncontrol the entitlement surge, no plan to control spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In fact, the President's budget, this year, proposes to \nincrease domestic discretionary nondefense spending by 11.5 percent. We \npassed, a few weeks ago, a stimulus plan to spend $800 billion--the \nlargest single appropriations in the history of America; $800 billion--\nevery penny of it going to the debt. Now we are going to have an 11-\npercent increase this year in discretionary spending on top of that? \nYou know the rule of 7. It states that at 7-percent growth, your money \ndoubles in 10 years. At 11.5-percent growth, our spending would double \nin 7 years. The entire spending of the discretionary account would \ndouble in 7 years if we maintained this incredible, colossal spending \npath we are on.\n  I think Senator Gregg is exactly right. Let's at least slow down and \nlet's at least have the 60 votes we would normally have to pass an \nimportant piece of legislation if and when--and we certainly are \nheading to a point where this debt doubles--so at least to go to \ntripling, we ought to have another vote and slow down and ask \nourselves: What in the world are we doing to our children? They are \ngoing to be carrying--at this year, as shown on the chart--$800 billion \nin interest that year. That assumes the interest rate is mainstream. \nBut the truth is, with this much borrowing in these many countries \naround the world, we could have interest rates higher than that. If the \ninterest rates go up, the $800 billion could become $1 trillion a year \neasily, and above, if the debt continues to surge.\n  I support the amendment. I am very worried. The numbers we are \ntalking about on the floor are not a political dustup. This is about \nthe future of America. The financial integrity of our country is at \nstake. We have never spent like this before, except in World War II \nwhen we were in a life-and-death struggle. It is not the right thing to \ndo, and I support the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it will be our intention, as I am able to \nreach Senator Gregg, that we yield back the time on the Gregg \namendment--I have 13 minutes remaining, he has 11 minutes remaining--\nand that we go to the Boxer amendment. I ask Senator Boxer, when she is \navailable, to come to the floor.\n  Let me very briefly respond to Senator Sessions. Let me first say \nthat I appreciate his concern about the long-term debt, but I have to \ngo back to the questions I was asking earlier. Where were they? Where \nwere they when the debt was deemed doubled in the previous \nadministration? Where were they? They were right there supporting every \npolicy which led to that explosion of debt and which ultimately led to \nthe sharp economic collapse we are still experiencing. This collapse is \nresponsible for record deficits. What happens when there is a collapse? \nThe revenue evaporates, the expenditures skyrocket, because you have \nmore people unemployed, you have more people who need food stamps, you \nhave more need for a stimulus package to try to give lift to the \neconomy.\n  So I would just say to my colleagues, I have been concerned about \ndebt for 22 years. I have been concerned about what it would mean to \nthe economic security of America for 22 years. I have led fight after \nfight after fight on this floor, whether it was Democratic \nadministrations or Republican administrations, to keep deficits and \ndebt down because I believe they threaten the long-term economic \nsecurity of the country. Never is it more evident than now, when we \nfinanced 68 percent of our increased debt last year through foreign \nentities. Some say that is a sign of strength that they are willing\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nto loan us all this money. I don't think it is a sign of strength; I \nthink it is a vulnerability. When we are dependent on the Chinese to \nbankroll us, the Japanese to bankroll us, that gives them an \nextraordinary influence over us because if they decide to not show up \nat the bond auction one week, what would we have to do? We would either \nhave to dramatically increase interest rates to attract capital or we \nwould have to radically cut spending or dramatically raise taxes. All \nof those alternatives would be bad for the economic position of the \nUnited States for the long term.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we preserve the time \nremaining on the Gregg amendment--whatever time Senator Gregg still has \nand the time I still have--and that we set that aside and go to the \nBoxer amendment, and that it be in order to return to the Gregg \namendment after we complete the time on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. With that, we will momentarily go to the Boxer amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess \ntoday from 12:30 to 2:15, that the time during the recess count against \nthe time on the budget resolution, and that it be charged equally to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to make clear that we had that \nagreement between the two sides. Although Senator Gregg is not present \non the floor, we had the understanding that this is how we would \nproceed.\n  With that, I note that Senator Boxer is here now and prepared to \nproceed on her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 749\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I really take to the floor, first of all, \nunder the order to call up an amendment I have at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 749.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that certain legislation relating to clean energy \n technologies not increase electricity or gasoline prices or increase \n                    the overall burden on consumers)\n\n       On page 33, line 21, after ``economy,'', insert ``without \n     increasing electricity or gasoline prices or increasing the \n     overall burden on consumers, through the use of revenues and \n     policies provided in such legislation,''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is an amendment I have decided to \noffer to our colleagues as a supplement to an amendment offered by \nSenator Thune.\n  Senator Thune makes the point that global warming legislation should \nnot increase electricity prices. It is very interesting because I \ndidn't hear the concern from the other side of the aisle--it also \nrefers to gasoline prices--when gasoline prices hit almost $5 a gallon \nin our home States. We didn't hear an outcry. There was no global \nwarming legislation. It had nothing to do with it; it had to do with \nmanipulation. We didn't hear any outcry about that.\n  I think Senator Thune doesn't go far enough because we believe that \nrevenues from a climate bill, should we pass one--and I certainly hope \nwe will--would be used to offset any kind of an increase in electricity \nand gasoline prices, and we would have the revenues from a cap-and-\ntrade system to do just that. So I think Senator Thune's amendment \ndoesn't go far enough. We not only don't want to see an increase in \nprices, we want to have the revenues coming in through cap-and-trade \nlegislation to make consumers whole.\n  In his argument for his very narrow legislation, which I will be \nvoting for--I don't have a problem with it--Senator Thune cited a study \nby MIT to argue that climate legislation is a tax. In fact, the MIT \nstudy actually shows why it is important to capture the overall picture \nbecause the MIT study actually points out that the monetary value of \nallowances under a cap-and-trade program is something that Congress \nwould have the option of using to give a family of four a tax rebate--a \ntax rebate--that could be as high as $4,500 per year by the middle of \nthe next decade.\n  So I find it amazing that my Republican friends who oppose taking any \naction on global warming suddenly have discovered the consumer and they \nare worried that the consumer would pay high prices when we fight \nglobal warming when, in fact, a well-designed program--and I say to the \nChair, as he is a proud member of our committee--a well-designed \nprogram, as he knows, will give us the ability to refund money to \nconsumers and make sure they are healthy and kept whole.\n  So this legislation simply says that we will ensure that our \nlegislation relating to clean energy does not increase electricity or \ngas prices or does not increase the overall burden on consumers, and \nthat is the key. So it is going to be a boon for consumers.\n  So we will be voting for the Thune legislation and hopefully for the \nBoxer legislation so that we cover all of our bases and we know that \nglobal warming legislation is not going to hurt consumers but actually \nkeep them whole and clean up their environment; it is going to create \ngreen jobs and all the rest.\n  I wish to spend a couple of minutes talking about this budget, and I \nwish to start off by thanking members of the Budget Committee. Again, \nmy colleague in the chair is a member of the Budget Committee. They \nworked very hard under the leadership of Senator Conrad to come up with \na product that keeps President Obama's priorities intact, that does \nmore for deficit reduction, and I am very pleased about it.\n  I wish to say that I am very pleased the American people have not \nfallen for the same old, same old policies of the Republicans as they \ntry to demolish this new President and they try to destroy his \nreputation and try to bring him down. We don't have the charts that \ntalk about the same old policies, so if we could get those. There is a \nseries of charts.\n  I have taken to the floor before to talk about the comments of my \nRepublican friends during the debate on the Clinton budget, and we all \nknow--here is the message. We all know the Republicans repeat the same \nold politics, the same old policies that got us into this crisis.\n  I wish to take you back to 1993. The Republicans came to this floor, \nand they tried to demolish the Clinton budget. Not one of them voted \nfor it. The Democrats had taken over from George Bush's dad. Things \nwere in very bad shape.\n  This is what the Republicans said about the Clinton budget in 1993:\n  It is just a mockery. It is just a mockery, said Committee chairman \nPete Domenici.\n  Senator Hatch: Make no mistake. These higher rates will cost jobs.\n  Phil Gramm said: I believe hundreds of thousands of people are going \nto lose their jobs as a result of this program--including Bill Clinton, \nhe predicted, would lose his reelection.\n  Connie Mack: This bill will cost American jobs.\n  What happened as a result of the Clinton budget? Twenty-three million \njobs were created. It was the best record ever in peacetime--the best \nrecord ever in peacetime.\n  Senator Roth of the other side: It will flatten the economy. It is \nbad policy.\n  And on and on and on.\n  Now here we have today--this is years later, more than 10 years \nlater--the same old politics, the same old policies. Just listen to my \nRepublican friends trashing Barack Obama's budget: disaster, \ndisastrous, terrible, deficits as far as the eye can see. That is what \nthey said about the Clinton budget too--deficits forever. Guess what. \nGuess what. Not only did we have a balanced budget under Bill Clinton \nby the end of his term, we had a surplus.\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\n  So as our Republican friends come to the microphone, I want my \ncolleagues to listen carefully to their words. I am proud of the \nAmerican people for seeing through this. They understand what got us \ninto this mess. Clearly, what we can see is the same old, same old, \nsame old; the party of nope: Nope, we can't change. Nope, nope. I, \nfrankly, would rather be in the party of hope than the party of nope, \nand hope is what the American people want.\n  In this budget, we recover from the Republican deficit. It is true in \nthe short-term we are going to see deficits go up. But as shown to us \nby Senator Conrad, who is the biggest deficit hawk in this Senate--I \nchallenge anyone to be more of a deficit hawk--we see we are beginning \nto turn these deficits back down to sustainable numbers.\n  We know why the American people support President Obama and the \nCongress right now--because they saw that George Bush took record \nsurpluses and turned them into record deficits. The national debt \nincreased by 85 percent. The foreign-held debt more than tripled. This \nis the Republican deficit we are dealing with now, and we don't like \nit. But we are going to fix it as we did under Bill Clinton. We fixed \nit then, we will fix it now. The people are smart. When Republicans \ncome to the floor and they fight President Obama, the people in this \ncountry--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike--are saying \ngive this new President a chance. He inherited this mess.\n\n  Let's look at the rest of the deficit that happened with our \nfamilies. Health insurance premiums have risen, energy prices \nincreased, college costs skyrocketed, and the gap between the wealthy \nand the middle class widens. That is the part of the deficit this \nPresident was left with. We are losing the middle class in this \ncountry. That is very clear. It is very clear. All you have to do is \nlook at income levels. That is why when my Republican friends come to \nthe floor to trash the President and the budget, they understand what \nhas happened. It is not a mystery.\n  This is not a theoretical argument about who is right and who is \nwrong. We now know what happened in the Clinton years: the best economy \nin peacetime, 23 million jobs, surpluses, debt on the way down. We know \nwhat happened. When George Bush took the keys to the Oval Office, he \nturned it around into the Republican deficit. We know that happened. \nThe people are smart; they get it. That is why they support this.\n  Let's look further. I said before when George Bush took the keys to \nthe Oval Office, there was a surplus of $5.6 trillion. That was the \nprojected surplus. They turned it into a deficit of $10.6 trillion. \nThat is what happened under the Republicans. Why should we listen to \nwhat they are saying now? They are saying the same old thing. GOP, SOP, \nsame old policies.\n  Now, what our President is saying is that we are going to have a road \nto change. That road to change is going to be paved with a few simple \nthings. One is energy independence; two, making college affordable; \nthree, lowering health care costs; four, middle-class tax cuts; five, \ncutting the deficit in half in the next several years. Let me repeat \nthem. Energy independence, making college affordable, lowering health \ncare costs, middle-class tax cuts, and deficit reduction.\n  What do my Republican friends stand for? The same old policies, the \nsame old thing--no investment, no imagination, no realization that \nuntil we get off of foreign oil, and we lead the way on global warming, \nand we lead the way on lowering health care costs, we are going to be \nstuck in the same old place. That is why this budget is so crucial and \nimportant, because it is a roadmap of our Nation's priorities.\n  The President ran on these issues. He is doing what he promised he \nwould do--everything. The American people are saying that we know times \nare tough, but this President is trying, this Congress is trying. That \nis better than the status quo. If you read anything about the years of \nthe Great Depression, you realize that what our people wanted then was \nwhat our people want now; they want us to try. They want us to shake \nthings up, to invest in our people, and to create the jobs that will \ncome along with these important policies.\n  There are a lot of middle-class tax cuts in this budget. The \nPresident extends the child tax credit, eliminates the marriage \npenalty, and increases education benefits. These are important for our \npeople. So this budget, all told, makes a lot of sense for our country.\n  Senator Thune has offered an amendment in which he says electricity \nand gas prices should not rise as we pass global warming legislation. \nWe agree with that. We don't think his amendment goes far enough, \nbecause what we want to see is global warming legislation that passes \nthat uses the revenues to help consumers, that uses the revenues to \ninvest in new technologies, that uses the revenues to create jobs, to \nbuild transportation systems, to make sure our forests continue to act \nas carbon sinks, taking carbon out of the air.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask if the Chair will let me know when I \nhave 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I said before that when my Republicans \nfriends come to the floor, the American people should be wary. That is \nbecause they trashed the Clinton budget, and they were wrong then. Now \nthey are trashing the Obama budget, and they are going to be wrong \nagain. Even more than that, let's see what they said about the Bush \nbudget--the Bush budget that led us into this mess.\n  Senator Gregg I have a lot of respect for, but he was wrong on the \nBush budget. He said the Bush budget would drive the deficit down and \nproduce a surplus in 2012. It is hard to believe that was the \nprediction. We had deficits as far as the eye could see under George \nBush. The leader of the Republicans on this predicted there would be a \nsurplus under the Bush budget. As a matter of fact, we are in the \nbiggest economic mess since the Great Depression that this new \nPresident has to lead us out of. We need to help him. We really need to \nhelp him. It is very important that we do.\n  I thank the Budget Committee for including in the budget a reserve \nfund that will be able to make global warming legislation a reality. In \nother words, the committee is saying this may happen and they have set \naside a reserve fund. It is important. It sets the stage for \nlegislation. I guess the message I want to give to my colleagues who \noppose any legislation--and there are a lot of them--I have bad news \nfor them. Whether they support it or not, action on global warming has \nalready begun. The train has left the station. The Supreme Court--this \nSupreme Court--voted 5 to 4 that the Clean Air Act actually does cover \ncarbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, the EPA has \nthe power to say to our businesses: Clean up your act for the good of \nsociety.\n  Frankly, as far as I am concerned, knowing what I know about the \nconsensus of scientists, I think it is urgent that the EPA act. But I \nalso know it would be far better if this Congress acted, because if we \nacted, we could set up a cap-and-trade system. The EPA cannot do that \nwithout legislation. That cap-and-trade system will bring in revenues \nto help our businesses, help our consumers. I think at the end of the \nday it will lead us to millions of green jobs, a new economy, and lead \nus down the path of energy independence.\n  Let me say to my friends who will oppose the legislation when it \ncomes--and it is coming--here is your choice: You can fight it tooth \nand nail and stop it any way you want. You can even say never use \nreconciliation, even though you supported it 17 times in the past. If \nthat is what you want to say, say it. We already have the New England \nStates which have come together and they are doing a cap-and-trade \nsystem. The western States have gotten together and they are doing a \ncap-and-trade system. We have the Midwest involved with Canada doing a \ncap-and-trade system. We have the EPA having to act because of the \nSupreme Court. We have the California waiver out there.\n  So we are acting on global warming. The question is: Will we do it in \na way that turns this challenge into an enormous economic opportunity--\nand, of course, that is what I want to do. That is why so many \nbusinesses, and now\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nmore and more labor unions, are supporting the passage of climate \nchange legislation. Look, we know, because our own scientists have told \nus here at home, there are risks to public health if we don't act: more \nheat-related deaths, water-borne diseases from degraded water quality, \nmore cases of respiratory disease, including lung disease, from \nincreased smog, and children and the elderly are vulnerable. We know \nwhat the future will be like. We would never, ever, take our kids in an \nautomobile and park it in the sunlight next to a supermarket, lock all \nthe windows, and go inside and leave them alone. We would never do \nthat. Well, as legislators, we cannot do that to our constituents.\n  The fact is we know what is happening. The IPCC, Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, warned us that unchecked global warming would \nlead to reduced snowpack in the western mountains, critically reducing \naccess to water. We are already seeing insect invasions damaging our \nforests. We know that every State in this great Union will be impacted, \nand some are already impacted. We know that. In New York, a report \npredicts that northeastern cities could be hit the hardest as sea \nlevels rise, including flooding of their subway system. We know Florida \nis another very vulnerable place. A huge population is exposed. New \nOrleans and Virginia Beach are ranked in the top 20.\n  It doesn't matter where you are in this country, you are going to be \nimpacted. Your agricultural sector will be impacted, your tourism \nsector will be impacted, your fishing industries will be impacted.\n  So here is the deal: Either we pass legislation that turns this \nchallenge into a great opportunity, gives us the resources to get us on \nthe path to energy independence, gives us resources to create millions \nof green jobs, or we allow the States to do what they want to do, and \nthat is fine. I support that. There will be various States doing their \nown cap-and-trade system. The whole world will do it. But Members of \nthe Senate will think, oh, if that is what they choose to do, that is \ntheir choice. But we will fight global warming, and we already are. It \nis just that we are not doing it in a way that is beneficial to our \nworking people, our families, and our children.\n  I have to tell you a story. We had yet another hearing in the \nEnvironment Committee on the latest science on global warming. We heard \nwhat we expected to hear--the predictions are getting more and more \ndire. The Republicans invited a witness, and I think the occupant of \nthe chair will remember this. He was a very good witness. But at the \nend of his remarks he lost his way. This is what he said:\n\n       I don't know why everybody is so worried about high levels \n     of CO2. We have had levels that have hit a \n     thousand parts per million before, and everything was just \n     fine.\n\n  I asked him:\n\n       Sir, you are an expert. When was it?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Eighty million years ago.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Who lived then?\n\n  He said:\n\n       The dinosaurs.\n\n  I have to say that is not an answer I am going to give to my \ngrandkids--that in order for them to live in the future, they are going \nto have to become dinosaurs or they won't make it. This is ridiculous.\n  The Senate is the last place to get the message. We are going to do \neverything we can to bring legislation later. I know what the Budget \nCommittee did was a sound decision. They said we are not getting into \nit, but if the committees do act, we will set aside a reserve fund, so \nthey can make sure there will be an order when they do act.\n  I am very happy to say that my House colleagues are working on \nlegislation. The prospects are looking very good over there. We will be \nready to go. But let me say this: The choice is between a livable world \nand one that is not livable. If my colleagues cannot understand this, \nthen I am very sorry. But in any case, we are going to fight global \nwarming. We will do it in the right way.\n  We are going to have an amendment that goes beyond what Senator Thune \nhas done. I am going to tell my colleagues to support the Thune \namendment and the Boxer amendment so that we make sure our consumers \nare kept whole as we move forward with legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be delighted to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might inquire of the Parliamentarian, how much time \nremains on the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 3 minutes 49 seconds. The time \nhas just begun for the opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to Senator Sessions, does he wish to \nuse time in opposition to this amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will yield whatever time the Senator might consume in \nopposition on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we get into this debate----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I can see \nthere is a little consternation. We are yielding off Senator Gregg's \ntime to Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And, Mr. President, how much time is left on the Boxer \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 28\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, I want to repeat the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves. My colleagues are quick to say President Bush \nspent us into bankruptcy, that he did all this reckless spending and \nthat is the problem we have today. President Bush, in my opinion, did \nspend too much money and the debt was too high during his 8 years in \noffice.\n  Last spring, I voted against sending out $160 billion in checks. I \ndidn't think that was a good policy. The Democratic majority here \nsupported that steadfastly, overwhelmingly. Spend, spend, spend is what \nwe have been seeing over there over the years and, in fact, with this \nbig majority they have, and on the budget, Republicans are not able to \ntake the heat, Republicans are not able to say to my colleagues, they \nhave the votes, they can pass whatever budget they want.\n  What I do want to say is that these are some accurate figures about \nthe Bush budget: His worst deficit in 2003 was after 9/11, after he \ninherited an economic slowdown. The tech bubble had burst. When he took \noffice, the day he took office, the Nasdaq had already collapsed and \nlost half its value. We were in a recession. Then we were attacked 9 \nmonths later, and the money got spent. At one point we ended up with a \n$412 billion deficit. We thought it was horrible. But in 3 years, that \ndeficit was reduced until fiscal year 2007, when we had a deficit of \n$161 billion. We worked it down and were heading in the right \ndirection. Then last year he sent out those checks and we had an \neconomic slowdown and both Houses, controlled by the Democrats, voted \noverwhelmingly to spend another $160 billion to stimulate the economy. \nIt didn't work, and we ended up with a $455 billion deficit.\n  In the third year of the Democratic majority in the Congress and in \nthe Presidency of Barack Obama and not all of this money can be traced \nto him, but much of it can--our deficit this year will not be $455 \nbillion. It will not be $800 billion. It will not be $1 trillion. It \nwill not be $1.4 trillion. It will be $1.8 trillion this year. Nothing \nhas ever been seen like this before, ever. Next year, it will be over \n$1 trillion. In the outyears of the President's 10-year budget, it will \nbe increasing the annual deficit $1 trillion. In fact, in the 10th year \nof his budget, according to our own Congressional Budget Office, \nbasically hired by the Democratic majority here, they are scoring the \ndeficit that year to be $1.2 trillion, added to the other. That is why \nthis irrefutable chart shows that the debt goes from $5 trillion to $11 \ntrillion, doubling, and then tripling in 10 years. That is not \nsustainable, as our Budget chairman has said.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleagues are on the floor. I will be \npleased to have a discussion with them about the reconciliation \nprocess. Let me just say this: In a time of economic hardship, when \nfamilies are struggling to pay\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\ntheir bills and businesses are laying off people in order to survive, \nthe last thing we need are major tax increases. Raising taxes hurts the \nfamily budget and kills jobs. Yet the President's budget contains the \nlargest tax increase in American history, $1.5 trillion over the next \n10 years.\n  Again, I note that the deficit is not because we are not increasing \ntaxes. We are increasing taxes. The spending is so great it still \ntriples the debt.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Was the Senator aware that the President's budget \nproposes a new national energy tax that will be paid by every person \nwho turns on a light switch, heats their home, or puts gasoline in \ntheir car?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. Under the President's plan, the \naverage American family will see their energy bills increase up to \n$3,128 each year. Not over 10 years, but each year. That is how much it \nwill go up.\n  In a candid moment when he was still a candidate, President Obama \nadmitted:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electric rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alabama yield for a \nfurther question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield to Senator Thune from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, is the Senator from Alabama aware that the \nPresident's Director of the Office of Management and Budget admitted \nthe same thing last year when he was the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office? Peter Orszag said:\n\n       Under a cap-and-trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the costs . . . but instead would pass them \n     along to their customers in the form of higher prices . . . \n     price increases would be essential to the success of a cap-\n     and-trade program.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Not only did he say that, last Wednesday OMB Director \nOrszag said that jamming a new national energy tax through the Senate \nwith very limited debate and ability to amend under the reconciliation \nis, and I quote--\n\n     not off the table.\n\n  In fact, the House of Representatives is very clear about this plan. \nSection 202 of the House of Representatives budget resolution states:\n\n     reconciliation in the Senate. (Senate reconciliation \n     instructions to be supplied by the Senate.)\n\n  Since the House has a Rules Committee, which allows them to pass \nbills with minimal debate, this is clearly intended, not to affect \ntheir procedures, but to make sure that the conference on the budget \nadds this provision so it can be jammed through the Senate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alabama yield for a \nfurther question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield to Senator Ensign from \nNevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, is the Senator aware of what one of the \nauthors of the Budget Act, the esteemed Senator from West Virginia, has \nto say about this? He said:\n\n       Americans have an inalienable right to a careful \n     examination of proposals that dramatically affect their \n     lives. I was one of the authors of the legislation that \n     created the budget reconciliation process in 1974, and I am \n     certain that putting health care reform and climate change \n     legislation on a freight train through Congress is an outrage \n     that must be resisted.\n\n  Does the Senator agree with this view?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I fully agree, I say to Senator Ensign, \nwith Senator Byrd's view. Senator Byrd wrote this legislation. He also \nwrote the book, literally, on Senate rules. He is our conscience of the \nSenate in terms of the great historic role of the American Senate.\n  Senator Byrd has also said this:\n\n       Using the reconciliation process to enact major legislation \n     prevents an open debate about critical issues in the full \n     view of the public. Health reform and climate change are \n     issues that, in one way or another, touch every American \n     family. Their resolution carries serious economic and \n     emotional consequences. The misuse of the arcane process of \n     reconciliation . . . to enact substantive policy changes is \n     an undemocratic disservice to our people and to the Senate's \n     institutional role.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order in the \nSenate to consider any conference report or House amendment on the \nfiscal year 2010 budget resolution which contains reconciliation \ninstructions for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, what I am concerned about \nis, according to MIT, if we did a cap-and-trade system and we did it \nright, a family of four would get a tax rebate of $4,500. What is \nhappening here is they are trying to make it more difficult for us to \nget a cap-and-trade system, get the revenues, and return $4,500 per \nfamily. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama does still have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to yield for a question. I have another \nrequest to offer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to have the Senator proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to Senator Boxer, we will have \nmore in-depth discussion of the cost of this program, but it is not \nwithout cost. The President and the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget have admitted clearly there will be costs of very \nlarge amounts passed forward to our constituents.\n  No. 2, and since it is such an incredibly monumental, colossal \nintervention and tax on the American economy, it certainly needs more \ndebate than the limited hours that would be given under the budget \nprocess. That is what we were asking, that it be treated in the normal \norder of business and not expedited with a simple majority vote and a \nlimited number of hours of debate. That is what the objection is to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield to the Senator, our chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In the budget resolution that is before us that came out \nof the committee, the committee on which the Senator serves, are there \nany reconciliation instructions for any purpose?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a good question, and I will be pleased to \nanswer our chairman. No, it did not, and I think that was the \nchairman's preference, his stated preference, and other Democrats on \nthe committee did not want this reconciliation language in the Senate \nbudget. But the language is in the House budget.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, has said it is not off the \ntable, as you know, that this might be included in the final conference \npackage. And as you know, since it is in the House language, Senator \nReid will appoint the conferees, a majority of the conferees. And if he \nso says, the language will be in the final package that could come \nbefore the Senate, which terrifies people who believe in the great \nhistoric role of the Senate. That is what our concern is today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could further inquire of my \ncolleague--and I thank him for his response--has not the Speaker of the \nHouse indicated there is no intention of including a reconciliation \ninstruction with respect to climate change in the House provisions?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not aware of that. Maybe some of my colleagues \nmight have heard that, but my understanding is that our leader says it \nmight be included. In fact, he went so far as to say the revenue that \nwould surge into the Treasury from the cap-and-trade could be used to \nfinance health care. So that is a matter that is important to us.\n  If the Senator shares my concern, I find it odd that he would \nobject--or Senator Boxer would object to language in this resolution \ncalling on us not to accept it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I further inquire, Mr. President, of my colleague: \nWouldn't it be logical for me to object if my conclusion is that there \nis not going to be any reconciliation instruction with respect to cap \nand trade?\n  We don't have it in the Senate resolution before us. The Speaker of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nHouse has made clear they are not going to have a reconciliation \ninstruction to be used in the House with respect to climate change \nlegislation. I must say, I understand the concern, but I don't think \nthere is a basis for it. I don't think there is a prospect that there \nis going to be the use of reconciliation for the purpose of climate \nchange resolution coming back from the conference committee. It is not \nin the Senate, the Speaker has made clear they do not intend to use it \non the House side, so I would just say to my colleagues that I \nunderstand the concern, I understand making the point--that is fully \nlegitimate--but I don't think it is a concern that is based on what is \ngoing to happen.\n  There are plans on the House side to use reconciliation for health \ncare and for education. That clearly is part of their resolution. Not \npart of ours; but part of theirs. So I have to say to my colleagues, I \ndon't think there is a basis for concern that the reconciliation \nprocess is going to be used for climate change legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have the floor, and I would be pleased \nto yield for a question from the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is it not true that under the rules of \nreconciliation, an instruction to the House Energy and Commerce \ncommittee that is contemplated for purposes of health care, for \nexample, would not prevent that committee's ability to use the \nreconciliation process for the purposes of climate change legislation \nbecause a reconciliation instruction cannot specifically state which \nmatters within its jurisdiction a committee should address to comply \nwith its reconciliation instruction, which is only a dollar number?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee is correct. Having read the House language on reconciliation, \nit appears to me, quite clearly, that if it is accepted in final \npassage of the bill, after conference, it would give the Senate the \npower to enact cap-and-trade or health care legislation without the \nnormal processes of the Senate.\n  Would the ranking member not agree?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would agree, and I am wondering why we \nwould need reconciliation instructions. I ask the Senator this \nquestion: Why would the House need reconciliation instructions? Do they \nnot have a Rules Committee? Would not the only purpose of \nreconciliation instructions in a House bill be to have a conference \nreport approve a reconciliation instruction, which would tie the hands \nof the Senate? It certainly wouldn't tie the hands of the House, would \nit? In tying the hands of the Senate, it would allow Senate committees \nto reconcile the issue of a cap-and-trade bill and create a carbon \ntax--or a national sales tax--every time somebody turns on a light \nswitch in America; and there would be no way to limit that once there \nis a reconciliation instruction in a conference report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe the Senator is absolutely correct. In other \nwords, the House can pass anything on a simple majority, and Speaker \nPelosi has a pretty good machine over there. They can pass whatever \nthey want to pass. They do not need reconciliation. Why did they put \nreconciliation in their bill? They put it in there because it could be \naccepted in the final conference report and give the power to the \nSenate to use it to deny the historic debate rules of our Senate. \nWouldn't that be a logical conclusion?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Alabama is absolutely right; that \ncould be the only conclusion. Is there any other conclusion that can be \nreached? I don't believe there is. The only purpose of a reconciliation \ninstruction in a House bill is for the purposes of controlling the \nfloor of the Senate--not the floor of the House--and set up the \npossibility of passing it in a conference report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would agree.\n  Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator from Alabama yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the observation that \nwas made about the purpose of reconciliation and the Rules Committee in \nthe House. The House very clearly has the power to regulate what comes \nto the floor and what amendments are made in order. Reconciliation \ninstructions in the House bill are clearly directed at a House-Senate \nconference and reserving the opportunity--the option--to actually do \nsomething with respect to these other issues.\n  I wish to point out, too--and I wish to ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Alabama regarding the conference committee--even though I believe \nthe best intentions of the Senator from North Dakota and I believe he \nis sincere when he says he doesn't want to use reconciliation to do cap \nand trade and to do other types of policy through the budget process--\nthere is a statement from the majority leader talking about the novel \nproposal for redoing the Nation's health care system, suggesting that \nusing $646 billion that would be collected under a controversial Obama \nproposal to auction off greenhouse gas pollution allowances. The exact \nquote is: ``That's exactly how much we need for the first phase of \nhealth care reform.''\n  My question to my colleague from Alabama is: If, in fact, you get \ninto a conference setting and you want to do health care reform--which \nclearly they have indicated they would like to do through \nreconciliation--it has to be paid for somehow, does it not? It is \nsuggested here, I think from at least the majority leader, that the \nrevenues available through cap and trade might, in fact, be used for \nthat.\n  Would it not be possible in a conference committee setting--despite \nthe best intentions of the Senator from North Dakota--for the members \nof that conference to decide to use that reconciliation process to \ncreate revenues through a cap-and-trade program that might be used to \naccomplish the financing of health care reform through that bill?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree with my colleague, Senator Thune.\n  Look, we are all grownups here. We know how the Senate works. We know \nhow things are handled. We offered an amendment to put E-Verify in the \nstimulus bill in order to check the citizenship of people before they \nget jobs under the stimulus package. It was in the House bill, but we \nwere not able not to have a vote in the Senate. The majority party knew \nexactly what they intended to do. When it went to conference, they took \nout the language, but everybody in the House could say they voted for \nit.\n  This is the same kind of situation. The language is now in the House \nbill, which they do not need. They do not need that language to pass \nanything in the House. But if it were to be accepted by the Senate, and \nSenator Reid has indicated he might do that, if they accept it in \nconference, then cap-and-trade or health care reform could be passed \nwithout the classical historic debate this Senate is used to having. \nThat is why our conscience of the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd, has said \nthis is bad, it should not happen, and it demeans the Senate. He used \nvery clear language.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to retain the floor, I yield to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed; and that no intervening amendments be \nin order to any of the amendments covered in this agreement; that prior \nto each vote, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled in the following form; that after the first vote in this \nsequence, the vote time be limited to 10 minutes each; and that all \ntime utilized during the votes count against the time on the budget \nresolution: Boxer No. 749, Thune No. 731, and Gregg No. 739.\n  Those are the three amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to my friend from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know this is a big deal--a very, \nvery, very big deal that we are discussing. If my friend, Senator \nConrad, is correct, and he didn't put it in his committee\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nreport, when we try to make it a clear statement that the Senate would \nnot accept this language if it came out of conference, why would \nSenator Boxer object? We have seen these maneuvers before.\n  Without this language, we would be in a position in which the \nleadership of the Senate could move forward with legislation that would \nuse reconciliation to pass other bills. So I would make another \nunanimous consent request, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order in the Senate to \nconsider any conference report or House amendment on the fiscal year \n2010 budget resolution which reconciles any of the following Senate \ncommittees: The Committee on Environment and Public Works, the \nCommittee on Finance, and the Committee on Energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. It is hard for me to \nbelieve that three or four Senators come to the floor to try to control \nthe agenda of the various committees, which we are very proud to serve \non.\n  I also wish to say that 19 times since 1980 has reconciliation been \nused, and by far and away more times by the Republicans--namely, 13 \ntimes they used it. They never came here and complained. They used it. \nI have the record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe number of times Republicans have used reconciliation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Reconciliation Measures Enacted Into Law, 1980 to the Present\n\n\n                 1. Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980\n\n     P.L. 96-499 (December 5, 1980)\n       This act, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, was \n     the first reconciliation bill to pass the House and Senate. \n     It was estimated to reduce the FY 1981 deficit by $8.276 \n     billion, including $4.631 billion in outlay reductions and \n     $3.645 billion in revenue increases.\n       Major spending changes affected such areas as child \n     nutrition subsidies; interest rates for student loans; ``look \n     back'' COLA benefit provisions for retiring federal \n     employees; highway obligational authority; railroad \n     rehabilitation, airport development, planning, and noise \n     control grants; veterans' burial allowances; disaster loans; \n     Medicare and Medicaid; unemployment compensation; and Social \n     Security.\n       Major revenue changes affected such areas as mortgage \n     subsidy bonds; payment of estimated corporate taxes; capital \n     gains on foreign real estate investments; payroll taxes paid \n     by employers; telephone excise taxes; and the alcohol import \n     duty.\n       [1980 Congressional Quarterly Almanac, pp. 124-130]\n\n\n              2. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981\n\n     P.L. 97-35 (August 13, 1981)\n       President Ronald Reagan used this act, along with a non-\n     reconciliation bill, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 \n     (P.L. 97-34), to advance much of his agenda in his first year \n     in office. OBRA of 1981 was estimated to reduce the deficit \n     by $130.6 billion over three years, covering FY1982-FY1984.\n       Major spending changes affected such areas as health \n     program block grants; Medicaid; television and radio \n     licenses; Food Stamps; dairy price supports; energy \n     assistance; Conrail; education program block grants; Impact \n     Aid and the Title I compensatory education program for \n     disadvantaged children; student loans; and the Social \n     Security minimum benefit.\n       [1981 Congressional Quarterly Almanac, pp. 256-266]\n\n\n          3.

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982\n\n     P.L. 97-253 (September 8, 1982)\n       This act, the second of two reconciliation measures signed \n     by President Reagan in 1982, was estimated to reduce outlays \n     by $13.3 billion over three years, covering FY1983-FY1985.\n       Major spending changes affected such areas as payments to \n     farmers, dairy price supports, Food Stamps, inflation \n     adjustments for federal retirees, lump-sum premiums for FHA \n     housing insurance, user fees on Veterans Administration-\n     backed home loans, veterans' compensation and benefits, and \n     reduction in the membership of the Federal.

Mr. President, that clearly states where we are headed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Alabama this: \nThe Senator from California has correctly stated that reconciliation \nhas been used often in this body before. It was used by President \nClinton, since I have been here. It was used by President Bush. I voted \nfor most of the different reconciliation bills. But is it not true that \nreconciliation, when it has been used before--even though used for \nsignificant events--has always been used for already existing policy; \nwhether it is changing the rates of taxes, whether it is changing the \nway the welfare system was adjusted relative to who was covered or \nwhether it was changing the way we deal with student loans?\n  It was always used on existing policy that had been pretty well aired \non the floor of the Senate. It has never been used for the purpose of \ncreating, ab initio, a brand new major tax, which would essentially tax \nevery American every time they turn on their light switch--a national \nsales tax--which would introduce industrial policy and which would \naffect virtually every American as to their jobs--sending many of them \noverseas--and as to the ability to be competitive. Has it ever been \nused for such a broad, extensive public policy event of creating \nmassive new taxes that don't exist today--a national sales tax--and \nmassive new industrial policy?\n  It would mean that policy and those taxes would come across this \nfloor without amendment, with 20 hours of debate, and an up-or-down \nvote. Has it ever been used in that context in the Senate?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No. In fact, few pieces of legislation this Senate has \never considered will have as much broad-based complexity and impact on \nour economy as a cap-and-trade system, period. That is why Senator \nByrd, the conscience of the rules of the Senate, said:\n\n       Using the reconciliation process to enact major legislation \n     prevents an open debate about the critical issues in full \n     view of the public. Health reform and climate change are \n     issues that in one way or another touch every American \n     family. Their resolution carries serious economic and \n     emotional consequences. The misuse of the arcane process of \n     reconciliation . . . to enact substantive policy change is an \n     undemocratic disservice to our people and to the Senate's \n     institutional role.\n\n  That is what Senator Byrd, the Democratic Senator who wrote the \nreconciliation bill and who has written a book on the rules of the \nSenate, has stated.\n  Mr. President, I have one more unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that it shall not be in order to consider any \nreconciliation bill in the Senate that raises energy prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the problem with this--and I could support \nit if it were made clearer--is it doesn't take into account that we \ncould have some very important new programs that actually result in \nconsumers getting rebate checks. So you may have an increase \ntemporarily, before we get free of foreign oil, in an energy cost that \nis totally offset by a refund and a rebate. So this would hamper the \ncommittees from doing what MIT says we should do, which is, when we do \ntackle this issue of energy independence, make sure we have the \nrevenues to rebate funds back to the American people.\n  I do not want to block the possibility of that so I am going to \nobject in a moment. But I have to respond to Senator Gregg. This is the \nfirst time I saw the Reagan revolution be so downplayed by my \nRepublican friends. ``Oh, nothing new was done by reconciliation.''\n  It was the Reagan revolution. It was Bill Clinton changing welfare as \nwe know it. I have it all here. So let's not say now, oh, the 13 times \nthe Republicans supported reconciliation it wasn't anything major; it \nwas little minor things.\n  The record is replete with what reconciliation did. Why are they so \nafraid of reconciliation? They embraced it time after time. Don't be so \nfearful of the rules of the Senate. Reconciliation is a rule allowed by \nthe Senate. Let's not say we could never do it again, never look at it \nagain. It doesn't make any sense.\n  I am going to object to this because I think in the end it could cost \nconsumers more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The time of the opposition \nhas expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The time on both sides has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes is remaining under Senator Boxer's \ntime on Senator Boxer's amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I must say when the assertion is made reconciliation has \nnot been used for significant things in the past, that is not so. \nWelfare reform----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I am going to complete my thought and then I will be \nhappy to yield. Welfare reform was not a significant policy change? \nAbsolutely it was. That was during the Clinton administration.\n  The tax changes that were made during the Bush administration were \nmade under reconciliation. That to me was an absolute, total abuse of \nreconciliation. Reconciliation was designed for deficit reduction. The \nplace where I would agree with the Senator is, I don't believe \nreconciliation was ever intended to write major substantive \nlegislation. But to suggest that has not been done in the past is not \nso.\n  Our Republican friends were leading the way in abusing what \nreconciliation is about. That is a fact. To suggest it has not been \nused for major changes is not so.\n  I want to say something else. I have said repeatedly, publicly and \nprivately, that I do not think reconciliation is the appropriate way to \ndo climate change legislation or to do health care reform or other \nmajor substantive legislation if it is not deficit reduction. That is \nthe position I have taken.\n  The fact is, in this resolution before us, there is no use of \nreconciliation for any purpose. I want the public to be very clear. In \nthis resolution there is no reconciliation instruction for any purpose.\n  In the House, the Speaker has made very clear reconciliation would \nnot be used for climate change legislation.\n  Is it technically possible in conference that there could be an \ninstruction that would allow cap-and-trade revenue? Yes, it is. It is \npossible. But let me say again, there is no reconciliation instruction \nin the Senate budget resolution. I have argued against it for the \npurposes that have been talked about and I have argued against it \npublicly and privately.\n  On the House side, with respect to climate change, the Speaker has \nsaid reconciliation would not be used for climate change legislation. I \ntake the Speaker at her word. In the conference committee I will say to \nmy colleagues: I will strongly resist--strongly resist--any attempt to \nreport out of the conference committee a reconciliation instruction for \nthe purpose of climate change legislation. I don't know how I could be \nmore clear on that point.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I appreciate the Senator arguing for \nour case, which is that we should not use reconciliation in the Senate \nfor the purposes of pursuing a vehicle such as a massive new sales tax \non all Americans on their electric bills, and specifically whenever \nthey turn on their light switch they are going to get hit with this \ntax. I would point out as an aside, he may have misrepresented what I \nsaid. I didn't say we hadn't used it for significant things; we have \nused it for significant things. But we have never used it for creating, \nab initio, a national sales tax or any tax, for that matter, ab initio, \nand that is where the rubber meets the road.\n  I do believe strongly, listening to the Senator, that he has \nbasically admitted a conference report could carry in it reconciliation \ninstructions which\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nwould allow for reconciliation to be used to create a new national \nsales tax on everybody's electric bill. So it seems perfectly \nreasonable that what the Senator from Alabama has requested should be \nagreed to here. Because he essentially is asking for what the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has suggested he supports, which is that \nreconciliation will not be used that way after the Senator from North \nDakota has said the reconciliation may be able to be used that way.\n  There is no reason for the House of Representatives to put \nreconciliation in their bill. It is a touch cynical for the other side \nto represent that, because the bill before us today doesn't have \nreconciliation in it, that reconciliation is not being considered as a \nvehicle before this body because the only reason the House of \nRepresentatives has put reconciliation in their vehicle--because they \ndon't need it, they have a Rules Committee--is because they can bring \nit out of conference and stick it to the Senate and put it into the \nSenate procedure here.\n  It means, on a purely procedural event, that the House of \nRepresentatives is actually going to be controlling the floor of the \nSenate. How outrageous is that? But independent of that there is a \nprocedural point--which affronts me as a Senator and I think would \naffront the tradition and history of the Senate--there is the more \nsubstantive issue that reconciliation should never be used to create a \nbrand new national sales tax. And that, of course, is what the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has said is true, it should not be used in that way.\n  So why do they object to the fairly benign request here of the \nSenator from Alabama, which is to ask unanimous consent that we not use \nreconciliation on the floor of the Senate for the purposes of creating \na national sales tax, or what is euphemistically called a carbon tax? I \ndon't understand the opposition myself. It seems very strange. Under \nthe bill----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The unanimous consent request would be in harmony with \nthe budget resolution that came out of committee and in harmony with \nSenator Conrad's expressed personal views, would it not?\n  Mr. GREGG. It seems as though the Senator from Alabama is expressing \nthrough his unanimous consent request the exact thought process of the \nchairman of the committee as stated here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Thune wishes to speak off the bill. I \nsee the assistant leader is here. I wish to sort of line up time so \neverybody gets time before we go into adjournment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Six minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might ask the Chair how much time do we have before \nwe break?\n  Mr. GREGG. We can go until you finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is scheduled to recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to change that. How much time does \nthe Senator need?\n  Mr. THUNE. If I could have 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the Senate continue to debate this \nissue under the bill until 12:40, and that the 10 minutes from 12:30 to \n12:40 be allocated to the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and the time from now until 12:30 be for the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, do I not control the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield my time off the bill to the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There was a unanimous consent. Mr. President, \nparliamentary inquiry: There was a unanimous consent request that was \nobjected to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have the right, do I not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. In terms of division of time. Look, we can sort this out.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let's sort it out. That is a better approach.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's do it amicably so we sort it out. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time from 12:35 to 12:40--no--12:25 to 12:30 be for \nSenator Durbin. Then we come back to this side. How much time did \nSenator Thune ask for?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to the Senator from North Dakota that the Senator \nfrom California has offered a side-by-side amendment to the amendment I \nlaid down yesterday. She spoke to that this morning. I wish to at least \nmake some remarks with regard to my amendment. So 5 or 10 minutes would \nbe what I would need to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be acceptable to the Senator to go from 12:30 to \n12:35 or 12:36?\n  Mr. THUNE. That would be fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And then would Senator Boxer like to have time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. About 3 minutes, if I could.\n  Mr. CONRAD. From 12:36 to 12:39. Then to come back to Senator Inhofe? \nWould the Senator like time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like the same time my chairman has. I am ranking \nmember on the committee and I have some specific thoughts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We could go from 12:39 to 12:42 with Senator Inhofe. \nWould that be acceptable? I ask unanimous consent: Senator Durbin from \n12:25 to 12:30; Senator Thune from 12:30 to 12:36; Senator Boxer 12:36 \nto 12:39; Senator Inhofe from 12:39 to 12:42.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, your \nwonderful construction here has eaten into the 5 minutes. I think there \nis 3 minutes left.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Five minutes----\n  Mr. GREGG. Give 5 minutes to everybody in sequence until they finish.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Five minutes for each Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I may be expressing a minority point of \nview, but I want to express it on the floor of the Senate. I happen to \ndisagree with both sides on this. Do you think climate change is a \nproblem? Do you think global warming is changing the planet we live on? \nDo you think there is a chance when our kids, 20 or 30 years from now, \ntake a look at it, they are going to say: Where were you, Senator, in \n2009, when you had a chance to do something about it, when you had a \nchance to try to take control of the mess that is being created in this \nenvironment? What happened to you that day, Senator?\n  Some Senators will be able to say: Oh, I was embroiled in a \nprocedural fight on the floor of the Senate where we used words such as \nreconciliation and conference instructions, and at the end of the day \nwe did nothing. Nothing--the same thing that has been done over and \nover again when we tackled big issues on the floor of the Senate. We \nfind a way to twist ourselves in knots, we throw up scare tactics of \nsales taxes that are going to be unmanageable, and guess what. Another \nyear under our belt, we will come back and see you next year, we will \nhave another debate. In the meantime all of these Senators will be \ngoing to schoolchildren and people around America saying: We have to do \nsomething about global warming. We have to do something about climate \nchange. I wish the Senate had the will. That is what this talk was all \nabout.\n  These Republican Senators came to the floor, objecting to using a \nprocedure that would bring us to a debate on global warming. They don't \nwant to talk about it because there are a lot of people who will have \nto come up to the counter and be honest about whether we have a problem \nnot just in this Nation but in this world. They don't want to face it \nhonestly. They want to ignore it, and they want to scare the living \nblazes out of the people across America about the possibilities: We \ncould have a national sales tax here and a tax here and a tax there. \nThat is how you inject fear into the debate. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  I think it is sad. Were we elected to do this, to find another excuse \nfor another year to go by with doing nothing for my grandson, for kids \nacross America and around the world, that this Nation will do nothing? \nLast November 4 we had an election and a big change in this town, and a \nmajority of the American people said they are tired of a\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nCongress that does nothing. They want us to tackle health care. They \nwant us to tackle energy issues. They want us to face global warming. \nThey want us to create schools for the 21st century.\n  There is always an excuse: Maybe we can get to it later in the year, \nmaybe next year, maybe after the next election.\n  That is what this was all about. It is whether we are going to \nhonestly address this issue. The budget resolution before the Senate \ndoesn't take us to that debate. That has been pretty clearly stated. \nBut we could get to that debate, if the House says they want us to, \nthrough what is called reconciliation. But we saw these Republican \nSenators, many of whom think they are green and environmentally \nsensitive, stand up and try to put every blockade in the road to stop \nus from debating and passing legislation to deal with climate change \nand global warming. Shame on the Senate. Shame on the Senate for \nfinding some reason, some excuse not to tackle this tough issue.\n  Will it be easy? Will it be popular? No way. It is going to be hard. \nBut isn't that why we were elected, on both sides of the aisle, to face \nthese hard and difficult issues? Somebody may lose an election over it, \nbut isn't that what the democratic process is all about?\n  Republican Senators who got up, one after another, objecting to \nconsidering global warming as an issue under reconciliation, know that \nlessens the chances that any bill is going to be passed. They know this \nissue will be kicked down the road for the next year, for the next \nCongress, for the next generation. Can America afford to wait? Can this \nworld afford to wait? Can't we see the ominous elements coming at us \nunder the circumstances, the change in climate, the change in global \nwarming that is bringing to this planet?\n  We know the reality. Unfortunately, we are going to ignore it today. \nBut we better face it. We better face it, if we want to face our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inouye.) The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that when we return at 2:15, after \nSenators who have the right to speak have completed their statements, \nthe time between 2:15 and 2:30 be divided between the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 731\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to speak to an amendment I \nlaid down yesterday on which there has been a side-by-side amendment \noffered by the Senator from California. In response to the comments of \nmy colleague from Illinois, there aren't any Republicans who aren't \nprepared to debate the issue of climate change or energy policy. We \njust think it ought to be debated in regular order; that when the \nSenate does take on big consequential items such as this, it ought to \nbe handled in the normal routine, in the way the Senate deals with big \nconsequential issues such as the issue of climate change because it \nwould have a profound impact on the American economy and on American \nhouseholds and families.\n  There isn't any resistance on this side to that. All we are saying \nis, it should not be used as a part of the budget process where you \nexpedite this and sort of circumvent the normal rules and procedures of \nthe Senate that would apply to big pieces of legislation. We want to \ndebate that.\n  Frankly, there are lots of Republicans who are happy to have the \ndebate on climate change, on cap and trade, but also want to make a \npart of the debate the cost. It is very easy to talk about throwing out \ndifferent solutions to this issue or talking about the general issue of \nclimate change, but when you start reducing the argument on cap and \ntrade, it has profound economic consequences on the American economy. \nThat is a part of the debate.\n  If we look at the question of whether climate change is occurring, if \none answers that yes, and if human activity is contributing to it, and \none answers that yes, we still have to get to the question, if those \ntwo points are true: What do we do about it and at what cost? We think \nthat ought to be part of the debate.\n  The Senator from California has offered a side-by-side amendment to \nmine. I assume she concedes the point that it would increase \nelectricity and gasoline prices. She adds to that the language ``or \nincreasing the overall burden on consumers through the use of revenues \nand policies provided in such legislation,'' suggesting there would be \nsome offsets that families who are affected by higher energy costs \nwould benefit from.\n  If there are going to be additional revenues, they are coming from \nsomewhere. This isn't an imaginary world. This stuff just doesn't \nappear. We are talking about real costs, real revenues.\n  I want to point out what the President himself said over a year ago \nabout his cap-and-trade plan:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  We cannot assume for a minute that there are not going to be enormous \ncosts associated with the proposal of the Senator from California and \nthe cap-and-trade proposal she put forward in the last Congress, of \nwhich the President was a cosponsor.\n  She referred earlier to MIT. Researchers there scored it at $366 \nbillion a year or a cost of $3,128 to the average household. This has \nan economic cost. It has an impact on our broader economy, an impact \nspecifically on American families and households and American small \nbusinesses.\n  I used data yesterday I had received from utility companies in my \nState about how this would affect their cost of doing business with \nregard to residential customers, small business customers, and large \nindustrial users. We would see costs go up as much as 65 percent in \nsome cases.\n  They used a typical school district. It would on an annual basis \ndouble their cost for electricity. These things have costs. That needs \nto be part of the debate because the American people deserve to know \nthese things have costs.\n  We need to have a debate about climate change, but we ought to do it \nin a way that is in regular order, that allows committees to do their \nwork and that contemplates what the costs and consequences of these \npolicies are going to entail for the average person.\n  This is an amendment provided to give something for the Senator from \nCalifornia and Members on the other side to vote for. The fact is, a \ncap-and-trade policy will increase electricity and gasoline prices. \nNobody disputes that. The question is how much. I happen to believe--as \ndo many others--that the President understates it in his budget, $646 \nbillion in revenue. There are those who believe it would be two or \nthree times that amount. The President himself has said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  His OMB Director, Peter Orszag, has said this would all be passed on \nto consumers. Utility companies will not bear the cost. Corporate \nAmerica will not. It will be passed on to customers in places such as \nSouth Dakota where a higher energy cost is the thing they can least \nafford these days when we have a bad economy to start with.\n  I hope when Senators come to vote on these amendments, they will bear \nin mind these votes have consequences. If they vote against my \namendment, they are essentially saying that we are open to, and OK \nwith, a reserve fund created under the budget, a climate change reserve \nfund that would lead to a lot higher electricity and gasoline prices. \nAll my amendment says is, those gas and electricity prices cannot go up \nunder a cap-and-trade proposal that might be adopted by the Congress \nand might be included in some reconciliation instruction that comes \nfrom a conference committee with the House.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State your inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. There was some confusion with the last unanimous consent \nrequest. I know I get 3 minutes. I ask the Chair, is that correct, and \nwhen will that happen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased to have these 5 minutes to \ncorrect the record. First, Senator Gregg takes the floor and says he \nopposes a national sales tax; that is what cap and\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\ntrade is. I defy Senator Gregg to show me where there is a national \nsales tax.\n  This is what is so interesting. A cap-and-trade system was invented \nin America to fight acid rain. It has been one of the most successful \nprograms. For acid rain, we used the cap-and-trade system, and it has \nworked. By the way, it has worked in the State of Senator Gregg.\n  The other thing I want to put in the record is, Senator Gregg made a \nstatement to my committee in January 2007. He said:\n\n       I believe Congress must take action to limit the emissions \n     of greenhouse gases from a variety of sources. The \n     overwhelming scientific data and other evidence about climate \n     change cannot be ignored. It is for this reason I have been a \n     strong advocate for mandatory limits on greenhouse gases.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Full Committee: ``Senators' Perspectives on Global Warming''\n\n  (By Senator Judd Gregg (submitted written testimony, Jan. 30, 2007))\n\n       Climate change is one of the most serious environmental \n     problems facing our planet. It touches nearly everything we \n     do. Our climate is inextricably linked to our economy and \n     heritage of our nation. Climate change affects where we live, \n     where our food is grown, the severity and frequency of storms \n     and disease, and many of our industries, including tourism, \n     forestry, and agriculture. In New Hampshire, folks are \n     already concerned with its impact on skiing, forestry, maple \n     production, tourism, and outdoor recreation. In fact, the \n     state was the first in the nation to pass a law in 2002 \n     requiring carbon dioxide emissions reductions from power \n     plants. Today, approximately 50 towns in New Hampshire are \n     poised to vote in March on a resolution seeking the \n     establishment of a national greenhouse gas reduction program \n     and additional research into sustainable energy technologies.\n       States alone can not solve this problem. I believe Congress \n     must take action to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from a variety of sources. The overwhelming scientific data \n     and other evidence about climate change cannot be ignored. It \n     is for this reason that I have been a strong advocate for \n     mandatory limits on greenhouse gases, and I will continue \n     working with my Senate colleagues on legislation.\n       For the last four years, I have worked with Senators Carper \n     and Alexander and others, on legislation which would reduce \n     carbon dioxide and other emissions from power plants. The \n     Clean Air Planning Act, which I have cosponsored, would \n     address our nation's critical air pollution problems in a way \n     that curbs greenhouse gas emissions, enhances air quality, \n     protects human health, and facilitates a growing economy. \n     This legislation reduces the four primary emissions from \n     power plants: sulfur dioxide (a contributing factor in lung \n     and heart disease) by 80 percent; nitrogen oxide (associated \n     with acid rain and regional haze) by 69 percent; mercury \n     emissions (associated with fish contamination and birth \n     defects) by 80 percent; and carbon dioxide emissions (linked \n     to climate change) by establishing mandatory caps. This bill \n     would protect the quality of air we breathe and the climate \n     we live in, while simultaneously stimulating the economy and \n     protecting human health. I hope to reintroduce this bill with \n     my colleagues in the coming weeks.\n       However, power plants are just part of the solution. That \n     is why I have supported economy-wide, market-based \n     approaches, such as the Climate Stewardship Act's ``cap and \n     trade'' system, as reasonable ways to rein in carbon dioxide \n     without undue harm to the U.S. economy. I also believe we \n     need to re-examine the issue of vehicle emissions, a \n     substantial contributor to the global carbon budget, and \n     consider increasing the corporate average fuel economy \n     standards for motor vehicles.\n       I appreciate the Committee's attention to this issue and I \n     look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \n     the aisle to draft climate change legislation which protects \n     our environment and stimulates our economy.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now he is here trying to do everything he can to block us \nfrom taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Then we have Senator Thune arguing that we are going to see taxpayers \ntake a huge hit, consumers take a huge hit, if we pass global warming \nlegislation. Where was Senator Thune when gasoline prices in my State \nreached almost $5 a gallon? That wasn't because there was cap and \ntrade. We had no cap and trade. What happened? We saw gas prices go \nfrom $1.50 to $5. We saw the biggest increase in history under George \nBush as President on gas prices.\n  Was it about cap and trade? Obviously not. We had no cap and trade. \nIt was speculation in the market. Where was my friend Senator Thune \nwith all kinds of amendments? He wasn't here. Where was my friend \nSenator Thune and my friends on the Republican side when Enron was \nspeculating and price fixing and saying they didn't care if old ladies \nwent broke? Nowhere. That had nothing to do with cap and trade.\n  I am going to list some of the corporations that support a cap-and-\ntrade system: Alcoa, BP America, Caterpillar, Chrysler, Conoco, Deere, \nDow, Duke Energy, DuPont, Ford Motors, General Electric, Johnson & \nJohnson, PepisoCo, and so on. Even Shell Oil understands if we want to \nhave a future, we better stand up and be counted.\n  Here is the point: My colleagues are doing everything they can to \nnarrow our options on how we deal with climate change. As chairman of \nthe Environment Committee, I want all the options at my fingertips. If \ncolleagues don't want to do it, I understand it because, guess what. \nGame over. We are already fighting back. EPA is getting ready because \nthe Supreme Court told them they had to make sure greenhouse gas \nemissions were reduced under the Clean Air Act. They were sued. The \nBush administration said: No, greenhouse gases aren't covered under the \nClean Air Act. Wrong. So the EPA is off and running. They have to be or \nthey will be sued again. They are already working to see that \ngreenhouse gas emissions are reduced.\n  Are States? A majority of States are involved. A lot of States have \ntheir own cap-and-trade system. The Northeast corridor, the west coast, \nthey are working with Canada, Europe, and everybody else.\n  If my Republican friends want to put their head in the sand and have \nthe Senate be the only place in the world that isn't taking action on \nglobal warming, be my guest. The train has left the station. The EPA is \ndoing its work. California and 19 other States are working to get a \nwaiver so they can cut back on greenhouse gases in terms of motor \nvehicles. In New England, they have their own cap-and-trade system. The \nMidwest is working with Canada.\n  If my friends want to stand around and listen to the minority witness \nwho said: Don't worry about it. There were times in history when carbon \nwas 1,000 parts per million, and everything was fine. But when we \npressed him, he admitted the only life on Earth then was dinosaurs. I \nknew the people who are against this were looking backward, but I \ndidn't realize they were going back that many years when only dinosaurs \nroamed the Earth.\n  I will fight hard to keep all our options on the table. We are \nfighting back, and we will eventually be victorious because mankind is \ndepending on us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the fact that I \nwill have 5 minutes. However, I have to say, after listening to my \ncounterpart, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I have rewritten my speech.\n  First of all, let me make a couple comments about her comments. When \ngasoline was $5 a gallon, or approaching that, out in California, there \nwas a reason for that, a reasonable justification at that time. It is \nthat old thing most of us who are in earshot right now learned years \nago; it is called supply and demand. Our problem is, the Democrats have \nrestricted our ability to exploit our own natural resources. We have a \nmoratorium on offshore drilling to make it more and more difficult. So \nas they restrict our ability to produce oil and gas, obviously, it is a \nsupply and demand thing, and the demand is going to go up and the price \nis going to go up. It is a very simple principle.\n  I think it is also interesting to talk a little bit about the cap-\nand-trade thing. We keep hearing that for acid rain, cap and trade \nworked. For acid rain, there were two differences. First of all, there \nwas a technology that was workable at that time. We had a technology \nthat said: We know how we can restrict it. Of course, there is no \ntechnology in terms of greenhouse gases in using cap and trade. The \nsecond thing is, in the acid rain situation, there were about \napproximately, at most, 1,000 sources. Here, there are literally \nmillions of sources. So there is no way we can actually get involved in \nthis and understand just how many sources there are out there. It would \nbe life-\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\nchanging for virtually everyone in our country.\n  The third thing, when the Senator from California was talking about \nthe national sales tax, that it is not a national sales tax, we hang \naround Washington so long that we lose sight of the fact that if you \nare a poor person out there and you are spending half of your \nexpendable income on driving your car and heating your home, and all of \na sudden they double the cost of that, that is a tax increase; when you \nincrease the cost of energy in America, it is not only an increase in a \ntax, but it is also regressive because those who have the least income \nare going to be spending a greater amount of their income on the \npurchase of energy.\n  The Senator from Illinois talked about global warming and all this \nand about the science. I will not get into the science thing because \neven though the science is mixed on this, even though there are quite a \nnumber of scientists who say there is not that relationship, that \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, are not the major cause \nof global warming--or if global warming really exists--explain that to \nthe people in Oklahoma. We had the largest snowstorm in the history of \nMarch 3 days ago. But nonetheless, we will go ahead and say: Well, for \nthe sake of the debate on global warming, we could concede the science, \neven though the science is not there. The reason we can do that is we \nwant people not to be distracted from the economics of this thing, what \nit really costs. This is one of the problems I have now.\n  The administration has talked about all the expenditures that are \ngoing on. We talked about the $700 billion bailout. We talked about the \n$787 billion stimulus plan. One thing about that is those are one-shot \ndeals. The problem with this is, once you impose this cap-and-trade tax \non the American people, this is every year. This is something that is \nnot going to be just one time. I can remember arguing against the $700 \nbillion bailout. I said: If you take the number of families who file a \ntax return and do your math, it comes to $5,000 a family. That is huge. \nBut at least it is only once. This would be, as the Senator from South \nDakota said, $3,000 a family every year. That is what we are talking \nabout now.\n  When the administration came out and said it was $646 billion, that \nis probably understated about 1 to 4. The amount of money we know it is \ngoing to be in terms of all the studying that has taken place is around \n$6.7 trillion between now and 2050--$6.7 trillion. We had the other two \nbills up--when we had the McCain-Lieberman bill, that range was \nsomewhere around $300 billion a year. When we had the Lieberman-Warner \nbill, that was a little bit more. When we had the Sanders-Boxer bill, \nthat was about $366 billion a year. So the price tag goes up and up.\n  If we were to allow this to happen, this would be the largest single \ntax increase in the history of America. We cannot let that happen \nwithout going through the procedures, the normal procedures the Senate \nhas provided.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The time until 2:30 is equally divided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to my friend if he would like to, and \nthen I will close the debate.\n  Mr. THUNE. How much time do we have equally divided right now?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Six minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 30 seconds.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are going to have a vote in just a few \nminutes on an amendment I offered yesterday, and now there is a side-\nby-side offered by the Senator from California which tries to modify my \namendment in a way that gives folks who want to be able to vote for \nsomething, something to vote for when, in fact, my amendment is the one \nthat is very simple and straightforward. That is, if we have a reserve \nfund created for climate change, the revenues coming into that fund \nobviously are going to be significant: $646 billion, if the President's \nbudget is accurate, and much more than that by many other analyses that \nhave been done. It simply says that cannot be used to increase \nelectricity rates or gasoline taxes on the American consumer.\n  So what I would hope that my colleagues will bear in mind when we \nvote is that any cap-and-trade system that is put in place is going to \nhave a significant increase in energy costs in this country. You can \ncall it what you want--a lightbulb tax, a national energy tax--but it \nis pretty clear that is going to be the case. The President, a year \nago, even made the same argument: ``Under my plan of a cap-and-trade \nsystem, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' That is a \ndirect quote.\n  All of the studies that have been done have suggested that this could \ncost anywhere from, as CBO said, $50 billion a year to $300 billion a \nyear; MIT said $366 billion a year. An enormous amount of money is \ngoing to come into the Federal Treasury by any form of cap-and-trade \nbill that is passed here in the Congress. It just depends on how rigid \nor how restrictive the caps are as to what that cost is going to be, \nand there are several other bills that are out there.\n  What I wish to point out, however, is that the Senator from \nCalifornia--her bill, S. 309 from the last session of Congress, \nactually designates seven different funds that the revenue would go \ninto. What her amendment would say is that a lot of these revenues \nwould go back in the form of some assistance to consumers in this \ncountry, but, in fact, if you look at her legislation, there are seven \ndifferent funds that it goes into. Essentially, what her bill would do \nis take all of these revenues that are going to come into the Federal \nTreasury and distribute them through Government agencies to all of \nthese different areas, including the climate change worker training \nfund; the adaptation fund, whatever that is; the climate change and \nnational security fund; the Bureau of Land Management emergency \nfirefighting fund; the Forest Service emergency firefighting fund; and \nthe Climate Security Act management fund. Those are six of the funds \nthat are listed in her bill as uses of revenues that would be derived \nfrom a cap-and-trade and national energy tax that would be imposed upon \nthe American consumers. Again, I point out that MIT, in their analysis \nof her bill, said it would cost the average household in this country \nan additional $3,128 annually in energy costs.\n  The President himself has said: ``Under my plan of a cap-and-trade \nsystem, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' Nobody \ndisputes the fact that rates are going to go up. What we are saying is \nthat shouldn't happen; we can't do that, particularly now at a time \nwhen the American economy is struggling and most Americans are having \nto tighten their belts already. To impose a huge national energy sales \ntax on American consumers would be very ill-timed.\n  Frankly, I don't believe for a minute that any of the revenues that \ncome in as a result of the imposition of that national energy tax are \ngoing to be used to refund the American consumers. There is a $400 and \n$800 tax credit the President has put in place, but that is a \nfraction--a fraction--of the amount of the revenue that is going to \ncome in.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support my amendment and vote against \nthe side-by-side that is being offered by my\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\ncolleague from California. I don't think there is any question but this \nis going to raise taxes, energy taxes in the form of a national sales \ntax on energy for consumers in this country. My amendment would make it \nvery clear that cannot be the case.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Thune makes it sound as if a cap-\nand-trade regime that we hope we will be able to put in place to fight \nglobal warming is going to be bad for the economy. The fact is, we have \nhundreds and hundreds of business leaders and union members, working \npeople, the Conference of Mayors, and Governors of both parties \nstrongly supporting global warming legislation because it will create \nmillions of green jobs.\n  My friend argues it will raise prices on consumers, and he cites \nBarack Obama's comments taken out of context because here is the thing: \nWe all know there will be revenues coming into the Government which we \nuse to soften the blow to consumers. As a matter of fact, my friend \ncites the MIT study, but he forgets the conclusion of the MIT study, \nwhich is that a family of four could get a rebate as high as $4,500 per \nyear. That is more than the increase in costs that are predicted.\n  So my friend is a pessimist, and he is standing here saying: The sky \nis falling, the sky is falling. Where was he when gas prices reached \nalmost $5 a gallon without any global warming legislation but because \nof speculators? I didn't hear my friend complain. Where was my friend?\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Where was my friend when Enron had a scandal--and I won't \nyield; I don't have time to yield--where was my friend when Enron had a \nscandal in which it raised prices? I didn't hear him coming down here \nand complaining about it. But because we are contemplating a way to \nsolve a major crisis that is facing the American people--and by the \nway, in the course of that crisis of fighting global warming, we will \ngenerate revenues that we can give back to consumers--suddenly--if I \nmight ask for order. If I might ask for order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Suddenly, my friend is upset that consumers won't be made \nwhole.\n  Well, I hope my colleagues will support my amendment because my \namendment says that, in fact, consumers will be made whole by the \npolicies in the bill, by the revenues in the bill.\n  We embrace what he is doing with his amendment. We hope he will \nembrace what we are doing in our amendment, which is to say that \nconsumers will do well in any cap-and-trade system. They will not be \nhit. They will have rebates. They will be made whole. The fact is, the \nvery same MIT study he cites proves our point.\n  Our friends on the other side are nervous and excited now because \nthere are studies that say gasoline could go up by 10 cents over 10 \nyears--a penny a year. They are getting very exercised about that. None \nof us want that. But they weren't exercised over it when there was \nmanipulation going on by the oil companies, the traders, and the rest \nof it. What we are saying in our amendment is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Vote aye on the Boxer amendment and vote aye on the Thune \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 749\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on the Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from California that \nwhen gas prices were going up last summer, many of us were trying to \nput together a plan that would increase production in this country. We \nhad a simple strategy: find more and use less.\n  Many of us were working constructively to try to come up with an \nenergy solution that would increase domestic supply so we can drive \ndown the cost of energy. I was engaged in that with a number of \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle.\n  But that has nothing to do with this debate. This deals strictly with \na cap-and-trade proposal--a national energy tax proposal that is being \ncontemplated in this budget. My amendment also was straightforward and \nsimple. It says any reserve funds created as a result of this budget \nthat would call for climate change legislation cannot raise electricity \nrates or gasoline prices for American consumers. That is a tax on \nAmerican consumers when they need it the least.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment and reject the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is no national energy tax proposal. \nNobody I know has ever proposed it. If the purpose of this amendment is \nto fight a national energy tax proposal, then it is very interesting \nbecause there is no such proposal.\n  The fact is, we have a cap-and-trade system in place for acid rain. I \nnever heard one Republican come to the floor and call that a tax. It is \nnot a tax.\n  My friend is very concerned that energy prices will go up. I share \nhis concern. He should vote for my amendment. As a matter of fact, I \nthink it would be stunning if my friend didn't because I said any kind \nof a cap-and-trade system that comes forward will not increase \nelectricity or gas prices or increase the overall burden on consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He will have a lot of explaining to do to his \nconstituents. I urge an ``aye'' vote on Boxer and on Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 749.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nGillibrand) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 731 offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if you honestly believe the trillions of \ndollars that are going to come in from a cap-and-trade proposal--what \nis essentially a national energy sales tax--that those revenues are \ngoing to be distributed\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\nback to the American people, then voting for the Boxer amendment was \nthe correct vote.\n  If you believe, as I do, that the trillions of dollars that come in \nthrough a cap-and-trade proposal are, in fact, not going to be rebated \nto the American people, that they are going to fund programs in \nWashington, DC, then you should vote for my amendment because my \namendment prevents any program that is created--a cap-and-trade \nprogram--from increasing electricity rates or gasoline prices for \nAmerican consumers.\n  This is a national energy tax on the American people, on American \nconsumers. If you want to vote against that, then voting for my \namendment is the correct vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think Members should feel free to vote \nfor the Thune amendment because the Boxer amendment was adopted, which \nmeans that if there is any increase in gasoline prices, in electricity \nprices, because the Boxer amendment was adopted, we said we can rebate, \nwe can take the funds that have come in from a cap-and-trade system and \nkeep consumers whole. So I have no problem at all with the Thune \namendment now that we have passed Boxer. So feel very free to do that.\n\n  I will say that my friends on the other side are so desperate to kill \ncap and trade that they call it a national sales tax. They never called \nthe cap-and-trade system for acid rain a national sales tax. So they \nare inventing a new vocabulary just to kill any chance at addressing \nglobal warming in the way that most businesses want us to address it--\nthrough a cap-and-trade system.\n  But I feel comfortable voting for the Thune amendment because the \nBoxer amendment passed, and we will have the ability to keep consumers \nwhole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call this the 1789 amendment because it \nsimply says that if there is a budget brought forward after January \n2009 that raises the debt of this country more than all the debt added \nup by all the Presidents since 1789, starting with George Washington, \nThomas Jefferson, Franklin Pierce--to remind a few of you folks--\nFranklin Roosevelt, all the Presidents since 1789, all the debt they \nadded to this Nation--if there is a budget that brings forward more \ndebt than that in one 5-year period, as regrettably President Obama's \nbudget does--it doubles the debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 \nyears--then there will be a point of order against that budget so it \nwill take 60 votes in this body to pass that budget rather than 51. It \nis a reasonable request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, one has to wonder where the Senator was \nwhen they were doubling the debt over the last 8 years. But this \nsolution is the most curious offered yet. What it says is we would make \ngetting a budget resolution--which is the only prospect of disciplining \nthe process--even more difficult. The cure is worse than the disease.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this wrongheaded amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Senator \nwishes to make this retroactive, we will accept it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We already have the problems that President Obama has \ninherited.

Mr. President, the reporting of the amendment \nmentioned my name and others. I rise with Senator Collins, representing \nthe bipartisan leadership amendment of the Senate Homeland Security \nCommittee, to offer this bipartisan amendment to the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget resolution to strengthen Federal law enforcement efforts on our \nsouthern border. Our amendment would provide an additional $550 million \nto increase the number of Federal agents, investigators, and resources \non the border to staunch the flow of guns and money southward into \nMexico and the flow of drugs and violent drug dealers northward into \nAmerica.\n  The increasing competition among the Mexican drug cartels caused by \nthe initiative by President Philippe Calderon has touched off a bloody \nwar that has claimed over 7,200 lives in Mexico since the start of \n2008. This violence is supported by guns flowing south from the United \nStates, along with billions of dollars of ill-gotten money earned from \ndrug sales in the United States which allows the cartels, among other \nthings, to corrupt officials in Mexico but also some in the United \nStates as well. President Calderon has taken unprecedented steps to \nchallenge the cartels. He has deployed the Mexican military to assist \nin the fight and has acted aggressively to root out corruption in \ngovernment and law enforcement agencies in Mexico. But he needs our \nhelp and more of it, and we need to help him succeed in defeating the \nMexican drug cartels which create such havoc in the United States \nthrough the drugs they sell but whose violence has begun to spill over \nthe Mexican border into the United States. We cannot sit idly by while \nthe streets in Mexico run with blood, nor can we wait until the \ncartels' brutal violence further invades our own cities.\n  The Department of Justice testified before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee on this subject a week or so ago that the Mexican \ndrug cartels are today the No. 1 organized crime threat in our country. \nThey operate in 230 of our cities, bringing their deadly drugs and \nviolence with them. In Phoenix, AZ, alone, the cartels have been \ninvolved in kidnappings that numbered 700 in the last 2 years. That \nmakes Phoenix second only to Mexico City in the number of kidnappings \nin any city in the world. That is a direct overflow result of the \nMexican drug cartel violence and competition in Mexico. This \nlawlessness must be stopped before it spreads.\n  Last week, the Obama administration announced it was redeploying \ninvestigators and other law enforcement officers from the Departments \nof Homeland Security and Justice to the southern border to expand our \nGovernment's efforts to investigate and interdict the cartels' \nactivities in the United States. This was a real step forward. \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano said at her \nhearing before the committee last Wednesday that the plan she had put \ninto effect the day before was budget neutral. I know we want \neverything we do to be budget neutral, but this is an urgent crisis.\n  The Mexican drug cartels are a clear and present danger not only to \nthe people of Mexico but to the people of the United States. That fact, \nSenator Collins and I believe, compels us to provide our Federal law \nenforcement agencies with additional funding to ensure that the \nredeployment of forces that Secretary Napolitano announced last week is \nsustainable, that it does not take personnel away from other sections \nof our country where they are needed for law enforcement purposes, and \nthat we provide the substantial additional resources that we conclude, \nas the leaders of the Homeland Security Committee, are necessary to \neffectively combat the cartels.\n  Secretary Napolitano announced the redeployment of 350 personnel \nwithin her Department. We need to do more. The Secretary also said she \nhad to play with the hand she was dealt. This amendment would \ndramatically improve that hand, and I urge my fellow Senators to \nsupport our Secretary and the amendment and the security of the \nAmerican people by supporting it.\n  I wish to briefly speak now about what the amendment does. It \nprovides $260 million additional for Customs and Border Protection to \nhire, train, and equip 1,600 new officers and 400 canine teams to be \nsent to the border to significantly increase the number of inspections \nthere, particularly exit inspections, which we do not do routinely. The \nfunding would also cover costs related to temporary infrastructure to \nensure that the officers are protected from both the elements and those \nwho would evade inspection to come across the border. CBP would also \nreceive $20 million to modernize its border-screening database to \nbetter identify potential criminals and stop suspicious loads--\ntruckloads or carloads--at ports of entry.\n  The Department of Homeland Security would receive an additional $20 \nmillion to improve the tactical communications in the field for Customs \nand Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure \nthat our law enforcement officers have the ability to call for help \nwhen they are confronted by dangerous situations and to better \ncommunicate with State and local law enforcement who must be part of \nthis anti-Mexican drug cartel campaign.\n  Increasing inspections is just one part of a comprehensive strategy \nwhich this amendment would enable. We also need to ensure that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice have the \nresources--\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\npeople--they need to investigate the cartels. That is why our amendment \nprovides $130 million to ICE--Immigration and Customs Enforcement--for \n350 full-time investigators to work on firearms-trafficking and money-\nlaundering investigations.\n  We would also double the number of border enforcement security teams \nalong the southwest border. These teams create fusion centers that \nbring together all the Federal agencies with State and local \ngovernments to combat the cartels' activities. The fact is, many State \nand local law enforcement agencies, particularly along our southern \nborder, simply cannot afford to detail the necessary additional \nresources and personnel to these fusion centers. So this amendment \nwould provide $30 million for Operation Stonegarden to reimburse State \nand local law enforcement for their participation in these programs.\n  We would also add $10 million in the Department of Justice \ncompetitive grants for local, State, and tribal law enforcement \nagencies located along the southern border and in high-intensity drug-\ntrafficking areas across our country.\n  There is $50 million here for the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \nagency to better support an existing program called Project Gunrunner. \nIt would enable the hiring of an additional 150 agents and 50 \ninspectors to investigate illegal firearms trafficking near or across \nthe Mexican border, and $20 million for the Human Smuggling and \nTrafficking Center at the Department of Homeland Security to better \ncoordinate investigations between Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement.\n  Finally, we appropriate an additional $10 million so the Department \nof Homeland Security can oversee the implementation of its part of the \nMerida Initiative, most of which has funds flowing through the \nDepartment of State. If I may borrow a phrase from another conflict, \nthis amendment enables a real surge in America's joint war with the \nGovernment of Mexico against the Mexican drug cartels to occur.\n  The cartels are now presenting a genuine and very unique security \nthreat to our homeland. Our Federal law enforcement officers and \ninvestigators are doing the best they can, but there are simply not \nenough of them with enough resources to take on the threat the cartels \npose to America's security and the security of our friend and ally \nnation to the south, Mexico. Additional resources provided by this \namendment would improve our ability to break the grip of the cartels \nand ensure that the drug-related violence from Mexico does not further \nencroach on America's communities and people.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I now am proud to yield to the \nranking member of our committee, Senator Collins of Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, in offering this bipartisan amendment to provide urgently \nneeded resources to confront a major and growing threat to our homeland \nsecurity.\n  Since the beginning of 2008, more than 7,000 people have been killed \nin drug-related violence in Mexico, including 522 military and law \nenforcement officials. The Mexican drug cartels have become \nincreasingly brazen and violent, targeting police and journalists and \nusing graphic displays of violence to intimidate communities. The drug \ncartels also have been able to corrupt some local law enforcement \nofficials, who then have turned a blind eye to or are complicit in \nillegal drug production and trafficking.\n  Compounding the danger of the situation, Mexico's drug cartels have, \nin recent years, acquired increasingly sophisticated and powerful \nweaponry. Smuggling equips the cartels with large numbers of firearms, \nas well as items such as night vision goggles and electronic intercept \nand encrypted communications capabilities. Police in Mexico are often \nill-equipped to confront such well-armed and trained forces.\n  This growing violence poses a significant danger to the security of \nour country, particularly to border States. Drug-related violence has \nalready spilled over our borders. Kidnappings, assaults, murders, and \nhome invasions related to the Mexican drug cartels are on the rise, \nparticularly in the State of Arizona. Tucson and Phoenix have created \nspecial task forces to investigate a rash of kidnappings and home \ninvasions directly related to these Mexican drug cartels. Authorities \nestimate, as the chairman has indicated, that more than 230 cities, as \nfar away as Anchorage, AK, and Boston, MA, have distribution networks \nrelated to the Mexican cartels. This number is up from just 100 cities \n3 years ago. As the drugs come north from Mexico, these distribution \nnetworks use the revenues from their sales to send cash and weapons \nback to the traffickers in Mexico.\n  The U.S. Government has invested significant resources in preventing \ndrugs from entering our country. But until very recently, the Federal \nGovernment has focused only very limited resources on the supply of \nmoney and weapons going south--south to fuel the drug war. In our own \ncountry, some local and State law enforcement agencies simply do not \nhave the capabilities to fully counter the increasingly complex \noperations and sophisticated weapons of the Mexican cartels' \ndistribution networks.\n  The amendment Senator Lieberman and I are offering would provide \nabsolutely critical resources to supplement those efforts underway on \nour southwest border to combat drug, gun, and cash smuggling by the \ndrug cartels in Mexico. These resources represent a more substantial \ncommitment to address the threat than the administration announced last \nweek when it moved some personnel from other parts of the country to \nthe southwest border. Those steps were good ones, they are needed, but \nthey simply are not sufficient, and they risk leaving other borders not \nfully staffed, particularly the northern borders.\n  Our amendment, as Senator Lieberman has indicated, provides \nadditional funding for Customs and Border Protection to deploy 1,600 \nadditional officers at ports of entry without robbing other ports of \nentry. It would also provide funding for 400 new canine teams. Many of \nthese new officers and teams will be deployed to the southwest border \nto conduct inspections, exit inspections of southbound traffic to \nMexico so we can interdict the illegal export of weapons and cash that \nagain fuel that cartel-related violence in Mexico.\n  To investigate and dismantle the networks involved in smuggling the \ndrugs, the weapons, and the cash, our amendment provides $130 million \nfor Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hire and train 350 new \ninvestigators. That will help ensure that the number of border \nenforcement security teams along the southwest border doubles. These \nteams have been highly successful in coordinating with Mexican \nofficials to combat cross-border smuggling, but they are simply \noverwhelmed by the extent of the threat.\n  As Senator Lieberman has described, our amendment also provides $50 \nmillion in additional funding to hire, train, and deploy an additional \n100 investigators working on Project Gunrunner. This will help expand \ninvestigations of armed smuggling.\n  The amendment sets aside an additional $30 million for a highly \nsuccessful cooperative program known as Operation Stonegarden. This \nprogram has been a big success in my own State, so I know how helpful \nit can be in combating this emerging and growing threat.\n  Finally, this amendment provides $40 million for important technology \nupgrades to make CBP officers and Border Patrol agents along the \nborder, and indeed across the country, more effective in identifying \npotential smugglers and in communicating with each other and with State \nand local law enforcement. This will make a real difference.\n  What we have done is put together a carefully crafted amendment that \nwill help to fill the real gaps that exist at the Federal level and, in \ncooperation with State and local law enforcement, to help us counter \nthis extraordinary rise in violence that has spilled over the border \nfrom Mexico that is threatening the security particularly in those \nborder States, such as Arizona, but also poses a threat to States \nthroughout our country because of these distribution networks the drug \ncartels are using.\n  This amendment is essential to the security of our country. The \nviolence the cartels originate in Mexico--and\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\ncertainly we have to be concerned about the violence in a neighboring \ncountry, but this affects American citizens directly. I am convinced, \nbased on the hearings our committee has held and the investigations we \nhave conducted, that this amendment is essential to countering this \ngrowing threat to our homeland security. I urge support for the \namendment, and I am very pleased to work with my chairman to bring this \nissue before the Senate.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I first wish to thank my colleague from \nMaine for her excellent statement as well as for the spirit of \nbipartisanship that has blessed and characterized our relationship. I \nam very pleased we have been able to bring this amendment forward \nquickly in response to testimony we have heard and an investigation our \nstaff has done. This is an urgent problem that concerns people \nparticularly along our southern border but also in cities around \nAmerica, 230 cities where the Mexican drug cartels are operating, and \nthey are all over the country. This is a business that by varying \nestimates returns between $16 billion and $38 billion a year. It takes \n$16 billion to $38 billion a year out of the United States and sends it \nback to the drug cartel kingpins in Mexico. If that was a business, it \nwould be one of the larger businesses in our country today.\n  We just have to help President Calderon, who has had the guts to take \non the Mexican drug cartels at tremendous risk to himself and his \ngovernment and deployed his military. We are helping him through the \nmerit initiative. This is a way to beef up our own response and our own \npartnership on this side of the border. I thank Senator Collins for her \nstatement and for her support.\n  I do wish to indicate for the Record that also original cosponsors of \nthis amendment are Senator Bennet from Colorado, Senator Bingaman from \nNew Mexico, Senator Feinstein from California, Senator Hutchison from \nTexas, Senator Kyl from Arizona, Senator Pryor from Arkansas, Senator \nUdall from Colorado, and Senator Udall from New Mexico, a truly \nbipartisan group of cosponsors. We are going to ask for a rollcall vote \non this amendment. I know there is a lot of interest in it from Members \non both sides of the aisle throughout the Senate and throughout the \ncountry, and we hope we can vote on it as soon as possible.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remaining time \nthat we have been allotted on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 747\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I was just making my entrance at the \ntime the Senator from Connecticut concluded.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 747 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 747.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To create runaway debt point of order against consideration \n of a budget resolution that projects the ratio of the public debt to \nGDP for any fiscal year in excess of 90 percent to ensure the continued \n  viability of U.S. dollar and prevent doubling or tripling the debt \n                     burden on future generations)\n\n       On page 68, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMIT ON PUBLIC DEBT.\n\n       (a) Federal Spending Limit Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any budget resolution, bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, or conference report that would exceed the limit \n     on public debt for any fiscal year covered therein.\n       (2) Waiver or suspension.--This subsection may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative roll call \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (3) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this subsection.\n       (4) Form of point of order.--A point of order under this \n     subsection may be raised by a Senator as provided in section \n     313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Limit on public debt.--The term ``limit on public \n     debt'' means a level of public debt for a fiscal year in the \n     resolution where the ratio of the public debt to GDP is 90 \n     percent.\n       (2) GDP.--The term ``GDP'' means the gross domestic product \n     for the relevant fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Hampshire is \nhere, and the Senator from Arizona, the assistant Republican leader, \nwill be here in a few minutes, I believe. Senator Gregg earlier offered \nan amendment which essentially would say that the projected debt under \nPresident Obama's budget couldn't go up more than all of the debt that \nhas been accumulated by all of the Presidents from George Washington to \nPresident Bush. That is one way of saying to the American people and to \nthe Senate that the debt that is proposed by these budgets is so \nstaggeringly high that we need to find some way to put a limit on it.\n  I am offering with my amendment another way to put some limit on the \ndebt. I call it a runaway debt point of order. This is not a matter of \nnot letting the horse get out of the barn; this recognizes that the \nhorse is already out of the barn and we are trying to put a fence \naround him before he gets into the next county or even into the next \ncountry.\n  This amendment would create a new point of order against considering \nany budget resolution that estimates gross Federal debt--our total \ndebt, total amount of obligations--exceeding 90 percent of gross \ndomestic product in any year covered by the budget. To put that in a \nlittle plainer English, what it means is the Senate would be forced to \ncome up with 60 votes if the public debt in any year goes beyond 90 \npercent of the estimated gross domestic product.\n  The gross domestic product is what all of us produce in the United \nStates every year. Despite the fact we are in an economic slowdown, we \nare a very privileged country. We make up only about 5 percent of the \nworld population--those of us who live in the United States--but year \nin and year out we produce about $1 out of every $4 of wealth produced \nin the world. So 22, 23, 25, 26 percent of all of the wealth, all of \nthe money produced each year in the world is produced in the United \nStates for distribution among primarily the 5 percent of us who live \nhere. We are a very privileged country. This amendment says if we \nintend in any year to increase the debt above 90 percent of all of that \nproduction in any year, that 60 Senators have to agree with it.\n  When was the last time the United States had a debt, a national debt, \nthat exceeded 90 percent of the gross domestic product? It was when we \nwere fighting in World War II and as we were coming out of World War \nII. Of course, during that time, it didn't matter what we spent. It \ndidn't matter what we taxed. We were in a fight for our lives, and we \ndid whatever we could think of to do, spent whatever we could think of \nto spend, and ran up any debt we needed to to win the war. And we did \nwin that war.\n  Right after World War II, our national debt was about 90 percent of \nthe annual gross domestic product of the United States. More recently, \nit has been about 40 percent.\n  So here is what happens now--the Senator from New Hampshire went into \nthis to some degree. We talked about deficits and we need to make a \nclear distinction between deficits and debt. Deficits adds to the debt \neach year. We talked about the fact that the deficit is going up this \nyear and next year during the recession, and we understand that is \nnecessary to some degree. But then the deficit comes back down to \napproximately 4 percent of gross domestic product, and it stays at a \nlittle over 4 percent in President Obama's budget. That is also the \nConrad budget, which OMB Director for\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nPresident Obama said, is about 98 percent of the Obama budget. This \nproposes an annual deficit as compared with GDP that is worse than the \nfollowing countries: Guatemala, the Philippines, Aruba, Cuba, Nigeria.\n  This amendment I'm offering, however, seeks to talk about the debt. \nFor example, the President's proposal is to double the debt in 5 years \nand to almost triple it in almost 10 years. So we start out with debt \nheld by the public at about 40 percent of gross domestic product. But \nby 2014, we are at 66.5 percent of gross domestic product under Senator \nConrad's budget. President Obama proposed a 10-year budget--which is a \npicture of America's future in the same way that a photograph of a \nfirst grade class would be a picture of a community's future 10 years \nout--that actually presented a very honest picture of our future as he \nsees it. I respect him greatly for that. I just don't like the picture \nhe has presented because that picture, as I mentioned, doubles the debt \nin 5 years and nearly triples it in 10 years. So we go from a level of \ndebt held by the public equaling about 40 percent of gross domestic \nproduct to 82 percent of gross domestic product.\n  Under President Bush--and we hear a lot of talking about President \nBush, we had lower deficits. I was listening to the radio yesterday \nmorning, and they said: How can you Republicans be talking about debt \nwhen under President Bush you ran up the debt? True, true. But Senator \nGregg offered an amendment that gives us a chance to deal with that \nbecause he points out that President Obama would increase the debt more \nthan, not just President Bush, but than all of the Presidents put \ntogether, going back to George Washington. That is a very sobering \nfact. So President Bush may have made some mistakes, but he was not \njudged on whether he caused Hurricane Katrina. He was judged on how he \nreacted to it. President Obama certainly didn't create the economic \nmess we are in, and he won't be judged by that, but he will be judged--\nand the majority party will be judged--by how they react to it. I don't \nbelieve doubling the debt and tripling the debt is the way to grow the \neconomy or restore good jobs.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire here, and I would like to ask \nhim about these gross domestic product discussions--90 percent of this \nand 20 percent of that and a trillion of this--all of that makes the \ncase, but it is hard to fathom.\n  Through the Chair, I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire how \nwould he put it in terms that the average family can deal with, what it \nmeans to double the debt in 5 years and nearly triple it in 10 years, \nas the President's budget would do.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for the purposes \nof a question, I will try to make it rhetorical. First off, I \ncongratulate the Senator for his amendment because it is a serious \namendment addressing what I consider to be the most serious problem \nwith the President's budget, which is that the amount of debt that is \nbeing put on the books by this budget is a result of incredible \nexpansion of the size of the Government and the spending of the \nGovernment. It is going to put us in a situation where, as the Senator \nnoted, we will probably not be able to sustain the payment of that debt \nor we will be forced into a position similar to some of the countries \nthe Senator mentioned, which is serious inflation or an inability to \nborrow money because people will worry about the ability to be able to \npay it back and our concern about the devaluation of the dollar.\n  It is hard, I think, and inappropriate for one generation to put that \nmuch debt on the back of another generation.\n  So what the Senator is proposing is--not that you can't pass a \nbudget, but when you do pass a budget that raises the public debt and \ngrows debt, in this case up to 90 percent of GDP, at a level of \ncountries such as Cuba and Aruba--what were the other countries?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Guatemala, the Philippines, Aruba.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nHampshire and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy for the remaining \nminutes we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Guatemala, the Philippines, Cuba, Nigeria, and Aruba \nare countries that have an annual deficit level lower than we will \nhave.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the debt level, too, I suspect. In fact, we could not \nget into the European Union at the debt level of 90 percent of GDP. \nThey would not even allow us in.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Lots of times Members of Congress sort of make fun of \nEurope and make fun of France and say: Well, that is French. We don't \nwant to be French. It is embarrassing to stand here and say the \nsituation exists where, if the United States were applying to be a \nmember of the European Union, our annual deficit level would be too \nhigh to be admitted. We would be unable to qualify for the entire 10 \nyears projected in this budget if we were to choose to do that.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct, as a result of this budget proposed by \nthe President, because the budget proposal is a dramatic expansion in \nspending--an expansion of spending up to levels we have not seen since \nWorld War II in terms of gross national product. Huge numbers.\n  The Senator asked how can this--these huge numbers, which nobody can \nunderstand, $1 trillion or 90 percent of GDP--how does that translate \nto the person who lives on Main Street? Well, basically it means at the \nend of this budget, every household in America will have an obligation \nrelative to the Federal debt that is owed of $133,000. That is probably \ngoing to exceed a lot of mortgages they have. So not only do you have \nyour mortgage on your house, but you are going to have a Federal debt \nwhich you are responsible for of $130,000. The service on that debt--in \nother words, the interest costs to pay for that debt--will be $6,200 a \nyear.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from New \nHampshire, who will be the mortgage holder on that debt in 20 or 30 or \n40 years?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, China regrettably. They are the primary mortgage \nholder, although other nations also hold our debt. Russia owns a lot of \nit, and Middle Eastern countries, such as oil-producing emirates and \nSaudi Arabia. Obviously, America also owns some of its debt. But the \ncountries outside our Nation, regrettably, have raised their level of \nownership of our debt. It has actually been good for us because some \npeople have been able to borrow from us; we have borrowed from people \nwho lent us money--primarily, China, Russia, and other countries in the \nMiddle East have been lending us money.\n  When we pay back this debt, which is going to be run up \ndramatically--doubled in 5 years and tripled in 10 years by this \nbudget--we are basically going to be sending hard-earned money from \nAmericans to these other nations.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the mortgage holders around the world--China, the \nMiddle East, and other countries--worry about our ability to pay it \nback, I suppose they could simply stop buying our dollars or ask us to \npay them more or pay a higher interest rate for our mortgage debt.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is absolutely right. That comes out of every \nAmerican's ability to have a better lifestyle here. It means Americans \nwill have to pay higher taxes, and they will not have as much \ndiscretionary money to spend on buying a house, sending their children \nto college, buying a car, and doing things Americans like to do in \norder to enjoy a good life. So much of the income of America will have \nto be poured into paying off the debt, which will be run up by this \nbudget.\n  There is an interesting fact that I know the Senator is aware of: By \nthe time we get through the 10-year period proposed in the budget, the \namount of money that we as a nation will pay in interest--just \ninterest--on the Federal debt will be over $800 billion, or almost a \ntrillion dollars. That is interest annually. That will be more money \nthan we spend on defending America, on our national defense.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have been worrying about sending billions of \ndollars overseas to buy oil. So we should be worried about sending half \nof that money overseas to pay interest on the debt.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was Governor of New Hampshire, as I \nwas Governor of Tennessee, and we used to have a friendly competition \nabout which had the most conservative fiscal policies. Of course, \nTennessee did, but one thing we always tried to do was keep our debt \nlow because that\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\nmeant we had more money for schools and for State parks and for \nhospitals. What happens when we run the debt so high that we are paying \n$800 billion in interest, which I believe is 8 times more than the \nFederal Government spends on education each year and 8 times more than \nthe Federal Government spends on transportation each year. We are \ntaking away the money that we would invest to make this a better \ncountry in the future.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct. We will spend this \nmoney for the purpose of paying interest and, as the Senator points \nout, maybe more than half the interest payment will go to the people in \nChina, Russia or in the Middle Eastern countries, rather than spending \nit here to build better schools or basically make sure our national \ndefense is adequate, which is the primary responsibility of the \nGovernment, or to build better roads or invest in energy. That seems to \nbe a very bad policy to me.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 16 minutes. There is 44 \nminutes left in support of the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we had an agreement that, under \nthis amendment, our side would have 25 minutes and the other side would \nhave 25 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be able to have another 5 minutes on \nour side, and then we will go to the other 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from North Dakota \nhere. We have been talking about Senator Gregg's amendment, which would \ntry to put some limit on the size of the debt. And we have been talking \nabout my proposal, the runaway debt point of order, which would say \ndebt is not where it should be, so let's say whoa out there and let \nourselves and the American people know when we reach a debt level of 90 \npercent of GDP and that we should not have a budget in any year that \ndoes that.\n  I know the chairman, Senator Conrad, has said in committee he didn't \nthink that was a very effective way to do things. I wonder why that is \ntrue because it seems to me it would be extremely effective to shine a \nbig spotlight on the Senate and say you have proposed a budget where \ndebt exceeds 90 percent of the gross domestic product of this country \nfor a year. You cannot do that, unless a bipartisan group of 60 of you \nagree to do it.\n  I wonder whether Senator Gregg believes these kinds of limits or \nspotlights would be a helpful tool in beginning to reduce the \nstaggering debt these budgets propose.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think they would be. First off, we are not barring the \nability to bring a budget to the floor. We are simply saying any budget \nthat anticipates the debt of the United States, which in this budget \npotentially is occurring or which would occur under this budget as \nproposed from the President, that has a general debt of over 90 percent \nof GDP, gross national product, requires 60 votes. Why shouldn't it? If \nyou are going to do that and step off down the road of basically banana \nrepublicanism--is that a word?--you ought to have a major vote to do \nthat, a supermajority to accomplish that.\n  I don't want to be like some of these nations listed by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I would rather not find myself in a situation where we \nbasically cannot afford our debt and we are passing on to our children \na nation which has been so profligate in its spending that it ran up a \ndebt to make it impossible for our kids to have such a life as good as \nthe one we have had.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe our time has expired. I ask \nunanimous consent to allow a couple more minutes because I see Senator \nKyl from Arizona who wishes to speak briefly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes off my time to Senator \nKyl. I do that not because I am eager to hear from Senator Kyl but \nbecause I would like to maintain the overall time constraint we have \nput into place, given all the other demands. I am happy to yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am appreciative and chagrined at the same \ntime. I appreciate very much the courtesy. The only point I wished to \nbriefly make--and I don't know whether it was made before with \nspecificity--is that there is a reason why the debt and the deficits \nmatter. It is because so much of it is held by other countries. Those \nother countries are becoming very concerned about the debt they hold in \nAmerica.\n  We don't have an unlimited ability to continue to sell this debt to \nother countries. I just got these statistics. The Chinese specifically \nhold $727 billion or about 23.6 percent of all foreign holdings of U.S. \ndebt. The Japanese hold $626 billion or 20 percent. Others are held by \nPersian Gulf countries. When they hold this debt, they both have a very \nlarge indirect stake in the kinds of policies we can pursue as a \nnation, and they also, obviously, would affect our future ability to \nborrow by their assessment of the quality of the debt and of the value \nof the dollar.\n  To this point, the Chinese Premier, in response to a question at a \nnews conference, said:\n\n       We have lent huge amounts of money to the United States. Of \n     course we are concerned about the safety of our assets.\n\n  My only point is, it is not just a matter that there is more debt in \nthis budget than the entire history of the United States combined--\nthere is a reason to be concerned about that debt beyond the fact that \nour kids and grandkids are going to have to pay it back--but today and \ntomorrow how that debt is viewed by the holders of the debt in other \ncountries. Therefore, I think we ignore that at our peril.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the chairman to lend me a couple \nminutes to make that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, look, I believe that, over the first 5 \nyears, this budget resolution takes us in the right direction. The \nresolution dramatically reduces our deficits, reduces them by more than \ntwo-thirds, it reduces our deficit as a share of gross domestic product \nfrom 12.2 percent this year down to less than 3 percent in the fifth \nyear.\n  The place where I would actually agree with my colleagues is in the \nsecond 5 years of either the President's budget or, frankly, mine, \nalthough mine would have substantially less debt than would the second \n5 years of the President's. My own belief is getting down to 3 percent \nof GDP is not enough. Why is it not enough? Because at 3 percent of \nGDP, you stabilize the debt. That is why it is so critical to get \nthere. At least that is what the economists tell us.\n  The problem with that, I believe, is I don't think stabilizing the \ndebt at those high levels is an acceptable outcome. I think when the \nSenator talks about the Chinese Premier--when Senator Kyl talks about \nthe Chinese Premier sending a warning shot, we had better take that \nvery seriously. I think that when we see the U.S. gross debt \napproaching 100 percent of GDP--gross debt as distinguished from the \npublicly held debt--that is a real warning flag. I understand that \nJapan's debt is about 180 percent of their GDP and rising. I don't \nthink it is healthy for them or for us to have public debt so high \nrelative to GDP once the immediate crisis has passed.\n  Look, the problem I have with the Alexander amendment is not the \nsentiment behind it; it is the specifics of the amendment because what \ndoes it provide? The amendment says you are going to have a 60-vote \npoint of order against the budget resolution when you are at those debt \nlevels. Senator Alexander said it himself moments ago--we would not do \na budget when we get to those debt levels. I don't think that is what \nhe meant because that is not what his amendment provides. The amendment \nprovides a 60-vote point of order against the budget resolution at \nthose levels. I just don't get how that is the solution to the buildup \nof debt.\n  I think one of the last things you would want to do is make a budget \nresolution more difficult because the budget resolution actually has \nthe disciplines, the points of order, and the supermajority points of \norder that help discipline the budget process, which makes it easier to \nprevent more appropriated spending.\n  Let me say this. I have been through this exercise of cutting $160 \nbillion over 5 years from the President's discretionary proposal. I \nhave the scars to prove it. I will tell you, if you want an intense \nexperience around here, cut domestic discretionary spending. That is\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nwhat this budget does. There are a lot of people who are not happy \nabout it--very much not happy. I don't know what else you do when you \nare faced with losing $2 trillion in revenue.\n  I say to my colleagues that I agree very much with the sentiment that \nSenator Alexander has expressed about the dangers of debt. I have said \nmany times on the floor of the Senate that debt is the threat. The debt \nis the threat. I will just say this: In the previous administration, we \nnever heard the word ``debt'' leave the mouths of the President or Vice \nPresident of the United States. Never did you hear them talk about the \ndebt of the United States. Do you know why? Because they doubled the \ndebt during their time. Our colleagues were complicit in that activity. \nThey stood and voted with them to endorse the policies that doubled the \ndebt of the United States. That was during good economic times.\n  In the final year of the Bush administration, the economy plunged \ninto the worst condition since the Great Depression. That is true. But \nin the early days of that administration--well, the early days were \nrecession, too. They began in recession and they ended in a very severe \nrecession. But in between, we had a number of years of economic growth, \nbut that growth was propelled by writing trillions of dollars of hot \nchecks. That is what was being done during the Bush administration. The \nresult is right here. This is what they did to the debt. They doubled \nit. That is the Bush legacy--doubling the debt of the United States \nand, again, during relatively good times. Our friends on the other side \nof the aisle were with them every step of the way as they took us right \nover the cliff.\n  Why did we wind up in this devastating economic downturn? I \npersonally believe it was the result of four factors: No. 1, a very \nloose fiscal policy under the control of the Congress and the President \nof the United States. And I fought it every step of the way. I opposed \nthis massive buildup of debt because I thought it would fundamentally \nthreaten the economic security of the country.\n  No. 2, a loose monetary policy under the control of the Federal \nReserve. After 9/11, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low. So we \nhad a combination--very unusual in economic history--of very loose \nfiscal policy and loose monetary policy. On top of that, we had a \ndysfunctional trade policy with trade deficits running well above $700 \nbillion a year, meaning we were consuming substantially more than we \ncould produce. We were sending vast sums of money to other countries to \nbuy their energy, to buy their goods and to, in effect, make them our \nbankers, because guess what? We financed our budget deficits largely \nthrough foreign borrowing.\n  No. 4, we had a very loose regulatory climate in which nobody was \nwatching these derivative instruments, these other exotic investment \ntools, the mortgage-backed securities that were created by people who \nlent money and did not care if they got repaid because as soon as they \nmade the mortgage, they packaged it in these collateralized debt \nobligations and they took those packages and sold them around the world \nand got huge fees from it, made a lot of money from it, didn't care if \nthe people who had the underlying mortgages paid them back or ever had \nany prospect of paying them back because they were not there to \ncollect. They had shuffled it off to somebody else. They didn't shuffle \nit off just to American banks, they shuffled it off to banks all around \nthe world, precipitating this crisis.\n  On top of it all, we had investment banks going from 11-to-1 leverage \nto 30 to 1. These guys were no fools. They thought to themselves: This \nis going to be great, we go from 11-to-1 leverage to 30-to-1 leverage. \nWhat does that mean? Let's say you bet on the price of oil and the \nprice of oil goes up a buck. You make $11 if you have 11-to-1 leverage. \nIf you have 30-to-1 leverage, you don't make $1, you make $30. But \nleverage works both ways. It works very well when things are going up. \nIt does not work so well when things are going down.\n  What did these guys figure out? They figured out: Let's see if we \ncan't find somebody to sell us insurance against the downside risk of \nthe debt we are incurring, against the downside risk of the deals we \nare entering. So, in case the complicated packages of loans we're \nholding as assets begin to default, we will be covered.\n  That leads us to AIG, doesn't it? Because AIG, which had been a very \nstrong insurance company, a highly respected company worldwide, had \nthis little skunk works over in England, about 300 people, who started \nwriting these exotic insurance policies called credit default swaps \nwhich insured owners of debt securities against default on the \nunderlying loans. AIG sold that insurance at very high premiums and \nearned huge profits on those insurance sales. The buyers paid those \npremiums because having the insurance from AIG insulated them from \ndownside risk. Or so they thought.\n  So what went wrong? What went wrong was that AIG never took any steps \nto cover their potential insurance obligations in case things went bad. \nThey did not have the capital to back up the insurance agreements they \nentered into. So when things, in fact, did go bad, they could not come \nup with the money to provide the insurance that others had paid in \nexpensive premiums to purchase.\n  It reminded me of the guy--remember back in the World Series when it \nwas in San Francisco and they had the earthquake? We are watching the \nWorld Series and all of a sudden, the stadium starts shaking. I heard \nabout a guy out in the Bay area who, after that, came up with a scheme \nto sell earthquake insurance. His earthquake insurance idea was that he \nwould get you a helicopter within 15 minutes of the next earthquake to \nrescue your family, or rescue your top executives. He goes around and \nstarts selling insurance to have a helicopter rescue you within 15 \nminutes, he starts collecting premiums. The problem is he did not have \nany helicopters.\n  That is basically what AIG was doing with their bogus debt \ninsurance--insuring the debt of already heavily leveraged banks and \ninvestment banks against defaults on their debt securities. When it was \nrevealed that AIG had not covered its bets, could not cover its bets, \ncredit markets seized worldwide.\n  Shame on them. Shame on all of them. They put the world's economy at \nrisk, and we are reaping the whirlwind today.\n  If I am right about this analysis that the seedbed for all of this is \ncreated by very loose fiscal policy, massive runup in debt, loose \nmonetary policy by the Federal Reserve, irresponsible trade policy, and \nalmost no regulatory oversight--that is the seedbed for the current \nprecipitous decline. That is what I believe.\n  Senator, if you believe that, why are you writing a budget that has \nmore debt? Very simply because when you are in a steep contraction, a \nsteep decline, the only entity big enough to provide the liquidity to \nprevent a complete collapse is the Federal Government. Consumers cannot \ndo it. They are tapped out. Companies cannot do it. They are tapped \nout. The only one left to do it is the Federal Government.\n  If we do not do it--if we did not do it--the precipitous decline we \nare already in could become a deflationary spiral that would suck this \neconomy down, like the Great Depression.\n  Let's remember, we have 8.1 percent unemployment today. In the Great \nDepression, they had 25 percent unemployment. Ninety percent of the \nstock market's value was lost in the Great Depression. It took them \ndecades to recover. We think we have problems now? Don't pursue the \nright policy options, don't have the Government provide liquidity, \ndon't have the Government provide things such as guarantees to money \nmarket funds. I tell you, I was in the room with the previous Secretary \nof Treasury and the head of the Federal Reserve when they came one \nnight to tell us--not to consult us, to tell us--they were taking over \nAIG the next morning. Leaders of Congress were there, the chairmen of \nthe Banking Committees were there, the chairmen of the Budget \nCommittees were there, and the ranking members of the House and Senate \nwere there. We were told in no uncertain terms by the Secretary of the \nTreasury--not this one, the previous one--and the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve that if they did not take over AIG the next morning, \nthere would be a global financial collapse. That is what they told us. \nAnd they did not just use those words; they\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nprovided a lot of specifics of the companies that would be on the brink \nof going under within 1 week if we did not provide the assistance \nrequired and if they did not make the decision to take over AIG.\n\n  Again, they were not there to consult us. They were not there to ask \nus. They were there to tell us what they were doing.\n  If this analysis is correct--and I believe it is--then our current \neconomic circumstance is the result of an overly loose fiscal policy, \noverly loose monetary policy, dysfunctional trade policy, coupled with \nderegulation that provided no oversight.\n  These deals by AIG, those derivative deals--nobody even has a list of \nwhat these deals were around the world. There is not even a list \nbecause there was no requirement for any governmental agency anywhere \nto oversee it.\n  There are real consequences to policy failures. In the short term, \nthere is no question in my mind we have to take on additional deficits \nand debt in order to give lift to this economy and provide liquidity to \nprevent a much greater collapse.\n  As this economy strengthens and recovers--and it will--we then have \nto pivot to get back to a more sustainable long-term policy. But \nhonestly, I don't think the answer is the Alexander amendment. I think \nthe answer is something much more like what Senator Gregg and I \nproposed, which is a special task force with everything on the table \nmade up of 16 Members of Congress, members of the administration, \neverybody with some responsibility to come up with a plan to dig out. \nThat is what I believe is the appropriate response.\n  Again, I would resist the Alexander amendment because I think it \ncould in a strange way actually make things worse. Not to have a budget \nresolution, not to have the disciplines that are provided for in a \nbudget resolution I think would be a big mistake because in a budget \nresolution, there is a whole series of points of order against \nadditional spending, against excessive spending, 60-vote hurdles. \nWithout a budget resolution, we would be left with simple majority \nvotes.\n  Anybody who has been here, if we get an appropriations bill out on \nthis floor and not have any of the budget protections that are in the \nBudget Act in a budget resolution--it is open checkbook, open \ncheckbook. That is what would happen.\n  I have enormous respect for Senator Alexander and for Senator Gregg. \nThey are well motivated. They are serious about this country's economic \nfuture. But I believe this particular solution, as I said earlier--this \nis a circumstance in which the cure is worse than the disease. I hope \nmy colleagues will resist it.\n  I ask the Chair, how much time is remaining on the Alexander \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 43 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I think not. They are counting the official 2 hours. \nThat is not the agreement we are operating under. Maybe we should \nclarify. If we are at 60 minutes equally divided, including the time \nalready used, would there be any time remaining on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have 14 minutes remaining. \nSenator Alexander would have no time remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nuse or yielding back of time on the Lieberman-Collins amendment, the \nnext amendments to be debated are the following: the Alexander \namendment regarding debt, with 60 minutes equally divided, including \nthe time already used, and we will come back to the disposition of the \nremaining time on that amendment; the Sessions amendment regarding a \ndiscretionary freeze, 45 minutes equally divided, with Senator Inouye \nin control of 10 minutes in opposition; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time on the amendments, the amendments be set aside and the \nSenate proceed to a period of debate only with the following order: \nSenator Cardin recognized for 15 minutes; Republican members of the \nJoint Economic Committee recognized for 30 minutes; myself or my \ndesignee for 30 minutes; following the remarks of Senator Conrad or his \ndesignee, the Senate continue for debate only for Senators to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each on the resolution or on amendments they intend to \noffer at a later time; further, that speakers alternate between the two \nsides; finally, that the previous order with respect to Senator Conrad \nor his designee to offer a side-by-side amendment to amendment No. 735 \nremain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nremaining on the Alexander amendment be yielded back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that would take us, if I am not mistaken, \nto the Sessions amendment, and we understand he will be here shortly, \nso that leaves some time.\n  Mr. President, I can announce on behalf of the leader that as a \nresult of this agreement there will be no further rollcall votes today. \nIt will be our intention to try to stack votes at approximately 11 a.m. \ntomorrow. I think we will need to finalize and formalize that and \nannounce it later in the evening, but that will be our intent.\n  Are we in agreement on that, I ask Senator Gregg?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, one part of the unanimous consent request \nwas that at the end of today, at the end of all the speakers and when \nwe have exhausted all the time today, we will have 20 hours left on the \nresolution to be equally divided. Mr. President, one other caveat I \nwould like to have as an understanding is with respect to Senator \nInouye. If he is somewhat late because of other responsibilities, he \nwould still have his full 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member, and we thank Senator Sessions \nfor being not only on time but ahead of time. He sets a very good \nexample for our colleagues. We appreciate very much Senator Sessions \nbeing here early.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 772\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have filed and call up amendment No. \n772 and ask that it be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 772.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore the budget discipline of the Federal Government by \n freezing nondefense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2010 and \n 2011, and limiting the growth of nondefense discretionary spending to \n      one percent annually for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014)\n\n       On page 4, line 14, decrease the amount by $34,170,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $38,847,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $45,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $50,655,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $57,729,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $23,170,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $37,847,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $43,300,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $49,655,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by \n     $56,729,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $23,170,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $37,847,000,000.\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $43,300,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $49,655,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by \n     $56,729,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $23,170,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $61,018,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by \n     $104,317,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by \n     $153,972,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 21, decrease the amount by \n     $210,701,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 25, decrease the amount by $23,170,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 1, decrease the amount by $61,018,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 2, decrease the amount by $104,317,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 3, decrease the amount by $153,972,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 4, decrease the amount by $210,701,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $170,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $170,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 3, decrease the amount by $847,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $847,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, decrease the amount by $2,300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 11, decrease the amount by $4,655,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, decrease the amount by $4,655,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 15, decrease the amount by $7,729,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $7,729,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by \n     $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by \n     $23,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $38,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 3, decrease the amount by $37,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 6, decrease the amount by $43,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $41,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 10, decrease the amount by \n     $46,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, decrease the amount by \n     $45,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $50,000,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 15, decrease the amount by \n     $49,000,000,000.\n       On page 50, line 13, decrease the amount by \n     $34,000,000,000.\n       On page 50, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $23,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as so often has been said, we are on an \nunsustainable path of taxing and spending and borrowing. The numbers \nare larger than anything we have ever seen before in the history of our \ncountry. We have dueling charts and different views and obfuscation and \nspin and talk and all that kind of thing, but the bottom line is that \nour debt is surging under this budget--President Obama's budget and the \nSenate budget and the House budget--to a degree we have never seen \nbefore. I think that much is not disputable.\n  President Bush had a $412 billion deficit at the time of the \nrecession he inherited and the war in which we found ourselves. Then it \ndropped until 2007 to $161 billion. This Congress, responding to the \nPresident's requests--without my vote--added another $150 billion and \nsent out the checks last spring, which did nothing good for the \neconomy, although everybody was glad to get the free money from \nWashington. That caused us to reach $455 billion in deficits for that \nyear--the largest in the history of the Republic outside of World War \nII. This year, the deficit will be $1,800 billion--four times that. \nNext year, we will be over a trillion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scores President Obama's 10-year \nbudget as averaging over $900 billion in deficit each year--almost $1 \ntrillion in deficit each year--with no plan to bring that down. In \nfact, it surges in the 10th year to $1.2 trillion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. The CBO is our group, a bipartisan office, \nthough the Democratic majority hires them. But basically we have a good \ngroup, and they are honest numbers. So that is what we are looking at.\n  To say President Bush's $455 billion deficit he had in his last \nyear--which every dime of that was appropriated by the Democratically \ncontrolled Congress--somehow excuses the path we are on today is \nunbelievable. The year before last, he had $161 billion. They are going \nto average $900 billion.\n  What does it mean in terms of interest? Most people can understand \nthis. When you borrow money--and we have to borrow the money. That is \nwhere we get the money. It doesn't drop out of the sky. If we print it, \nit debases the value of the currency. So we are borrowing. That is what \nwe plan to do, to borrow the money and pay interest. This year, \ninterest on our over $5 trillion debt is $170 billion.\n  This chart shows the trend of the interest this Government will pay \neach year on the debt we are now adding to each year in unprecedented \nrecord numbers. It goes from $170 billion in 10 years to $806 billion. \nThis is a thunderous alteration of our financial situation. This is not \npolitics; this is the President's budget as scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office. These are not my numbers but CBO's numbers.\n  I know the budget we have today on the floor is a 5-year budget. They \ndidn't like the looks of the President's 10-year budget, so my \ncolleagues cut it to a 5-year budget. There is nothing in this 5-year \nbudget that suggests there is any effort to contain the surging deficit \nin the outyears, which continues to surge. There is nothing in the \nbudget that suggests we are going to control entitlements or any other \nspending. In fact, Mr. Orszag, who used to be CBO Director but who is \nnow the President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nsays the Senate budget is essentially ``98 percent of what the \nPresident wanted.'' So it is essentially the same budget. It puts us on \nthe same path. You can spin it any way you want to, but that is true. \nThose of us here in the body know that. Anyone who is sophisticated \nabout it understands what is happening, and it is very troubling.\n  The President proposed an 11\\1/2\\-percent increase in domestic \nnondefense discretionary spending this year. That is a thunderous \nnumber, particularly in light of the fact that we just passed, a few \nweeks ago, a stimulus package that added $800 billion in spending on \ntop of all of the fundamental baseline spending we have. Scored over 10 \nyears, that is $1.2 trillion based on the interest to it.\n  So our colleagues in the Senate Budget Committee thought that didn't \nlook good and it was easier, I think, to just propose a 5-year budget \nso they wouldn't have to deal with these numbers out here. No changes \nwere made that would have actually created any real reduction in those \nnumbers. They propose, instead of an 11-percent increase in domestic \ndiscretionary spending, a 7-percent increase. That is on top of the \nstimulus package. Surely we all know that every penny of that stimulus \npackage was paid for by increased debt. We are already in deficits, so \nwhen you add another $800 billion, where do you get it? You borrow it.\n  You know the House is not outside of this game. They are in the game \ntoo. What does their budget do on nondefense discretionary spending? \nTheir budget projects an 11\\1/2\\- to 12-percent increase in \ndiscretionary spending. They passed their budget. So if we go to \nconference with this bill, the Senate will be at 7, the House will be \nat 11 or 12, the President is at 11 or 12, and I suspect we will come \nout with a budget that increases by about 10. Let me just note that an \n11\\1/2\\-percent increase over 7 years doubles your money. You know the \nrule of 7: If you have 7 percent on your money, in 10 years it doubles.\n  Here we are talking about a rate of increase that will double \nnondefense discretionary spending in 10 years--probably considerably \nless than that. That is why the baseline funding is important.\n  I have to note, in all frankness, that our Senate budget is less \nhonest--I will use that word for lack of a better one--than the \nPresident's. The President scored the cost of fixing the alternative \nminimum tax for 10 years, which he says will be about $600 billion.\n  The President also scored the cost of fixing our doctors' medical \npayments that, if we do not put money in, will drop down 20 percent. \nOur Senate budget doesn't fix that. So that is maybe how they make the \nnumbers look a little better. But I want to say these numbers are huge.\n  Madam President, what is the status of our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator has used 9 \nminutes 27 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to be notified when I have 6 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this is a dangerous exercise we are \nin. I want to say a couple of things. The surging of debt and interest \npayments is not due to an expectation by the Senate or the President \nthat we will be in a recession or in an economic slowdown. This is the \nonly year they are scoring us as having negative growth. The President \nexpects 3 percent next year and 4 percent the next and 3 years which is \nrobust growth. Those are the kinds of numbers that President Reagan and \nPresident Clinton had in their best years. So that is not why we are \ngoing deeper and deeper in debt with a $1 trillion 1-year debt in the \n10th year. It is because of spending.\n  States are facing financial crisis. This year States are expected to \nreduce their spending by 4.1 percent. Are they going to disappear from \nthe face of the Earth? No, they are making some tough decisions. They \nare wrestling with costs, fraud, accountability, efficiency, \nproductivity. We need to be doing that instead of throwing money at \nthis problem.\n  I suggest that, with the huge surge of stimulus funding, we ought to \nkeep the baseline level for 2 years. We will be spending huge amounts \nof money--65 percent more nondefense discretionary budget authority in \nthe first 2 years with the stimulus money pouring into the system. So I \nsuggest we could achieve a significant improvement in our long-term \nfiscal situation by saying during this time of stimulus spending we \nwill have a 2-year freeze and then we will go up to a 1-percent \nincrease.\n  Flat spending does not require us to savage anybody's budget. The \npower is given to our appropriators to work out exactly how some \nprograms might take more than others. Others could still get an \nincrease. But fundamentally we need to set here, as a principle, we are \ngoing to have a budget that actually contains baseline spending and it \nwill save $226 billion over 5 years. I project it would save at least \nthat much in the second 5, maybe more because the baseline of our \nbudget would not have gone up so much.\n  What about this interest on the increasing debt? It amounts, today, \nin 2009, that every household is paying to the Federal Government \n$1,435, just to pay the $170 billion in interest. That number in 5 \nyears, 2014, will increase to $3,433 per household, to pay the interest \non the debt. With interest rates increasing as we expect--unfortunately \nas they are going to be doing with this inflationary budget--the number \nmay well be twice that in 10 years. That is an unsustainable path.\n  I propose we take this step. It is a rational step in light of the \nhuge stimulus package we passed--without any cutting of total \nexpenditures but an unprecedented increase in our expenditures would \nstill occur with flat funding, level funding for 2 years and 1 percent \nfor 3 years. I think this is a rational approach we could be proud of.\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal noted that nations such as the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom will be tempted to use inflation \nto pay their massive debts. Households in the United States are among \nthe most indebted in the world. People on fixed incomes would be most \nhurt by inflationary rates. Other nations might also continue to \nborrow, creating more nations seeking to borrow more and more money, \ntherefore having to raise interest rates to get people to buy their \ndebt, which could mean that the estimate that in 2019 we would be \npaying 5.5 percent on our Treasury bills would probably be low. In \nfact, it could be much higher.\n  Indeed, Mr. Rogov was quoted in the Wall Street Journal. He is at \nHarvard. He was the chief economist for the International Monetary \nFund. He predicted--hold your hat. This is something new. He predicted \nthat inflation in the United States could hit up to 10 percent in the \nnext 3 to 5 years, all because of this incredible spending spree we are \non.\n  Let me say this to my colleagues. This country is going to come out \nof this economic problem. We don't have to spend irresponsibly now. We \nhave already spent an incredible amount of money in the stimulus \npackage. Our baseline budget needs to start getting frugal, to \nchallenge us to get more for less in the Federal Government. The best \nway the U.S. Government can help the American people and the American \neconomy is to use every dollar our Government gets wisely, to get the \nbest possible return for it. You will not get that kind of return \nthrowing money around as rapidly as we are throwing it today. In fact, \nI think it is a general acknowledgment that the surge in spending under \nthe stimulus package, plus 7, 8, 12 percent increase in general \nspending, will throw so much money so fast that our Presiding Officer, \nwho doesn't like waste, fraud, and abuse, is going to have a lot to do \nto watch out for it because, like her, we have been prosecutors and we \nknow that you have dangers out there in spending money unwisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe the issues we are talking about today are not \ninsignificant. They represent the direction the President of the United \nStates wants this country to go--which is huge spending without \ncompensating cuts, with tax increases but not enough to cover it--and \nthat this is an unsustainable path. This amendment would be a \nsignificant step in the right direction. With the stimulus package that \nhas already been passed this year, we will still have sizable increases \nin discretionary spending across the board, and we will be able to \ncarry on all requirements of our Government without having to spend \nthis much of our children's money.\n  Maybe we won't have to pay $806 billion a year in interest, when our \neducation and highway budgets will each be about $100 billion. The \neducation budget and the State general fund budget in Alabama, for the \nteachers and schools and highways and police and the Governor and the \nlegislature--all of that is less than $10 billion a year and we are \ntalking about $806 billion in interest? It is not responsible.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving this amendment their serious \nconsideration. I believe it is the right step and the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, when I hear the other side all of a \nsudden concerned about debt, it raises the question in my mind: Where \nwere they? Where were they over the last 8 years when their \nadministration doubled spending, doubled the debt as is shown in this \nchart, and they were voting for all of the policies that led to these \nresults? Now they come and all of a sudden they are very concerned \nabout debt. I have been concerned about debt the entire 22 years I have \nbeen here. But I also recognize that when you are in the sharpest \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression, trying to freeze spending \nor trying to cut spending or raise taxes doesn't make a whole lot of \nsense. That would make the downturn only worse.\n  Senator Gregg, who is the ranking member on the committee, recognized \nthat in a floor statement on March 11. I referred to this earlier \ntoday. March 11 is riveted in my mind because it is my daughter's \nbirthday. My birthday is the next day. And this year--you know, \ntypically Senator Gregg and I exchange birthday gifts. This year I got \nno present. I didn't even get a card. I did get this statement--which \nis very helpful. So I will take this as my gift. He said:\n\n       I'm willing to accept this short-term deficit and not \n     debate it because we are in a recession, and it's necessary \n     for the Government to step in and be aggressive and the \n     Government is the last source of liquidity. And so you can \n     argue that this number, although horribly large, is something \n     we will simply have to live with.\n\n  He was right then. I say it is very clear, if we are going to have \nany kind of rational economic policy, we have to be taking the steps \nnecessary to prevent a much steeper slide. That is the near term. In \nthe longer term we have to pivot and get this debt under control. That \nis critically important. This budget seeks to do that by cutting the \ndeficit by two-thirds by 2014.\n  Under the budget resolution we go from $1.7 trillion of deficit this \nyear--most of which is a responsibility of the previous administration \nbecause we are living off their last budget.\n  Then we are going to cut the deficit $500 billion in this resolution \nbefore us, the next year cut it another $300 billion, the next year cut \nit another $300 billion and get it down to $508 billion by the fifth \nyear, a more than two-\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nthirds reduction. If you measure it the way economists prefer, we are \nreducing the deficit from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2009 down to 2.9 \npercent in 2014. That is a very substantial reduction, a reduction of \nmore than three-quarters over the 5 years of this budget.\n  With respect to the question of spending, let me be clear what this \nbudget does. On discretionary spending, both defense and nondefense, we \nbring the spending down as a share of GDP in both categories and by \nabout the same amount. For example, defense in 2010 is 4.8 percent of \nGDP. At the end of the budget period, we will have reduced it to 3.7 \npercent of GDP. Nondefense discretionary this year is 4.7 percent of \nGDP. By 2014, we will have reduced it to 3.6 percent of GDP, a roughly \nproportionate reduction in both defense and nondefense discretionary \nspending.\n  On domestic discretionary spending, the percent of the GDP under the \nbudget resolution is reduced from 4.3 percent in 2010 to 3.2 percent in \n2014. On total domestic discretionary spending--and this excludes \ninternational--we bring it down from 4.3 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent \nof GDP.\n  Let me be clear: The average annual increase in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending under this budget resolution is 2.5 percent. \nThat is a pretty tough budget. Anybody who doesn't think it is a tough \nbudget, come and join me in my office for the next 2 hours and see the \nphone calls I am getting from colleagues and others who say: Won't you \nadd a little more here or a little more there. I have to say: No, no, \nno. Why? Because we have to get on a more sustainable budget course.\n  The increases we do have, where do they go? Where does the money go? \nThirty-seven percent of the increase in discretionary goes for regular \ndefense funding. International is the next biggest increase, 14 \npercent; that is, 14 percent of the increase that we have provided in \ntotal discretionary goes for international funding. Why did we do that? \nBecause, again, in the previous administration, they kept hiding money. \nThey kept it out of the budget, and they kept putting it into \nsupplemental appropriations bills in order to try to hide the ball. We \nare not hiding the ball. We are laying it right out there.\n  I had both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State call \nme the weekend before last, asking me to do more for international \nfunding. It is very rare. I have never had the Secretary of Defense on \nany budget call me and ask me to have more funding for international \naccounts. Why did he do that? He made it very clear that we have been \nfunding in the defense budget things that more properly belong in the \nState Department budget. I had to tell the Secretary of State and the \nSecretary of Defense I was having to cut that line by $4 billion from \nthe President's request, still providing an increase but reducing the \namount the President requested by $4 billion. Why did I do that? I did \nthat because we lost $2 trillion from the revenue forecast. When you \nlose $2 trillion, guess what. You have to make some changes. Ten \npercent of the discretionary increase is for veterans. We have given \nveterans the biggest increase in the history of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. We have done it because we recognize these vets are coming \nhome, and they deserve the best health care we can provide. Ten percent \nof the increase is in education. Ten percent is in income security; 8 \npercent for the census. We have to do a census every 10 years. It costs \nmoney. So 8 percent of the increase was for the census. Six percent is \nfor natural resources, to try to reduce our dependence on foreign oil; \n3 percent for transportation; 2 percent is other. That is where the \nmoney has gone.\n  Again, I emphasize, here is the amount of spending increase for \nnondefense discretionary spending over the 5 years of this budget. It \naverages 2.5 percent a year. That is one of the most conservative \nbudgets anybody has brought to this floor in a very long time. It is a \nresponse to the need to get back to more sustainable deficit numbers. \nWe have done it, reducing the deficit by two-thirds over the next 5 \nyears.\n  How much time remains on my side? I note the Senator from Texas is \nhere, and we would like to accommodate her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much does Senator Sessions have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from Texas like?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the remaining 3\\1/2\\ minutes of Senator Sessions' \nand a minute and a half of my time so the Senator from Texas has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is that going to take away anything you need from \nyour side? Are you saying there is only 3\\1/2\\ minutes left on our side \non this?\n  Mr. CONRAD. On this amendment. But I am happy to yield the Senator a \nminute and a half of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee because \nI know he has tried very hard to do something better than the budget \ndelivered by President Obama and tried to cut back on the deficit. In \nfact, they have cut back on the deficit. But they have only cut back on \nthe deficit because they made it a 5-year bill instead of a 10-year \nbill. That is a problem. Because if you take this 5-year bill and \nextend it 10 years, it is still going to have the same impact. The \nimpact is, this budget is going to double the national debt in 5 years, \nand it will triple the national debt when it is taken out to its 10-\nyear maximum. In fact, I am hoping we can do some amending on this \nbill. I am hoping there will be enough time for us to talk about the \nprinciples in this bill. This is going to set our country on a course, \nthe likes of which we haven't seen since World War II.\n  In fact, the Obama budget creates more debt than under every \nPresident from George Washington to George W. Bush combined. That is \nthe 100-year budget put forward by the administration. By 2019, under \nthis proposal, the public debt would exceed 80 percent of GDP. That is \nmore than twice the historic average and the highest since World War \nII.\n  We have looked, since we have been in this financial crisis, at the \nmodels of the past, when we have been in recessions and even looking at \nthe Depression. There are people who have taken the Roosevelt model. \nWhen we have looked at historians' viewpoints of the New Deal, in 1941, \nFederal debt was only about 40 percent of the GDP. Today the national \ndebt is at 57 percent of GDP. I think we are looking at a very slippery \nslope. In fact, it was said on March 20 by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office that the dimensions of the debt problem in \nthe President's budget are that it is one-third more--actually, it \nwould add $9.3 trillion, about a trillion every year--than the Obama \nadministration had estimated when it sent the budget over.\n  We need to look at some of the bipartisan, nonpartisan economists and \norganizations looking at this budget. I hope we can have a reality \ncheck. We are getting ready to take a step that is continuing what has \nhappened in the last 2 months. We passed a $1 trillion stimulus package \nand then a $1 trillion Omnibus appropriations bill within a 2-week \nperiod. Now we are looking at a $1 trillion deficit, adding to the debt \nevery single year.\n  On Sunday, March 29, David Broder said in his column:\n\n       The Democratic Congress is about to perform a cover-up on \n     the most serious threat to America's economic future. The \n     real threat is the monstrous debt resulting from the slump in \n     revenue and the staggering sums being committed by Washington \n     to rescuing embattled banks and homeowners in the absence of \n     any serious strategy for paying it back.\n\n  In 10 years, the President's budget will spend more on interest \npayments than on education, energy, and transportation combined. Under \nthe President's budget, the debt per household for fiscal year 2010 \nwould be $78,000. Every household in America would have a debt of \n$78,000. This ever-growing national debt is going to require larger \nannual interest payments, with much of that money going overseas, as we \nknow, because foreign entities own 25 percent of our public debt. The \nChinese Government already owns about $1 trillion in U.S. debt. What is \ngoing to be their answer when they see this debt continuing to go up? \nMany of us are concerned that they are going to either say: We are not \ngoing to buy any more debt. Then we would be in a downward spiral from \nwhich I don't see a recovery plan. Or they may say: The\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nrisk is greater and, therefore, we are going to charge a higher \ninterest rate. What is that going to do in these very fragile economic \ntimes?\n  I appreciate the time given by the majority. There will be amendments \noffered and there will be substitutes. I hope we can have some \nbipartisanship so we could have a budget that maybe all of us would \nagree is the right path for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to correct a statement of \nthe Senator from Texas. She said the only change we made to reduce \ndeficits from what the President has proposed was, we went from a 10-\nyear budget to a 5-year budget. That is not the case. We did go from a \n10-year to a 5-year budget, because in the 34 times Congress has done a \nbudget, 30 of those 34 times it has been a 5-year budget. The reason \nfor that change is the second 5 years of forecasts are notoriously \nunreliable--notoriously unreliable.\n\n  The reason we have substantial savings from the President's budget \nover the 5 years of our budget--in fact, we have $608 billion of \nsavings from the President's budget, comparing his 5 years to our 5 \nyears--is because we cut spending, not only discretionary spending, but \nwe cut mandatory spending, and we had revenue changes. The combined \nresult is a savings of $608 billion over 5 years. So we have $608 \nbillion less of deficits and debt. That is the fact.\n  I see the very distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Is he seeking time or would he prefer to--the chairman has \nasked to defer for a couple minutes until he is prepared to discuss \nthis amendment.\n  Madam President, could I ask, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Nine minutes. Then the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee still has 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes total left on the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. I thought there were 10 minutes, under the \norder, reserved for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has used part of \nthat time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, Madam President, I do not know how that would occur \nwithout my being notified, but let me ask unanimous consent that the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee be given the 10 minutes that \nwas intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the budget resolution we are considering \nnow proposes to increase discretionary nondefense spending by $35 \nbillion from the level approved in fiscal year 2009. My colleagues \nshould all understand that this is $15 billion less than was requested \nby President Obama.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am not particularly \npleased that the resolution has cut the President's request by $15 \nbillion. We on the Appropriations Committee know that in order to meet \nthe level proposed by the Budget Committee, we will have to make real \ncuts in the budget proposed by President Obama.\n  But I must say that I am surprised that we are now facing an \namendment which would seek to cut discretionary spending even more. As \nI stand here, I find myself somewhat at a disadvantage to explain all \nthe impacts that would occur if further cuts are made.\n  While we know the overall parameters of the President's budget, we do \nnot yet have most of the details on the thousands of programs which \nwill be reviewed in detail by the Appropriations Committee. That \ninformation is not available to the Congress at this moment. So we \nreally do not know which programs that have been supported by the \nSenate in years past will be proposed for cuts or elimination. We do \nnot know which fees or offsetting collections might be buried in the \nPresident's request that the Congress is likely to insist on \neliminating, adding to the unfunded costs in the budget. We also know \nthat nearly all of our colleagues will be asking for items that will \nnot be included in the request. We know that many of you will be \nwriting our various subcommittees urging that we adopt new programs and \ninitiatives that might be incorporated in this budget. And we know this \nfor sure: The committee will face a much larger burden than just \nidentifying $15 billion that can be reduced by the President's request.\n  With the few details we have already received about the budget \nrequest, there are a few things that we know would result by freezing \nnondefense discretionary spending.\n  First, my colleagues should all be advised that the largest single \nincrease in the domestic spending budget for fiscal year 2010 will be \nfor the census. A $4.5 billion increase is necessary to meet our \nconstitutional responsibility. This amount is needed in fiscal year \n2010. It cannot be delayed. The timeliness and accuracy of the census \nwill be in jeopardy if we do not fund this amount.\n  Second, we are advised that the budget will include a $3.5 billion \nincrease for the Veterans' Administration to cover the cost of medical \ncare inflation, as well as projected increases in VA enrollment, and \nnew initiatives such as the proposal to expand VA health care to over \n500,000 modest-income veterans.\n  Increased veterans health care services and specialty care services \ntargeted at the growing population of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \ninclude prosthetics, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, \nwhich would have to be curtailed if we freeze spending. Surely, the \nsponsors of this amendment do not want us to cut these needed increases \nfor our veterans.\n  Madam President, if I may be personal at this juncture--and this is \nnot in my prepared text--I had the privilege and honor of serving in \nthe Army of the United States during World War II. I was literally a \nyoung boy. I was 18 when I got in. But I know a few things about that \nwar.\n  My regiment, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, has been declared to \nbe the most decorated unit of its size in World War II. It also had one \nof the highest casualty numbers of any war.\n  We began our battles in Italy in June of 1944, and the war ended in \nMay of 1945. In those 11 months, we began our service with 5,000 men, \ninfantry men. At the end of 11 months, over 12,000 had gone through the \nranks, all brought about because of the necessity of replacements to \nreplace those who had been wounded in action. So when our men got \ninvolved in a major battle--I remember one battle that lasted 5 days. \nAt the end of the battle, our casualty rate was 800, and of that number \n250 dead. When you see these numbers, somehow Iraq becomes \ninconsequential: four today, three tomorrow. But at that time, times \nwere a little different. For example, if I had been wounded in Baghdad, \nI would have been evacuated from that site of battle to the hospital \nwithin 30 minutes by helicopter.\n  On my last battle, when I received three wounds--my arm, my gut, my \nleg--I had to be evacuated by stretcher. Evacuation began at 3 o'clock \nin the afternoon. I got to the hospital at midnight--9 hours. So it \nsounds unbelievable, but with all the casualties we have had, not one \ndouble-amputee survived the war. And we had dozens of them, but they \nbled to death because of the long evacuation. Not one brain injury case \nsurvived because of the long evacuation. Not one spinal injury case \nsurvived because of the long evacuation. Today, they are all surviving, \nand this amount will cut it out. Help for them will disappear.\n  On a final note, I think about this and I chuckle. When I was taken \nto the hospital at midnight, we were put into a tent about half the \nsize of this Chamber. Hundreds were lined up on stretchers, and teams \nof doctors and nurses would go down the line, look at the medical card, \nand whisper among themselves--and you could hear--``No. 1,'' ``No. 2,'' \n``No. 3.'' By the time it got to me--I sensed that ``No. 1'' meant: \nSend him immediately to the operating room; ``No. 2'' meant: Oh, his \ninjury is not that serious, he can wait; ``No. 3'' was: You have done a \ngood job for us. Thank you. So people would see the Chaplain going to \nall the No. 3's.\n  The Chaplain came to me. I did not know, but I was designated a No. \n3, and the Chaplain said: Son, God loves you.\n  I looked at the Chaplain, and I said: Chaplain, I know God loves me, \nbut I am not ready to see Him yet.\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\n  So here I am.\n  What I am trying to say, is that in that war, seriously injured \nsoldiers did not survive. And maybe in a sense, it is God's gift. I \nwould hate to think of myself lying in bed the rest of my life looking \nat the ceiling.\n  But they survived, and I think it is our responsibility. This \namendment would cut that out.\n  If I may proceed further, third, we know that the budget will include \na $250 million increase to cut down on overpayments in Social Security. \nWe know this from experience, that for every $1 we spend, we save $10 \nin inappropriate payments. Isn't that a good investment? By spending \n$250 million, we are going to save billions. I thought the business was \nnot in spending but in saving. We would lose more than $2 billion in \nmandatory savings by freezing discretionary funds.\n  Fourth, we have an amount of $183 million, which would be cut out. We \nare told by the Department of Agriculture that an additional $183.5 \nmillion will be needed simply to maintain existing rental assistance \nagreements. This assistance provides subsidies to maintain affordable \nrent and utility costs for very low-income rural residents. Without \nthis increase, 41,705 households will face substantial rent increases \nforcing many to leave, be evicted from their homes.\n\n  I know the sponsors are not seeking to force the poor from their \nhomes.\n  Madam President, as you preside and as I speak, we should keep in \nmind that many of our fellow citizens are sweating out each day, not \nknowing whether he or she has a job tomorrow or whether they can keep \nup the payments on the mortgage or whether they can pay for health care \nor whether they can pay the rent. Without this, all hope is gone. The \nleast we can do is to let them know we are here to help them get \nthrough this crisis.\n  Yes, there is another one.\n  Fifth, we know about potential accidents at airports. We know we do \nnot have enough trained air traffic controllers. This resolution \nprovides funds for that purpose, to train them so we may have safer \ntraveling.\n  When I travel, which is not often enough, I go to Hawaii. It takes, \njust in flying time, 11 hours. I feel safe because I have confidence in \nour air traffic controllers. But many of them are now on the verge of \nretiring. We need a new crew. This budget resolution provides the funds \nfor training them.\n  The FAA faces a crisis in maintaining an adequate workforce of \ntrained air traffic controllers with a freeze in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending for 2010, the FAA would be forced to freeze or \nreduce the number of new air traffic controllers the agency can bring \non board and train--worsening the experience shortage we already have \nin our air traffic control towers. With a freeze in funding, the FAA \nalso would be unable to settle an ongoing dispute over the terms of its \ncontract with its air traffic controllers. This dispute has hurt the \nagency's productivity and its ability to retain experienced \ncontrollers, who are essential to training the agency's newly hired \ncontrollers.\n  Sixth, the section 8 tenant-based account provides critical resources \nto help the Nation's most vulnerable families find and maintain safe \nand affordable housing in the private market. Congress provides annual \nfunding adjustments for this program to cover housing cost increases, \nso that all families served by the program can maintain their housing. \nIf nondefense discretionary spending were frozen in fiscal year 2010, \nhousing agencies wouldn't have the necessary resources to cover these \nincreased costs. As a result, tens of thousands of families could be at \nrisk of losing their housing.\n  Seventh, we know that because of high food costs and other factors, \nthe overall cost of the WIC program has already increased dramatically. \nIn fiscal year 2009, $760,000,000 above the budget request was required \nto keep people from losing WIC benefits. A freeze on spending could \ncause no new participation, waitlists, and could potentially cause some \npeople to lose benefits.\n  As I noted earlier, we simply do not have all the details of the \nbudget to be able to explain to our colleagues all the harm that a \nfreeze on discretionary spending will do.\n  Nonetheless, I believe from the information that we have already \nreceived that I just listed it is clear that we simply cannot sustain \nadditional cuts in the request.\n  These economic times are tough. But in tough times our people count \non the Federal Government for more services.\n  Each day as more wage earners lose their jobs, more of them become \neligible for many of the assistance programs which I have highlighted. \nMany of these programs are designed to help people in need during \ndifficult economic times.\n  Our efforts to reduce spending here will result in an even greater \nreliance on mandatory programs such as welfare rolls, food stamps, and \npublic assistance.\n  For these reasons I must oppose the amendment from the Senator from \nAlabama, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  Madam President, as I said, I am going to vote against this \namendment. It is a bad amendment. It is not American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to urge my colleagues \nto support the budget resolution that came out of the Budget Committee. \nI am proud to serve on the Budget Committee. I congratulate Senator \nConrad for his extraordinary work in bringing out a well-balanced \nbudget resolution during extremely difficult times. I think we all know \nthe economic crisis we are in, and Senator Conrad's budget does what a \nbudget should do. It is the blueprint of our Nation's priorities. \nPresident Obama brought forward a budget that gives new hope for \nAmerica's future. Then Senator Conrad had to fit those priorities into \nthe realities of our revenues.\n  We all know we have the new Congressional Budget Office numbers. It \nshows the economy is a lot weaker than when President Obama submitted \nhis budget. But Senator Conrad's budget fits the priorities of \nPresident Obama into the realities of our projected revenues. I thank \nSenator Conrad for bringing forward this budget.\n  President Obama inherited an economic mess. That is worth repeating. \nTake a look at the mess the President inherited. The Congressional \nBudget Office shows it is more severe than President Obama thought when \nhe first took office.\n  The deficit in 2000, when President Bush took office, was not a \ndeficit. It was a surplus of $236 billion. Congress worked hard during \nthose years to balance the Federal budget. In 2009, we are now \nprojecting a deficit of $1.75 trillion. How did we get there? There has \nbeen a lot of time spent going over the mistakes that have been made \nover the last 8 years. But we had tax cuts we did not pay for. We had \nspending we did not pay for. We had a war in Iraq we never budgeted for \ncorrectly. And we ignored the underlying problems of our economy.\n  The Bush administration took our health care system, which had 40 \nmillion people without health insurance from when President Bush took \noffice, to a health care system that now has 47 million people without \nhealth insurance. Health costs in America grew during those years to be \ntwice any other industrial nation's spending on health care. We do not \nhave the results to reflect that type of economic expenditures.\n  We found that the Bush administration wanted to privatize our health \ncare system. As a result, we spent more money--more money on \nprescription drugs because we only used a private insurance option; \nmore money for private insurance within Medicare, paying those who \nenroll in private insurance more than the Government would pay if they \nstayed in traditional Medicare. This past administration did everything \nit could to privatize even if it cost more public money.\n  In energy, the Bush administration never dealt with the energy \nproblems of our country. We became more dependent rather than less \ndependent upon imported energy sources. This prior administration \nsubsidized the oil industry, even knowing full well that the energy we \nimported very much affected our national security and the moneys we had \nto spend on national security.\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\n  We now have these large deficits. We cannot do anything about that. \nPresident Obama inherited these deficits. He also inherited a \ngovernmental system that failed to deal with the underlying problems of \nour economy.\n  President Obama says there is a different course. If we take the same \ntype of budget and do that for our future and try to address the \ndeficits today, we are going to have the deficits of tomorrow. We need \nto deal with the underlying problems.\n\n  President Obama has submitted a very open and honest budget. He is \nactually budgeting for the costs of government rather than saying, \nWell, we will pay for it after the fact. He has tackled the tough \nproblems of our time, and he is prepared to make difficult choices to \nmeet tomorrow's challenges.\n  The first issue this budget deals with is the economic problems of \nour Nation. We need to make that our top priority. The budget allows \nfor investment in job creation. We are losing over 500,000 jobs a month \nin America today--about 600,000. We have been doing that now for the \nlast several months because of the economic crisis. This budget allows \nus to invest in job creation so we can provide new jobs for Americans. \nIt provides money in the hands of consumers. Middle-class tax cuts are \nextended. The AMT--alternative minimum tax--relief is provided. We \nextend the marriage penalty provisions to avoid the marriage penalty. \nThere are credits for savers. The estate tax issue is accommodated in \nthe budget. So the budget provides for the realities of a recession \nthat consumers need to have more money in their family budgets in order \nto help stimulate our economy.\n  The budget Senator Conrad has brought forward protects critical \nprograms for Americans to meet economic challenges, whether it is \nunemployment insurance, health care, veterans, transportation, job \ntraining, research, education, or small business issues. I wish to \nmention for 1 minute the SBA, the Small Business Administration. We all \nknow if we are going to get out of this recession, we need to create \njobs, and we create jobs mainly through small businesses. Over 99 \npercent of America's businesses are small businesses, and they are \nparticularly vulnerable today. Most of our job growth comes from small \ncompanies. The President has brought forward initiatives that allow for \nthe SBA loan programs--the 7(a) program and the 504 program--to be less \ncostly to small business. He has also instructed Treasury to go out and \nhelp with the secondary markets to make money available for small \nbusiness loans. We need a Small Business Administration that can \nprovide the services to small businesses. During the Bush years, the \nSBA budget was decimated. This will allow the SBA to have the resources \nnecessary not only to administer these programs but to provide \ncounseling and mentoring to small businesses and to oversee what other \nFederal agencies do to make sure that small businesses get their fair \nshare of government procurement contracts. I particularly appreciate \nthe fact that the Budget Committee passed an amendment I offered that \nincreased the SBA's budget to $880 million, up from $700 million. That \nmoney is going to be used for the right reasons.\n  This budget also deals with fiscal responsibility. It deals with the \neconomic crisis but also with fiscal responsibility. The President's \ngoal was to halve the budget deficit in 5 years. Well, it has gone \nbeyond that. The budget Senator Conrad has brought to the floor will \ntake the budget deficit from $1.7 trillion this year to 5 years from \nnow a budget deficit of $508 billion. We want to see it lower than \nthat, but reducing it by two-thirds over that period of time is \ncertainly moving in the right direction. That is fiscal responsibility. \nThat is making the tough decisions. It also allows us, when we get out \nof this recession, to deal with the underlying problems in our economy.\n  We deal with energy in this budget by allowing a cap-and-trade system \nso we can become energy independent for the sake of our national \nsecurity; so we can create good jobs for the sake of our economy; so we \ncan reduce carbon emissions for the sake of our environment. Global \nclimate change is a real problem, and this budget allows us to deal \nwith it by creating jobs and reducing the deficit, while also dealing \nwith energy independence.\n  It deals with the underlying problems in our health care system by \nallowing our committees to bring out legislation that will provide for \nuniversal health coverage for the 47 million Americans who don't have \nhealth insurance; by moving forward with preventive health care which \nwe know will save money; by improving health information technology \nwhich will save money; by investing in research which will give us the \nanswers to how to deal with the health challenges of tomorrow; by \nimproving our Medicare system to deal with physician reimbursement \nrates, and an amendment I offered that deals with the outpatient \ntherapy caps. So our committees will be able to deal with the health \ncare issues that will, if we don't deal with them, add to the budget \ndeficits of the future.\n  We invest in education, from Head Start to making college affordable. \nThe 1979 Pell grants covered 70 percent of the tuition and fees of \npublic 4-year colleges. Today, it is less than one-third. We need to do \nbetter in making college affordable. The Obama budget does that. The \nConrad budget does that. It invests in America's future so we can meet \nthe challenges of the future so we will have an easier time, not only \nbalancing our budgets in the future, but having the type of economic \ngrowth this Nation needs.\n  I wish to deal with one last issue on which there is disagreement in \nour caucus, and that is reconciliation instructions. I regret that the \nbudget does not bring forward reconciliation instructions, particularly \non the energy issue. I know there is a bad taste among my colleagues on \nthe use of reconciliation, considering how it has been used in the past \nwith the Republican leadership to bring about tax cuts. It is supposed \nto be used to reduce the deficit. In fact, they increased the deficit \nand that was wrong, but the proper use of reconciliation instructions \ncan help us reduce the Federal deficit and avoid the misuse by the \nminority of filibusters. Does anyone here believe that the right number \nof filibusters has been used by the minority over the last years? Of \ncourse not. It has been used way too often.\n  So what proper budget reconciliation instructions will allow us to do \nis have an up-or-down vote on a critical issue that is important to \nreducing the deficit. Why do I say that? Because the cap and trade will \nproduce $237 billion of revenue over the next 5 years. Some of that \nrevenue will be used for direct--direct--deficit reduction. If we do \nthe cap-and-trade system right, if we become energy independent--we all \nknow the secondary impact of becoming energy independent, of not having \nto bring our energy in from foreign sources--it will help us balance \nour budgets in the future. We also know if we do it right and use the \nmarket forces, as a cap-and-trade system will do, we will create good \ngreen jobs here in America, using American technology, keeping jobs \nhere. That will also help us balance the budget in the future.\n  So I hope we will get back in time to the proper use of \nreconciliation instructions. That was part of budget reform, and that \nshould be included in our budget document.\n  However, today we have a choice on the resolution that is before us. \nI strongly support the budget resolution that came out of the \ncommittee. We have a choice. We can continue down the same path we have \nin the past, which is not dealing with the underlying problems of our \ncountry--and I dare say we will have a much more difficult time \nbalancing our budgets in the future, and certainly being competitive \ninternationally, as we need to be for the sake of growth of our \neconomy--or we can choose a different direction for our economy; one \nthat embraces fiscal responsibility; one that provides an opportunity \nto reform our health care system; one that allows us to have an energy \npolicy that not only brings about energy independence but does it in a \nway that will reduce greenhouse gases and deal with the international \nissue of global climate change; and one that will invest in the \ncritical investments for America's future, including education. That \nchoice is the one offered by the budget brought out by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the budget resolution so we can \nchange the\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\ndirection of America, so we can invest in our future, so we not only \ndeal with the economic crisis we are in today, we not only deal with \nthe budget deficits we are facing, but we deal with the underlying \nproblems and invest in America's future. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the budget resolution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the economics of \nthis issue and talk about it from the Joint Economic Committee \nperspective, as I am ranking member on that committee. There are a lot \nof problems within this budget as far as what it does to the overall \neconomy, and I think we are going to see some of it as we go through a \nfew of these charts.\n  The problem I see overall and one of the things we have to watch the \nmost, as far as its impact on the overall economy, is what the percent \nof the Federal Government is of the overall economy. The problem with \nthis budget and the deficits and the financing that takes place in \nfuture years is we are going to start moving this government from being \nroughly and normally somewhere below 20 percent of the economy as far \nas intake--the taking of taxes--to somewhere north of there, probably \naround 23 percent. We normally average around 18 percent of the economy \nbeing taken by the Federal Government in taxes. This budget moves us, \nover a period of years, to 23 percent. That is completely \nunsustainable. It is harmful. We have been somewhere close to that. We \nhaven't been that high. We have been somewhere close to that in the \npast. Whenever we have been, it has had significantly bad economic \nconsequences for our overall economy.\n  That is just the take. I am afraid what we have going on is too much \na philosophy of ``spend it and the taxes will come,'' so that we go \nahead and spend this money into the economy and taxes will build up and \nincrease so that over a period of years we spend it in deficit form and \nstart financing the taxes, so we edge up that percentage from 18 \npercent of what the Federal Government takes to 23 percent over a \nperiod of years, while we get people hooked to the spending early on \nand say, isn't this a great program? We have spent it on school \nbuildings, and on this program, and on that program. Don't you love \nthat? Isn't that great? Yes. We have to build the taxes up now to pay \nfor it. We get a wholly unsustainable situation for the Federal \neconomy. And that is not anything about the State or local share of it, \nwhich adds to it, and then people are working half of the year for the \nGovernment and not working enough of the year for themselves. That \ndoesn't work.\n  I hope we can back up, philosophically, for a little bit and think \nwhere we want to be as a government. I think it is important that we \nlook at it. Thomas Jefferson, in the first inaugural address he gave--\nhe is one of the greatest minds ever to be in this country and one of \nthe great public policy thinkers. He said this:\n\n       A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from \n     injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free \n     to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, \n     and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has \n     earned. This is the sum of good government. . . .\n\n  So it is the limited focus of Government that everybody recognizes, \nwhich Jefferson said it should be, one of our country's great minds. It \nis this limited view of Government and a maximum view of personal \nresponsibility and opportunity that has produced this vibrant, active, \ngrowth-oriented country for 200-plus years. Do we want to move away \nfrom that to an economy that is much more stagnant, more Government \ndriven, rather than individual driven? Certainly we need to do things \nin particular areas, such as in the financial market structure, no \nquestion about that. But do you want to fundamentally move away from \nthis idea Jefferson spoke of regarding what Government is to be about: \n``A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring \none another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their \nown pursuit of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the \nmouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good \ngovernment. . . .''\n  Jefferson then warned about the perils of excess taxation, excess \nspending, and excess debt, all three of which are present in this \nbudget. He warned that ``We must not let our rulers load us with \nperpetual debt.'' We are getting close to that with this budget. ``We \nmust make our selection between economic and liberty or profusion and \nservitude.'' He was saying, look, we either move forward as a free \neconomy or there is going to be servitude in the process. His warning \nwas that big Government, with its excessive spending and taxation, \ninevitably strips its citizens of their liberties. Yet here we are \ntoday, heeding the notion ``spend and the money will come.'' Spend it \nand people will attach it to a government program, and the taxes will \nflow thereafter. It doesn't comport with what Jefferson said. It won't \nwork.\n  I believe it is a fatal error to assume that higher spending today \nwill generate higher future tax revenues. The proposed budget amounts \nto an ever-increasing size of Government, and at some point we will \nhave to face up to the massive Government we have created through \nmassive tax increases, which will chip away at economic growth and \nthreaten the principles of freedom and the pursuit of happiness on \nwhich our Nation was founded and has thus far prospered.\n  On top of this, you have this demographic nightmare coming of the \nfull-scale retirement of the baby boomer generation. So you are \nupscaling your Government spending and your taxes, and then you are \ngoing to have a bunch of people getting into the retirement system, \ngetting Medicare, Social Security, all of which they have paid for and \nearned, but adding more to the growth of government, more to the demand \nfor more tax increases, and taking away more from the liberty of \nindividuals.\n  More than any budget debate during the time I have been in Congress, \nthis debate isn't simply about the spending priorities of the next 5 \nyears; it is a debate about what kind of economy we will leave not just \nto the next generation but generations to come. It is a debate about \nwhether we believe that what made America great will keep America \ngreat. It is a philosophical debate. It is about the proper role of \nGovernment. Do we believe that the strength of America lies in its \nGovernment and its political leaders or that the strength of America \nlies with the American people? That is a fundamental question. Is it \nbetter for the Government to decide who runs GM or is it better for GM \nto decide who runs it?\n  Do we believe that the best opportunity to rebuild this economy is a \nfree enterprise system that encourages investment, encourages \nentrepreneurs to start new businesses, and empowers our citizens to \npursue their dreams and aspirations or do we believe the Government \nshould act as head of a household, determining what is in the best \ninterest of our families? How we answer that question will determine if \nwe begin the inexorable slide toward an America where the Government \ntells you how much you can earn or who will be deemed ``acceptable'' to \nrun the Nation's enterprises. How we answer that question will \ndetermine whether we are willing to accept mediocrity and condemn \nfuture generations to an America with fewer economic liberties and \nopportunities. Make no mistake, as our economic liberties disappear, \nnot just our children but our grandchildren and their children will see \ntheir political liberties slip further away. Government will become the \nmaster of the people, not their servant.\n  Unfortunately, the spending, taxes, and debt contained in the budget \noutline submitted by the President and the one reported by the Budget \nCommittee represent a statement that Government knows best, and that we \nshould trust in Government before we trust in a free people.\n  I will talk about the budget suggested by the President and reported \nby the Budget Committee interchangeably because they are essentially \nthe same. The only true differences come from the use of budget \ngimmicks and sleights of hand that attempt to make this budget look \nmore ``responsible'' than the one the President has put forward. They \nare almost identical. I have a chart that points that out where they \nare on discretionary outlays and total outlays. They are the same.\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\n  The American people deserve an honest discussion of the budget and \nthe spending and taxes it contemplates. They deserve to know that the \npolicies contemplated by this budget will add more to the national debt \nover the next 10 years than in all the years from the founding of this \nNation until 2008. In fact, according to CBO's estimates, the publicly \nheld debt of the United States will triple over the next 10 years under \nthis budget.\n  It is not simply the dollar amount of the debt that should concern \nus, it is the size of the publicly held debt in relation to the size of \nthe economy. According to CBO's estimate, the publicly held debt will \nrise to more than 82 percent of GDP by 2019. That is a level seen only \nonce in our Nation's history--in the extraordinary time of World War \nII. Yet this comparably massive-sized deficit will come with a \nsignificant reduction in defense spending. We did that spending in \nWorld War II to pay for war. This has a cut in defense spending.\n  As bad as these numbers are, I am concerned that the situation this \nbudget will put us in is likely to be worse, not better, to the overall \neconomy. Not only were the economic assumptions used by the President \noverly optimistic, I am concerned that those used by the CBO in \ncreating the baseline are too optimistic.\n  I want to talk about this chart. We talk too much about taxes and too \nmuch spending, and it goes too much in debt. This tells a lot of that \nsituation. You can see about debt held by the public as a percent of \nGDP. This is the average--about 35 percent for a long period of time. \nYou can see that at times, we dipped below that at different points, \nand then you can see what happens in 2008 and that this shoots up in a \ndramatic way--not to pay for war. What that debt number shoots up to is \ndramatic.\n\n  The point is that this is ``spend it and the taxes will come.'' What \nare you going to do if you cannot sustain the amount of debt? You are \ngoing to raise taxes to pay for that.\n  While CBO projects a larger decline in GDP during fiscal year 2009 \nthan the blue chip consensus, CBO projects a brighter outlook going \nforward through 2015. CBO also projects lower inflation, interest \nrates, and unemployment than the private forecasters. I don't think \nthat is probably likely assumptions to actually happen. For instance, \nthese different assumptions result in significantly higher deficits \nthan forecast by the administration. You can see on the chart of the \nObama budget deficit what is projected. These are budget deficits under \nblue chip assumptions. Even that big number of deficit increases \nprobably--it masks the true picture, which is much worse than that. It \nresults in about $2 trillion more in publicly held debt by 2019 than \nprojected by the administration. You can see these dollar numbers. You \ncan see the side bar being trillions instead of billions and millions. \nYou can see it goes from $8 trillion up to nearly $18 trillion. That is \nthe likely scenario, actually, versus what the Obama administration is \nsaying, around $15 billion, which it would be by 2019. That is $2 \ntrillion more.\n  This budget spends too much. There are many important priorities that \nmay have to be delayed. It is no different than what American families \ndo when things get difficult. They figure out what the priorities are \nand they go with it.\n  Suggesting that the new administration's budget reflects a ``new era \nof responsibility'' is like bestowing claims of prudence and \nreliability on the mortgage brokers who contributed to the housing \nbubble and ensuing economic crisis by carelessly selling unscrupulous \nand inferior loans. It is neither responsible budget nor fair nor \nefficient to use the current economic crisis as a means to expand \nGovernment spending to unsustainable levels financed entirely through \ndeficit spending and ultimately higher taxes on individuals. The \nGovernment is effectively charging its excessive consumption to the \ntaxpayers' credit card, except that the beneficiaries of that \nconsumption will not be the ones who pay off the debt. Rather, today's \nyoung workers and future generations will bear the burden of this \nGovernment's undisciplined spending. We are essentially forcing upon \nour young workers, our children, and grandchildren a massive credit \ncard debt--if you can imagine that--resulting from our inability to \nlive within our means. Would any of us do that to our children? Of \ncourse not. But that is what this budget does.\n  This budget contemplates permanently increasing the size of \nGovernment to unsustainable levels--especially when you consider the \ndemographic-driven entitlement tsunami that is waiting to overwhelm the \nAmerican economy. Under this budget, Federal spending as a percentage \nof GDP will be 28 percent of GDP in this fiscal year. Only 3 times \nsince 1930 has the Government spent a greater share of the Nation's \ndomestic output--1943, 1944, and 1945.\n  More disturbing than this year's spending is the escalating spending \nthat this budget entails. Even if you give the President and the Budget \nCommittee the benefit of the doubt for this fiscal year, since much of \nthat money has already been appropriated, spending as a percent of GDP \nwill average 23.7 percent over the 2010 to 2019 period. We will average \na greater percentage of GDP over those years than we have spent in any \nsingle year, except the 1942 to 1945 timeframe. So you have a permanent \ngrowth in Government spending, not paying for war, paying for the \nexcesses in our spending that we want to do.\n  We are going to have to pay that at some point or, more correctly, \nour children and grandchildren will. I have asked the staff to put \ntogether a quick estimate of how high marginal tax rates might have to \nrise if we are going to balance these budgets. You cannot sustain this \namount of debt, and you have spent it, and ``there is nothing so \npermanent as a temporary Government program,'' as President Ronald \nReagan observed. So you have started these on a temporary basis. They \nare going to balloon up and people get attached. So now you have to \nraise taxes to pay for it, because you cannot sustain that level of \ndebt.\n  Here are the answers they came up with: projected tax rates that will \nhave to go up, particularly on our top brackets because the President \nis saying we are going to tax the top brackets to do that. We are \nlooking at a 65-, 69-percent marginal tax rate.\n  We have been there before as a country. We have had marginal tax \nrates up this high. It has never worked. It was economically stagnant \nfor us as a country. People did not invest money, and basically the \nGovernment took this money and gave it to the Government instead of \nhaving it in productive sectors in the economy. We were looking at \nrates of 65, 69 percent.\n  Who is going to work and pay taxes at that rate? People working say: \nThis is not worth it to me. We have been here before. This is a failed \npolicy model. We have done this before. It has failed. We do not want \nto go back to that failed policy of the past.\n  Then there is the talk that we will do cap and trade, we will have an \nenergy tax that will help pay for some of these programs. Consumers \nmight not pay it directly, but they will certainly pay it at a rate of \nmore than $3,000 per American family with an energy tax. The cost of \nliving will rise, American industry will become less competitive, \nunemployment will rise, and the American people will suffer. We do not \nwant that.\n  Particularly troubling was the suggestion of the majority leader that \nthis is the right time to start health care reform and the same old \nGovernment game, trying to tell people: Look at this wonderful thing \nGovernment is providing you, and you are going to get it for free.\n  The reality of economics is that individuals pay corporate taxes in \nthe form of higher taxes. That is simply a fact of life.\n  Equally troubling is the administration's desire to tax corporations \nthat ship jobs overseas. It is nice rhetoric, but the policy is exactly \nopposite the one we should be pursuing. We should be pursuing \nincentives for multinational corporations to repatriate their earnings \nfrom abroad. One estimate put the amount of capital that could be \nrepatriated if we instituted a 1-year tax rate of 5 percent on \nrepatriated earnings. We could bring back as much as $500 billion into \nthe U.S. economy.\n  Instead, the administration is going exactly the other way. We are \ngoing to raise these taxes, and instead of bringing that money home, we \nare going to\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\ndrive it overseas. That is what is going to take place. That is what \nhas happened to date.\n  Over the last several years, many of us have tried working on another \nissue and put a great deal of effort into eliminating the so-called \nmarriage penalty. I am concerned that the President's proposal and this \nbudget will serve to create economic disincentives for family \nformation.\n  I have another chart to show this situation of the rate increases on \nincreasing the marriage penalty that is going to take place under the \nPresident's proposed budget. A marriage penalty already exists in \npresent law, and it gets worse under these policies.\n  The marriage penalty will nearly double in this particular wage \nearner's case from $2,900 to nearly $5,000. Is that the policy signal \nwe want to send; that if you are going to get married, we are going to \ndouble your taxes? That is not a wise way for us to go, and our \nfamilies are already stressed out the way it is now.\n  I know the President is calling for limiting deductions for higher \nincome taxpayers. What no one on the other side of the aisle is saying, \nhowever, is that these limitations are a backdoor method of expanding \nthe reach and scope of the alternative minimum tax.\n  Our economy cannot afford the kind of taxation that this budget is \nrequiring in the future. The all-time high for the Government's take in \nrevenue is 20.9 percent. That is the all-time high of the percentage we \nhave taken of the economy, 20.9 percent. That has occurred twice; \nagain, once during World War II and in 2000. The postwar average is \n17.9 percent. Normally, we are taking under 18 percent of the economy, \nand that is high.\n  Since the spending under this budget and the President's budget is \npermanent, revenues will have to rise and be sustained at a level of 6 \npercent of GDP higher than the historical average in order to bring the \nbudget into balance. That is a share of GDP, more than a third higher \nthan the historic average. The historic average is 18 percent. This is \ngoing to be 23 percent. We have never been that high before. It is not \nsustainable. It is harmful to the economy. If you think the economy is \nin tough shape now, wait until you see the stagnation, the inflation, \nthe unemployment this budget proposal will bring us at 23 percent \ntaxation rates for the overall economy.\n  This is a bold new vision for America. Yet it is a vision that tries \nto deny the fundamental laws of economics. It is the same denial of \nrisk on the part of financial institutions that put people in houses \nthey could not afford and encouraged them to run up massive amounts of \ncredit card and other consumer debt and led those sophisticated \ninstitutions to take on massive amounts of leverage that even the \nsmallest of losses could not survive.\n  We are in the situation we are in because of excessive spending by \nGovernment and excessive risk-taking by institutions that were allowed \nto become too big to fail. It is time to face the facts. Too big has \nfailed. This economy simply cannot afford this budget. The American \npeople cannot afford this budget. Future generations cannot afford this \nbudget. This budget asks the American people to buy into a Ponzi scheme \nbased on the promise of returns that we will never be able to pay, \nwhile we divert massive sums in an attempt to socially reengineer the \neconomy and the Nation.\n  Let us heed Thomas Jefferson's warning that I read at the outset and \nrefuse to go down a road that enslaves our descendants for generations \nto come in the shackles of a mountain of debt, high taxes, and a \ngovernment that has destroyed any vestige of economic freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we have heard all week long about this \nbudget, President Obama's budget, and the mantra that it spends too \nmuch, it taxes too much, and it borrows too much. I agree with that. \nBut I wish to bring up some other points about this budget that, quite \nfrankly, are counterintuitive to what we have been told by the \nadministration.\n  The President has said repeatedly in the last 2 weeks, in talking \nabout the American recovery, that his vision for the American recovery \nis founded in this budget document. I wish to talk about some of the \nthings that have been talked about in this budget document as they \nrelate to the recovery we so desperately need in this country.\n  For example, I think everyone agrees--Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents--that what led us into this difficulty is the housing \nmarket. Sure, the subprime mortgages were a part of it, but it is the \nloss of equity that homeowners have all over this country, a decline in \nvalue, an escalating foreclosure rate, and a massive amount of short \nselling and foreclosing that is going on.\n  It would seem at a time when that is going on, when that is the major \ncause of the crisis with which we are confronted, you would have \npolicies for home ownership so buyers would come back to the market, \nthey would buy the homes that are distressed and troubled, stabilize \nthe values, and begin to build the equity of the average American \nfamily. But this budget portends we would drop the tax deductibility \nfor a first mortgage on a family home that they occupy. So you take \naway a tax preference that for history and for years the American \nGovernment has granted to homeowners to encourage home ownership and \nyou take it away from them at the very time home ownership is under the \ngreatest stress in its history. It is counterintuitive and it is wrong.\n  The Senator from Kansas made a reference to charity. I just came from \na congressional awards reception downstairs where we gave golden awards \nto young people around this country for the volunteer service they have \ngiven to help their fellow man. That is a gift of charity itself.\n  At that reception were four major corporations that make charitable \ncontributions to the Gold Medal Award Program to encourage these young \npeople to volunteer their time. If you reduce the ability of \ncorporations or high-income wage earners or high-income earners to \ndeduct the charitable donation, you are actually motivating at a time \nof need less charity on behalf of your people and in turn putting more \nburden on the back of the Government.\n  We saw earlier today, with the vote on the Thune amendment, that \nthere is one idea the entire Congress almost appears not to like about \nthis budget, and that is part of this budget portends that we would pay \nfor some of the increased spending by taxing utilities.\n  The Thune amendment made the statement that the Senate does not \nbelieve that is right, and 88 Members of the Senate voted for the Thune \namendment. Obviously, that policy is misdirected.\n  And then we are at a time when values in equities have declined, when \nAmerican investment is declining, when corporate America is finding \ngreat difficulties, and at a time when all those things are going on, \nthis budget portends that we would raise the capital gains tax by 33 \npercent and, further, that we would raise the dividend tax at the \nhighest marginal rate by three times what it is right now. Penalizing \npeople for investing in stocks that pay dividends at a time when the \nmarket is depressed does not make sense to me.\n\n  Further, they are saying, for those who have assets or have a profit \nbuilt in, they are going to raise that tax by 33 percent at a time when \nthe economy is suffering. I think it is, at best, counterintuitive.\n  I do not like politicians who get up and talk about how bad something \nis without offering some solutions. We have a responsibility--every \nMember in this body--to offer some proposals. So if I think these \npolicies driven by this budget proposal are going in the wrong \ndirection, what is the right direction?\n  I have an amendment that will be offered at the appropriate time. It \nis amendment No. 762. It is an amendment that creates a placeholder, a \ndeficit-neutral placeholder in this budget proposal for a $15,000 tax \ncredit for any family who buys a home and occupies it as their \nresidence in the next 12-month period following the passage of that \namendment.\n  What will it do? Quite frankly, the Senate unanimously adopted that \namendment a few weeks ago on the stimulus, only to find it taken out by \nthe House of Representatives. Why do we need to stimulate home \nownership right now? Because it is the single\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nlargest asset of the average American family. It is the basis on which \nmost credit is extended to families. It is fundamentally the foundation \nof consumer confidence in the United States of America. And right now \nthere isn't any, and there isn't any because the housing market \nbasically collapsed, values have depreciated in some areas by as much \nas a third, and one in every five houses in America is actually \nunderwater, meaning the debt exceeds the value.\n  This tax credit is not an original idea by me as a Member of the \nSenate. In fact, in 1974, when we had the last major housing crisis in \nAmerica, the Congress--Democratically controlled and a Republican \nPresident, Gerald Ford--passed a $2,000 tax credit for the purchase of \nany standing vacant home in 1975. This country took a declining housing \nmarket, with a 3-year supply of houses on the market, back to stability \nand equilibrium in 12 months, all with the motivation of the tax \ncredit.\n  I first offered this tax credit in January of last year when we began \nto see the downward spiral in our economy. It is scored at $34.2 \nbillion. I was told last January that is too much. So we then spent \n$700 billion in October on the TARP, and the Federal Reserve has spent \nalmost $14 trillion. We are considering spending more, and $34 billion \nto me does not sound like very much. In fact, economic estimates by \nexperts--not by me--have estimated that the tax credit, if passed by \nthe Congress, would create 700,000 home sales in the first 12 months \nand 587,000 jobs. I don't know about you, but both of those are awfully \ngood numbers that we certainly would like to be seeing reported on Wall \nStreet and on Main Street.\n  When I offer this amendment, what I will merely be asking the Senate \nto do is send a signal. Instead of discouraging home ownership, we want \nto encourage it because it is the foundation of our recovery. Instead \nof having a tax policy that is punitive to investment, we want to have \na tax policy that is positive to investment, and understanding home \nownership and the value of it is still the fundamental key, the \neconomic stability of the American family.\n  It is my hope the Senate will adopt this amendment and send the \nmessage so we can come back after the recess, pass the tax credit, make \nit effective, and return investment to the housing market and stability \nto the U.S. economy. So instead of taxing too much, spending too much, \nand borrowing too much, it is time we encourage investment in the \nAmerican dream, which always has been and remains the home in which \npeople raise their families, live, and retire.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, tomorrow, I intend to call up an \namendment which will be cosponsored by Senators Bunning, Feingold, and \nMenendez. This is a very simple amendment, couldn't be simpler. What \nthe amendment is about is that when taxpayers of this country, the \nAmerican citizenry, put at risk trillions of dollars which go to large \nfinancial institutions, they have a right to know who is receiving that \nmoney. That is about it, not more complicated.\n  Earlier this year, Doug Elmendorf, the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office, told the Budget Committee that the Federal Reserve has \ncommitted nearly $2.3 trillion in taxpayer dollars to deal with the \nfinancial crisis. You have no clue, I have no clue, and nobody in \nAmerica has any clue where that money went, who got it.\n\n  It seems to me that right here on the floor of the Senate I have been \ninvolved in long, heated debates about whether we spend $20 million on \nthis and $30 million on that. These debates go on forever. Yet when we \nare prepared to place at risk through the Fed $2.3 trillion, I guess \nthe American people don't have a right to know who is getting that \nmoney.\n  Interestingly, if you go to your computer and you go to the \nappropriate Web site, you can find out, appropriately enough, which \nfinancial institutions and other corporations have received TARP funds. \nI voted against those bailouts, but the truth is, if you want to know \nhow much Citigroup has gotten, if you want to know how much Bank of \nAmerica has gotten, there it is. It is in black and white, as it should \nbe. But you will not know and you do not know which institutions \nreceived $2.3 trillion.\n  Earlier this month, I had an opportunity to ask Ben Bernanke, the \nChairman of the Fed, about this issue when he testified before the \ncommittee. At this hearing, the Chairman told the Budget Committee that \nsince the start of the financial crisis, the Fed has provided loans to \n``hundreds and hundreds of banks.'' But Mr. Bernanke declined to name \nany of these banks, how much assistance they provided to each bank, or \nwhat those banks are doing with this money. What the Federal Reserve \nneeds to understand is that this money does not belong to them, it \nbelongs to the American people. It is literally mind-blowing that \ntrillions of dollars have been placed at risk--by whom, for what, going \nto whom? We don't know.\n  I hope we have strong bipartisan support for this amendment which \nsimply begins the process of asking for transparency at the Fed, which \nis probably the most secretive institution in Government.\n  During the markup of the budget resolution last week, I offered an \namendment with Senators Bunning, Feingold, and Menendez--all of whom \nserve with me on the Budget Committee--to create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to provide increased transparency at the Federal Reserve. \nDue to some concerns raised by the Parliamentarian, this amendment was \nmodified and passed the Budget Committee by a voice vote.\n  The amendment I will be calling up tomorrow is more specific in terms \nof what type of transparency the Fed should be providing. The Sanders-\nBunning-Feingold-Menendez amendment simply puts the Senate on record \nthat the Federal Reserve should publish on its Web site--just as the \nTreasury Department does with TARP funding--comprehensive information \nabout all of the financial assistance it has provided under the lending \nfacilities it created to deal with the financial crisis since March 24, \n2008. What we ask specifically is--and believe me, I don't think the \ntaxpayers in this country are asking too much when they get this \ninformation--No. 1, the identity of each business, individual, or \nentity that the Fed has provided financial assistance to; No. 2, the \ntype of financial assistance provided to that business, individual, or \nentity; No. 3, the value or amount of that financial assistance; No. 4, \nthe date on which the financial assistance was provided; No. 5, the \nspecific terms of any repayment expected; No. 6, the specific rationale \nfor providing that assistance; and No. 7, what that business, \nindividual, or entity is doing with this financial assistance.\n  In addition, this amendment also puts the Senate on record in support \nof providing the GAO with the tools and authority it needs to conduct \nan independent audit of the Federal Reserve--something I know Senator \nBunning, among others, has been trying to accomplish for several years.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It is a very important amendment. \nAnyone who believes in transparency in Government should be supporting \nit. I hope and expect we are going to have support from both sides of \nthe aisle--from progressives, from conservatives. This really is a \ncommonsense amendment that the American people deserve to see passed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are following the action of \nthe Senate, the debate over the budget resolution, this is an annual \nevent that involves planning ahead for our spending for the next fiscal \nyear, which starts October 1, and beyond. Presidents come forward and \nsuggest what\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nthey would like to see us do with the submission of the budget. Then it \nis up to the Congress to decide, within the confines of the President's \nbudget request, what to do with the money--how to raise it, how to \nspend it. Naturally, it is a contentious process because there are a \nlot of different opinions on where money should be spent--how much \nshould be given to this agency or how much should be in tax cuts.\n  President Obama came to this assignment with a very difficult set of \ncircumstances--the worst economy in 75 years; a nation in recession; \nthe need for us to put money into the economy to create and save jobs, \ngood-paying jobs right here in America, which he did with his Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act; and then the question about what will our \npriorities be as a nation as we try to bring ourselves out of this \nrecession and plan ahead.\n  This week, the Senate is going to vote on its version of the budget \nresolution for the fiscal year 2010, starting October 1, 2009. We are \ngoing to make fundamental decisions about what our economy and the \nprosperity of our country will be. Of course, those decisions will \nimpact the direction of our Nation, not only next year but beyond.\n  We need to face facts. This is the hardest budget we have faced in a \nlong time. Because of the deficit which the President inherited from \nPresident Bush--the largest in history--we are trying our best to spend \nour money wisely but not make the debt any worse in the long term. We \nhave taken an important step with the economic recovery package, but \nthere is a lot more we have to do to put the economy back on track.\n  Now we need to pass a budget that is smart and fair and responsible, \none that helps our economy work again and invest in things that will \npay off over the long run. The Senate budget resolution reported by \nChairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota would allow us to do that. I \ncertainly do not agree with all of the specifics in his budget \nresolution. I would write it differently. Every Member of the Senate \ncan say that. But when I look, on balance, I believe this budget \nresolution really addresses the realities of what we face and the \nchallenge of what lies ahead. It restores fairness for middle-class \nfamilies, working families across America, it reestablishes \nresponsibility in the budgeting process, and it makes some smart \ninvestments in America's future.\n  The Budget Committee followed the principles laid out in President \nObama's proposal to Congress. It sets a path to regain balance that our \ncountry once enjoyed--careful investments in our future while creating \nopportunity for working families who have lost a lot of ground over the \nlast 10 years. It provides the flexibility to authorizing committees to \ntackle our toughest challenges, and it starts to repair years of \nneglect and make critical investments in health care, education, \nenergy.\n  Let's speak to the health care issue for a moment. Our Nation spends \nmore than any other industrialized nation on health care. Yet the \nUnited States is the only industrialized nation that does not offer \nhealth care coverage to all of its citizens. We can't just throw money \nat this problem and hope everybody gets good health care. Instead, the \nPresident's budget identified specific changes in the current system to \nimprove efficiency. The savings from those changes would then be \napplied to Congress's efforts at reforming health care. That is smart, \nit is fair, and it is responsible.\n  To implement the President's request, the Senate budget resolution \nincludes a deficit-neutral reserve fund that allows the committees here \nin the Senate to take on the challenge of health care reform. We need \nto spend our health care dollars more sensibly, and we need to provide \nquality health care for all Americans.\n  Let me tell you about one program that kind of tells the story about \nthe debate we have been engaged in over the last several years. \nPresident Obama has said we need to take a closer look at the Medicare \nAdvantage program. He said it is time for us to end excessive payments \nto private insurance companies that administer that program.\n  From the beginning, Medicare Advantage was sold to Members of \nCongress as the private sector alternative to Medicare which will \nprove, as they argued, that if you let the private insurance companies \ndo the Medicare Program, they are going to save the Government money. \nThose who argued for it started with the premise that when the \nGovernment bureaucrats get their hands on it, they are going to make a \nmess of it, it will cost too much, have too much redtape, and at the \nend of the day, if you just left it to the market forces and the \nprivate sector, you would come out with a much better and cheaper \nresult. Taxpayers would save money if you took away the Government \nprogram and replaced it with a private sector program. That was the \npremise behind Medicare Advantage.\n  It was a good theory: The competition among private insurance \ncompanies would bring down the costs of traditional Medicare. But it \nturns out to be wrong. Congress passed legislation in 2003 and agreed \nto pay for-profit insurance companies 12 percent more per beneficiary \nthan regular Medicare would spend to cover the same people. So the \npremise that private insurance companies would save us money was \ndefeated from the beginning. We started off subsidizing private \ninsurance companies to offer as much coverage as Medicare offered.\n  We gave them a 12-percent subsidy to prove that the free market \nworks. Today, research from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nour official experts on Medicare payments, showed that Government pays \nprivate fee-for-service programs 119 percent of the average cost for \nbeneficiaries in traditional Medicare.\n  If they were setting out to prove that they could do the job of \nMedicare with competition and private insurance cheaper, they failed, \nfailed by 19 percent. What is it costing us? Last year, a report from \nthe Congressional Budget Office said payments to private health plans \nin Medicare Advantage rose from $40 billion in 2004 to $56 billion in \n2006, $75 billion in 2007.\n  Federal payments to these private insurance companies are expected to \nreach $194 billion by 2017. So for 10 years, from 2007 to 2017, the \nFederal Government is on the hook for $1.5 trillion in an experiment \nthat was supposed to save us money. The share of Medicare spending for \nMedicare Advantage Plans will increase from 17 percent in 2006 to 27 \npercent in 2017.\n  So they end up proving, year after year, that they can reach into and \ngrab more and more Medicare beneficiaries, lure them into private plans \nthat cost the taxpayers more money, when they were supposed to be \nproving they could save us money.\n  Insurers claim they are paid more because they offer more than \nGovernment-sponsored Medicare. It is true that many plans do offer \nthings that the original Medicare plan did not offer. But in a report \nissued last year, the Government Accountability Office noted that only \na small share of the money that the Government will pay Medicare \nAdvantage Plans over the next 4 years goes to extra benefits; only 11 \npercent.\n  It turns out there is much more in profitability and in offering \nservices that do not benefit Medicare beneficiaries. Most of the rest \nof it goes to out-of-pocket spending, reducing out-of-pocket spending \nand copays.\n  Sounds good until you realize that to pay for this reduction, we are \nnow charging higher premiums for the 35 million Medicare beneficiaries \nwho enrolled in traditional Medicare. Follow it? Private companies that \nare going to show they can run rings around traditional Medicare, offer \nthe same benefits at a lower cost, it turns out, were wrong, and we are \npaying 19 percent more for private insurance companies to offer \nMedicare Programs than if traditional Medicare offered it, and the 19 \npercent is being paid by the seniors in traditional Medicare. They are \npaying for the subsidy for the private insurance companies.\n  Each beneficiary enrolled in traditional Medicare sees their premiums \nincrease $3 a month to pay for the reductions in out-of-pocket spending \nfor beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Worse, we do not even \nknow if this program is working. In 2007, CBO Director Peter Orszag, \nnow head of OMB, pointed out in testimony before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that little information is available on the degree to which \nplans generate better health outcomes than traditional Medicare.\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\n  Now, you want to know why and how we are wasting money? Here is one \ngood example. If we are going to bring down the cost of care and \nmaintain its quality, we cannot afford subsidizing private insurance \ncompanies that charge us more than traditional Medicare and cannot \nprove that the outcomes are any better.\n  The President's budget proposes to cut Federal payments to insurers \nthat run plans by requiring them to competitively bid to offer coverage \nin a given geographic area. Insurers will be paid according to the \naverage of the bids. If they are as good as they say they are, let's \nhave them compete.\n  This process will save us $177 billion over 10 years. It is a sacred \ncow. I recall an alderman from Chicago, a friend of mine, a Hispanic \nalderman, called me and said: Senator, I have to see you. I just have \nto see you.\n  I said: OK. We will set it up. I said: I am coming out of meeting \nover here in a hotel. If you can meet me in the lobby, I would be glad \nto talk.\n  And he did. We sat down and he said: Senator, you just have to save \nthe Medicare Advantage program.\n  I said to my friend, the alderman: Why in the world did you come to \nlobby me on this?\n  Well, he said, it turns out, one of the major insurance companies \ncalled me and said that my people liked this plan. And they gave me the \nnames of some people who liked this plan.\n  I said to the alderman: Do you know this plan costs more than \ntraditional Medicare and your people are not getting anything more for \nit?\n  No, I did not know that, he said.\n  But they went to the lengths, the insurance company, of sending this \nalderman in, a nice fellow, trying to do the right thing for people he \nrepresents, trying to sell an idea that, frankly, costs the Federal \nGovernment more money.\n  That is how you get into the mess we are in with health care in \nAmerica today. This $177 billion we could save by taking an honest look \nat Medicare Advantage we can use to expand health insurance protection \nto the 48 million uninsured people in this country. We can expand and \nbuild community health centers. God bless them. These are people who do \ngreat work in primary care all across America.\n  I tell you, I visit these centers, clinics, all across Chicago. Erie \nHealth Clinic is one of my favorites, Alivio Health Clinic. I walk in \nthere and I say to these doctors, face to face, eye to eye: If I were \nsick, I would be happy to walk through the door of your clinic and have \nyour doctors and nurses see me. They are fine, quality care. And many \nof the people whom they serve are poor people, uninsured people, folks \nwho have no coverage, no insurance. They are doing great work, and we \nneed to have more of them providing primary care, keeping people out of \nemergency rooms.\n  The money we have spent and we have been spending to subsidize \nMedicare Advantage is money that is wasted, money that, in fact, goes \nto private health insurance companies. Well, President Obama said: The \nfree ride is over. If you cannot compete and get your prices down to a \nreasonable level, we are going to stop this subsidy. You set out to \nprove to us how good the private sector was and how good the free \nmarket worked and then you are demanding a subsidy of the Government to \nkeep offering your Medicare Advantage program.\n  I have a friend of mine, Doug Mayol in Springfield, IL, who knows too \nwell the difficulty this economy can create for someone on their health \ncare. I have a picture of Doug here. I want him to be seen on C-SPAN \nback in Springfield, IL, or wherever he is watching.\n  Doug, since 1988, has operated a small business in downtown \nSpringfield selling cards, gifts, knickknacks. And as you can imagine, \na self-insured businessman, his profits, many times, are at the mercy \nof the rising costs of health care. He is fortunate that his only \nemployee in his little shop is over 65 years of age and qualifies for \nMedicare and also receives spousal benefits from her late husband. If \nthat were not the situation, Doug does not think he could help her pay \nfor her health insurance.\n  In terms of his own insurance, Douglas has a challenge. Doug has a \npreexisting condition and fears the possibility of becoming uninsured. \nSome 30 years ago, Doug was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve \ndefect. He has no symptoms, but without regular health care, he is at \nthe risk of developing a serious problem.\n  Like most Americans, his health care premiums have risen over the \nyears. But recently it has been shocking. In 2001, Doug paid $200 a \nmonth for health insurance. By 2005, it had doubled to $400 a month. \nWhen Doug turned 50 years of age in 2006, the monthly rate went up to \n$750 a month for his health insurance. He tried to work within the \nsystem. He chose a smaller network of providers and a higher deductible \nand brought the monthly premium down from $750 to $650.\n  Unfortunately, last year, that premium for this small business owner \nin Springfield, IL, went to $1,037 a month. Only by taking the highest \ndeductible allowed, $2,500, was he able to bring it down to $888 a \nmonth. He knows and we know the numbers are going to keep going up.\n  Because of his high deductible, Doug thought he should open a health \nsavings account, but he could not set aside the $200 a month on top of \nthe $888 premium every month, found it impossible to do.\n\n  You know what. He is not a sick person or costly patient. With his \nhigh deductible, the insurance does not even pay out, as Doug has never \nmade a claim for an illness or injury except for routine primary care. \nYet more affordable insurance carriers reject him because of his \npreexisting condition, the possibility of high expenditures in the \nfuture for things such as surgery.\n  This condition, or burden you can say, severely limits his choices \nwhen it comes to insurance. But he cannot afford not to have health \ninsurance either. With his heart condition, antibiotics are needed \nbefore undergoing even a visit to the dentist. Although he should see a \ncardiologist periodically, Doug avoids it. He fears it would add \nanother red flag to his already tainted medical record in the eyes of \nthe insurance companies.\n  What kind of system are we operating in America that even those with \ncoverage are delaying care because it costs and the way insurance is \nstructured? Americans need peace of mind of knowing that health \ninsurance companies will not be able to pick and choose whom they \ncover. We deserve the highest quality care our country has to offer, \nand President Obama has made a commitment to reach that goal.\n  This budget resolution lays the foundation for making that commitment \na reality. Doug is living his American dream. He has his own business. \nHaving health insurance should not destroy that dream. Doug should not \nbe forced to choose between keeping the shop doors open and paying his \ninsurance premium.\n  The budget resolution also offers a promising vision for education in \nAmerica, closely following the President's proposals. The budget fully \nfunds the President's request for a smart, fair, responsible investment \nin education and training and improves chances to learn.\n  First, the budget dramatically expands access to quality early \nchildhood education programs. I listened on the floor while Republicans \ncame and criticized the Senate budget resolution for spending too much \nmoney.\n  The major investment and expenditures in this resolution, in terms of \nnew expenditures, are three. We put more money into veterans care \nbecause a lot of soldiers are coming back hurt; they need help. They \nneed to have the clinics and hospitals and medical professionals that \nwe promised them we would give them. We put the money in this budget \nresolution to keep that promise.\n  The second thing we do is pay for the census. This comes up every 10 \nyears. We have to prepare for it. We cannot escape it. It is required. \nLet's do it right. We are doing what others have done in the past. That \nis one of the new areas of spending.\n  Third is education. This budget dramatically expands access to \nquality early childhood education. I believe and think most parents \nunderstand that the earlier you start teaching a child, the better \nchance that child has in school or to succeed. Unfortunately, a lot of \nkids come to kindergarten well behind the other kids in the class. This \nis especially true for kids from homes where families struggle \neconomically.\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n  That is why early childhood education programs such as Head Start can \nmake a big difference. After a year or two in a preschool setting, \nthese kids start kindergarten ready to learn. If you listen to the \nstories from Head Start teachers, you will understand how important \nthese programs can be. I do not have a chart here, but I will tell you \nthat Vamyah is a child in Chicago who began in a class taught by Ms. \nHardy, as a tearful, timid little girl.\n  After 2 years in Head Start, Vamyah is singing and playing with the \nother kids and even attempting to write her name at the writing table. \nShe has progressed so far, she is now helping other kids write letters, \nnumbers, and puzzles. Ms. Hardy reports that when Vamyah goes to \nkindergarten in the fall, she is going to be missed. But she has a \nbetter future ahead of her because of the experience she has had at \nHead Start.\n  This budget will give other kids the opportunity to grow and learn \nbefore even entering school. Once they begin their schooling, the \nbudget asks us to invest in teachers and innovative programs so all \nchildren can succeed in the classroom. We improve student assessments, \nteacher training, principal preparation, and programs that reward \nstrong teacher performance.\n  These are initiatives we want to see in our kid's schools and every \nschool. The budget will help us build the education system to compete \nin the challenging 21st century. Once these kids move on to higher \neducation, the budget would help them afford the high cost of tuition \nby raising the maximum Pell grant award and streamlining student loan \nprograms.\n  The cost of college keeps going up. Everyone knows it. This morning, \nNPR reported that record numbers of kids are enrolled in community \ncolleges. It is the affordable alternative. But as the costs go up, we \nhave to give a helping hand because otherwise these kids will end up \nwith a mountain of debt, pushing them into jobs they may not aspire to.\n  If a young person wants to be a teacher, we ought to give them a \nhelping hand. Making the Pell grant larger each year will reduce the \nultimate debt they face. Financial aid has not kept up with costs. Some \n30 years ago, a Pell grant covered 77 percent of public college costs. \nNow it covers less than half that amount. To fill in the gap, more \nstudents have taken out student loans to afford college.\n  In the early 1990s, fewer than one-third of college graduates had \nloan debt. Now that number has doubled, more than doubled, to 70 \npercent, to an average of $20,000 debt per student. This budget \nincreases Pell grants to $5,550.\n  It currently helps 7 million American kids stay in college.\n  One of the students who will be helped is Kendra Walker at Southern \nIllinois University in Edwardsville. She grew up in St. Louis and had a \ndifficult childhood. She and her brother were raised by a single mom \nwho was a crack addict for 12 years. Kendra had to grow up pretty fast, \ntaking care of a little brother and often taking care of her mom. Her \nmom eventually went to rehab, but things were still pretty tough at \nhome. Kendra worked all through high school to pay the bills and buy \ngroceries when the family needed them. Even as she struggled, she \nthought: I can do better in my life. She knew her future had to include \ncollege. She worked hard in school. She was on the honor roll and \ngraduated fourth in her class from high school. She believed her hard \nwork had paid off when she was accepted at Howard University.\n  Then reality set in and Kendra knew she would not be able to go \nbecause she just didn't have the money. Instead, she started college at \nSt. Louis Community College with plans to transfer to a university.\n  When her mother passed away suddenly in July of 2007, she had to \nredouble her efforts. She enrolled at SIU Edwardsville and moved into \nstudent housing. Today she is a junior studying criminal justice and \npolitical science. She is still struggling to pay the cost of her \neducation, and she has nobody to help her.\n  As Kendra says: It is just me and the Financial Aid Office.\n  She has Pell grants, work-study funds, a few scholarships, and too \nmany student loans. It is becoming harder for Kendra to make ends meet. \nPaying the bills and keeping food on the table is pretty tough. She \nalmost didn't start school because her Pell grant didn't cover all the \ncost. She was forced to take out even more student loans. She worries \nabout the debt she is piling up, but she knows to quit now without a \nbachelor's degree is to end up with debt and no diploma. When she \ngraduates next year, Kendra plans to become a probation officer for \nteenagers so she can help them turn their lives around. She also dreams \nof attending graduate school, maybe someday going to law school and \nbecoming a defense attorney. What a remarkable young lady.\n  Look at what she has been through at this point in her life. If a \nbudget talks about a nation's values, this budget shows that we care \nabout students like Kendra. Our budget reflects it.\n  In her words:\n\n       Without federal financial aid I would just be another \n     statistic. With the help of programs like the Pell Grant, me \n     and others like me can obtain our goals and have bright \n     futures.\n\n  We need to help people such as Kendra achieve their college dreams by \nincreasing help through the Pell grant. This budget will do that.\n  The Republicans come and criticize it: Why are we spending more \nmoney? It is another one of those overspending budgets.\n  We are spending more money to provide more Pell grants so Kendra \nWalker can finish college, get a job, and contribute back to society. \nIs that a good investment? I think it is one of the best.\n  This budget also provides a downpayment on weaning America from \nforeign energy sources. We know we have to cut back on foreign energy \nthat generates greenhouse gases and makes us dependent on foreign \ncountries. This budget proposes we spend less money heating and cooling \nwith old, inefficient systems in Federal buildings and more money \ndeveloping smarter ways to use power. It proposes we spend less burning \nconventional fuels and more money developing cleaner energy sources.\n  If this budget had already passed and this funding was already \navailable, Lee Celske of Alito, IL, might have been able to put a small \nportion of that funding to good use.\n  In this budget, Lee Celske can be helped. Lee is an interesting and \nentrepreneurial fellow. He has figured out how to create greenhouses \nout of recycled glass. They can be framed for $30,000, quick to \nassemble, and a good option for communities. They are energy efficient, \ncan withstand a category 5 hurricane. The factory that makes the houses \nwould employ 30 high-tech, high-paying green-collar workers.\n  Over the past 14 months, Lee has presold nearly $2 million worth of \nhouses, relying on loan guarantees from the bank that would underwrite \nthe factory once sufficient sales were in place. But then the bank \npulled the financing. Lee hasn't done anything wrong. His small company \nis ahead of schedule on growth targets, and it will create good jobs. \nYet his progress has been stopped cold by the freeze in the credit \nmarkets. This budget will help finance entrepreneurs such as Lee in \nAlito, IL.\n  It contains a deficit-neutral reserve fund to advance the President's \ngoal of expanding renewable energy use, ensuring 10 percent of our \nelectricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 and 25 percent by \n2025. There is also money in this budget to green Federal buildings.\n  Three weeks ago I was a visitor to what was then the Sears Tower, the \ntallest office building in America. It is now the Willis Tower. I was \nshown a demonstration where they are about to take this 35-year-old \nbuilding and make it energy efficient. It starts with replacing 16,000 \nsingle-pane windows, energy-inefficient windows, with triple-paned \nwindows, putting in new brackets to sustain the new weight on the \nbuilding, changing the heating and air-conditioning system, generating \nelectricity with the over 130 elevators that move up and down the old \nSears Tower, now the Willis Tower. They will make this investment.\n  We need to look at our Federal buildings the same way and realize \nthat sticking with old energy-inefficient\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nbuildings is draining money from taxpayers' pockets. Money spent now \ncreating good jobs, making these buildings energy efficient is money \nwell invested. It will reduce the cost in the future of these \nbuildings. Weatherization of homes and office buildings is a critical \npart of the energy agenda. Mr. President, 60 percent--some say 40 \npercent, but whatever it is--is a substantial portion of the pollution. \nIt comes from buildings we live in, and we can reduce that pollution if \nwe start dealing with these energy issues honestly.\n  I listened to the debate on the Senate floor as my colleagues on the \nRepublican side criticized this budget. I will say, in their defense, \nthat writing a budget is not easy. It is hard. There were years when we \nwere in the loyal opposition and couldn't do it, couldn't write it. It \ndiminished our ability to criticize because, frankly, we couldn't put a \nbudget on the table. We just couldn't do it.\n  Well, the Republicans can't do it this year. They can't produce a \nbudget. They certainly can't produce one to meet the goals they say \nthey want in this budget. So there they stand, emptyhanded, criticizing \nour work effort, our budget resolution. It does detract from their \ncredibility, if they can't produce their own budget. As I have said, it \nis hard. There have been times in the past where we in the loyal \nopposition couldn't.\n  I encourage colleagues to take a close look at this budget. It makes \nsmart investments in the future. It is fair, particularly to working \nfamilies. It is responsible. We put on line the actual cost of two wars \nwhich the previous President wouldn't even put in his regular budget. \nWe are going to let the American people know what they cost and make \nsure we make allotments and allocations for them.\n  I hope when this comes up for a final vote, we can have the support \nof a sufficient number to pass this budget resolution and move America \nforward again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have listened with interest to my friend from Illinois \nwhere everything works, every proposal makes sense, every Federal \nappropriation is carefully handled, and every citizen of the State of \nIllinois personally prospers. That would be a great world. I hope we \ncan get to it. I don't think this budget takes us there.\n  I rise to discuss another aspect of this budget, to discuss amendment \nNo. 759, which I have submitted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Thune and Ensign be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This amendment has to do with the tax treatment of \ncharitable contributions. The budget the Senator from Illinois \ndiscussed has to be paid for. One of the ways President Obama has \nproposed that it be paid for is to change the tax treatment of \ncharitable contributions for those evil people in America who earn more \nthan $250,000 a year. I say ``evil'' in a sardonic sense because, in \nfact, we all recognize they are essential to the economy. Without them, \nwe would not have the tremendous amount of income tax revenue we do \nhave. We understand that they are paying the lion's share of the income \ntax. We should not demonize them. But some people have in their \nresponse to this and say they earn too much, and we should not allow \nthem to accumulate too much.\n  One way we are going to make sure they don't accumulate too much is \nto see to it that they are not allowed to deduct the same percentage of \ntheir income taxes for charitable contributions that other people are.\n  Let's talk about this for a moment. Taxpayers with incomes in excess \nof $250,000 contributed $81 billion to charities, according to the IRS. \nThat is an average contribution of $22,000. The people with incomes \nbelow that have made an average contribution of $2,700, nearly 10 times \nless. So the charitable contributions made in this country clearly come \nin the bulk from those who earn over $250,000 who would see the tax \nbenefit from making that contribution go down if President Obama has \nhis way.\n  I have two interesting personal comments to make about that, one from \nmy son who was having a debate with one of his liberal friends. His \nliberal friend said to him: Jim, you don't earn over $250,000 so this \nwould not affect you. Why are you so concerned?\n  He responded: I work for a nonprofit. If their contributions are cut \nas a result of this, it will affect me. More importantly, it will \naffect those people whom this nonprofit serves.\n  I take my son Jim as an example. The nonprofits in this country \nemploy 10.2 million people. When we talk about this budget saving jobs, \nwe have to ask: How many of that 10.2 million people will lose their \njobs as they see the contributions go down as a result of this change \nin tax treatment?\n  President Obama says: You should make the contribution regardless of \nthe tax treatment. The tax treatment should not stand in the way of \nyour doing good work.\n  I agree with that. But if the tax treatment holds down the amount of \nmoney you have available to do good work, it will impact it.\n  George Washington made this comment with respect to charitable \ncontributions:\n\n       Let your heart feel for affliction and distress of everyone \n     and let your hand give in proportion to your purse.\n\n  What is happening is that President Obama is suggesting that the \nproportion of your purse will go down as a result of Federal action.\n  Now I go to the second personal experience that comes out of this. I \nhave long been known as one who is a strong supporter of the arts. I \nsupported the arts when some members of my party wanted to eliminate \nthem, particularly the National Endowment for the Arts. I was here on \nthis floor to argue in favor of that and have been happy to see the \narts amount go up each year since we saved it as a result of the action \nwe did in the Senate. Our friends in the other body had zeroed it out \nin their budget, and we did our best and succeeded in saving it.\n  A group of arts people have been to see me this week, thanked me for \nthe work I have done--and I thanked them for that--and then described \ntheir problem. Their problem is, of course, that their contributions \nare down. Why? Because the economy is down. So they are having to lay \npeople off. They are saying: Can't we get an even bigger Federal \ncontribution to make up for the fact that the private contributions are \ndown?\n  Step back from those two comments and see how ironic it is. The \nPresident is saying: We are going to change the tax treatment so there \nwill be less incentive for private contributions. The people who live \non the basis of these contributions are saying: Our contributions are \ndown. Will you please increase the tax contribution so we can make up \nthe difference?\n  The President's proposal sets up a situation which takes away with \none hand and then presumably gives with another. There is a proposal in \nthis deficit for more money for the arts.\n  I support that proposal, as I say, because I have always been in \nfavor of some money for the arts, but not for enough money from the \nFederal taxpayer to make up the amount that will be lost if we follow \nPresident Obama's proposal. My amendment will deal with that.\n  Over one-third of the charitable contributions that are paid go to \nfaith-based organizations, to churches. We have always recognized the \nimportance of religion in this country. Freedom of religion is the \nfirst item mentioned in the first amendment. The Founding Fathers \nthought that freedom of religion and saying that Congress shall in no \nway interfere with religions was the most important thing they could \nsay in the first amendment. It is there ahead of freedom of speech, \nahead of freedom of the press, ahead of the right to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of your grievances.\n  We are going to say to those faith-based organizations, all right, \nthe large donors who make the contributions to the church universities \nor to the major church activities, they are going to be discouraged by \nvirtue of this tax treatment President Obama has proposed. Yes, you can \nstill pass the plate for the small parishioners. And I do not wish in \nany way to denigrate the importance of the widow's mite, but anyone who \nhas ever run a major fundraising organization knows that you start out \nwith the big contributions first, and\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\nthen you try to add to those the smaller contributions and get \neverybody involved.\n  I come from a constituency that has a long history of faith-based \ncontributions and that has used those contributions for tremendously \nvaluable purposes. Originally, to bring people to Utah, they organized \nwhat was known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund. People of means put \nmoney into that fund so people who could not afford to come to Utah \ncould borrow from it; and then, when they were there, they would pay it \nback. That is why it was called the Perpetual Emigration Fund. We do \nnot need that anymore.\n  We now have what is known as the Perpetual Education Fund. People of \nmeans put substantial amounts into this fund, which then makes loans to \nthose who cannot get an education otherwise. We heard the Senator from \nIllinois talk about the importance of educational loans and the \nimportance of Pell grants. This is a fund that makes loans of all \nkinds, primarily to people at the bottom of the economic ladder, to \ngive them a trade, to help them get the skills they need to support \ntheir families--mainly young people who do not have families yet and \nmay not be starting families because they are afraid they cannot afford \nit.\n  The large contributors who contribute to this fund are now being \ntold: Well, we still need your money. We still need this effort for all \nof these young people who need this benefit. But the Federal Government \nis going to take a little more off the top than they used to.\n  For those who say: Well, I have only so much to give, and I have to \nreduce it in order to be able to pay the extra tax, it is the Perpetual \nEducation Fund that will pay the price.\n  So we have submitted this amendment that would make it clear that \nnothing in this budget could be used to put in place the President's \nproposal, and I hope when the time comes, all of my Senators will vote \nfor it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are discussing and debating all week on \nthe budget resolution. I stand before the Senate tonight to talk about \nsome amendments I am offering. But this is a budget that President \nObama has worked very hard on, as well as Chairman Kent Conrad, the \nchairman of our Budget Committee. That work done by the President and \nhis team, as well as by the Budget Committee, has resulted in a series \nof proposals that focuses on a whole range of issues.\n  But one of the most important parts about this resolution is that it \nkeeps its focus on recovery for the short term, but long term it \nfocuses on issues we all are concerned about and need to spend a lot of \ntime on--issues such as health care, education, and energy. This budget \nalso cuts the deficit in half over the next couple of years and cuts \ntaxes for working families.\n  We need to focus on all of those issues, and more, because of what \nhas happened to our economy. Since December of 2007, we have lost 4.4 \nmillion jobs. In my home State of Pennsylvania, in February of this \nyear, it was reported we had lost 41,000 jobs--the largest single month \njob loss for the State in 13 years.\n  These numbers reveal that not only is the economic downturn ongoing \nbut the pace of job loss is not slowing down. In response to the \neconomic crisis, many of our communities in Pennsylvania have community \ncolleges that have offered at least one semester of free tuition to \nworkers who have lost their jobs as a result of the economic downturn.\n  The first amendment I am offering creates a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund to establish a tuition assistance program in the Department of \nLabor. Voluntary participation in this program will not only help \nworkers in need of skills and training for future employment, it will \nalso strengthen qualifying educational institutions and reinforce their \nrole in workforce development in our complex economy.\n  It makes perfect sense that when people are losing their jobs because \nof the economy, because of the recession, they be offered an \nopportunity for further education. This amendment makes all the sense \nin the world in light of that reality.\n  The second amendment I am offering sets forth a fund for accelerated \ncarbon capture and storage and advanced coal technologies. This \namendment creates a fund to accelerate the research, development, \ndemonstration, and deployment of advanced carbon capture and storage, \nknown by the acronym CCS, and coal power generation technologies.\n  Today, coal provides over half of the Nation's electricity and \nsupplies more than 40 percent--40 percent--of worldwide electricity \ndemand. Any domestic program to meet the challenge of climate change \nmust include carbon capture and sequestration. We know coal helps build \nour businesses, helps keep American homes, factories, airports, \nschools, and hospitals humming. It creates millions of good-paying jobs \nacross the economy.\n  We know in addition to addressing our greenhouse gas \nresponsibilities, this amendment I am offering will make the United \nStates a leader in the development and export--and that word is very \nimportant: ``export''--of advanced coal technologies to those countries \nsuch as China and India that also rely upon coal as their dominant \nenergy source.\n  I am proud to be joined in this amendment by Senators Rockefeller, \nBayh, and Stabenow.\n  Finally, I have a third amendment which would create a deficit-\nneutral fund for long-term stability and housing for victims of \nviolence. This would be an amendment that speaks directly to a program \nauthorized under the Violence Against Women Act--a great piece of \nlegislation passed to protect women in America.\n  I am offering this amendment because I want to highlight two very \nserious problems in this country and the relationship between the two: \ndomestic violence, on the one hand, and its impact on women and \nchildren.\n  In particular, women and children in high numbers fleeing abusive \nsituations often become homeless. There are many very harmful \nconsequences of homelessness for children, which I will mention in a \nmoment. But first I want to emphasize the nexus between domestic \nviolence, on the one hand, and homelessness on the other. That is the \nreason I am offering this amendment.\n  One of the things the National Center on Family Homelessness \nhighlighted in its recent report is how frequently domestic violence is \na direct avenue to homelessness for women and children. This is \nsupported by other data from the National Network to End Domestic \nViolence and many other policy groups and researchers.\n  Several national and State reports show that between 22 and 57 \npercent of homeless women report that domestic violence was the \nimmediate cause of their homelessness. Research on domestic violence is \nwell documented that batterers commonly sabotage a woman's economic \nstability, making abused women more vulnerable to homelessness. This \nprogram I am offering an amendment for builds on collaboration between \ndomestic violence service providers and housing providers and \ndevelopers to leverage existing resources and create housing solutions \nthat meet victims' needs for long-term housing. Helping victims remain \nsafe and stable over time is critical. Victims of domestic violence \noften return to their abuser because they cannot find long-term \nhousing.\n\n  Just to give one example of a real person, a real story from my home \ncounty, Lackawanna County, PA: Jean is a 43-year-old survivor who \nexperienced severe domestic violence during her 10-year marriage. She \nfiled for divorce from her abuser in an attempt to find a better life \nfor her and her 2 children, a 4-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter. \nUnfortunately, as often happens when the victim tries to end the \nrelationship, the violence escalated as her husband stalked her, broke \ninto her home, and severely beat her with a crowbar as her son watched \nin horror. Her husband was arrested and sentenced to 1 to 4 years.\n  Following the arrest of her estranged husband, Jean turned to the \nWomen's Resource Center in Scranton, PA. There, she received free and \nconfidential counseling and became an active participant in support \ngroups. Her children joined the children's group at the center, and \nwith legal representation from the center, Jean was able to \nsuccessfully fight her ex-husband's petition for custody while he was \nin prison.\n  Jean's family resided in transitional housing offered by the center \nwhile she\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\ngot back on her feet financially after the divorce. She returned to \nschool, and this past Mother's Day she graduated with a bachelor's \ndegree in social work. She completed an internship at the center and \nnow works as relief staff member at the center as she prepares to \nfinish graduate school this fall.\n  Jean says the center is:\n\n       The wind beneath her wings. Everything I've done, I've done \n     because of their help, their encouragement and their \n     empowerment. I am where I am and who I am today only through \n     their incredible support.\n\n  So said Jean, a real person living a life of horror that most of us \ncan only imagine.\n  Her story illustrates the kind of vital help victims of domestic \nviolence and their children can get and need to get. We have a \nresponsibility, every one of us here has a responsibility to victims of \ndomestic violence and to children to keep these programs and services \ngoing with the funding they need. These programs save money and \nliterally safe lives. As did Jean, victims of domestic violence and \ntheir children can become survivors and go on to live successful, happy \nlives, free of abuse and free of fear. If we do anything in this budget \nthis year, we should speak directly to those victims who are able to \nsurvive horrors that I can't even begin to imagine and go on to lead \nproductive lives.\n  So with these three amendments, I hope to improve upon what I think \nis a very good product already--a budget that focuses on our \npriorities, our fiscal priorities, health care, education, and energy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, while we are getting set up, I would \nfirst ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this week we are laying out a blueprint \nfor the part Congress will play in America's economic recovery.\n  Our budget isn't just a list of revenues and expenditures; it is a \nbalance sheet of priorities and values. The line of numbers come \ntogether to form a bigger picture, laying out a vision for where we \nplan to lead the Nation. On a practical level, it gives us a chance to \nplan how we are going to create jobs, reform health care, make college \nmore affordable, and end our dependence on foreign oil. This is \nPresident Obama's vision, and it is a mission we share and seek to make \na reality with this budget.\n  Considering the current state of the economy, the times demand a bold \nstrategy to give immediate help to those damaged by the crisis and \ncreate the conditions for recovery in the long term. But as we are \nmoving forward with clarity and confidence, let's not forget how we got \nwhere we are today.\n  We would all prefer not to have the Government run a deficit and a \ndebt. There is no question about that. Unfortunately, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are a little late in coming to that \nconclusion. Republican policies were tried in the last Presidency over \nthe last 8 years and were tried in Congress for 10 years. They took a \nrecord surplus to a record deficit. They added trillions of dollars in \ndebt, trading away our fiscal health in exchange for subsidies to big \noil companies and tax breaks for the wealthy. They rubberstamped a $1 \ntrillion war in Iraq without even accounting for it in the budget.\n  For those who are proclaiming themselves guardians of fiscal \nresponsibility, where were they when Dick Cheney declared that \n``deficits don't matter''? Deficits don't matter.\n  So let's be very clear: It is a Republican deficit that we are \ninheriting and that the President inherited. Even if he did absolutely \nnothing, he would have well over a $1 trillion deficit.\n  Republican policies got us into the red. As President Obama has made \nvery clear, over the next few years we are going to bring down that \ndeficit he inherited because our long-term financial health depends on \nit. But right now, there is a bigger question. The question isn't just \nhow do we cut the Republican deficit the Nation inherited; the question \nis, What kind of country do we want our children to inherit? Do we want \nthem to inherit a country where foreign workers are better trained and \nbetter prepared to compete in the global economy or a country where \nAmericans are, bar none, hands-down the best educated, best trained \ninnovators in the world? Should the country they grow up in be one \nwhere they stay up at night worrying because one serious illness or \ninjury can drive their family into bankruptcy or one where everybody \ncan sleep soundly, knowing their whole family has health coverage? Is \nthis going to be a nation that is forced to send hundreds of billions \nof dollars a year to foreign governments to pay for oil or a leader in \nthe development of clean, cheap energy, creating jobs that can't be \noutsourced in exporting our technologies around the world?\n  Those are the choices we face, and in this budget we have chosen our \npath with confidence. We are making health care more affordable for the \nmiddle class, investing in clean energy to create jobs that can't be \noutsourced, helping more middle-class Americans get a college \neducation, and cutting taxes for middle-class Americans. That is the \nkind of country President Obama has promised to help us build, and it \nis the kind of country we are choosing to build in this budget. In a \nsense, if we want to get our economy moving again, we don't really have \na choice but to make these investments.\n  Since this recession began, more than 4 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs, 600,000 people are losing their jobs every month and often \ntheir health insurance along with it. The housing market, the epicenter \nof this crisis, is still unstable. A tsunami of foreclosures is still \ndevastating our neighborhoods and leaving families on the rocks, while \nhomeowners have seen their homes lose a staggering collective $6.1 \ntrillion in value since 2006. While paychecks are shrinking, Americans \ncontinue to send hundreds of billions of dollars every year to foreign \ncountries to pay for their oil.\n  So I don't think there is any doubt that investing in a better future \nisn't a luxury; it is a necessity. It is time for the kind of \nreinvestment this country needs to recover our economic dynamism and \nstrengthen the 21st century economy, and that is what this budget does.\n  Let me talk about middle-class tax relief.\n  First, this budget brings immediate tax relief to middle-class \nfamilies. It brings tax relief to married couples, an expanded child \ntax credit, and a patch for the alternative minimum tax. That tax, the \nalternative minimum tax, was originally designed to keep the wealthiest \nAmericans from using creative accounting to avoid all taxes, but it was \nnever intended to hit the middle class as hard as it is hitting them \nright now.\n  I am proud to have introduced the amendment earlier this year in the \nstimulus package that passed that saves, for example, in my home State \nof New Jersey, over a million New Jersey families up to $5,600 a year, \nand this budget makes a commitment to those taxpayers that they will \nnot be subjected to higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax for \nthe next several years. That is why collectively all of the tax cut \nbenefits--the revenue changes in this budget--are about $825 billion in \ntax cuts over the next 5 years. That is the kind of relief we need to \nput money back into people's pockets and give families who are being \nsqueezed some financial breathing room. If you are a middle-class \nfamily, there is no doubt that this budget is good for you.\n  Our budget also makes a strong investment in education. There are few \ninstruments and investments we can make that are as important because \nit is no secret how closely tied our economic success is to success in \nthe classroom. The country that out-teaches us today out-competes us \ntomorrow. So if we are going to stay at the apex of the curve of \nintellect and innovation, we need to invest in human capital and give \nour young people the skills to thrive in a 21st century economy.\n  I know what that means personally. I know what Pell grants and other \nassistance for higher education means for students and their families. \nI was raised in a tenement--poor, the son of immigrants, the first in \nmy family to go to college. I know I wouldn't be standing here today as \none of 100 Senators in a country of 300 million people if it weren't \nfor the Federal Government's support for higher education.\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nSo I am proud that this budget commits to making college more \naffordable. It boosts Pell grants to $5,550, and it provides a $2,500 \ncredit for higher education through the American opportunity tax \ncredit. That amounts to almost half of tuition at a State college or \nresearch university and full tuition at a community college. That is \nthe kind of investment we need to help workers damaged by this crisis \nas well as to prepare younger people for a brighter future.\n  Our family budgets, our economic competitiveness, the stability of \nour climate, and our national security all depend on ending our \ndependence on foreign oil. The budget builds on the economic recovery \npackage, supporting investments in renewable energy, efficiency and \nconservation, and modernizing the electric grid. I am proud to have \nauthored provisions that bring funding to our communities to help save \nenergy in the most efficient ways they know. The more we assist our \nhometowns in energy-efficiency projects, the more it creates jobs, \nbrings down our electric and heating bills, and fights the global \nwarming that threatens our very way of life.\n  The budget also takes a major step toward making health care more \naccessible and affordable. It expands coverage, saves on costs by \nimplementing new technologies, puts a stronger emphasis on prevention \nand wellness, and supports the kind of research that can find a cure \nfor my mom's Alzheimer's. For years, the administration neglected key \nareas of the Federal health system. This budget restores them to their \nrightful importance.\n  We are going to have a National Institutes of Health which will save \nlives with their innovations. We are going to have an FDA that has the \nresources to keep the food we put on the table safe to eat and make \nsure we fully know the risks and rewards of the drugs that come into \nthe market. A larger health care reform is on the way, but up until \nthat happens, our message is very clear: We will not rest until, in \nthis great Nation of ours, no one goes to sleep at night without access \nto affordable health care.\n  Let me conclude. There is one thing all economic crises have in \ncommon: They all end. While history has shown that government can play \na constructive role, a recovery can't come from government alone. The \njobs of the 21st century are going to be created by the free market \nwithin a regulatory structure that prevents it from collapsing on \nitself. With the kinds of investments we make in this budget, we are \npaving the way for the private sector to create jobs and start us on \nthe road to economic recovery.\n  The budget sends tax relief where it should go: to working middle-\nclass families. It moves us away from the mistakes of the past by \naccounting for the costs of the war in Iraq until we withdraw in 2010. \nIt makes health care more affordable and brings a college education \nwithin reach for millions of young people. It makes the investments to \nbegin to end our dependence on foreign oil that will keep money in our \npockets and create jobs here in America. And it will cut the deficit \nPresident Bush left us before the end of President Obama's term.\n  To sum it all up, we put forth a plan to invest in our future and get \nour economy moving again. It is a plan that puts forth a basic idea \nabout what America should be. It should be a country where anyone \nwilling to work hard can get an education and a job, a country where \neveryone has access to the medical services that keep them healthy, a \ncountry where a lifetime of hard work guarantees the right to retire \nwith dignity, a country that knows its past and cares about its future.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I am tired of hearing just a chorus of \nnoes, the same old politics, the same old Republican policies that got \nus to where we are today. As President Obama and we try to move forward \nin a much better direction for the country, what we hear is no, no, and \nno. This is about saying yes to a brighter future. This is about saying \nyes to the fulfillment of the opportunities that each and every \nAmerican should have. This is about saying yes to a new set of \npolicies, and it is about an opportunity to change the direction of our \ncountry.\n  I have great faith that we will meet these challenges. This is a \ncountry that went to war twice in Europe to beat nazism and fascism and \ndid so. This is a country that put a man on the Moon and created a \nscientific revolution as a result of it. It is a country that cured \ndiseases that were once thought incurable. It started a technological \nrevolution that still is the envy of the world. And with this budget \nand working with this President, it is a country that, once again, will \nlead both at home and abroad.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nunderlying budget resolution we are considering this week. I first want \nto thank Chairman Conrad for all of his leadership and for the good \nwork he and his staff have put into developing this budget resolution.\n  In November, the American people chose a new direction. That is what \nPresident Obama and this 111th Congress are working to deliver. I am \nproud of what we have been able to accomplish so far: an economic \nrecovery package that is already putting Americans back to work and \ninvesting in our communities; a children's health insurance bill that \nexpands access to health insurance to 4 million children who will now \nbe able to receive health care services no matter what the \ncircumstances their families face; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, \nwhich ensures that all Americans are paid the same regardless of age, \ngender, race, or ethnicity; a national service bill that taps into the \nstrong desire of Americans to do their part to help our country recover \nand prosper through voluntarism; a public lands bill, which is the most \nsignificant conservation legislation passed by Congress in 15 years.\n  We are off to a good start, but we all know we still have a lot of \nchallenges to tackle. We have inherited the worst economic crisis in \ngenerations, and we need to get our economy back on track. That means \nfinally addressing challenges that have been ignored for far too long. \nWe have the opportunity to begin this process now by passing a \ncomprehensive and sensible budget to guide our next year.\n  I support the priorities that President Obama has set out for the \nbudget. Like the President, I believe we must reform our health care \nsystem. We must move our country toward energy independence. We must \nexpand the promise of education. We must cut our national deficit in \nhalf over the next 4 years.\n  Right now, we spend 16 percent of the national gross domestic product \non a health care system that is broken. This is the time--especially \nnow--when we need to reform health care to bring down costs, expand \ncoverage, and improve the quality of the health care coverage that we \nall receive.\n  Our Nation can save billions of dollars through health information \ntechnology. I am pleased this budget that we are considering builds on \nthe funding in the economic recovery package that has been dedicated to \nmodernizing health care through the use of electronic medical records.\n  This budget also makes a significant investment in comparative \neffectiveness research. It is a long name, but what it essentially \nmeans is that we need to look at what is working in health care for the \nleast cost, the research on which Dartmouth College in my home State of \nNew Hampshire has been working hard. The Dartmouth Atlas Project has \ndone some of the best research into looking at what is most effective \nfor health care procedures and remedies in the country.\n  On energy, we all know our national energy strategy has been on an \nunsustainable course for a very long time. We are overly dependent on \nforeign oil, and we must begin to address the threats of climate \nchange.\n  These challenges call for a paradigm shift in the way we produce and \nuse energy. I am pleased the budget we are considering makes \ninvestments in clean energy technology, energy efficiency, and \nrecognizes that we have to modernize our energy infrastructure. I \nbelieve these investments in clean energy will create new green-collar \njobs\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nat home that will save consumers money.\n  We also have to invest in education so our children can compete in \nthis global economy. Senator Menendez talked about that very eloquently \na little while ago when he talked about his experiences.\n  I am one of those kids, too, who, without a public system of higher \neducation, would not have been able to go to college. That is why I am \npleased the budget resolution we are considering expands opportunities \nfor students to go to college--to go to college and to graduate--\nbecause it increases Pell grants to $5,550 per student and provides \neducation tax incentives for families.\n  This budget also recognizes the critical importance of the early \nyears in a child's life by providing significant support for early \nchildhood education and title I programs. The long-term strength of our \neconomy is dependent on each of these issues--education, health care, \nand energy policy. We need to act now to make critical investments to \nstimulate the economy in the short term. But we also have to do this in \na fiscally responsible way that puts us on a path toward reducing our \ndeficit. The budget deficit has been growing for 8 years. This \nPresident and this Congress inherited a debt and deficit that are at \nrecord highs. We are not going to erase these deficits and debt \novernight. But we can work toward significantly cutting the deficit \nover the next few years. The budget that has been laid out by Senator \nConrad and the Budget Committee puts us on an aggressive course toward \na balanced budget.\n  Spending nearly doubled under the previous administration, and \nrevenues have now fallen to the lowest level as a share of our economy \nsince 1950. The Obama administration inherited these record deficits \nand a national debt that doubled during the 8 years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  This Congress, this President, and this budget are reversing course \nand putting our country back on a path to a balanced budget. This \nbudget cuts the deficit by two-thirds by 2014. At the same time, it \nmakes wise investments that will lead to economic growth in the future.\n  As a former Governor, I understand how important and difficult it is \nto balance the budget. It takes a lot of hard work, patience, and \ncompromise.\n  I never expected the New Hampshire State Legislature to rubberstamp \nmy budget when I submitted it. I knew it would change to reflect the \ninterests and priorities of legislators, and that is exactly what is \nhappening in Congress. But I also understand this Congress is going to \nsend a budget back to the President that I believe will contain those \npriorities that the President supports and that we support as Members \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, I also want to speak about an amendment I intend to \noffer this week. My amendment is No. 776. It is simple and \nstraightforward. It would establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \nmonitor FHA-approved loans. We have to remember that one of the things \nthat got us into this economic mess is what happened in the housing \nmarket. Unfortunately, we need to make sure that doesn't continue to \nhappen going forward.\n  The Federal Housing Administration is playing an increasingly \ncritical role in promoting home ownership during these tough economic \ntimes. The FHA now insures about one-third of all new mortgages.\n  In the runup to the subprime crisis, many fraudulent lenders pushed \nborrowers into mortgages and refinancing that they could not afford \njust to collect commissions and fees. We need to make sure we prevent \nthat from migrating now to federally insured loans, which would put \ntaxpayers at risk of footing the bill for another bailout.\n  The amendment I am going to offer addresses the need for HUD--Housing \nand Urban Development--to be able to properly investigate and remove \nfraudulent lenders from the program whenever they deem it appropriate.\n  As I said, I am confident that we will be able to pass a budget that \ninvests in the future of America. I am hopeful all of our colleagues \nwill join in that effort because I think it is important to strengthen \nthe middle class, restore fiscal discipline, and make the investments \nthat we need to make to ensure that this country is going to continue \nto be strong and competitive in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the 2010 budget resolution, and I \nhope they will also support the amendment I am offering to address \npotential fraud in the FHA housing market.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 15, Air Force SSG \nTimothy Bowles decided to help a fellow soldier. A friend was scheduled \nto visit a school near Kot, Afghanistan, as part of his provincial \nreconstruction duties, but he was feeling sick. Timothy offered to take \nhis place.\n  He never returned from that trip. Timothy Bowles was killed when his \nvehicle was destroyed by a roadside bomb. He was 24.\n  We all celebrate the remarkable bravery of our men and women in \nuniform. But Timothy was not just a brave soldier; he was a deeply kind \nand caring man. He displayed not just the martial virtues of the \nsoldier, but the simple kindness that we all hope to find in our \nfriends, our families, our fellow citizens.\n  Timothy grew up in the Air Force. His dad, Air Force Msgt Louis \nBowles, fought in the first gulf war. As a child, Timothy moved from \nbase to base while his dad served our country. He knew the hardships \nthat the military can bring. But when he turned 18, he quickly signed \nup to serve.\n  We tend to think of that decision as one of physical bravery. Every \nsoldier accepts the risk of injury or death. They commit themselves to \nchallenges that many Americans will never know. And they put in the \neffort that will transform them from civilians into soldiers--the \neffort that makes the U.S. military the finest fighting force in the \nworld.\n  But the decision to become a soldier is also an extension of values \nthat we all share. It is the act of a good neighbor pledging to help \nkeep the neighborhood safe. Of a good father telling his family they \ncan count on him. Of a good citizen who puts his community before \nhimself.\n  Please join me in honoring Timothy Bowles and extending our \nsympathies to his father Louis, his mother Lisa, his sister Heather, \nand all of the Bowles family.\n  Timothy was a good soldier and a good friend--to his fellow soldiers, \nand to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4055-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4055-S4056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, ``America the Beautiful'' is perhaps \none of the most moving anthems that captures the very essence of our \nNation. In the fourth verse, Miss Katherine Lee Bates wrote, ``O \nbeautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years, thine alabaster \ncities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed his \ngrace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining \nsea!'' From the inception of our Nation, the strength of America has \nbeen our unwavering sense of honor, an unshakable belief that we are \nall created equal ``under God'' and our unrestrained sense of global \nhumanity.\n  This is the embodiment of the American Red Cross and of the vision \narticulated by Clara Barton, founder of this wonderful organization \nthat has helped countless individuals in times of crisis whether \ncomforting a wounded soldier during battle, assisting those who are\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nrecovering from a natural disaster, or administering life-saving blood \nto a sick patient. It is indeed the legacy of this organization to go \nand serve those in most need--even to the endangerment of the \nvolunteer. Clara Barton once elaborated on importance of service to \nothers, ``I may be compelled to face danger, but never fear it, and \nwhile our soldiers can stand and fight, I can stand and feed and nurse \nthem.'' Though the focus of the Red Cross has grown over the years the \ntenacity to help those in need and who face grave danger has never \nwavered.\n  Since 1943, every President of the United States has proclaimed March \nas American Red Cross Month and in turn, the organization uses this \nmonth to promote the services provided to the public each and every \nday. Communities depend on the Red Cross in times of need and the Red \nCross depends on the support of the public to achieve its mission.\n  I am pleased to join with the Red Cross and highlight the courageous \nwork that this organization accomplishes year after year and celebrate \nMarch as American Red Cross Month. As one of the best known \nhumanitarian organizations, the Red Cross has been at the forefront of \nproviding aid to soldiers during times of war and peace and helping \nindividuals and families prevent, prepare for and respond to large and \nsmall scale disasters for more than 127 years.\n  I am very pleased of the work that the Kansas Red Cross has achieved \nover the years and am especially delighted to highlight the work of the \nKansas Capital Area Chapter for their involvement in the creation of \nthe ``Holiday Mail for Heroes.'' This program is a partnership between \nthe Red Cross, Pitney Bowes, and the American people. Holiday Mail for \nHeroes distributes holiday cards to military veterans and active duty \npersonnel throughout the world. This past year, over 1 million cards \nwere received and sorted by hundreds of Red Cross volunteers. Pitney \nBowes boxed and shipped them to different distribution sites--the \nKansas Capital Area Chapter being one of them--and I am proud to \nreport, shipped more than 1,000 cards.\n  In addition, to the focus on veterans, the Red Cross also provides \nprograms that promote health and safety services as well. These vital \nservices help to save lives and strengthen communities through \neducation, training and products that enable people to prevent, prepare \nfor and respond to disasters and other life-threatening emergencies. I \nknow that I am profoundly grateful for the services that the Red Cross \nhas given to my state during our times of challenges with natural \ndisasters.\n  Last year alone, more than 5 million people took advantage of such \neducational opportunities, attending Red Cross first aid, \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation--CPR--and automated external \ndefibrillation--AED--training classes. I know that I am profoundly \ngrateful for the services that the Red Cross has given to my State \nduring our times of challenges with natural disasters.\n  Other educational programs and services include Aquatics, such as \nbasic swimming lessons, lifeguarding and water safety, care-giving, and \nHIV/AIDS education.\n  The American Red Cross has been able to provide services because of \nthe tireless and dedicated work of volunteers, often known as ``Red \nCrossers.'' Many of these ``Red Crossers'' have been involved in their \ncommunities for 10, 20 or even 80 years.\n  Mr. President, it is very fitting that we celebrate March as American \nRed Cross Month and continue to advance the principles of this very \nessential organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4056-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4056-S4058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Our family is being greatly affected by the rising energy \n     prices, especially gasoline; we are average middle income \n     America here and we do not have a lot of extra money to keep \n     up with the rising gas prices. If something could be done \n     such as more development of domestic oil, fossil fuels, \n     nuclear research or anything else, besides depending on OPEC \n     prices, that would be a really boon for our Nation as a whole \n     and help with our correct recession. Have a blessed day.\n     Brent and Charlene.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife Suzanne and I are Idaho natives of 33 years. We \n     have three children who are approaching the teen years. I \n     earn a modest income as a police officer in Caldwell. From \n     the time of our marriage over 13 years ago until last year, \n     Suzanne had served our family as a homemaker and educator of \n     our children. Part of curriculum Suzanne employed involved \n     music lessons, sports, and dance, which required many miles \n     per week of driving from our home to each event. Even though \n     we operate a fuel-efficient vehicle getting over 30 mpg, the \n     transportation costs have always been substantial. Last fall, \n     we made the decision to enroll our children in a local \n     charter school focusing on our children's talents in music. I \n     am proud to say that they tested into the school a grade \n     level above their age and have all received high honors in \n     their first year. This is a testament to Suzanne's hard work \n     and skill as a teacher.\n       Since Suzanne and I enrolled our children into school, she \n     decided to take a part-time job in Meridian to help our \n     income. At about the same time Suzanne entered the work \n     force, fuel prices began to rise and have never stopped. Now \n     we still have travel for music lessons, sports, and dance, as \n     well as Suzanne's commute to work. Despite our efforts to \n     conserve, Suzanne's income is completely used up and then \n     some paying for higher fuel prices. Each year over the past 5 \n     years or so, I have made more money, but we have had a \n     continually harder time providing for our family's needs. I \n     believe that this is due in large part to the price of fuel.\n       I hope that this recent fuel price increase will prompt the \n     members of Congress to act and the citizens of our country \n     not to accept less than the best solution to the problem. I \n     am in favor of allowing the free market to solve the energy \n     problem with innovation. I do not support the intrusion of \n     the Federal Government with taxes and regulations. I think \n     the ideas of windfall profits taxes for corporations' amount \n     to no less than theft and would serve only to severely damage \n     our Nation's long-term productivity and morale. I would like \n     to see the following things happen ASAP and believe if \n     implemented that they would solve the fuel shortage very \n     soon, as well as stabilize the market for decades to come \n     without any compromise to the environment:\n       Build nuclear reactors to produce a clean, long-term supply \n     for electricity. Retire all dams on the Snake River in Idaho \n     and Washington once nuclear reactors are online.\n       Lift the drilling restrictions on domestic petroleum \n     exploration.\n       Allow for the construction of enough oil refineries and \n     infrastructure to handle the projected increase in demand and \n     oil production.\n       Immediately stop production and government subsidy of \n     ethanol. It is not efficient and cannot support itself. Corn \n     is best used for food.\n       Stop refining so many different grades of gasoline. Refine \n     only 92 octane gasoline and #2 diesel fuel. This will provide \n     fuel for all cars currently in use while increasing current \n     refinery production capacity through consolidation.\n       Offer tax incentives to auto makers to produce vehicles \n     that get good mpg (35+ for cars, 25+ for trucks). Allowing \n     the free market to solve the problem, which they are already \n     trying to do, is the best and quickest way to get it done.\n       I hope this letter finds its way to those who can help \n     effect the change necessary to keep our country secure and \n     prosperous. Thank you for time.\n     Scott, Middleton.\n                                  ____\n\n       Fuel is a necessity in our country, just as milk and eggs \n     cannot be traded in futures markets oil should not be \n     speculated on. I work in the transportation industry. \n     Currently, due to high fuel prices, business is poor, \n     reducing my income. There is little or no public \n     transportation available to me so my costs have increased \n     dramatically in spite of my efforts to travel less. I cannot \n     continue on this path much longer without painful sacrifices \n     or perhaps an additional job.

We have the \n     resources we need in this country. Let us have access to what \n     rightfully belongs to the American people. Maybe it takes 10 \n     years for this to have an effect. Where will we be 10 years \n     from now if we do nothing now? New technologies need to be \n     developed, but in the meantime we should use some of the \n     resources that we have available to us, if we do not, those \n     countries who are using the resources available to them \n     (China? Venezuela? Brazil?) will own us. Our government and \n     special interest groups have made it so that we cannot use \n     our own steel, coal, oil, timber, and many other natural \n     resources; we are being regulated back to the days of the \n     horse and buggy. The way I see it, not only is this fuel \n     crisis an economic threat; it is a threat to our national \n     security.\n       Please share my sentiments with your peers. Better yet, how \n     about having some of us from the middle class come and talk \n     some sense to them. As a regular citizen I do not have the \n     capability to make an ``emergency appropriation'' to cover my \n     shortfalls. Inaction on the part of Congress and the Senate \n     will have serious consequences in the near and long term.\n     John, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to send you my thoughts on the \n     ``Energy Crisis''. Like many Americans our age, my wife and I \n     had dreamed and planned of the time we would retire. While \n     never rich, we were always comfortable. When we retired we \n     had sufficient for our needs and a little to spare.\n       We have five (5) children and 23 grandchildren. As our \n     children were growing, one of the many happy memories they \n     had of their grandparents was each summer knowing they would \n     come with their 5th wheel trailer and spend time with us. \n     Sometimes we camped with them, other times they just parked \n     in front, or alongside our home and used their trailer as \n     their home away from home. They were then in the same \n     position we are now. Their children had moved from the area \n     seeking jobs and opportunities not found were our parents \n     lived.\n       For years we planned to be able to live a similar life. \n     Spending time with each of our children and grandchildren \n     building memories and connections of love that would help \n     knit our family into a family similar to the one we shared \n     with our parents.\n       About 5 years before my retirement, we purchased a modest \n     5th wheel trailer and a pick-up truck to pull it. We wanted \n     to have everything paid for prior to my retirement. The \n     trailer will never be used as we had planned because the cost \n     to pull it is greater than we feel we can afford. We have one \n     son who lives here in Idaho Falls, and we are able to enjoy \n     his family on an ongoing basis. Our son who with his family \n     lives in Oklahoma will get to see us for a few days once a \n     year. Even driving our car which does get quite good mileage \n     makes the cost for multiple trips per year out of the \n     question. Our daughter and her family who live in the \n     Seattle, WA, area similarly will be able to enjoy an annual \n     visit (again driving our car). Our other daughter and son \n     live in Utah, and because of the relatively close proximity, \n     we are able to visit several times per year.\n       We had dreamed of being able to take our grandchildren at \n     various times to see some of the wonderful sights of our \n     country, such as Yellowstone Park, Mount Rushmore, Zion \n     National Park and other such areas. With our truck and \n     trailer it would have been a wonderful adventure. By car with \n     the costs of lodging, meals, and especially fuel even that is \n     not a viable option.\n       Do we suffer with insufficient food, power, or other \n     necessities of life? The answer is no. Do we long to be able \n     to share with our loved ones the time and experiences that \n     our children enjoyed with their grandparents? The answer is \n     definitely yes.\n       The impact of our situation will influence negatively not \n     only my wife and I but future generations as well. Traditions \n     that were important in our lives will be lost. The connection \n     from one generation to the next and the generations that \n     follow will be weakened.\n       We feel blessed that we presently have sufficient for our \n     daily needs, and a little to spare, but we also feel betrayed \n     by a series of decisions and events that have taken from us \n     our dreams.\n       Thank you for allowing me to provide this to you.\n     Orville and Rhea, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work at the INL, and my wife has a painting and \n     decorating business. I ride the bus to work, and my wife has \n     two employees for the summer; they are college students. We \n     have had to use our home equity line of credit to cover the \n     extra cost of fuel and everything it has caused the price to \n     increase on. People we come into contact with at the INL or \n     through the painting business are saying the same thing. \n     People have less money to spend because the cost of \n     everything is going up, due to the fact that the price of oil \n     affects everything, just not driving. With less money to \n     spend, people are doing less, putting off home repairs, \n     vehicle repairs, skipping a visit to the doctor or dentist, \n     the effects are being felt by everyone.\n       Drilling for oil off our coasts, in Alaska, oil shale and \n     other areas should be a No. 1 priority. The technology exists \n     to do it safely and environmentally friendly. Yes, there \n     should be windmills, ethanol, biodiesel and other \n     alternatives, but those alone will not solve the problem. \n     More oil is being used worldwide, so more needs to be \n     produced. Oil is used in so many things that it will always \n     be in demand. I would rather see my money go to the oil \n     companies, than to the Arab countries. If we are drilling in \n     America, then the money stays in America. I am tired of the \n     lies to the American public that it will take time to drill, \n     how long will it take to get other technologies online. Or \n     the lie that the oil companies have millions of acres of \n     leases. Tell these people to stop the smoke and mirrors game, \n     they were sent to Washington to represent the people, not \n     play games. If they were working for my wife painting, they \n     would have been fired for not getting the job done they were \n     hired to do.\n     Brian.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a family, we are finding the increase in gasoline prices \n     in Idaho especially difficult as we try to continue our \n     regular activities. We rely so much on our transportation \n     needs as we attempt to take advantage of the many \n     opportunities afforded to us here and serve throughout the \n     community. The costs are beginning to have a negative impact \n     and limit so many of our friends as well, as so often, we are \n     all living with tight budgets each month. Raising a family is \n     expensive and getting much more so as the gas prices are \n     passed on to food, clothing, and other costs.\n       Our ancestors saw the need to be self-sufficient, to use \n     and re-use and make do with what they had. This is the best \n     and most effective way to be good stewards of our land and \n     happened long before the trend to go ``green''. Indeed, much \n     of the ``green'' activity today borders on the ridiculous. We \n     would really like to see our Nation become self-sufficient, \n     as well by drilling in our own country, eliminating our \n     dependence on foreign oil. Our lands are special to all of \n     us, especially those of us in remoter areas that are still \n     beautiful and pristine, such as Idaho and Alaska. But if we \n     act responsibly, we can continue to preserve our lands and \n     provide for our own people.\n       We would also like to see some alternative fuel innovations \n     encouraged with incentives to use them.\n       Thank you for all you do for our State. We know that it is \n     hard work, especially working with a Congress that is often \n     unwilling or unable to see the obvious solutions many in the \n     public can see so clearly.\n     Chris and Shawna, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The unacceptable rises in every facet of living is really \n     beginning to affect the quality of life for both myself and \n     my fiance. We have really noticed the strain on our pocket \n     books despite having paid off several debts thus freeing up \n     more of our money. Because of the prices in gas, we are \n     forced to restrict our more frivolous pursuits. We find it \n     hard to partake in dining out and spending money on \n     entertainment. Travel, which we enjoy doing often, is almost \n     out of the question completely. Our spending habits are \n     becoming more and more conservative and only the necessities \n     are being purchased. I know we are not alone in this, for all \n     of our friends and relatives are cutting back and struggling \n     to make ends meet.\n       It cannot be good for the American economy when we are \n     forced to spend most of our money on just getting by. We work \n     hard for our money and resent having it stolen from us at the \n     pumps, the grocery store, and at home while using everyday \n     appliances. While oil companies are enjoying record profits, \n     (Exxon making $40.6 billion in 2007; according to US News), \n     Americans are paying record prices for a gallon of gas. Is \n     there any question as to why gas prices are so high?\n       This madness has to stop. We must pursue other fuel \n     alternatives and fast! Not in 5 or 10 years but today. Our \n     country is heading into a depression and printing more money \n     is not going to solve it. Let us put our Americans to work by \n     making fuels here, at home. It is time we become self-\n     sufficient once again.\n     Roma, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the fine job you do for Idahoans. We realize \n     current energy prices are wreaking havoc because the cost of \n     transportation impacts prices for everything we buy including \n     food and clothing. Those hardest hit, are the poor, elderly \n     and our working families. My grown children and their kids \n     are pinching every penny to try to make ends meet. It is \n     getting much harder.\n       In the short term, I would like our country to utilize safe \n     offshore drilling. (I heard the rigs in the Gulf Coast \n     withstood Katrina very well.) At the same time, we need to \n     understand and utilize ``best practices'' with renewable \n     energy. When we were in Europe a few weeks ago, my husband \n     and I learned they use nuclear power. An electrical engineer \n     we met in our travel group tried to help me understand that \n     nuclear power is safe. I would like to believe that is true, \n     but my only concern is that we not leave a mess for our \n     grandchildren and their grandchildren to solve.\n       Our citizens need to do our part by not buying the gas \n     guzzlers our auto makers so happily design. We can also get \n     off our duffs and walk more and use bicycles. When we were in \n     Holland, my husband and I were amazed at how many people, old \n     and young, use bikes. Kid do not ride school buses; they ride \n     their bikes to school. For that to work here, we need safe \n     bike paths. I would be terrified to let my grandkids use the \n     bike path on our Emerald Connector overpass in Boise.\n       Thank you and God bless you.\n     Marjean, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I thank you for your efforts concerning the energy problems \n     we face. We live in the very\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\n     rural area of Salmon. Public transportation is not an option. \n     Most home sites are within a 10-mile radius of town; however, \n     public trails and non-motorized travel is not an option \n     either. Our family is suffering from the increase in energy \n     costs to the degree that we have had to alter an already \n     modest lifestyle. We live in an area where pickups and SUVs \n     are a way of life. We use our truck to mend fences, irrigate, \n     transport lumber and haul equipment. We have reduced the \n     insurance on this vehicle to liability and only drive it now \n     when we have to. We have purchased a small 1989 ``beater'' \n     car that gets 25 mpg to travel to town. We would purchase a \n     more economical vehicle if we could, in particular, one that \n     utilizes hybrid technology. However, our family cannot afford \n     a $30,000 vehicle; this is a ``luxury'' afforded to the \n     wealthier classes.\n       On visiting Sun Valley recently, we saw a beautiful trail \n     system, a bus system and pedestrians/bikes everywhere. Their \n     community is unique in Idaho. They have the economic \n     foundation to provide alternatives to their citizens that \n     lessen the burden. It is not safe to travel on bike or \n     scooter along US Hwy 93 and 28 into the town of Salmon. Our \n     populous is too small to support a bus system. We would like \n     to see more support for the development of alternative \n     transportation, in particular, non-motorized travel such as a \n     beltway that would connect the rural outskirts to the center \n     of town. As Salmon grows, we are also seeing more children \n     traveling along these narrow and inadequate strips of \n     highway. We would also be providing a safe means for them to \n     access community services such as the library and swimming \n     pool.\n       Many of us are already car pooling and we have limited our \n     trips to town as much as possible. Please help us find other \n     means to lessen the burden of living in rural Idaho.\n     Michelle, Salmon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have been riding a bike to work this is great; however, I \n     am financially strapped to the point where I will not spend \n     any money for anything other than food, gas.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of a \nvery special resident of my home State of Alaska, Curt Menard.\n  Mayor Curt Menard passed away March 3, 2009, after a long battle with \nmyeloma.\n  Mayor Menard was the embodiment of a true Alaskan. Honorably serving \nin our Nation's Air Force took him to our State where he left his mark. \nCurt and his wife Linda purchased one of the original homesteads in the \nMatanuska-Susitna--Mat-Su--valley and Curt became one of the first \ndentists in the area. He devoted his life to the people of the Mat-Su, \nand for that we are all grateful to this remarkable man.\n  On behalf of his family and his many friends, I ask today we honor \nCurt Menard's memory. I ask that his obituary, published March 5, 2009, \nin the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman, be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n          [From the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman, Mar. 3, 2009]\n\n       Curtis Delbert Menard, 64, died March 3 at Mat-Su Regional \n     Medical Center, from complications of multiple myeloma.\n       A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at \n     Wasilla High School with Pastor Larry Kroon of Wasilla Bible \n     Church officiating. The following are pallbearers: Curtis C. \n     Menard, Larry, Sgt. Maj. Ret. Ritchie, Nancy, Jim, Gabrielle, \n     Tanner, Harrison, Sullivan, Brock, Grant, Jack, Alexandra, \n     Jane and Charles Menard, and Lewis Bradley. Burial will take \n     place later in the spring at the Menard homestead.\n       Dr. Menard was born June 16, 1944, in Detroit. He graduated \n     from L'Anse High School in 1962, received his undergraduate \n     degree at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wis., and \n     graduated from Marquette University School of Dentistry Class \n     of 1968.\n       He had served with Habitat for Humanity, The Alaska \n     Railroad Board, American Legion, Salvation Army Board, and as \n     chairman of the Multi-Use Sports Complex, and was a member of \n     Wasilla Bible Church. He was an honorary member of the \n     Wasilla Rotary Club, was the Wasilla Chamber of Commerce \n     Citizen of the Year, and the Frontiersman Mat-Su Dentist of \n     the year. He enjoyed fishing, hunting, flying, marathons, \n     farming, coaching, politics, and well wishing.\n       His family wrote, ``Curt Menard was raised in L'Anse, \n     Mich., born to June and Curtis Menard. At 15 years old he met \n     the love of his life, Linda. Linda and Curt moved to \n     Milwaukee, to pursue his life-long dream of becoming a \n     dentist. In 1968 he graduated as class president from \n     Marquette University School of Dentistry. He joined the \n     United States Air Force and was stationed at Elmendorf Air \n     Force Base in Anchorage. He worked exclusively with Vietnam \n     soldiers in preparation for the war. During that time he \n     learned to fly and there his love affair with planes \n     commenced. He flew a 206, Supercub, Citabria and a PA 14. In \n     1972 he purchased one of the original homesteads in the Mat-\n     Su Valley and built the first professional building and \n     dental office in Wasilla. He especially loved his dental \n     contract in the village of Togiak. Three years later Curt \n     lost his dominant right arm in an electrical accident. With \n     unsurpassed determination, Curt learned to practice dentistry \n     with his left hand. Sen. Curt Menard's public service began \n     as a school board member. Encouraged by his experience, he \n     ran for office and became a state legislator. By this time, \n     he had two thriving dental offices, Palmer and Wasilla Dental \n     Center, 33 employees, five children, and was a respected \n     community leader and politician. He had a love for farming \n     and not only baled 55 acres of hay every summer, but enjoyed \n     cows, chickens, turkeys, homing pigeons, pigs, horses, a cat \n     and many dogs. In 2001, tragedy again struck the family. \n     Curt's son, Dr. Curtis C. Menard II passed away in a plane \n     crash.\n       ``Curt was diagnosed in 2003 with multiple myeloma, an \n     aggressive and painful cancer of the bone. In 2006, in true \n     Curt fashion, he took on the task of running and being \n     elected Mat-Su Borough Mayor. In 2007 he went through a stem \n     cell transplant at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. In a \n     selfless manner he put his community before himself and \n     carried out his mayoral responsibilities until the very end. \n     And if you met `Doc' today, his hook would not be the first \n     thing you would notice. You'd see the twinkle in his eye, \n     feel his zest for life and compassion for his fellow man, \n     share his love of his countryside and then, maybe, you'd \n     notice the hook. But by then you'd be so hooked on the man, \n     it wouldn't matter.''\n       Survivors are his wife Linda of Wasilla; sons and \n     daughters-in-law, Robert and Gretchen Menard of Milwaukee, \n     Steven Menard of Wasilla, Dr. Dirk and Alicia Menard of \n     Fairbanks; daughter and son-in-law, McKenzy and Jared Boyd of \n     Milwaukee; daughter-in-law, Dr. Carole Menard of Wasilla; \n     grandchildren, Brock, Grant, Jack, Alexandra, Gabrielle, \n     Tanner, Harrison, Sullivan, Jane, and Charles; father, Curtis \n     C.

Mr. President, today I honor the life of a great \nAmerican, John Hope Franklin, who died last week at the age of 94. Dr. \nFranklin was a witness, participant and documentarian of the struggle \nof African Americans for civil rights and the fight to have this \ncountry fulfill its promise to become a more perfect union for all of \nits citizens.\n  Dr. Franklin once said, ``I want to be out there on the firing line, \nhelping, directing or doing something to try to make this a better \nworld, a better place to live.'' In his life, Dr. Franklin did just \nthat through his work with W. E. B. Du Bois, his efforts on Brown v \nBoard of Education with Thurgood Marshall and by marching from Selma to \nMontgomery with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. How wonderful that this \ngreat fighter for civil rights was able to witness the election of \nBarack Obama as President of the United States.\n  As a historian and a teacher, Dr. Franklin enriched this Nation by \neducating us all about race issues. He began his teaching career in \n1936 at Fisk and continued teaching over the next six decades, at \nschools such as Howard University, the University of Chicago, Cambridge \nUniversity in England, Harvard, Cornell, the University of California \nBerkeley, Duke, and other institutions. He had a passion for teaching, \nand I was fortunate enough to sit in on Dr. Franklin's classes at \nBrooklyn College in the 1960s. Having him there was like having a real \nstar in our midst, and students who were lucky enough to get into his \nclass bragged about him from morning until night.\n  Dr. Franklin was the author of nearly 20 books, beginning with ``The \nFree\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nNegro in North Carolina, 1790-1860,'' which explored slaveholders' \nhatred and fear of the quarter-million free blacks in the antebellum \nSouth. His 1947 ``From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-\nAmericans,'' remains a classic and one of the most definitive \nexplorations of the American Black experience. Dr. Franklin once said, \n``One might argue that the historian is the conscience of the nation, \nif honesty and consistency are factors that nurture the conscience.'' \nWhile many of these studies may have been of the past, they inevitably \nshed light on the struggles we continue to face as a nation.\n  Dr. Franklin led a life of firsts, and President Clinton awarded him \nthe Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, in 1995 for \nhis life's work. Today, I honor his life and ask that all Americans \njoin me in remembering this truly great visionary who never stopped \nworking for change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4059-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4059-S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN ARKANSAS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 1, 2009, four \nArkansas universities--Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas \nTech University in Russellville, Southern Arkansas University in \nMagnolia, and the University of Arkansas at Monticello--will celebrate \n100 years of commitment to higher education. On their centennial \nanniversary, I want to recognize the enormous contributions these \ninstitutions have made to Arkansas and our Nation.\n  In 1909, during the 37th session of the Arkansas General Assembly, \nRepresentative J.J. Bellamy of Lawrence County introduced Act 100, a \nbill to create four agricultural schools in Arkansas, one for each \nquadrant. The locations of the schools were to be chosen based upon \n``the nature of the soil, healthfulness of location, general \ndesirability, and other material inducements offered, such as the \ndonation of buildings, land or money.'' The legislation was signed on \nApril 1, 1909, by Governor George Donaghey.\n  The four agriculture schools were to teach agriculture, horticulture, \nand textile making. Although they were secondary schools in their early \ndays, these schools added additional curriculum to better serve their \ncommunities and soon were offering junior college classes. In 1925, the \nstate legislature changed the names of the schools to better reflect \ntheir new role and the unique status of each school.\n  The former First District Agricultural School is known today as \nArkansas State University. A farm just east of Jonesboro was selected \nas the location for the school. With enrollment down due to World War \nI, the school obtained a Student Army Training Corps--SATC--on its \ncampus. Since only junior colleges could participate in the SATC \nprogram, the school added faculty and improved its curriculum. It soon \nbecame known as the First District Agriculture and Mechanical College; \nthe school received accreditation as a 2-year junior college and \nconditional status as a 4-year institution in 1925.\n  In 1931, the A College awarded its first baccalaureate degree, and \nin 1933, the legislature once again changed the name to Arkansas State \nCollege--ASC. In fact, Arkansas's first female U.S. Senator, Hattie \nCaraway, was awarded the school's first honorary doctorate in \nrecognition of her support. The university continued to grow over the \ndecades, and on January 17, 1967, Arkansas Governor Winthrop \nRockefeller signed legislation that gave the school its present-day \nname, Arkansas State University--ASU.\n  Today, the ASU system serves approximately 18,900 students and \nincludes campuses at Beebe, Mountain Home, and Newport. It also \nincludes degree centers in Heber Springs and Searcy as part of ASU-\nBeebe; a technical center in Marked Tree; and instructional sites in \nParagould and at Little Rock Air Force Base.\n  On the occasion of the centennial, ASU Chancellor, Robert L. Potts, \noffered the following thoughts:\n\n       From our origins as an agricultural school serving the \n     First District, we have matured into a comprehensive \n     university offering 42 degrees through the doctoral level in \n     170 fields of study and ten colleges. Since 1909, we have \n     prepared our students to meet the challenges of their lives \n     by Powering Minds--providing a university experience that \n     educates, enhances, and enriches. We look forward to this \n     Centennial Celebration as a time to focus on our heritage and \n     build upon our successes.\n\n  The former Second District Agricultural School is presently called \nArkansas Tech University. The location of Russellville was chosen \nbecause the town agreed to pledge a minimum of $40,000 and a site of \nnot less than 200 acres. In addition, it offered free electricity and \nwater for three years. In 1925, the state legislature changed the \nschool's name to Arkansas Polytechnic College to accurately reflect its \nmove away from an agriculture curriculum to teacher training and the \nliberal fine arts.\n  The school was officially accredited as a junior college in 1929 and \nremained a 2-year college until 1951. The school continued to grow and \nin 1976, it officially became Arkansas Tech University. It awarded its \nfirst graduate degrees 1 year later. Today, Arkansas Tech includes \napproximately 7,480 students at its Russellville and Ozark campuses.\n  After 100 years, Arkansas Tech Chancellor, Robert C. Brown, noted:\n\n       For the last one hundred years, Arkansas Tech University \n     has educated students and prepared them for a successful \n     future. Today, we are uniquely positioned to continue \n     preparing our students for what lies ahead. Because of our \n     commitment to educational excellence and our emphasis on \n     teaching and learning, we are producing what the state and \n     region need the most--college students ready to shape the \n     future for the next one hundred years.\n\n  The Third District Agricultural School is now known as Southern \nArkansas University. Local farmers in Columbia County ensured that \nMagnolia was chosen as the site for the school. It became officially \nknown as Magnolia A in 1925 and was fully accredited in 1929 with an \nemphasis on agriculture and home economics.\n  In 1950, it became a 4-year institution and was renamed Southern \nState College--SSC--the following year. For 25 years, the school's \nenrollment and size increased, and in 1976 it was approved for \nuniversity status. Renamed Southern Arkansas University, it is now a \nmulticampus system with more than 5,000 students and locations in El \nDorado and Camden.\n  For the 100-year celebration, Southern Arkansas University Chancellor \nF. David Rankin had this to say:\n\n       As the former Third District Agricultural School, Magnolia \n     A, and Southern State College, Southern Arkansas University \n     has served its region with a Tradition of Success since 1909. \n     Although our name has changed, our commitment to higher \n     education has not. SAU has roots that run deep in \n     agriculture, but it has grown into a regional, comprehensive, \n     four-year institution with a broad curriculum and a quickly \n     expanding graduate school. As we begin our second century of \n     service, we invite you to be a part of history as we pay \n     tribute to our own.\n\n  The final school created by Act 100 was the Fourth District \nAgricultural School. Monticello was chosen as the site thanks to the \ndonation of land by the William Turner Wells estate. A former \nplantation, it included 900 fruit trees, a house, and a pond. In 1923, \njunior college classes were added. It formally changed its name, as the \nother schools did, in 1925 and became known as the Fourth District \nAgricultural and Mechanical College. By 1928, it was fully accredited \nand became a 4-year institution in 1933.\n  In 1935, the school began unofficially calling itself Arkansas \nAgricultural & Mechanical College. It remained Arkansas A until 1971 \nwhen Governor Dale Bumpers signed legislation merging the school with \nthe University of Arkansas. On July 19, 1971, the University of \nArkansas at Monticello--UAM was established. Although it is the \nsmallest school in the University of Arkansas system at nearly 3,000 \nstudents, the Monticello campus owns the most land of any UA school \nwith 1,036 acres devoted to forestry research and instruction and 300 \nacres for agricultural teaching and research. In 2003, UAM added \ncampuses and now includes the College of Technology at McGehee and the \nCollege of Technology at Crossett.\n  University of Arkansas at Monticello Chancellor, H. Jack Lassiter, \nsaid the following for the centennial celebration:\n\n       As we approach our 100th Anniversary, we are constantly \n     reminded that we have always represented opportunity to \n     generations of people seeking a higher education and a better \n     life. That message resonates as clearly today as it did in \n     1909. Many of our students are the first in their families to \n     attend college. Others are non-traditional students\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\n     who have decided to take advantage of the opportunity to \n     change careers or complete a dream that began years ago. The \n     university is constantly exploring and developing new \n     opportunities to help students open doors to a better life. \n     UAM is truly celebrating a century of opportunity.\n\n  Mr. President, what wonderful gifts to the people of Arkansas that \nour legislators bestowed upon us a century ago. As each university \ncelebrates this year, I want to add my voice to the chorus of Arkansans \nwho celebrate this milestone. We have so much of which to be proud. As \nwe move forward in the 21st century, I know that these four \ninstitutions will continue to stand ready to prepare our citizens to \ncompete in the global marketplace for the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4060-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4060-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4060-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 20.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom an employee's gross income any employer-provided supplemental \ninstructional services assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce legislation to \nincrease access for our Nation's children to affordable, quality \ntutoring. The Affordable\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nTutoring for Our Children Act would enable middle-class families to \npurchase supplemental instructional services on a pre-tax basis, \nensuring greater utilization of critical educational tools. I would \nlike to thank my good friend, Senator Nelson of Florida, for \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  A sound education for every American child is fundamental to the \nwell-being and prosperity of our society, both now and in the future. \nYet, as we are all acutely aware, not every child learns at the same \npace, nor in the same manner, and some face unique challenges that \ncannot be overcome simply in a typical classroom setting. Many children \nrequire--and greatly benefit from--additional help in academics. \nRegrettably, our Nation's middle-class families are increasingly unable \nto afford this essential ancillary support for their children. Indeed, \naccording to education market research company Eduventure, the average \namount spent annually by a family on private tutoring for a student is \n$1,110.\n  Unfortunately, given the considerable and ever-increasing financial \nstrains facing middle-class families, with more and more income going \nto pay for gasoline, health care, groceries, and a multitude of other \nexpenses, tutoring is often out of reach. In fact, according to a 2007 \nreport from Demos and the Institute on Assets & Social Policy at \nBrandeis University, more than half of middle-class families have no \nfinancial assets, or worse, their debts exceeds their assets.\n  At present, employees may set aside a portion of their earnings to \nestablish a flexible spending account, or FSA, allowing them to pay for \nqualified medical or dependent care expenses free from income and \npayroll taxes. Our legislation would permit employees to use their \ndependent care FSAs to cover supplemental instructional expenses, \nthereby saving themselves up to 40 percent of their cost. Critically, \nthis bill is targeted to middle-class families, those who most \nnecessitate our assistance. Indeed, only those employees making \n$110,000 or less per year would be able to exclude amounts paid for \nthese services from their taxable income. Additionally, supplemental \ninstructional expenses would be subject to a combined $5,000 cap with \nother dependent care expenses.\n  This bill would help more middle-class children to receive extra \nassistance for a host of subjects ranging from English and mathematics \nto science, government, and foreign languages. At a time when graduates \nwho attain a bachelor's degree earn roughly 96 percent more than high \nschool graduates, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it is \nvital that our Nation's children get the help they need to succeed.\n  With middle-class families feeling the squeeze from every angle, our \nlegislation would provide essential relief for those parents seeking to \nensure that their children have the best educational experience \npossible. I urge my colleagues to consider the dramatic advantage our \nchildren will gain from this crucial bill, and look forward to its \npassage in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the Magna Water District water reuse and groundwater \nrecharge project, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding a troubling \nsituation facing Magna Water District in Utah. Magna's drinking water \nis threatened by contamination from an underground plume of perchlorate \nwhich is heading towards its wells. The perchlorate is the result of \ndecades of rocket motor production at a Department of Defense site \ncurrently operated by Hercules, ATK Launch Systems. In order to address \nthe threat to its water system, the district plans to implement a \nunique water reuse and groundwater recharge project that would serve to \ndemonstrate a bio-destruction process combining wastewater with a \ndesalination brine stream to destroy the perchlorate. This new \ntechnology would give water districts throughout the country a more \neffective and more economical method of mitigating perchlorate \ncontamination.\n  The district has already invested a significant amount of its own \nfunds toward the effort, and it is now seeking a 25 percent match from \nthe Federal Government. This funding would preserve the district's \ncrucial water resources while finding an efficient and beneficial use \nof treated industrial and domestic wastewater. In addition, this \nfunding is vital in order to provide our Nation with a better way to \ndestroy harmful perchlorate plumes that may threaten community water \nsupplies.\n  As you know, our Nation's clean water supply is a precious asset to \nour country. In desert places like Utah, the need for the best use of \nour available water is critical to preserving the limited amounts of \nclean water available\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\nto us. This water reuse and groundwater recharge technology is crucial \nto ensure clean drinking water for the citizens of Magna. Not only \nwould this funding benefit the Magna district, but it would provide our \nNation with an inexpensive and powerful new tool to clean up \ncontaminated water. This is an investment in our Nation that will be \npaid back many times over.\n  I urge my colleagues to lend their support to this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 748. A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 2777 Logan Avenue in San Diego, California, \nas the ``Cesar E. Chavez Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I join Representative Susan Davis in \ncommemorating Cesar E. Chavez's 82nd birthday by introducing \nlegislation to name a post office in San Diego, CA, after this \nextraordinary civil rights activist and union leader.\n  Today we join millions of people across this Nation in honoring Cesar \nChavez's legacy as an educator, environmentalist, and a civil rights \nleader who was committed to providing fair wages, better working \nconditions, decent housing, and quality education for all. As an \nactivist, Chavez worked to give a voice to the voiceless, and inspire \nmillions of Americans to stand up and say, ``Si, Se Puede!''\n  As a migrant farm worker in his youth, Cesar E. Chavez learned about \nthe struggles of farm workers including poor wages, poor medical \ncoverage, and poor working conditions. When he returned from serving \nhis country in the Navy during World War II, Chavez began to work to \nimprove this situation, first by organizing for the Community Service \nOrganization coordinating voter-registration drives and battling racial \nand economic discrimination.\n  In 1962 Cesar Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, \nlater to become the United Farm Workers, the largest farm workers union \nin the country. Using nonviolent tactics, such as boycotts, pickets, \nand strikes, Chavez raised awareness about the plight of farm workers. \nCesar Chavez's unflagging determination made great strides in \nchampioning the rights of farm workers, but the struggle for farm \nworkers continues. This year, thousands of workers across California \nare preparing to march, and continue the fight for their rights.\n  Cesar Chavez's life and legacy should serve not only as an example \nbut an inspiration to us all as we work to address the growing \ninequality in our nation, as well as the challenges faced by America's \nworking families, including poverty, health care, and education.\n  Fifteen years ago, President Clinton awarded Cesar Chavez the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, in recognition of his great \ncontributions to our Nation. Today we remember his work not only for \nthe U.S., but also for the communities and people of the State of \nCalifornia.\n  San Diego is a city with a rich cultural heritage, and a history of \ncommunity organizing and activism that shares its roots with Cesar \nChavez's lifelong struggle for justice and equality. Cesar Chavez \naccomplished a great deal to improve living and working conditions for \nall people, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill \nto recognize his work and his memory.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 749. A bill to improve and expand geographic literacy among \nkindergarten through grade 12 students in the United States by \nimproving professional development programs for kindergarten through \ngrade 12 teachers offered through institutions of higher education; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friend \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. The purpose of this bill is to improve \ngeographic literacy among K-12 students in the U.S. by supporting \nprofessional development programs for their teachers that are \nadministered in institutions of higher education and other educational \ninstitutions. This bill also assists States in measuring the impact of \neducation in geography.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, ``To solve most of the \nmajor problems facing our county today--from wiping out terrorism, to \nminimizing global environmental problems, to eliminating the scourge of \nAIDS--will require every young person to learn more about other \nregions, cultures, and languages.'' We need to do more to ensure that \nthe teachers responsible for the education of our students, from \nkindergarten through high school graduation, are prepared and trained \nto teach these critical skills to solve these problems. The Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act has expressly identified geography as a \ncore academic subject. Yet, when we review No Child Left Behind, \ngeography education is the only subject without a dedicated source of \nsupport for educational training and innovation.\n  This bill prepares students to be good citizens of both our nation \nand the world. John Fahey, President of the National Geographic \nSociety, stated that ``geographic illiteracy impacts our economic well-\nbeing, our relationships with other nations and the environment, and \nisolates us from the world.'' When students understand their own \nenvironment, they can better understand the differences in other \nplaces, and the people who live in them. Knowledge of the diverse \ncultures, environments, and the relationships between states and \ncountries helps our students to understand national and international \npolicies, economies, societies, and political structures on a more \nglobal scale.\n  To expect that Americans will be able to work successfully with the \nother people in this world, we need to be able to communicate and \nunderstand each other. We need to prepare our younger generation for \nglobal competition and ensure that they have a strong base of \nunderstanding to be able to succeed in the global marketplace.\n  The 2005 publication, What Works in Geography, reported that \nelementary school geography instruction significantly improves student \nachievement and proved that the integration of geography into the \nelementary school curriculum improves student literacy achievement an \naverage of 5 percent. That is the good news. However, the 2006 National \nGeographic-Roper Global Geographic Literacy Survey shows that 69 \npercent of elementary school principals report a decrease in the time \nspent teaching geography, and less than a quarter of our nation's high \nschool students take a geography course in high school. This survey \nshows that many of our high school graduates lack the basic skills \nneeded to navigate our international economy, policies, and \nrelationships. According to statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis, 30 percent of the annual U.S. GDP, that is 4.3 trillion \ndollars, results from international trade. According to the CIA World \nFactbook of 2005, U.S. workers need geographic knowledge to compete in \nthis global economy. Geographic knowledge is increasingly needed for \nU.S. businesses in international markets to understand such factors as \nphysical distance, time zones, language differences, and cultural \ndiversity among project teams.\n  In addition, geospatial technology is an emerging and innovative \ncareer available to people with strong geography education. \nProfessionals in geospatial technology are employed in Federal \nGovernment agencies, the private sector, and the non-profit sector. \nThese professionals focus on areas such as agriculture, archeology, \necology, land appraisal, and urban planning and development. According \nto the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the information \ngathering necessary to protect critical infrastructure has resulted in \nan enormous increase in the demand for geospatial skills and jobs. A \nstrong geography education system is a necessity for this industry's \ncontinued advancement. The U.S. Department of Labor has identified \ngeospatial technologies as one of the most important high-growth \nindustries, with the market growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. \nThese are high-tech, high-wage jobs in which America can and must \ncompete.\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n  It has been both the private and non-profit sectors working to ensure \nthat the critical skills and knowledge provided by geography education \nare provided to our schools. Over the last 20 years, the National \nGeographic Society has awarded more than $100 million in grants to \neducators, universities, State geographic alliances, and others for the \npurposes of advancing and improving the teaching of geography. Their \nmodels are successful, and research shows that students who have \nbenefitted from this teaching out-perform other students. In all 50 \nStates, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, there are state \ngeographic alliances and partnerships between higher education and K-12 \nschool systems. Thirty States, including Mississippi and the District \nof Columbia, are endowed by grants from the National Geographic \nSociety. But these efforts alone are not enough. The bill I am \nintroducing establishes a Federal commitment to enhance the education \nof our teachers, focuses on geography education research, and develops \nreliable, advanced technology-based classroom resources. A 5 year, \n$15,000,000 grant program would be created under the bill to achieve \nthese objectives.\n  In my State of Mississippi, teachers and university professors are \nmaking progress to increase geography education in the schools through \nadditional professional training. To date, there are 555 members of the \nMississippi Geographic Alliance who teach geography. Last year, the \nMississippi Geographic Alliance conducted a statewide workshop titled \nIntroductory World Geography to help prepare teachers to meet the \nState's new graduation requirement in geography. The Alliance conducted \ntwo, week-long residential summer institutes that provided grade-\nspecific geography content and teaching strategies; provided a field-\nbased local Mississippi geography workshop; and conducted two workshops \nthat introduce pre-service teachers to the scope of modern geography \nand effective geography teaching strategies.\n  I hope the Senate will consider the serious need to invest in \ngeography, and I invite other Senators to cosponsor the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 750. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to attract and \nretain trained health care professionals and direct care workers \ndedicated to providing quality care to the growing population of older \nAmericans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the need for health care reform is \nundeniable and we must undertake comprehensive efforts to provide \nquality care for our Nation's diverse populations, particularly older \nAmericans. Our aging population is expected to almost double in number, \nfrom 37 million people today to about 72 million by 2030. If we fail to \nprepare, our Nation will face a crisis in providing care to these older \nAmericans. We must start now if we are going to adequately train the \nhealth care workforce to meet the needs of an aging America.\n  Health care providers with the necessary training to give older \nAmericans the best care are in critically short supply. In its landmark \nreport, Retooling for an Aging America, the Institute of Medicine \nconcluded that action must be taken immediately to address the severe \nworkforce shortages in the care of older adults.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, only about 7,100 U.S. \nphysicians are certified geriatricians today; 36,000 are needed by \n2030. Just 4 percent of social workers and only 3 percent of advance \npractice nurses specialize in geriatrics. Recruitment and retention of \ndirect care workers is also a looming crisis due to low wages and few \nbenefits, lack of career advancement, and inadequate training.\n  Preparing our workforce for the job of caring for older Americans is \nan essential part of ensuring the future health of our nation. Right \nnow, there is a critical shortage of health care providers with the \nnecessary training and skills to provide our seniors with the best \npossible care. This is a tremendously important issue for American \nfamilies who are concerned about quality of care and quality of life \nfor their older relatives and friends.\n  It is clear that there is a need for federal action to address these \nissues, and that is why Senator Collins and I are introducing the \nCaring for an Aging America Act. This legislation would help attract \nand retain trained health care professionals and direct care workers \ndedicated to providing quality care to the growing population of older \nAmericans by providing them with meaningful loan forgiveness and career \nadvancement opportunities.\n  Specifically, for health professionals who complete specialty \ntraining in geriatrics or gerontology--including physicians, physician \nassistants, advance practice nurses, social workers, pharmacists and \npsychologists--the legislation would link educational loan repayment to \na service commitment to the aging population, modeled after the \nsuccessful National Health Services Corps. The bill would also expand \nloan repayment for registered nurses who complete specialty training in \ngeriatric care and who choose to work in long-term care settings, and \nexpand career advancement opportunities for direct care workers by \noffering specialty training in long-term care services. Lastly, the \nlegislation would establish a health and long-term care workforce \nadvisory panel for an aging America.\n  In addition, I was pleased to work with the Alzheimer's Association \nand the American Geriatrics Society to ensure that this legislation \nwill also help provide a workforce to meet the needs of older Americans \nwith dementia, Alzheimer's and other cognitive disorders.\n  Ensuring we have a well-trained health care workforce with the skills \nto care for our aging population is a critical investment in America's \nfuture. This legislation offers a modest but important step toward \ncreating the future health care workforce that our Nation so urgently \nneeds.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Collins and our colleagues to \nensure that we meet our obligations to the seniors of our Nation to \nimprove their care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 751. A bill to establish a revenue source for fair elections \nfinancing of Senate campaigns by providing an excise tax on amounts \npaid pursuant to contracts with the United States Government; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are facing the worst economic crisis \nsince the great depression. Health care costs are exploding. Our \neducation system is in desperate need of reform. All while we continue \nto fight two wars on the other side of the globe.\n  At a time like this, our Nation's leaders need to be singularly \nfocused on the challenges at hand. Yet as Senators and Congressmen we \nfind ourselves spending more and more of our time raising money for our \nown re-elections. That means we spend less and less time focusing on \nour Nation's policy challenges.\n  In the last three election cycles, Senate candidates spent nearly \n$1.3 billion on their races. This is simply unsustainable.\n  Unless you have enough personal wealth to pay for a campaign by \nyourself, you have little choice but to spend an enormous amount of \nyour time dialing for dollars to keep up with your competitors. If you \ndo not attend the nightly fundraisers and hit the phones during power \nhours, your campaign message will be drowned out by your opponent's \nadvertising by Election Day. You will stand little chance of being \nchosen to continue to work on the challenges you came to Washington to \nsolve.\n  Worse, the system we currently use to finance Federal campaigns makes \ncandidates far too reliant on the ability of wealthy donors to help \nraise the mountains of money necessary to compete.\n  The result is a public who rightly questions whether those that win \nelections in this system are serving ALL of their constituents and not \njust their wealthy donors.\n  We need to finance Federal campaigns differently. There has never \nbeen a more critical time for change.\n  That is why today I am reintroducing the bipartisan Fair Elections \nNow Act with my friend Senator Specter. I am pleased that Congressman \nLarson is introducing the companion legislation\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nin the House with Republican Congressmen Todd Platts of Pennsylvania \nand Walter Jones of North Carolina.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act would help restore public confidence in \nthe Congressional election process by providing qualified candidates \nfor Congress with grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair \nElections Fund to replace campaign fundraising that largely relies on \nlobbyists and other special interests. In return, participating \ncandidates would agree to limit their campaign spending to the amounts \nraised from small-dollar donors plus the amounts provided from the \nFund.\n  Fair Elections for the Senate would have three stages.\n  To participate, candidates would first need to prove their viability \nby raising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying \ncontributions from in-state donors. Once a candidate qualifies, that \ncandidate must limit the amount raised from each donor to $100 per \nelection.\n  For the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would \nvary in amount based on the population of the state that the candidate \nseeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 4-to-1 match for \nsmall-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. The candidate \ncould raise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed to \ncompete against high-spending opponents.\n  For the general election, qualified candidates would receive an \nadditional grant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for \npurchasing television advertising. The candidate could continue to \nraise an unlimited amount of $100 contributions if needed.\n  Under our plan, candidates will no longer be in the fundraising \nbusiness. Instead, candidates will be in the constituent business, \nregardless of whether those constituents have the wealth to attend a \nfundraiser or to donate more than $100 per election. Candidates will be \nin the policy business, regardless of what policies are preferred by \nwealthy donors.\n  This is no naive theory. It is a system that is already at work. Very \nsimilar programs exist in Maine, Arizona, and elsewhere. These programs \nare bringing new faces and ideas into politics and making more races \nmore competitive. Most importantly, candidates spend more time with \nconstituents and in policy debates and less time with wealthy donors.\n  I know that some will say that the answer to this problem of time \nconstraints is simply to remove individual contribution limits, so that \nwith a few phone calls to billionaire donors candidates can raise all \nof the money that they need. I completely disagree. The answer is not \nto further concentrate influence in the hands of a smaller and smaller \ngroup of donors, but rather to remove that source of influence \naltogether. That is the only way to rebuild the trust of the American \npeople.\n  Let me be clear: I honestly believe that the overwhelming majority of \nthe people serving in American politics are good, honest people, and I \nbelieve that Senators and Congressmen are guided by the best of \nintentions. But we are nonetheless stuck in a terrible, corrupting \nsystem. The perception is that politicians are corrupted by the big \nmoney interests . . . and whether that is true or not, that perception \nand the loss of trust that goes with it makes it incredibly difficult \nfor the Senate to take on tough challenges and have the American public \nbelieve that what we are doing is right.\n  I believe that this problem is fundamental to our democracy, and we \nmust address it. Overwhelming numbers of Americans agree. Recent \npolling shows that 69 percent of Democrats, 72 percent Republicans, and \n60 percent of independents supported a general description of this \nproposal. The Fair Elections Now Act is supported by several good \nGovernment groups, former members of Congress, business leaders, and \neven lobbyists.\n  Our Nation's leaders need to be completely focused on getting America \nback on track. The Fair Elections Now Act will help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived \n     conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large \n     campaign contributions from private interests that are \n     directly affected by Federal legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' \n     accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to \n     be accountable to the major contributors who finance their \n     election campaigns;\n       (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal \n     access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to \n     mount competitive Senate election campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive \n     elections, because large campaign contributors tend to donate \n     their money to incumbent Senators, thus causing Senate \n     elections to be less competitive; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that \n     providing the option of the replacement of large private \n     campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair \n     Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections \n     to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--\n       (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest \n     created by fully private financing of the election campaigns \n     of public officials and restoring public confidence in the \n     integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative \n     processes through a program which allows participating \n     candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution \n     limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be \n     sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral \n     campaigns;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to \n     participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that \n     constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and \n     participate in the program;\n       (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign \n     contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence \n     within the political process by facilitating the expression \n     of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging \n     political participation, and incentivizing participation on \n     the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar \n     contributions;\n       (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that \n     may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated \n     based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the \n     influence of campaign contributions;\n       (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run \n     for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;\n       (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by \n     citizens of every level of wealth; and\n       (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to provide for increased Federal oversight of \nmethadone treatment; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenator Corker and Senator Kennedy, to introduce the Methadone \nTreatment and Protection Act, legislation that provides a comprehensive \nsolution to our country's growing problem of methadone-related deaths. \nIn recent years, too many families have come to me with heartbreaking \nstories of mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers who have been \nseriously injured or who have died as a result of methadone. My State \nof West Virginia has been particularly hard-hit by the number of lives \nlost, with just seven methadone-related deaths in 1999 compared to \napproximately 120 deaths in 2005. In the face of such stark realities, \nwe can no longer stand by and remain content with the status quo. Now \nis the time for a comprehensive strategy to address the misuse of \nmethadone and prevent any additional avoidable deaths.\n  Methadone is an FDA approved, synthetic opioid prescription drug that \nhas been extensively tested and used in the U.S. for more than thirty \nyears. While it was first prescribed for pain management, methadone is \nalso widely used as a part of opioid addiction treatment. The high \nefficacy and low cost of methadone has resulted in a significant rise \nin the number of methadone prescriptions, up 700 percent since 1998. \nHowever, there has also been a steep increase in the number of \nmethadone-related deaths. In 2005, there were 4,462 methadone deaths, \nrepresenting a 468 percent increase in the number of deaths since 1999.\n  Currently, oversight of methadone is fragmented between three federal \nagencies: the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the Substances Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, and the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, DEA. Currently, these agencies lack the \nmost effective tools necessary to properly monitor methadone usage and \neffectively prevent methadone-related deaths. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will address this shortcoming in our public health \ninfrastructure by providing the administrative direction, funding, \neducation, and data necessary to effectively monitor for the potential \nmisuse of methadone.\n  The alarming number of accidental methadone-related overdoses \nindicates that both patients and practitioners do not fully understand \nthe complex nature of this medication. Therefore, the Methadone \nTreatment and Protection Act will significantly improve patient and \nprovider information about methadone by mandating the creation of a \nconsumer education campaign and requiring additional training for \npractitioners who prescribe methadone and other opioids.\n  The bill will also improve Federal oversight of methadone by creating \nthe Controlled Substances Clinical Standards Commission--with \nmembership comprised of the FDA, SAMHSA, and the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH. This new Commission will establish safe dosage levels for \nmethadone and other opioids, determine appropriate conversion factors \nwhen transferring a patient from one opioid to another, and create \nspecific guidelines for initiating pain management treatment with \nmethadone. To curtail the problems of doctor shopping and diversion, \nthis legislation also adequately funds the National All Schedules \nPrescription Drug Reporting Act, NASPER. Passed and signed into law in \n2005, NASPER requires providers to submit prescribing information for \nall schedule II, III, and IV drugs to State run controlled substance \nmonitoring programs. NASPER also requires States to share this \ninformation with one another. Funding NASPER will serve as a deterrent \nto those who misuse methadone from crossing State lines in order to \navoid being detected.\n\n  Finally, to improve access to comprehensive data on methadone-related \ndeaths, this legislation mandates the completion of a standard Model \nOpioid Treatment Program Mortality Report, and requires its submission \nto a newly created National Opioid Death Registry. Prior to 1999, \nmethadone did not have separate classification from other opiate-\nrelated deaths. Therefore, a study released by the Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention in 2006 was the first opportunity to examine the \ntrends in methadone exclusively. By creating a National Opioid Death \nRegistry, it will be possible to more carefully track--and hopefully \nprevent--methadone-related deaths.\n  It is my belief that the multi-pronged approach provided in the \nMethadone Treatment and Protection Act will lead to a decrease in the \nnumber of opioid and methadone-related deaths. This legislation will \nimprove the coordination of resources and information at the local, \nState and Federal level to stifle the rising death toll, while at the \nsame time make certain methadone and other opioids remain accessible \nfor those who truly need these medications. In light of the facts and \nthe preventable nature of methadone-related deaths, Congress has a \nresponsibility to the American people to guarantee individuals have \naccess to the treatment they need in a manner that is both safe and \neffective. The time for action is now, and I urge my colleagues to join \nus in support of this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 755. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Cancer Institute to make grants for the \ndiscovery and validation of biomarkers for use in risk stratification \nfor, and the early detection and screening of, ovarian cancer; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we engage in the debate on health care \nreform, it is critical that we address the need to invest in health \nresearch and innovation to spur the development of new treatments and \ncures for diseases. Today, I am proud to introduce two bills, S. 755 \nand S. 756, that would direct Federal investment in new programs that \nwould develop tools to detect ovarian and prostate cancers.\n  We know that early and reliable detection of these cancers can save \nlives. These bills make sure we have the tools we need to catch these \ncancers early, when they can be treated thereby significantly \nincreasing survival rates.\n  First, the Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act provides funding for \nresearch directed toward the development of reliable screening \ntechniques for ovarian cancer--a critical investment in the future of \nany woman who will face ovarian cancer.\n  Though only one in 72 women will face ovarian cancer in their \nlifetime, this disease ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women and \ncauses more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive \nsystem. In the last year alone, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nestimated there were 15,520 deaths from ovarian cancer in the U.S.\n  For many years, ovarian cancer has been called the ``silent killer'' \nbecause too often women are diagnosed with this disease too late to be \nsaved. But when ovan cancer is diagnosed early, more than 93 percent of \nwomen survive longer than 5 years. Because there is currently no \neffective screening test available, 4 out of 5 ovarian cancer cases in \nthe U.S. are diagnosed in the later stages, when a woman's chance of \nsurviving more than 5 years drops to 46 percent.\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\n  The Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act would authorize NCI to make \ngrants for public or nonprofit entities to establish research centers \nfocused on ovarian cancer biomarkers. Biomarkers are biochemical \nfeatures within the body that can be used to measure the progress of a \ndisease and predict the effects of treatment. This legislation also \nauthorizes funding for a national clinical trial that will enroll at-\nrisk women in a study to determine the clinical utility of using these \nvalidated ovarian cancer biomarkers.\n  The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, \nand the American College of Surgeons have all joined together in \nsupport of this research developing tools to detect ovarian cancer \nearly, because they know it is critical to improving the rate of \nsurvival for women struck by this disease.\n  The second bill, the Prostate Imaging, Research and Men's Education \nAct, addresses the urgent need for the development of new technologies \nto detect and diagnose prostate cancer.\n  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S., and the \nsecond leading cause of cancer related deaths in men--striking 1 in \nevery 6 men. In 2008, it was estimated that more than 186,000 men were \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer, and more than 28,000 men died from the \ndisease.\n  The Prostate Research, Imaging, and Men's Education Act, or PRIME \nAct, would mirror the investment the Federal Government made in \nadvanced imaging technologies, which led to life-saving breakthroughs \nin detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. This bill \ndirects the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \nexpand prostate cancer research, and provides the resources to develop \ninnovative advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection, \ndiagnosis, and treatment.\n  In addition, the PRIME Act would create a national campaign to \nincrease awareness about the need for prostate cancer screening, and \nworks with the Offices of Minority Health at HHS and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to ensure that this information reaches \nthe men most at risk from this disease.\n  The PRIME Act will also promote research that improves prostate \ncancer screening blood tests. According to a National Cancer Institute \nstudy, current blood tests result in false-negative reassurances and \nnumerous false-positive alarms. Some 15 percent of men with normal \nblood test levels actually have prostate cancer. Even when levels are \nabnormal, some 88 percent of men end up not having prostate cancer but \nundergo unnecessary biopsies. Furthermore, the prostate is one of the \nlast organs in a human body where biopsies are performed blindly, which \ncan miss cancer even when multiple samples are taken.\n  Government initiatives in research and education can be the key to \ndiagnosing prostate or ovarian cancers earlier and more accurately. \nThese two bills would strengthen our efforts to fight these diseases.\n  These bills are of vital importance to thousands of men and women \nacross our great Nation, and the families and friends who are concerned \nfor their continued health. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate to get these bills passed as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Udall \n        of New Mexico):\n  S. 757. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to expand the category of individuals \neligible for compensation, to improve the procedures for providing \ncompensation, and to improve transparency, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nCharlie Wolf Nuclear Workers Compensation Act. It is a bill designed to \nimprove a program to compensate Americans who are gravely ill because \nthey were exposed to radiation or other toxins while working in our \nCold War-era nuclear weapons complex.\n  This is an issue that is important to many Coloradans because of the \nwork done at Rocky Flats outside of Denver. The compensation program \nhas a number of serious flaws, and I have worked on solutions for \nseveral years now.\n  The bill I am introducing includes a number of provisions that I \nintroduced last session in the House of Representatives with my \nColorado colleague, Representative Ed Perlmutter. This year, I expanded \non those provisions and added others to help these workers finally get \nthe assistance they deserve under this program.\n  We named the bill for Charlie Wolf, who was one of thousands of \nworkers during the Cold War era, who risked their health in order to \nbuild America's nuclear arsenal. And I believe his story illustrates \nwhy we should do better by these workers--and why I have introduced \nthis bill.\n  Charlie worked as an engineer at Rocky Flats--and before that, at the \nSavannah River Site in South Carolina. He--and the thousands of other \nworkers like him--are Cold War veterans. As controversial as their work \noften was, they were also patriotic Americans who did more for our \ncountry than collect a paycheck.\n  They believed that their work was keeping the world safe from the \nSoviet threat--and keeping this country strong. And they were right.\n  But their work was also dangerous. As a result of radiation and \ntoxins he was exposed to on the job, Charlie developed brain cancer a \nlittle over 6 years ago. He was given 6 months to live--but he hung on \nfor 6 years.\n  During all of those 6 years, he and his family fought with the \nFederal government to get the compensation that he was promised--and \nthat he deserved.\n  Charlie's struggles were documented by the Rocky Mountain News in a \nseries of stories called ``Deadly Denial.'' That title, unfortunately, \nhas come to symbolize the troubles with this compensation program.\n  I have heard from many former workers, who--like Charlie and his \nfamily--have been subjected to repeated delays, lost records, complex \nexposure formulas, and other roadblocks.\n  We simply cannot--and should not--subject these workers--patriotic \npeople who put themselves in harm's way to help secure our nation--\nthrough these kinds of obstacles and difficulties.\n  It is shameful and, frankly, enough is enough.\n  This Congress recognized that we should compensate our Cold Warriors \nand certain survivors who put their health and life on the line to \nserve our Nation during the Cold War. We created the EEOICPA program to \ncarry out that compensation.\n  I was among those who strongly supported the EEOICPA provisions that \nwere finally enacted into law in 2000.\n  But the next year brought a new administration that, regrettably, did \nnot advocate for the program as the Clinton administration had.\n  Simply put, the program is not working the way it was intended.\n  As a result, while many people have received benefits under the \nprogram, too many face inexcusable obstacles as they try--often in old \nage or while struggling with the effects of cancer or other serious \nillnesses--to prove they qualify for benefits.\n  More than 9 years after we enacted EEOICPA, workers have died without \nreceiving the health care or compensation they deserve.\n  In fact, a combination of missing records and bureaucratic red tape \nhas prevented many workers from accessing any compensation for their \nserious illnesses.\n  I now look forward to working with the Obama administration to \ncorrect problems with this compensation program.\n  The bill I am introducing this week is part of that ongoing effort.\n  The Charlie Wolf Act is designed to expand the category of \nindividuals eligible for compensation, improve the procedures for \nproviding compensation and transparency, and grant the Office of the \nOmbudsman greater authority to help workers.\n  I would like to explain a couple of the provisions in a little more \ndetail.\n  First, it would revise the part of the EEOICPA law that specifies \nwhich covered workers are part of what is known as a ``special exposure \ncohort'' designation under the law.\n  The revision would extend this ``special exposure cohort'' status to \nDepartment of Energy employees, Department of Energy contractor \nemployees,\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nor atomic weapons employees who worked at a nuclear weapons facility \nprior to January 1, 2006.\n  Being included in a special exposure cohort would help make it easier \nfor workers to establish that their radiation-linked cancer was the \nresult of working at one of these facilities.\n  Second, the bill would change the burden of proving that a radiation-\nlinked cancer was the result of workplace exposure to toxic materials.\n  As the law now stands, before a worker can receive benefits, they \nmust establish that the cancer is as likely as not to have resulted \nfrom on-the-job exposure to radiation.\n  While that sounds like a reasonable requirement, many workers have \nlearned that we have not adequately documented radiation exposures over \nthe years.\n  In fact, there were serious shortcomings in the monitoring of nuclear \nweapons plant workers' radiation exposures and in the necessary \nrecordkeeping. Also, the current administrative process for determining \nlinks between exposure and employment is terribly slow.\n  Many worker exposures were unmonitored or under-monitored over a \nnuclear weapons plant's history. As such, the current law requires \nthese workers to seek ``dose reconstructions''--essentially using some \nextrapolated data modeling to re-create the sorts of exposures \nexperienced.\n  But ``dose reconstructions'' are extremely difficult, slow and \narduous for the worker and the agency. The process drags out, while \nworkers like Charlie suffer and wait for compensation they need--in \nsome cases, to help them pay for cancer treatments or care for other \ndeadly illnesses.\n  This is wrong. We owe these workers better than that.\n  My bill fixes that problem by presuming that a worker with a covered \nradiation-linked cancer is eligible for compensation. And it puts the \nburden of proof on the agency.\n  So, unless the agency can show--by clear and convincing evidence--\nthat their cancer was not caused by exposure while working at a nuclear \nweapons facility, that worker would be eligible for compensation.\n  It may seem like this is asking to prove a negative, but I believe \nthat it requires the federal agency to prove that the cancer may have \nbeen the result of other factors. I think it is more appropriate to \nplace this burden on the federal government--and not the ill worker.\n  Third, the bill expands the list of cancers for which individuals are \neligible to receive compensation. The current law fails to recognize \nsome cancers that could legitimately be caused by exposure to toxic \nmaterials at these sites.\n  The bill also requires the Department of Labor to pay a claimant's \nestate should a claimant die after filing their claim--but before \nreceiving payment and leaving no survivors.\n  Finally, the bill makes a number of other changes that are all \ndesigned to make this process more user-friendly and helpful to \nclaimants.\n  It expands the duties of the Ombudsman's Office, providing greater \ntransparency and communication with claimants, and allowing more time \nto file legal actions should claims be denied.\n  It also allows claimants who were previously denied to re-file their \nclaims.\n  Since early in my tenure in Congress, I have worked to make good on \npromises of a fairer deal for the nuclear-weapons workers who helped \nAmerica win the Cold War.\n  That was why enactment and improvement of the compensation act has \nbeen one of my top priorities. This is an important matter for our \ncountry. It is literally a life-or-death issue for the Coloradans who \nare sick today because of their work at Rocky Flats.\n  The Charlie Wolf Act will not remedy all the shortcomings of the \ncurrent law, but it will make it better.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate, who have \nconstituents who face situations similar to that of Charlie and his \nfamily. I hope for swift action from both Congress and the \nadministration to keep our promises to these workers and their \nfamilies.\n  Charlie Wolf and his family deserve better, as do all of the \nAmericans who have made similar scarifies and been subjected to similar \nstruggles.\n  Charlie's widow, Kathy, told me this week that Charlie carried on his \nfight out of principle because he didn't want other workers to have to \nfight the country they worked so hard to protect.\n  I am proud to continue to work on behalf of Charlie's family and his \nmemory. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor or support this worthwhile \nlegislation and honor our Cold War heroes.\n  I would like to thank Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Senator \nTom Udall of New Mexico for joining me as original cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (referred to in \n     this subsection as the ``Act'') was enacted to ensure \n     fairness and equity for the civilian men and women who, for \n     more than 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to \n     the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the \n     Department of Energy (including predecessor agencies of the \n     Department of Energy) by establishing a program to provide \n     efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for--\n       (A) beryllium-related health conditions; and\n       (B) heavy metal-, toxic chemical-, and radiation-related \n     health conditions;\n       (2) the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) provides a process for \n     the consideration of claims for compensation by individuals \n     who were employed at relevant times and at various locations, \n     which includes provisions to designate employees at certain \n     other locations as members of a special exposure cohort the \n     claims of whom are subject to a less-detailed administrative \n     process;\n       (3) the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) authorizes the \n     President, upon a recommendation by the Advisory Board on \n     Radiation and Worker Health established under section \n     3624(a)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384o(a)(1)), to designate \n     additional classes of employees at facilities under the \n     jurisdiction of the Department of Energy as members of a \n     special exposure cohort if the President determines that--\n       (A) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy \n     the magnitude of the radiation dose that the cohort received; \n     and\n       (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the radiation \n     dose may have endangered the health of members of the cohort;\n       (4) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy \n     the magnitude of radiation doses received by employees at \n     facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy \n     because--\n       (A) many radiation exposures by employees were unmonitored \n     or were not monitored adequately over the lifetime of each \n     facility, as demonstrated in 2004, when an individual \n     employed during the 1950's agreed to be scanned under the \n     former radiation worker program of the Department of Energy \n     and was found to have a significant internal deposition of \n     radiation that had been undetected and unrecorded for longer \n     than 50 years;\n       (B) lung counters used for the detection and measurement of \n     plutonium and americium in the lungs of the employees were \n     not available at some facilities until the late 1960's, \n     thus--\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\n       (i) preventing the very insoluble oxide forms of plutonium \n     from being detected; and\n       (ii) leading to a result in which a large number of \n     employees experienced inhalation exposures that went \n     undetected and unmeasured;\n       (C) exposure to neutron radiation was not monitored at some \n     facilities until the late 1950's, and most of the \n     measurements taken at the facilities from the period \n     beginning in the late 1950's and ending in 1970 have been \n     found to be in error;\n       (D) in some areas of the facilities, neutron doses were 2 \n     to 10 times as great as the gamma doses received by \n     employees, although only gamma doses were recorded;\n       (E) the radiation exposures of many employees at certain \n     facilities were not measured, and in some cases estimated \n     doses were assigned, while some records for doses have been \n     destroyed or lost;\n       (F) as a result of the practices described in subparagraph \n     (E), the available exposure histories and other data are not \n     adequate to properly determine whether employees qualify for \n     compensation under the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.); and\n       (G) the model that has been used for dose reconstruction by \n     the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in \n     determining whether certain workers qualify for compensation \n     under the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) contains errors \n     because--\n       (i) the default values used for particle size and \n     solubility of internally deposited plutonium in employees are \n     in error; and\n       (ii) the use of those erroneous default values to calculate \n     internal doses for claimants can result in dose calculations \n     that may be 3 to 10 times below the calculations as indicated \n     by the example of the records and autopsy data of the Rocky \n     Flats Environmental Technology Site of the Department of \n     Energy;\n       (5) the administrative costs arising from claims have been \n     disproportionately high relative to the number of claims that \n     have been approved;\n       (6) many employees, despite working with tons of plutonium \n     and having known exposures that have lead to serious health \n     effects, have been denied compensation under the Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) as a result of--\n       (A) potentially flawed calculations based on records that \n     are incomplete or in error; and\n       (B) the use of incorrect models;\n       (7) the purposes of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) are \n     more likely to be achieved if claims by the employees \n     described in this subsection are subject to administrative \n     procedures applicable to members of the special exposure \n     cohort;\n       (8) Charlie Wolf, an employee at the nuclear weapons \n     facilities of the Savannah River Site, the Fernald Site, and \n     the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site of the \n     Department of Energy, died in 2009 from complications due to \n     glioblastoma multiform brain tumors;\n       (9) the difficulties of Mr. Wolf in securing compensation \n     for the illness that he likely incurred from exposures to \n     toxic and radioactive materials at the nuclear weapons \n     facilities described in paragraph (8) reinforce the need to \n     ensure that the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) will be carried \n     out more efficiently and humanely for employees similar to \n     Mr. Wolf;\n       (10) Mr. Wolf's first tumor was discovered after he had \n     worked for several years at the Rocky Flats Environmental \n     Technology Site of the Department of Energy, during which he \n     served as the director of buildings numbered 771 (which was \n     once considered the most dangerous nuclear facility in the \n     United States), 774, and 779, 3 facilities at which toxic and \n     radioactive materials were present and handled by employees;\n       (11) prior to working at the Rocky Flats Environmental \n     Technology Site of the Department of Energy, Mr. Wolf ran \n     plutonium metal production lines at the Savannah River Site \n     of the Department of Energy;\n       (12) Mr. Wolf and his family spent almost 7 years of their \n     lives seeking compensation under the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et \n     seq.) although, due to the requirements of the Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7384 et seq.) and the manner by which the regulations and \n     procedures were carried out, the claims of Mr. Wolf were \n     subjected to lengthy and repeated delays and complications \n     that resulted from the difficulties associated with \n     establishing the reconstruction of radiation doses;\n       (13) as a result of the experiences of Mr. Wolf, and many \n     others like him, there is a need to reform the Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7384 et seq.), and the program carried out in accordance with \n     the Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.), to improve the processing \n     of claims; and\n       (14) the reforms established through the amendments made by \n     this Act broaden the list of specified cancers, broaden the \n     membership of the special exposure cohort, and change the \n     presumption of cancer due to work-related exposures to help \n     streamline the claims process and help workers like Mr. Wolf \n     and their survivors.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the \n     Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \n     Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) to improve the \n     processing of claims for work-related illnesses at facilities \n     under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The bonuses were paid less than 2 \n     weeks after AIG reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth \n     quarter, the largest in United States corporate history.\n       (2) The $165 million of bonuses paid to AIG employees is \n     dwarfed by the billions of dollars of bonuses paid out to \n     Federal contractors and senior government officials \n     responsible for projects and programs that were over budget \n     or failed to meet basic performance requirements.\n       (3) The Department of Defense paid $8 billion in \n     unwarranted bonuses to contractors for weapons programs that \n     had severe cost overruns, performance problems, and delays \n     between 1999 and 2004.\n       (4) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays \n     more than $312 million per year in quality-of-care bonuses to \n     nursing homes that provide below average care and have past \n     violations of health-and-safety regulations.\n       (5) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) paid Boeing a bonus of $425.3 million for work on the \n     space station that ran 8 years late and cost more than twice \n     what was expected. Boeing estimates that it will incur an \n     additional $76 million in overruns by the time the contract \n     is completed.\n       (6) NASA paid Raytheon a $103.2 million bonus for the Earth \n     Observing System Data and Information System despite the \n     project costing $430 million more and taking 2 years longer \n     to complete than expected.\n       (7) Lockheed collected a $17 million bonus from NASA for \n     the Landsat-7 satellite even though the project was delayed 9 \n     months even and the costs rose 20 percent to $409.6 million.\n       (8) The Department of Commerce selected Northrop Grumman in \n     2002 to build a $6.5 billion satellite system that would \n     conduct both weather surveillance and military reconnaissance \n     that was supposed to save the Federal Government $1.6 \n     billion. The first launch was scheduled for 2008 but hasn't \n     happened, the project's budget has doubled to $13.1 billion, \n     and Northrop's performance has been deemed unsatisfactory. \n     Yet, from 2002 to 2005, the Federal Government awarded \n     Northrop $123 million worth of bonuses.\n       (9) In 2007, Harris Corp. developed a handheld device to \n     collect data for the 2010 Census that failed to work properly \n     and was $198 million over budget. Despite this costly failure \n     that could cause delays in preparing for the nationwide head \n     count, the Department of Commerce's Census Bureau awarded \n     Harris $14.2 million in bonuses.\n       (10) The Federal National Mortgage Association, a \n     government sponsored mortgage enterprise better known as \n     Fannie Mae, suffered $59 billion in losses last year and has \n     requested $15 billion in taxpayer assistance. Yet it plans to \n     pay $4.4 million or more in bonuses to its top executives. \n     Fannie Mae's Chief Operating Officer is expected to receive a \n     $1.3 million bonus, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer is \n     slated for $1.1 million, and 2 executive vice presidents are \n     each in line for $1 million each.\n       (11) In 2006, more than $3.8 million in bonuses were paid \n     out to senior officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     months after a $1 billion budget shortfall threatened to \n     imperil the care of thousands of injured veterans returning \n     from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among those receiving \n     bonuses were some who crafted the VA's flawed budget that was \n     based on misleading accounting and the Deputy Undersecretary \n     for Benefits, who helped manage a disability claims system \n     that had a backlog of cases and delays averaging 177 days in \n     getting benefits to injured veterans. The bonuses were \n     awarded after Federal Government investigators had determined \n     the VA repeatedly miscalculated, if not deliberately misled, \n     taxpayers with questionable budgeting.\n       (12) In 2006, the Department of Treasury abandoned a $14.7 \n     million computer project intended to help detect terrorist \n     money laundering. The failed project was 65 percent over its \n     original budget, but the vendor, Electronic Data Systems \n     Corp., was awarded a $638,126 bonus.\n       (13) The repair and restart a Tennessee Valley Authority \n     (TVA) nuclear reactor cost $90 million more than what the \n     Federal utility budgeted, but TVA paid the primary \n     contractors on the project, Bechtel Power Corp. and Stone and \n     Webster Construction Inc., an extra $42 million in bonuses \n     and other fees last year.\n       (14) In 2008, the San Diego Unified school district spent \n     more than $3 million in Federal funding for low-income \n     students, child nutrition, and other Department of Education \n     programs on bonuses for employees leaving the school \n     district.\n       (15) In 2008, the Department of Education paid nearly $1.7 \n     million in bonuses to Denver Public Schools principals and \n     assistant principals, including those at some of the lowest-\n     performing schools in the city and 6 schools that have been \n     closed because of poor performance.\n       (16) The United States Postal Service is expecting a \n     deficit of $6 billion in 2009, following deficits of $2.8 \n     billion in 2008 and $5.1 billion in 2007 and, as a result, \n     may increase the price of first-class mail stamps by 2 cents \n     and end mail delivery 1 day a week. The Postmaster General, \n     however, was paid a $135,000 bonus in 2008.\n       (17) In 2008, 3 top executives in the Office of the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Defense each received \n     a cash bonus of $30,000 for outstanding leadership even \n     though their agency has a history of weak management and \n     strained relations between employees and supervisors.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should enact legislation that \n     would save the taxpayers billions of dollars every year by--\n       (1) ensuring that all new contracts using award fees and \n     bonuses link such fees and bonuses to acquisition outcomes, \n     which should be defined in terms of program cost, schedule, \n     performance, and outcome;\n       (2) ensuring that no award fee or bonus is paid for \n     contractor performance that is judged to be below \n     satisfactory performance or performance that does not meet \n     the basic requirements of the contract or significantly \n     exceeds the original cost estimate;\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\n       (3) providing that all award fees and bonuses are posted on \n     a public website which would include an itemized, searchable \n     databases of such award fees and bonuses, the amount of each, \n     to whom the award fees and bonuses were paid, the reasons for \n     the awards, and the name of the Department and agency that \n     paid each such award;\n       (4) prohibiting bonuses from being paid to agency and \n     department managers and grant recipients overseeing a program \n     with performance or over budget costs; and\n       (5) directing the bipartisan congressional sunset \n     commission established via a deficit-neutral reserve fund \n     under section 212 of the fiscal year 2010 concurrent budget \n     resolution to examine the number and total cost of \n     unwarranted bonuses and award fees paid to contractors and \n     Federal Government executives as part of the panel's review \n     of nonperforming government programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 780. Mr. COBURN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 13, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2010, revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2009, \nand setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2011 through 2014; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PERFORMANCE MEASURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The fiscal year 2010 budget funds all Federal \n     Government functions, including every program administered by \n     each Federal department or agency across the country.\n       (2) The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance lists over \n     1,800 Federal Government subsidy programs across 63 \n     departments and agencies.\n       (3) The number of Federal Government subsidy programs has \n     grown by 54 percent since 1990.\n       (4) President Barack Obama stated, ``The Federal Government \n     has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should \n     perform its functions efficiently and effectively while \n     ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the \n     taxpayers.''.\n       (5) President Barack Obama has proposed opening up the \n     insular performance measurement process to the public, \n     Congress, and outside experts.\n       (6) President Barack Obama has proposed creating the \n     position of Chief Performance Officer to improve results and \n     outcomes for Federal Government programs while eliminating \n     waste and inefficiency.\n       (7) President Barack Obama has proposed working with \n     Congress to address Federal Government efficiency by creating \n     performance teams to reform programs, replacing existing \n     management at Federal agencies, demanding improvement action \n     plans, and cutting program budgets or eliminating programs \n     entirely.\n       (8) In national polls, less than \\1/3\\, or only 27 percent, \n     of Americans gave a positive rating of the performance of \n     Federal departments and agencies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) research-based, quantifiable performance measures are \n     necessary to evaluate program effectiveness;\n       (2) each Federal department and agency should develop \n     performance measures for all programs receiving Federal \n     assistance under its jurisdiction; and\n       (3) the performance measures developed under paragraph (2) \n     should--\n       (A) to the maximum extent practicable, draw on research-\n     based, quantitative data;\n       (B) take into account program purpose and program design;\n       (C) include criteria to evaluate the cost effectiveness of \n     programs;\n       (D) include criteria to evaluate the administration and \n     management of programs; and\n       (E) include criteria to evaluate oversight and \n     accountability of recipients of assistance under such \n     programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 781. Mr. COBURN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 13, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2010, revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2009, \nand setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2011 through 2014; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPETITIVE BIDDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Last year, then-candidate Barack Obama stated that \n     ``for too long, Washington politicians have wasted billions \n     on no-bid contracts'' and promised to ``end abusive no-bid \n     contracts.'' As part of his ``Blueprint for Change,'' \n     candidate Obama pledged to ``ensure that Federal contracts \n     over $25,000 are competitively bid''.\n       (2) According to the most recent figures compiled by the \n     Federal Government, Federal agencies annually award over \n     $1,000,000,000,000 in financial assistance alone, with \n     $496,000,000,000 in grants awarded in fiscal year 2008 and \n     $518,000,000,000 in contracts and $29,000,000,000 in direct \n     loans awarded in fiscal year 2007.\n       (3) A non-competitive grant or contract is Federal funding \n     that is provided directly to an entity, bypassing the \n     standard process for awarding Federal funding in which \n     competing bids are solicited in order to select the most \n     cost-efficient and qualified entity to perform a service.\n       (4) The volume of non-competitive contracts awarded using \n     Federal funds has risen from $49,000,000,000 in 2000 to \n     $134,000,000,000 in 2008, an increase of 176 percent.\n       (5) The Senate voted 97 to zero in support of competitive \n     bidding for contracts and grants in a Senate-passed amendment \n     to H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n     (Public Law 111-5).\n       (6) The competitive process helps ensure that the Federal \n     Government receives the highest-quality products for the \n     least amount of money.\n       (7) This resolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund \n     for Defense acquisition and contracting reform and a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund for a comprehensive investigation into \n     the current financial crisis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that all Senators support President Obama's pledge to end \n     abusive no-bid contracts by requiring all Federal contracts \n     to be competitively bid.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 782.

SENSE OF THE SENATE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF THE \n                   FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on January 28, 2009, Doug Elmendorf, the Director of \n     the Congressional Budget Office, provided testimony to the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate, that the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Board'') has committed nearly \n     $2,300,000,000,000, more than 3 times the cost of the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program, to programs it created to deal \n     with the financial crisis, with the potential for such \n     taxpayer assistance to grow to at least $4,500,000,000,000;\n       (2) on March 7, 2009, Bloomberg News reported that \n     ``Government loans, spending or guarantees to rescue the \n     country's financial system total more than $11.7 trillion \n     since the international credit crisis began in August \n     2007.'';\n       (3) unlike the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the American \n     public does not know the names of the recipients of more than \n     $2,200,000,000,000 in taxpayer assistance provided by the \n     Board since the beginning of the current United States \n     financial crisis;\n       (4) while Congress has spent numerous hours of debate on \n     the merits of Federal investments totaling less than \n     $1,000,000,000, not one significant debate has been held on \n     the floor of the Senate or the House of Representatives in \n     Congress on whether the Board should be exposing American \n     taxpayers to more than $2,200,000,000,000 in risk;\n       (5) on March 3, 2009, Chairman of the Board, Ben Bernanke, \n     told the Committee on the Budget of the Senate that since the \n     start of the financial crisis, the Board had provided \n     assistance to ``hundreds and hundreds of banks,'' but would \n     not name the banks, how much assistance they have received, \n     what they are doing with the taxpayer assistance, or what the \n     specific terms of the assistance were;\n       (6) the American people have a right to know to whom the \n     Board is lending over $2,200,000,000,000 taxpayer dollars, \n     how much they are receiving, and what the Board is asking in \n     return for such money;\n       (7) since the creation of the Federal Reserve System in \n     1913, there has not been a single, comprehensive independent \n     audit of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve \n     banks; and\n       (8) during the worst financial crisis in our nation's \n     history since the Great Depression, a crisis which has led to \n     the largest taxpayer bailout ever, the Board has a \n     responsibility to the American people to explain what they \n     are doing with their hard-earned taxpayer dollars.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Comptroller General of the United States should be \n     provided with the resources and authority necessary to \n     conduct a comprehensive audit of the Board and the Federal \n     reserve banks; and\n       (2) the Board should publish on its website, with respect \n     to all lending and financial assistance facilities it has \n     created to address the financial crisis since March 24, \n     2008--\n       (A) the identity of each business, individual, or entity to \n     which the Board has provided such assistance;\n       (B) the type of financial assistance provided to that \n     business, individual, or entity;\n       (C) the value or amount of that financial assistance;\n       (D) the date on which the financial assistance was \n     provided;\n       (E) the specific terms of any repayment expected, including \n     the repayment time period, interest charges, collateral, \n     limitations on executive compensation or dividends, and other \n     material terms;\n       (F) the specific rationale for providing assistance in each \n     instance; and\n       (G) what that business, individual, or entity is doing with \n     such financial assistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 801.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 94, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 94) designating April 2009 as \n     ``Financial Literacy Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of a resolution to \ndesignate April as Financial Literacy Month. First, I would like to \nthank my cosponsors, Senators Dodd, Crapo, Kennedy, Enzi, Hagan, \nCorker, Levin, Wicker, Schumer, Inouye, Menendez, Durbin, Stabenow, \nJohnson, Cardin, Carper, Lincoln, Murray, and Gillibrand. As in past \nyears, I am once again pleased to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to promote financial literacy for people of all ages \nacross America.\n  This resolution highlights the need to promote financial literacy in \nour homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. Education in personal \nfinance means empowerment, because it can provide people with the tools \nthey need for sound decision-making and future economic opportunities. \nUnfortunately, many individuals do not understand even the basics of \nour increasingly complex economic system. Although much continues to be \ndone to provide Americans with an education in personal finance and \neconomics, a number of troubling indicators show that many people are \nnot equipped to negotiate financial choices.\n  For instance, according to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal \nFinancial Literacy, many students who graduate from high school lack \nbasic skills in the management of personal finances such as the ability \nto effectively balance their checking account. The average score of \nhigh school students in the Department of the Treasury sponsored 2008 \nNational Financial Literacy Challenge was a 56 percent--an ``F.'' While \nsome States have begun to recognize the need for economic or personal \nfinance in their curriculum, according to a 2007 ``Survey of the \nStates'' compiled by the Council for Economic Education only 22 States \nrequire an economics test as a high school graduation requirement. We \nmust do more to invest in financial literacy now for our young men and \nwomen in order to ensure a knowledgeable, prosperous generation of \nfuture American leaders.\n  On the other end of the spectrum, the 2008 Retirement Confidence \nSurvey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that \nthe percentage of workers who were ``very confident'' about having \nenough money for a comfortable retirement decreased sharply, from 27 \npercent in 2007 to 18 percent in 2008. This is the biggest 1-year \ndecline in the 18-year history of the survey. To further illustrate \nthis problem, approximately 76 million adults say they do not have any \nnonretirement savings, according to the National Foundation for Credit \nCounseling. These findings suggest a serious problem exacerbated by the \nfact that most workers have not calculated how much they need to save \nfor retirement, even if they believe they are behind schedule in their \nretirement savings.\n  Increased financial and economic literacy can help people navigate \naround the countless pitfalls that confront working families. In \nSeptember 2008, consumer bankruptcy filings in the United States \nincreased more than 30 percent from the same period in 2006, and there \nwere more than 1,000,000 personal bankruptcy filings in the United \nStates in 2008, according to the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts. This was the highest personal bankruptcy mark since \nbankruptcy laws were amended in 2005. The current market turmoil \nunderscores the critical need for improved financial literacy in the \nUnited States.\n  As leaders and policymakers, we need to champion financial literacy \nefforts year round. However, identifying April as Financial Literacy \nMonth will allow us to focus our attention on this critical issue. We \nmust continue to address financial literacy by educating Americans of \nall ages throughout their lifetime to better protect consumers and \nexpand access to economic empowerment opportunities. Once again, I \nthank my colleagues for their support of this resolution.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 94) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 94\n\n       Whereas, in September 2008, consumer bankruptcy filings in \n     the United States increased more than 30 percent from the \n     same period in 2006, according to the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts;\n       Whereas there were more than 1,000,000 personal bankruptcy \n     filings in the United States in 2008, the most since \n     bankruptcy laws were amended in 2005, according to the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts;\n       Whereas, according to a 2008 ``Flow of Funds'' report by \n     the Federal Reserve, the net worth of households in the \n     United States fell for the 4th consecutive quarter, dropping \n     $2,800,000,000,000, the largest decline in the 57-year \n     history of the report;\n       Whereas, according to a 2008 ``Flow of Funds'' report by \n     the Federal Reserve, household debt in the United States \n     reached $14,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the 2008 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that the \n     percentage of workers who were ``very confident'' about \n     having enough money for a comfortable retirement decreased \n     sharply, from 27 percent in 2007 to 18 percent in 2008, the \n     biggest 1-year decline in the 18-year history of the survey;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury sponsored the 2008 \n     National Financial Literacy Challenge, an examination testing \n     knowledge of high school students of important personal \n     finance concepts;\n       Whereas the average score on the examination was an ``F'', \n     only 56 percent;\n       Whereas the 2007 ``Survey of the States'' compiled by the \n     Council for Economic Education found that only 22 States \n     require an economics test as a high school graduation \n     requirement, 3 fewer than in 2004;\n       Whereas many students who graduate from high school lack \n     basic skills in the management of personal financial affairs \n     and are unable to balance a checkbook, according to the \n     Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy;\n       Whereas, according to the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, fewer than half the people in the United States \n     accessed their credit report in 2008, despite the fact that \n     such report can be obtained for free and contains critically \n     important information for consumers;\n       Whereas approximately 76,000,000 adults say they do not \n     have any non-retirement savings, according to the National \n     Foundation for Credit Counseling;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress found it important to coordinate \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulate a national \n     strategy; and\n       Whereas, in light of that finding, Congress passed the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act of 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-159; 117 Stat. 2003) establishing the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission and designating \n     the Office of Financial Education of the Department of the \n     Treasury to provide support for the Commission: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2009 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of \n     understanding about personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4105-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4105-S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA MEN'S WRESTLING TEAM\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

The outstanding grapplers \nand coaches produced a great season, winning numerous awards and praise \nthroughout the country. I also want to take a special moment and \ncongratulate the University of Iowa wrestling head coach Tom Brands, \nwho has led the team to two straight national championships in only 3 \nyears at the helm of the Hawkeye wrestling team.\n  The University of Iowa students, alumni, faculty and fans are \ncommitted to keeping alive the tradition of wrestling in Iowa and \nbringing pride to the state, as well as the University of Iowa.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to address, as others \nhave today, the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution that is currently \nbeing considered by this body. We take up this budget under the specter \nof--some would say gloomy, some would say perilous--economic conditions \namidst a credit crisis that threatens long-term damage to our economy--\nnot just to the economy in our country but to economies all over the \nworld. As a result, this budget is very likely probably not the most \nimportant vote we cast in the time we serve here but certainly one of \nthe most important we will vote on this year, and maybe in this \nCongress.\n  I wish to begin this evening by reminding my colleagues--I know we \nhave been reminded already today and we will be reminded tomorrow--that \nour friend, former colleague, Barack Obama, took office just 70 days or \nso ago. Not since the inauguration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt has an \nAmerican President inherited such far-reaching economic turmoil and \nbeen asked to do so much in such a short period of time.\n  Over these last 10 weeks, President Obama has become very well \nacquainted with the economic mess he inherited from the previous \nadministration. On the day his predecessor took office--this was about \n8 years ago--our Federal Government enjoyed multibillion-dollar \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see. We were on track, believe it or \nnot, if you recall, on track to actually pay down our national debt, \nwhich at the time was a little under $6 trillion. Since then, sadly, we \nhave seen those surpluses disappear, and they have been replaced \ninstead by the largest budget deficits I think we have witnessed in our \ncountry's history. In fact, we ran up as much new debt in the last 28 \nyears as I think we did in the first 220 years of our Nation's history.\n  When President Bush left office earlier this year, our Nation and the \nnew President were left--and us, here in the Senate and the House--to \nbear the cost of two wars, tax cuts that tend to favor the wealthiest \namong us, an increase of more than 50 percent in Government spending, \nand $10.6 trillion in debt. Again, that is roughly twice what former \nPresident Bush inherited on his first day on the job.\n  The fact is that our badly damaged credit system, our banking system, \nalong with rising unemployment numbers and a contracting economy, have \nthreatened to reduce future revenues to the point where the burgeoning \nbudget deficits of the last 8 years could become a permanent fixture if \nwe are not careful.\n  The damage of these potential deficits cannot be overlooked. I \nbelieve the deficits matter. I think our Presiding Officer knows the \ndeficit matters--it matters for all of us.\n  Last year, American taxpayers paid some quarter of a trillion \ndollars, $250\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nbillion, in interest payments--not principal, just interest payments--\nto creditors at home and around the world. I am told each citizen's \nshare of today's debt amounts to more than $36,000 per person. Beyond \nour own borders, we now owe some $740 billion to China. That is almost \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollars. We owe about $635 billion to \nJapan. We owe $133 billion to Brazil. The list goes on and on.\n  In all likelihood, the large deficits will eventually drive up \ninterest rates for consumers. They will raise prices for goods and \nservices, and they will combine to weaken America's financial \ncompetitiveness.\n  The bigger our deficits become, the fewer resources we have for \ninvestments in energy, education and health care, and we will have \nfewer resources to help provide tax relief for the middle class and for \nsmall businesses that need it the most.\n  Thankfully, both this President's budget and the Senate Budget \nCommittee's proposed budget for fiscal year 2010, the year that begins \nthis October 1, seek to reverse the trend set in motion by the previous \nadministration. Under both plans, annual deficits will be cut in half \nover the next 4 years, by 2012.\n  During his Fiscal Responsibility Summit, which I was fortunate to be \nable to attend along with Democratic and Republican colleagues, the \nPresident said these words:\n\n       This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult \n     decisions.\n\n  There is an understatement.\n  He went on to say we will:\n\n       . . . face challenges we have long neglected.\n\n  He went on to add:\n\n       But I refuse to leave our children with a debt they cannot \n     repay--and that means taking responsibility right now, in \n     this administration--\n\n  And, I might add, in this Congress--\n\n     for getting our spending under control.\n\n  The President is right. Meeting this budget goal will not be easy and \nwill require tough choices and discipline by all of us. Some of these \ntough choices will come from the spending side, and in a difficult \neconomic times, we have to make sure every dollar we collect from the \ntaxpayers is spent wisely and effectively.\n  As chairman of the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I have worked \nwith Senate and House colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, to \nidentify areas of Government spending that are wasteful and in many \ncases inefficient. One of these areas involves something called \nimproper payments.\n  According to data reported to the Office of Management and Budget by \nFederal agencies in their most recent financial statements, the Federal \nGovernment made something like $72 billion last fiscal year in \noverpayments--actually, improper payments, mostly overpayments. During \na series of hearings held by my subcommittee, my colleagues and I \nlearned from GAO that some agencies are not taking seriously their \nresponsibility to properly account for Federal dollars they spend. We \nalso learned that others may not have the resources they need to \naddress their improper payments problem.\n  Just think about this. This is a big budget. This is a budget that is \nhundreds of billions of dollars. But $72 billion was improperly paid, \nmostly overpayments.\n  I plan to introduce legislation in the near future that will direct \nagencies to focus more of their time and more of their resources on \neliminating improper payments--and not just that, but to develop better \nimproper payments remediation plans so they don't continue to make the \nsame mistakes--and finally becoming more aggressive in the use of \nrecovery auditing.\n  I say to my sons, who are now 19 and 20, there is nothing wrong with \nmaking mistakes. We all make mistakes. The only people who don't make \nmistakes are the people who don't do anything. And if we are doing \nanything important, a lot of times we make mistakes. But the key here, \non improper payments, is to figure out why we are making these mistakes \non the improper payments and figure out how not to continue to make the \nsame mistakes and, third, if we made overpayments, to figure out how to \ngo out and recover taxpayers' moneys that have been overpaid.\n  The proposal we will be introducing with bipartisan support will \nincrease the use of recovery auditing, and the positive impact that \nrecovery auditing will have on Government spending will be measured in \nbillions of dollars.\n  Even in a day and age where we are looking at a trillion-dollar-plus \ndeficit, billions of dollars still count. A recent test of recovery \nauditing in just three States' Medicare Programs led to the recovery of \n$1 billion.\n  The Presiding Officer heard me talk about this a time or two, along \nwith the President, when he came to our luncheon last Wednesday here in \nthe Capitol. Three years ago, we started doing I call postaudit \nrecoveries in Medicare to try to identify moneys overpaid in Medicare. \nWe went to three States--California, Texas, Florida--and began to try \nto recover moneys that were overpaid. The first year, we didn't get \nmuch of anything. The second year, we captured a little bit of money. \nLast year, it was close to $1 billion in just three States. What I \nsuggested to the President and my colleagues: We should not just be \ndoing this in three States; we should do it in all 50 States and \nrecover real money. The other thing we ought to do is consider the \nMedicaid Program and see whether there is some way we can do with \nMedicaid, in terms of recovering misspent moneys, overpayments--we do \nthat, take the same lessons from Medicare and apply them to Medicaid.\n  I am pleased to see that the Senate budget makes a number of tough \nchoices when it comes to Federal spending. Senator Conrad has shown \ngreat leadership and fiscal discipline in his drafting of this Senate \nresolution, and his counterpart over in the House, our old friend \nCongressman John Spratt from South Carolina, has managed to do the same \nin the House. The Senate Budget Committee has sent us a lean budget \nthis year, relatively speaking, that increases discretionary spending, \nI am told, by about 5 percent over the fiscal 2009 level, despite calls \nto do much more. Frankly, that is a bit less than was asked for by our \nPresident.\n  While making sure the taxpayer funds are spent wisely is crucial, I \nwould just add that I, for one, reject the philosophy held by some that \ndiscretionary spending is the culprit--maybe the major or even the only \nculprit for our fiscal mess.\n  Balanced budgets will not come just from reductions in discretionary \nspending. Fundamental reform of our major entitlement programs, coupled \nwith some changes in our tax codes, must occur if we are to restore \nfiscal sanity to our Federal budget.\n  On the entitlement side, the Presiding Officer, among a number of \ncentrist Democrats, met today with our budget director OMB Director \nPeter Orszag. Among the things we talked about were entitlement \nprograms and entitlement spending.\n  The entitlement spending on health care consumes an ever-increasing \npercentage of our GDP, with the U.S. currently spending over $2 \ntrillion a year on health care. That is about 17 percent of GDP, and we \nare on a track to get up to about 20 percent in the next several \nyears--20 percent of GDP just for health care.\n  I am told that if you look at three programs now, three entitlement \nprograms, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, if you gather the \namounts, they are about 10 percent of our GDP. And we are on a track \nthat in about 25 years, those three programs alone will amount to 25 \npercent of GDP, and 20 percent of GDP is historically our whole \nbudget--in just three programs. That is obviously not sustainable.\n  And while we spend a whole ton of money, $2 trillion a year on health \ncare, a number of folks suggest that about $700 billion, $700 billion \nof that money, that is about 35 percent of it, does not really improve \nour health outcomes.\n  We spend more money than any other developed nation for health care \nand we certainly do not get better results. This cost growth raises the \npricetag associated, as I said, with entitlement programs such as \nMedicaid as well.\n  And I repeat myself that the current path we are on is clearly not \nsustainable, both for our fiscal health and for our medical health, and \nit is not sustainable as far as our being competitive with the rest of \nthe world and our\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\nbusinesses trying to compete, whether building cars or windmills or \nbuilding electronic equipment. It makes us uncompetitive around the \nworld.\n  America must reform its health care system. We have responsibility to \nhelp do that so we can reverse the rise in health care costs, while we \nimprove the quality of care. We simply cannot afford to continue on \nthis trajectory. As I have said, and I am sure my colleague presiding \nhas, doing nothing is not an option.\n  I wanted to commend tonight not only Senator Conrad, but I wanted to \ncommend the Senate Budget Committee for including a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund in the Senate budget that will enable us to advance a \nhealth care reform bill and reduce Medicare and Medicaid's contribution \nto our budget deficit.\n  Now, on the tax side, I am pleased the Senate budget provides middle-\nclass taxpayers with a measure of tax relief. They still have to pay \ntaxes, but in this budget package and this spending plan they receive a \nmeasure of tax relief, something of which this President is a champion.\n  Taxpayers need certainty, though, when it comes to making middle-\nclass tax provisions permanent. Taxpayers need certainty when it comes \nto the alternative minimum tax. And taxpayers certainly need certainty \nwhen it comes to the estate tax.\n  The idea that we are going to have an estate tax this year, we are \nnot going to have one next year, and then a year later after that we \nare going to go back to the same estate tax we had in 2001 does not \nmake a whole lot of sense to us and to our constituents. But this \nbudget begins the process of addressing those issues, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues, both in the Finance Committee \nand on the Senate floor, in addressing them.\n  On the estate tax, this budget includes a proposal that looks a lot \nlike one I introduced a year or two ago. And it would permanently \nextend the 2009 rate of 45 percent, and an exemption of $7 million per \ncouple. It would index that amount, that is exempted from taxes by the \nrate of inflation each year. So it is not going to be $7 million that \nis the exempt number forever; it will go up each year by the rate of \ninflation. And that which is not covered within that exemption is taxed \nat the rate of 45 percent, which is really right about where we are \nthis year. I think this proposal represents a sensible way to balance \nour two critical goals, and seems fair and reasonable, is what Fox \nsays.\n  It helps us to avoid hitting middle-class taxpayers and small \nbusinesses. It helps us to avoid the problems we have had with the \nalternative minimum tax, where we have not indexed it in over 30 years.\n  Finally middle-class families are finding out they are subject to the \nalternative minimum tax. And someday the same thing will happen to the \nestate tax if we do not index it.\n  In addition to the estate tax provision, this budget extends the \nprevious administration's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the middle class. \nWe are not throwing out everything we have done in 2001 and 2003 in the \nBush administration if it is meritorious. And that is an example--those \nare examples of things we want to preserve. We think that preserving \ntax relief for the middle class is a high-yield, low-risk investment. \nIt will be the middle class, we think, who lifts the economy out of the \nrecession and ushers us through the decade of innovation and hopefully \nto prosperity. I believe this extension of these tax cuts will go a \nlong way toward bolstering a resurgence.\n  While many of these provisions seek to help stimulate growth through \nrevenue modifications, we also need to make some other changes to our \ncurrent tax policy in order to help increase revenues that will pay \ndown our budget deficit. One way to do this is to close something we \ncall the tax gap, which I am pleased to say is a high priority of this \nbudget resolution. Most Americans, if they knew that something like \n$400 billion of taxes that are owed to the Federal Government are not \nbeing collected--and most people in this country pay their fair share \nof taxes--the idea that, gosh, almost a half a trillion is not being \ncollected on an annual basis makes my blood boil, and I suspect makes \nit boil for a lot of other people.\n  As it turns out, there are a number of things that we can do to \naddress the tax gap. I am delighted in the budget document that we are \nseeing, it reflects a whole lot of steps we can take. Through my \nsubcommittee that I chair on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs and through my work on the Finance Committee, I have been \nhelped by a bunch of people to enable us to craft legislation--I will \nbe introducing it soon--that helps close the tax gap, and we do it by \nfocusing on improving compliance.\n  I would say this. You and I, most people, if taxes are withheld from \nour income, we comply. We have a compliance rate of about 99 percent of \npaying our fair share of taxes. When our income is reported to the IRS \non, say, a 1099, there is about a 90-percent, maybe 95 percent, \ncompliance with paying our fair share of taxes.\n  When there is not withholding of taxes, where there is not reporting \nof income, the rate of compliance drops way down--as low as 50 percent, \neven lower than that.\n  I am looking forward to working with our new President and my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, in a nonpartisan way, of putting \ntogether a package of proposals to meet the goals that are laid out in \nthis budget, particularly with respect to making sure people pay their \nfair share of taxes.\n  While the Senate budget does extend the Bush tax cuts for the middle \nclass beyond fiscal year 2010, it does not do the same for some of our \nmost affluent Americans. During the previous administration, some of \nthe wealthiest Americans shouldered disproportionately less tax burden \nthan do many members of the middle class.\n  The budget before us seeks to restore a fairer balance while also \nproviding the revenue needed to close our budget deficits over the next \nseveral fiscal years.\n  Finally, I commend Senator Conrad and the President for acknowledging \nthat we have to do more to address climate change in this budget--\nsomething with which I know our Presiding Officer agrees--keeping open \nall of our options, including a cap-and-trade system which I have \nworked on for a number of years for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have likened a climate cap-and-\ntrade program to a carbon tax. I always find it interesting that people \naround here seem to embrace the idea or propose the idea of a carbon \ntax instead of a cap-and-trade approach on climate change. Most of the \npeople that seem to propose and embrace a carbon tax would not vote for \none if they had the chance to, which is kind of ironic.\n\n  Let me be clear. On a cap-and-trade system--and where we basically \nsay for carbon dioxide emissions, we are going to put a cap on how much \ncan be emitted--over time we are going to bring that cap down, and we \nare going to give folks, the emitters, the chance to trade as they \nreduce their emissions, to have an opportunity to trade with other \nemitters, and find ways to harness economic forces to reduce, in an \neffective way, an efficient way, our emissions of CO2.\n  But among the advantages of a cap-and-trade system, it is flexible \nwithin our economy. It interacts with folks like in Europe who have \nbeen doing this cap-and-trade stuff for a while. It ensures that we get \nthe needed pollution reductions.\n  A great example of a cap-and-trade program is the Acid Rain Program. \nIt was not set up by a Democrat. It was not set up by Bill Clinton. It \nwas set up by former President Bush. George Herbert Walker Bush set it \nup in 1990.\n  That cap-and-trade program, the Acid Rain Program, has reduced sulfur \ndioxide emissions at half the estimated cost and quicker than expected, \nmaking it one of the most successful environmental programs in our \nNation's history.\n  I hope my friends here will not forget that cap and trade is a \nvaluable market tool that has been proven to secure air quality \nimprovements at half the cost. It is not a tax.\n  We have a chance to test this baby, see how it works. We have seen it \nwork very well.\n  Let me add in closing that this budget resolution puts the brakes on \nsome of the budgetary tactics used in recent budgets and puts our \nNation back on a path toward fiscal discipline. While we can't solve \nall our budget problems in 1 year, this bill represents the opening\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\nsalvo in a multiyear battle to reduce our deficits and prevent our \nchildren from bearing the cost of ever greater deficits.\n  At the President's first fiscal summit a month or so ago, he noted:\n\n       While we are making important progress toward fiscal \n     responsibility this year, in this budget, this is just the \n     beginning. In the coming years, we'll be forced to make more \n     tough choices and do much to address our long-term \n     challenges.\n\n  He is right. To paraphrase Robert Frost, we have miles to go before \nwe sleep.\n  I stand ready to help this President, to work with my colleagues, \nRepublican and Democrat, House and Senate, to make some of those tough \nchoices and to tackle the challenges in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/31/senate-section/article/S4109-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
