Mr. President, the most important part of our jobs as \nSenators is to create jobs in our States. That is especially true in \ntimes such as these, when so many are reeling from so much economic \npain.\n  Right now, as I speak, the President is signing into law our small \nbusiness jobs bill. As soon as he does, $15 billion in tax relief and \nhundreds of millions of dollars in loans will be on the way to \nAmerica's small businesses, which we all know are the engines of our \neconomy, engines that will power recovery.\n  Every penny of that help is paid for, and it will not add a single \ndime to the deficit. I spoke to the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration on Thursday or Friday--I don't know the exact day. She \nindicated to me that there were 1,000 applications for small business \nloans that will be completed within hours of signing that bill. The \nresources have simply not been there for her to do the work that is \nnecessary. One thousand small businesses will be able to go forward on \nprograms they have, programs dealing with retail sales, wholesaling. \nThere will be businesses that will be exporters, importers, and any \nvariation of small\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nbusinesses that you can imagine--restaurants. This will create many \njobs immediately. So I was happy when I heard that from her. I knew \nthat was going to be the case, but I wanted to hear it from her.\n  When that funding gets to where it is going, as many as one-half \nmillion people who are looking for work today will soon be on their way \nto a new job. We fought so hard for this bill against such stubborn \nminority opposition because we know we have to do everything we can to \nget people back to work. That means we have to work just as hard to \ncreate new jobs as we have to protect existing ones. It means that when \na corporation tries to take away someone's job in Nevada and send it \nhalfway around the world, we have to stop them. We cannot let the \ngreedy CEOs do that anymore, and that is exactly what we are going to \ndo this week. We are going to take away the incentives that our \ncorporations have to send our jobs overseas and give them powerful new \nincentives to keep the jobs right here in America.\n  Right now, our Tax Code actually rewards corporations for offshoring \njobs. It is hard to comprehend that, but it is true. It helps them pay \nthe costs of closing their plants and offers them tax breaks if they \nmove production to other countries. The current system even encourages \ncompanies to ask their employees to train their foreign replacements. \nThink about how an American feels about that. That is a slap in the \nface to hard-working Americans. It is no way to get our economy back on \nits feet and certainly no way to get Americans back to work.\n  Our bill rights this wrong, and it is going to help revive our \nNation's manufacturing industry. We are giving companies the right kind \nof tax cut, a payroll tax holiday as a reward for bringing jobs back \nhome. So far, we have seen little to indicate that our friends on the \nother side of the aisle have any interest in protecting American jobs. \nInstead, we have seen them fight with great enthusiasm to keep \ncorporate tax loopholes as wide open as possible.\n  Let's use this week to remember whom we work for: middle-class \nfamilies and the hard-working people who built this country and will \nrebuild it toward recovery; middle-class families and not corporations \nthat take advantage of tax loopholes at their expense; American workers \nand not foreign companies that want to take away their jobs. That is \nthe most important thing we can do.\n  Nothing is more important to me, as a Senator, than the work to \ncreate jobs in our States.\n  Will the Chair now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7456-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, although we have come a very long way \nsince January 2009, our Nation faces profound short-term and long-term \nfiscal and economic challenges. In the short term, we need to do more \nso our economy will grow significantly again. This should include the \nsmall business jobs bill, the extension of middle-class tax cuts, and \nadditional spending on infrastructure, as the President has proposed. \nIn the longer term, we need to shore up our fiscal balance sheet and \ndevelop policies, including investment in innovation, research and \ndevelopment, clean energy and science, technology, engineering and \nmath--STEM education--that promote sustainable growth and job creation.\n  Unfortunately, instead of distinguishing between our distinct short-\nterm and long-term problems, we have conflated them, focusing most of \nour attention on our immediate fiscal deficits.\n  Sometimes overlooked is that these deficits are, in a large part, \nlegacies of unpaid-for policies of the previous administration, whether \nthey be the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not paid for, tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, which were passed and not paid for, or Medicare Part D, \nwhich was passed and not paid for. In addition, the economic fallout \nfrom the financial crisis, a primary driver of our current fiscal \ndeficits, was itself a product, as you well know, Mr. President, of \ngovernmentwide deregulation.\n  While we all support cutting wasteful government spending, it is not, \nby itself, a solution to our fiscal woes. Indeed, if we were to \neliminate all nondefense discretionary spending in the next fiscal \nyear--Department of Justice, Department of Education, Department of \nEnergy--we would still have a deficit of more than $700 billion; that \nis, if we eliminate all of them. We hear people coming to the floor and \ntalking about cutting that, that is going to save us. If we eliminate \nthe whole thing, go down Constitution Avenue and close down every \nbuilding, we would still have a deficit of more than $700 billion.\n  This focus on Federal Government spending is shortsighted and even \ncounterproductive, since it distracts us from the real problem of \naddressing our weak economic fundamentals.\n  All too many Americans are painfully aware of the current economic \nconditions in which we find ourselves. It is clear these conditions \nwould even be worse if not for the Recovery Act. It saved us from \nanother full-blown depression and allowed us to rebuild our economy and \nadd jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act resulted in anywhere between \n1.8 million and 4.1 million more jobs.\n  The CBO also estimated that our gross domestic product was 1.7 \npercent to 4.2 percent higher in the first quarter of 2010. Other \neconomic indicators show similarly strong results, following the \npassage of the Recovery Act. After the passage of the Recovery Act, the \nmarkets hit bottom, with the Dow 6,547, on March 9, 2009, just about \nthe time we passed the Recovery Act. Since we passed the Recovery Act, \nthe Dow has risen dramatically, climbing above 11,000 early this year, \neven remaining above 10,000 amidst recent market turmoil, and most \nrecently spurting higher by more than 7 percent in the month of \nSeptember alone. All that happened after we passed the Recovery Act.\n  The Purchasing Managers Index, a leading indicator of business \nconfidence, has also been generally trending upward since the passage \nof the Recovery Act. That we are not where we want to be is testament \nto the magnitude of the problems inherited by the President and this \nCongress. Indeed, millions of Americans are without jobs and \noverburdened with debt. Although large corporate balance sheets are \ngenerally strong, many small businesses have limited access to credit, \na condition which will be helped with the small business jobs bill, \nwhich the President signs today.\n  What is more, many businesses will simply not invest without consumer \nconfidence. In such an environment, where consumer and business \nconfidence is low, there are obviously limits to the effectiveness of \nmonetary policy, irrespective of the creativity of the economists and \npolicymakers at the Federal Reserve.\n  Fiscal policy, whether through direct government spending or through \ntax or other incentives, is the one lever we have to spur growth. As \nOlivier Blanchard recently stated: ``If fiscal stimulus helps reduce \nunemployment and thus avoid an increase in structural unemployment, it \nmay actually largely pay for itself and lead to only a small increase \nin debt relative to the alternative of doing nothing.''\n  Conversely, policies aimed at an immediate spending cut and a \ntightening of the proverbial fiscal belt could actually harm our \neconomy. Therefore, it is critical we extend middle-class tax cuts and \nexpand, not contract, stimulus measures.\n  In addition, the President's $50 billion of infrastructure investment \nis a good way to put more Americans back to work, to make a downpayment \non rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  Of course, our need to promote economic growth in the short term does\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nnot make the need to address long-term fiscal problems any less urgent.\n  Former OMB Director Peter Orszag said in late July:\n\n       It would be foolish to dramatically reduce the deficit \n     immediately, because that would choke off the nascent \n     economic recovery. But it would be equally foolish not to \n     reduce the deficit significantly by, say, 2015, because that \n     would imperil continued economic growth at that point.\n\n  Accordingly, while we should not be raising taxes on middle-class \nfamilies in the midst of a recession, we should also not make permanent \nthe Bush tax cuts on the top 2 percent of Americans. Doing so would \ncost close to $700 billion over the next 10 years. That is not a policy \nof fiscal discipline.\n  The path to fiscal sustainability will require tough choices and \ntradeoffs. We, therefore, need to be supportive of efforts and \ndecisions of the new bipartisan debt commission. But as important as it \nis to put our fiscal house in order, our Nation's future prosperity \nwill not be determined by accountants in green eyeshades. If we hope to \npromote sustainable economic growth and job creation, it is critical \nthat we seize the initiative on clean energy and that we support \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.\n  If we want to get the most bang for our buck now and long into the \nfuture, we should invest in clean energy. Studies show that a $1 \nmillion investment in clean energy will create more than three times \nthe number of jobs than if those dollars were invested in fossil fuel-\nbased energy projects.\n  The truth is that clean energy is the future of the global economy, \nand we should be investing in it today. Since 2005, global investment \nin clean energy has exploded, growing by 230 percent. But the United \nStates is not keeping up with the global clean energy revolution. Last \nyear, 10 G20 countries invested a higher percentage of gross domestic \nproduct in clean energy technology than the United States did. These \ninvestments created many jobs--over 1 million jobs in China alone. This \ngrowth is a direct result of policy decisions that commit to a clean \nenergy future. The United States has failed to make a significant \ncommitment to clean energy. Over the recess, Ernst & Young announced \nthat for the first time, China had overtaken the United States as the \nmost attractive country for renewable energy projects.\n  We need to provide certainty in the energy market for investors, \nbusinesses, and industries. They tell us that none of this will happen \nwithout a price on carbon. Pricing carbon will reflect the true cost of \nour energy sources and enable market forces to drive American ingenuity \nto develop clean energy technologies that will create jobs, enhance \nU.S. competitiveness, and establish the long-term economic security we \nneed. Pricing carbon is the most effective policy tool available to \ntransition the Nation away from dirty fossil fuels. It will create \nincentives for businesses and industries to find the lowest cost \nsolutions to reducing carbon pollution. Again, this is a market-driven \nsolution. Leave it to the private sector. Give them the incentives to \ndo the right thing and develop clean energy.\n  In addition to investing in clean energy, we need to promote STEM--\nscience, technology, engineering, and math--education. STEM jobs will \nbe the jobs of the future. Whether it is energy independence, global \nhealth, homeland security, or infrastructure challenges, STEM \nprofessionals will be at the forefront of the most important issues of \nour time. In fact, according to a new study released by Georgetown \nUniversity's Center on Education and the Workforce, by 2018 STEM \noccupations are projected to provide 2.8 million new hires. This \nincludes over 500,000 engineering-related jobs.\n  We must also continue to support research and development--a \nchallenge that requires significant Federal as well as private \ninvestment. In our current economy, it is often hard to imagine \ninvesting more in anything, but more research and development funding \nis fundamental to high-tech job creation. A recent report from the \nScience Coalition features 100 companies that can be directly traced to \ninfluential research conducted at a university and sponsored by a \nFederal agency. Examples include Google, Cisco Systems, and SAS.\n  It is imperative that we get our economy growing again so that we are \nin a strong position to tackle the very real challenges of the future. \nIn the long term, our task will not be simply to get our government's \nfinances under control. As important as that is, it will also involve \nmaking the needed investment in areas such as clean energy and STEM \nthat will ensure long-term growth and job creation. We face complex \nchallenges in the 21st century. They include harnessing eco-friendly \nsources of energy and providing efficient and effective health care for \nan aging population. By making these investments in our future, I am \nconfident we can foster the innovation necessary to successfully \naddress these problems and reestablish our leadership in an \nincreasingly competitive global economy.\n  Finally, Americans always had the ingredients for success, and I am \nconfident that in the coming months and years, the American ethic of \ninnovation and hard work will once again return our economy to the path \ntoward prosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7457-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7457-S7459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENDING OFFSHORING ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. I wish to talk about the so-called Ending Offshoring Act, a \nbill that the Wall Street Journal suggested this morning should be \ncalled ``The Send Jobs Overseas Act.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this bill provides a temporary payroll tax \nholiday for multinational U.S. employers who hire a new U.S. worker. \nBut not just any worker. To be eligible, the business must prove that \nthe employee is replacing an employee who had been performing a similar \njob abroad. The bill, which is not fully offset, proposes to partially \npay for this tax holiday for multinational corporations with new tax \nhikes on multinational corporations--tax hikes that could undermine job \ncreation in America.\n  How would the tax increases be applied? The bill would disallow tax \ndeductions associated with expanding operations overseas and would \nlimit tax deferral of income U.S. multinational companies earn abroad \nby selling products in the United States.\n  Currently, when a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. parent company earns \nsuch income, it is not taxed by the United States until it is sent back \nto the U.S. parent company. Even though most foreign countries only tax \nincome earned within their borders, the U.S. taxes income earned \nanywhere in the world by U.S. citizens and companies. The deferral \npolicy aims to keep U.S. companies competitive with their foreign \ncounterparts, since we also have the second highest corporate tax rate \nin the world. So deferral is not a ``tax benefit,'' as some of the \nbill's proponents claim.\n  This bill wrongly assumes that all foreign expansion stems from \n``greed'' and that foreign expansion only hurts American workers. I \nwill explain why that's simply not the case and why this bill could, in \nfact, hinder job creation in America and actually send American jobs \noverseas permanently.\n  The first point I want to illustrate is how limiting tax deferral \ncould hurt American jobs. Limiting deferral would subject U.S. \nmultinational companies to higher taxes, cutting into their profits and \ngiving foreign competitors a huge advantage in the global marketplace. \nWe have to keep in mind: American companies with overseas operations \nsupport and create U.S. jobs.\n  A new paper from the McKinsey Global Institute shows that America's \nmultinational companies make huge contributions to our economy: They \naccount for 19 percent of all private-sector jobs in the United States, \n25 percent of all private wages, 48 percent of total export goods, and \n74 percent of nonpublic research and development spending.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n  In fact, Johnson & Johnson estimates that about one in five U.S. \nemployees hold jobs that support their international operations.\n  Let me provide an example of how foreign expansion can create jobs \nhere at home:\n  A few years ago, PepsiCo embarked on an aggressive expansion program \nin Eastern Europe, largely by buying up existing bottlers and snack \nchip producers, upgrading plants and equipment, and improving \ndistribution while increasing their marketing efforts in these \ncountries, achieving large gains in sales as a result.\n  As a result of this expansion, PepsiCo's employment abroad increased, \nbut that did not cost any Americans their jobs. Pepsi merely took over \nexisting plants and their workers.\n  In fact, PepsiCo's foreign expansion created jobs here in the United \nStates. To support their overseas operations, the company needed to \nexpand their logistics, marketing, and other support operations, all \nwell-paying jobs at their U.S. headquarters. As a result, expanding \noperations abroad increased employment here in the United States.\n  The advisers for the McKinsey report provided the jobs statistics \nthat show the correlation between companies' expansion abroad and \nemployment here at home: From 1988 to 2007, employment in foreign \naffiliates rose to 10 million from 4.8 million. During that same \nperiod, employment in U.S. parent companies rose to 22 million from \n17.7 million. The reason is, as the Pepsi example shows, that much of \nthe expansion abroad by U.S. multinationals has complemented, rather \nthan replaced, U.S. operations.\n  In 2008, a Washington Post editorial highlighted a study that made \nthis same point. The study looked at U.S. manufacturers that expanded \nabroad between 1982 and 2004 and, as the Post wrote, ``found that they \ntended to grow domestically as well, hiring more U.S. employees, paying \nthem more and spending more on research.''\n  The study concluded that ``the average experience of all U.S. \nmanufacturing firms over the last two decades is inconsistent with the \nsimple story that all foreign expansions come at the cost of reduced \ndomestic activity.''\n  New taxes could encourage some companies to locate more or all of \ntheir operations abroad, where they could remain more profitable, since \nmany countries do not tax income earned outside their borders. That \ncould really happen. There is nothing that says corporations have to be \nlocated in the United States. U.S. multinational corporations will have \nlittle incentive to invest and hire here if tax policy prevents them \nfrom realizing attractive returns.\n  The McKinsey report cautions that policymakers have to be diligent \nabout enacting policies that maintain U.S. economic competitiveness:\n\n       The United States retains many strengths that make it one \n     of the most attractive markets for multinational companies' \n     participation and investments. But numerous fast-growing \n     emerging markets [such as China, Brazil, and India] and some \n     advanced economies are making huge strides in increasing \n     their attractiveness, and are thereby influencing how \n     multinationals decide where to participate and invest. Thus, \n     the United States has entered a new era of global competition \n     for multinational activity. . . . Many of the executives we \n     spoke with emphasized the need to ensure they are competing \n     on a level playing field.\n\n  So let us not give foreign competitors a new edge by raising taxes on \nAmerican companies that create new American jobs.\n  A second point: Many American companies establish operations abroad, \nnot ``to export jobs'' for reasons of ``greed,'' as some of the bill's \nsupporters charge, but to break into foreign markets, add new \ncustomers, or cater to a larger market abroad. The Pepsi example I just \ndiscussed illustrates this point.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, only 10 percent of foreign \nsubsidiary sales are into the United States. So 90 percent of the \nsubsidiaries' sales are in foreign markets. This statistic shows that \nthe vast majority of companies are not moving manufacturing overseas \nonly to sell goods back to the United States at a savings, but rather \nto cater to their customers.\n  A third point: Rather than picking winners and losers shouldn't we \ncreate an environment in which all companies become even more \ncompetitive?\n  One way to do this would be to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, \nwhich is the second highest in the world. A recent article in National \nReview points out that ``by mid-2009, the U.S. corporate tax rate, \nincluding federal and state corporate taxes, was 39.1 percent. In \nWestern Europe, the corresponding rates ranged from 34.4 in France, to \n26.3 in Sweden, to 12.5 percent in Ireland.''\n  The author of this article points out that on the most recent World \nBank list of places to pay business taxes, the U.S. ranks 61st out of \n183 countries, behind France, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, and \nthe UK.\n  This high corporate tax rate distorts business decisions, such as \nlocating investments; hinders capital formation; and suppresses wages. \nRather than increase taxes on certain companies, we should bring the \nrate down to help correct these distortions.\n  Let me quote a couple of lines from the Wall Street Journal editorial \nI mentioned before. They confirm:\n\n       The U.S. already has one of the most punitive corporate tax \n     regimes in the world and this tax increase [proposed in the \n     legislation before us] would make that competitive \n     disadvantage much worse, accelerating the very outsourcing of \n     jobs that Mr. Obama says he wants to reverse.\n\n  Paul Volcker, the handpicked individual of the White House on the tax \nreform panel, whose report recently was received by the President, said \nin the report:\n\n       The growing gap between the U.S. corporate tax rate and the \n     corporate tax rates of most other countries generates \n     incentives for U.S. corporations to shift their income and \n     operations to foreign locations with lower corporate tax \n     rates to avoid U.S. rates.\n\n  That is what is causing people to move abroad, the higher corporate \ntax rates here. Yet the bill before us would raise those rates even \nhigher on companies that do business abroad.\n  One Volcker recommendation is to lower the corporate tax rate to \ncloser to the international average which would ``reduce the incentives \nof U.S. companies to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.''\n  So rather than raising taxes to try to punish U.S. companies that do \nbusiness abroad, we should be reducing the tax rate to encourage them \nto stay here. The Wall Street Journal concludes:\n\n       CEO Steve Ballmer has warned that if the President's plan \n     is enacted, Microsoft would move facilities and jobs out of \n     the U.S.\n\n  Thus proving the point. In fact, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, my colleague Max Baucus, said in Congress Daily:\n\n       I think it puts the United States at a competitive \n     disadvantage. That's why I'm concerned.\n\n  A concluding comment from the editorial:\n\n       The lesson here is that tax rates matter in a world of \n     global competition and the U.S. tax regime is hurting \n     American companies and workers.\n\n  In conclusion, we are talking again about taxing Americans more at a \nvery time when we should be finding ways to reduce the tax burden on \nAmericans; in this case, so they can compete better with foreign \ncompetitors.\n  I return to the issue before us and, unfortunately, it apparently \nisn't going to be resolved before Congress leaves, and that is taxing \nsmall businesses as well. The proposal of the President and those on \nthe other side of the aisle to raise taxes on American small business \nmen and women and thereby threaten job creation is exactly the wrong \nmedicine at this time. The proposed payroll tax holiday won't help \nsmall businesses at all. We have been coming to the floor for weeks \nsaying: Don't increase taxes on any American. So far all we have seen \nis efforts by the majority in one way or another to find a way to \nincrease taxes on segments of the American economy. That is precisely \nwhat is being proposed in the legislation before us.\n  I reiterate, now is not the time to be raising taxes on anyone, let \nalone companies that account for such a high number of new jobs. Let's \ntailor our policies to help these companies employ even more American \nworkers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 26, 2010]\n\n                       The Send Jobs Overseas Act\n\n       Democrats may be dodging a vote on the Bush-era tax cuts, \n     but that doesn't mean they don't want to raise taxes before \n     November. Witness this week's showdown in Congress over \n     increasing the tax on the profits of American companies with \n     foreign subsidiaries to punish firms that relocate plants\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\n     overseas. How much more harm can this crowd do before it's \n     run out of town?\n       Like so many others, this tax increase is being promoted by \n     President Obama, who declared last week that ``for years, our \n     tax code has actually given billions of dollars in tax breaks \n     that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other \n     countries. I want to change that.''\n       Democrats around the country are making this issue their \n     number one campaign theme, since they can't run on health \n     care, stimulus or anything else they've passed into law. \n     Think about this: One of the two major parties in the world's \n     supposedly leading economy is trying to hold on to its \n     majority by running against foreign investment and the free \n     flow of capital. This is banana republic behavior.\n       We're all for increasing jobs in the U.S., but the \n     President's plan reveals how out of touch Democrats are with \n     the real world of tax competition. The U.S. already has one \n     of the most punitive corporate tax regimes in the world and \n     this tax increase would make that competitive disadvantage \n     much worse, accelerating the very outsourcing of jobs that \n     Mr. Obama says he wants to reverse.\n       At issue is how the government taxes American firms that \n     make money overseas. Under current tax law, American \n     companies pay the corporate tax rate in the host country \n     where the subsidiary is located and then pay the difference \n     between the U.S. rate (35%) and the foreign rate when they \n     bring profits back to the U.S. This is called deferral--i.e., \n     the U.S. tax is deferred until the money comes back to these \n     shores.\n       Most countries do not tax the overseas profits of their \n     domestic companies. Mr. Obama's plan would apply the U.S. \n     corporate tax on overseas profits as soon as they are earned. \n     This is intended to discourage firms from moving operations \n     out of the U.S.\n       The real problem is a U.S. corporate tax rate that over the \n     last 15 years has become a huge competitive disadvantage. The \n     only major country with a higher statutory rate is Japan, and \n     even its politicians are debating a reduction. A May 2010 \n     study by University of Calgary economists Duanjie Chen and \n     Jack Mintz for the Cato Institute using World Bank data finds \n     that the effective combined U.S. federal and state tax rate \n     on new capital investment, taking into account all credits \n     and deductions, is 35%. The OECD average is 19.5% and the \n     world average is 18%.\n       We've made this case hundreds of times on this page, but \n     perhaps Mr. Obama will listen to his own economic advisory \n     panel. Paul Volcker led this handpicked White House tax \n     reform panel whose recent report concluded that ``The growing \n     gap between the U.S. corporate tax rate and the corporate tax \n     rates of most other countries generates incentives for U.S. \n     corporations to shift income and operations to foreign \n     locations with lower corporate tax rates to avoid U.S. \n     rates.''\n       As nations around the world have cut their rates, the \n     report warns, ``these incentives [to leave the U.S.] have \n     become stronger.'' Companies make investment decisions for a \n     variety of reasons, including tax rates. But as long as the \n     U.S. corporate tax is more than 50% higher than it is \n     elsewhere, companies will invest in other countries all other \n     things being equal. One Volcker recommendation is to lower \n     the corporate rate to closer to the international average, \n     which would ``reduce the incentives of U.S. companies to \n     shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.''\n       Mr. Obama believes that by increasing the U.S. tax on \n     overseas profits, some companies may be less likely to invest \n     abroad in the first place. In some cases that will be true. \n     But the more frequent result will be that U.S. companies lose \n     business to foreign rivals, U.S. firms are bought by tax-\n     advantaged foreign companies, and some U.S. multinational \n     firms move their headquarters overseas. They can move to \n     Ireland (where the corporate tax rate is 12.5%) or Germany or \n     Taiwan, or dozens of countries with less hostile tax \n     climates.\n       We know this will happen because we've seen it before. The \n     1986 tax reform abolished deferral of foreign shipping income \n     earned by U.S. controlled firms. No other country taxed \n     foreign shipping income. Did this lead to more business for \n     U.S. shippers? Precisely the opposite.\n       According to a 2007 study in Tax Notes by former Joint \n     Committee on Taxation director Ken Kies, ``Over the 1985-2004 \n     period, the U.S.-flag fleet declined from 737 to 412 vessels, \n     causing U.S.-flag shipping capacity, measured in deadweight \n     tonnage, to drop by more than 50%.''\n       Mr. Kies explains that ``much of the decline was \n     attributable to the acquisition of U.S.-based shipping \n     companies by foreign competitors not subject to tax on their \n     shipping income.'' Mr. Kies concludes that the experiment was \n     ``a real disaster for U.S. shipping'' and that the debate \n     over whether U.S. companies can compete in a global market \n     facing much higher tax rates than their competitors was \n     answered ``with a vengeance.''\n       Now the White House wants to repeat this experience with \n     all U.S. companies. Two industries that would be most harmed \n     would be financial services and technology, and their \n     emphasis on human capital makes them especially able to pack \n     up and move their operations abroad. CEO Steve Ballmer has \n     warned that if the President's plan is enacted, Microsoft \n     would move facilities and jobs out of the U.S.\n       The lesson here is that tax rates matter in a world of \n     global competition and the U.S. tax regime is hurting \n     American companies and workers. Mr. Obama would add to the \n     damage. His election-eve campaign to raise taxes on American \n     companies making money overseas may not be his most dangerous \n     economic idea, but it is right up there.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our policy in \nAfghanistan, which has evolved significantly since I arrived in the \nSenate in January 2009. After President Bush diverted our focus from \nAfghanistan to Iraq in 2003, President Obama redoubled our efforts to \nengage in an effective counterinsurgency strategy. In the past year, we \nhave finally invested the resources necessary to make progress in \nAfghanistan with increased troop levels, equipment, and funding. But \ndespite this commitment and the outstanding performance of our troops, \nprogress in Afghanistan is riding on far more than the military. It \nalso requires a civilian strategy, Afghan National Security Force \ntraining, cooperation with Pakistan, Afghan Governance, and tackling \ncorruption at all levels, beginning with President Karzai.\n  The Obama administration has made a concerted effort to get the \npolicy right in Afghanistan, as demonstrated by the two policy reviews \nconducted in 2009. As it embarks on a third review this fall, I \nencourage a renewed focus on corruption, which will serve as the \nbellwether for progress as we transition toward a conditions-based \ndrawdown in July. The majority of Afghans do not support the Taliban, \nbut they will not support U.S. efforts if they perceive their \ngovernment as corrupt. According to a recent poll, 59 percent of \nAfghans cite corruption as the biggest problem, while 54 percent cite \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, this is not a battle between the U.S. and the \nTaliban. It is a struggle between the Afghan Government and the Taliban \nfor the support of the population. While less than 10 percent of \nAfghans actively support the Taliban, this does not necessarily \ntranslate into support for the Afghan Government in the absence of \njobs, free and fair elections, an efficient judicial system, and other \nessential services. Counterinsurgency is about building trust between \nthe local population, the security forces, and the government. And \nwithout credible governance at the national and subnational levels, we \ncannot expect sustainable progress.\n  Since assuming office, I have traveled to Afghanistan three times in \nMarch and September 2009, and April of this year. My trips have been \neye-opening experiences, and I have made the following observations. \nFirst, our military is performing at the highest level--a 10 out of 10. \nThe bravery and commitment of our men and women in uniform is both \nadmirable and inspiring. Moreover, from the top down, the military has \nembraced counterinsurgency strategy, which is the best way to meet \ncurrent and future security challenges. This is why I strongly support \nSecretary Gates' efforts to rebalance the defense budget to better \nprepare for the non-conventional threats of the future, drawing on the \nlessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My second observation is that counterinsurgency strategy in \nAfghanistan requires far more than the military. It requires a strong \ncivilian capacity, indigenous security forces, and governance to meet \nthe requirements necessary for progress. First, the military must shape \nthe strategy. Second, security forces must clear the area of \ninsurgents. Third, they must hold the area. And fourth, civilians, in \npartnership with the local and national government, must build through \neconomic development. In Afghanistan, we are working toward a fifth \nstage of transferring responsibility to the Afghans by July 2011.\n  Last year at this time, I gave a speech detailing the requirements \nnecessary for waging an effective counterinsurgency strategy in \nAfghanistan, including sufficient numbers of Afghan National Security \nForces, or ANSF; a ``civilian surge'' strategy; increased levels of \ncooperation with Pakistan; and building Afghan government capacity \nthrough the elimination of corruption. In the past year, there has been \nprogress in some of these areas, but significant challenges still \nremain.\n  When considering the sufficient number of ANSF, it is important to \nlook to COIN doctrine, which stipulates one counterinsurgent for every \n50 civilians. This requires nearly 600,000 counterinsurgents given the \nsize of the Afghan population. If we add the total number of \ninternational troops plus current levels of the Afghan army and police, \nit is less than half the required 600,000. At the same time, there has \nbeen recent progress in lowering the rates of attrition and increasing \nrecruitment and retention, especially among the Afghan National Police.\n  By comparison, the current level of Iraqi Security Forces is 600,000, \nwhich seemed like a lofty goal just a few years ago. Increasing the \nsize of the ANSF is possible, but training an effective Afghan army and \npolice will continue to require great patience, determination, and \nleadership.\n  Remember, Iraq and Afghanistan are about the same size and need \n600,000 troops for our counterinsurgency. We have less than 300,000 \nnow, security forces, troops, police, and our troops.\n  When I asked him about this issue last year, General McChrystal said \nthat we did not need to reach the requisite level of 600,000 because \nthe plan was to selectively focus on population centers in regional \ncommands east and south. While it makes sense to hone in on areas with \nthe biggest security problems, the Taliban has filled the void in areas \nwhere we diverted our attention. We have seen this most prominently in \nthe north, where violence has increased in recent months as U.S. and \ninternational troops continue to concentrate, where they should, on \nsouthern Afghanistan.\n  In addition to levels of trained ANSF, I also remain concerned about \nthe U.S. civilian strategy. While it is positive that the number of \ncivilians posted in Afghanistan more than tripled since President Obama \ntook office--rising from 300 to nearly 1,000--there are not enough \ncivilians posted outside of Kabul to partner with the local government. \nToday, there are approximately 400 civilians outside of Kabul, but more \nare required to reach the population of more than 28 million.\n  This underscores the need for building greater U.S. civilian capacity \nfor engaging in counterinsurgency. We are more likely to face \nnonconventional threats in the future, and must therefore prepare both \nthe military and civilian agencies for such operations. This requires \na-whole-of-government approach and greater civilian-military \ncoordination. While I am pleased that joint training with the military \nis now required for all civilians deploying to the field in Afghanistan \nat Camp Atterbury in Indiana, other steps must be taken to better \nprepare our civilian workforce for engaging in counterinsurgency \noperations. We must also increase interagency staffing of the Civilian \nResponse Corps, as overseen by the Office of the Coordinator for \nStabilization and Reconstruction, or S/CRS, at the State Department.\n  In addition, an increased number of Afghan civil servants are \nrequired for partnership with U.S. civilians, especially as we look \ntoward the build and transfer stages of the process. The establishment \nof the Afghan Civil Service Institute, which trains Afghan bureaucrats, \nis a step in the right direction. But examples such as Marja \ndemonstrate that ``government in a box'' cannot be installed without \nAfghan partners who can institute rule of law and provide credible \ngovernment services. We must avoid situations like in Marja, where we \nopened the so-called government in a box and there was little \ngovernment.\n  Since last year, cooperation with Pakistan has improved perhaps more \nthan any other area. In April 2009, the military began an extensive \noperation targeting the Pakistani Taliban beginning in the Swat Valley \nand extending into South Waziristan. These operations, coupled with \nhigh-profile arrests of Pakistani Taliban leadership, were positive \ndevelopments. But there is no question that Pakistan--and especially \nthe Pakistani intelligence service--could do more to target the Afghan \nTaliban and other extremists operating along the border in North \nWaziristan.\n  More than any other factor, however, corruption at every level of the \nAfghan Government and distrust between the U.S. and President Karzai \nare undermining our chances for success. This is the elephant in the \nroom, which cannot\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nbe ignored. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to corruption, or deal \nwith it only at the local level. Rule of law must be instituted from \nthe top, and we will not succeed if corrupt officials escape justice.\n  Since last year, this is the one area where there has been no \nprogress. To the contrary, the Afghan Government has continued to \nderail corruption investigations led by Afghan institutions, such as \nthe Major Crimes Task Force and the Special Investigative Unit. This \nsituation has worsened in recent months, as demonstrated by the recent \ncase of Mohammad Salehi, an aide to President Karzai who was arrested \nfor soliciting bribes. President Karzai personally intervened to secure \nSalehi's release despite the fact that his arrest was ordered by the \nAfghan Attorney General and the investigation surrounding the charges \nagainst him was Afghan-led.\n  As the administration prepares for a December review of its strategy, \nI am deeply concerned that the debate has changed from reducing \ncorruption to determining how much corruption can be tolerated. Reports \nindicate that the administration has considered focusing on lower level \ncorruption as opposed to that which stems from the top. Make no \nmistake, just as the ``fish rots from the head,'' the root of the \nproblem stems from Kabul. This has been clearly demonstrated by the \ndecisions to release corrupt officials, which have been personally made \nby President Karzai.\n  Corruption in Afghanistan is a continuum, and we must address the \nproblem at both ends of the spectrum. It is a fallacy to think we can \ndelineate a clear line between corruption at the highest level and the \nlocal level, or that we can address this issue without dealing with \nPresident Karzai. National and subnational incidents are of equal \nimportance and must be confronted at the same time if we are to be \nsuccessful.\n  In the midst of the debate about the best way to tackle corruption, \nconcerns have been raised about Afghan sovereignty. Fighting corruption \nand protecting Afghan sovereignty are not mutually exclusive, and \ncombating corruption does not necessarily impede on Afghan sovereignty.\n  As someone once said, we cannot want to win this more than the \nAfghans want to win it themselves. To the contrary, the two most \nsignificant bodies for investigations--the Major Crimes Task Force and \nthe Special Investigative Unit--are housed in the Afghan Interior \nMinistry, and they operate with only minimal U.S. involvement apart \nfrom advising.\n  While it may be unrealistic to eliminate corruption completely, we \nmust demonstrate that we are committed to doing so. And at the moment, \nwe are moving in the wrong direction. We must measure and assess levels \nof corruption using a standardized metric to demonstrate that we are on \nan upward trajectory as we move toward the July 2011 drawdown date.\n  The recent establishment of three U.S.-led task forces to deal with \ncorruption in Kabul is a good idea, but it is a tacit acknowledgement \nthat our current strategy is not working. Now that the task forces have \nbeen created by the State Department and DOD, coordination and \nimplementation of a common strategy are key. At the same time, these \ntask forces are worth nothing--they are worth nothing--if Karzai \nreleases corrupt officials or stands in the way of prosecutions. As we \napproach July, the Karzai government must demonstrate it is willing to \narrest, detain, prosecute, and punish those who are caught red-handed.\n  The war in Afghanistan is critically important and worth fighting. If \nwe leave, al-Qaida and other terrorist groups will reconstitute and \nonce again find safe haven in Afghanistan, which will undoubtedly \nincrease the threat to the homeland. American lives are at risk, and we \nmust do everything in our power to defend our national security \ninterests and ensure al-Qaida does not return to Afghanistan.\n  That said, let me be clear on two critically important points. First, \nwe must remain dedicated to a top-to-bottom review of the entire \nAfghanistan campaign this December. Anything less would be a \ndisingenuous attempt to sidestep the hard questions that linger about \nthis exceedingly difficult foreign policy issue. Second, and most \nimportant, the December review must assess whether the Karzai \ngovernment is genuinely committed to detaining and prosecuting corrupt \nofficials who are brought before the courts, regardless of their family \nand political connections. Additional findings to the contrary gravely \nthreaten our prospects for long-term success.\n  At the end of the day, we have to ask whether the Afghan people will \nchoose the Afghan Government over the Taliban when we begin \ntransferring security and governmental responsibilities to the Kabul \ngovernment next year. Given that rampant graft and corruption is the \ntop concern of Afghan citizens who were polled--ranked even above their \nown security--the answer to that question will be no unless the Karzai \ngovernment gets serious about this debilitating and rampant problem.\n  This is what defines, more than anything else, our long-term success. \nAnd we should not continue--I cannot emphasize this enough--we should \nnot continue to put our brave young men and women in harm's way unless \nwe are pursuing a strategy that we believe has a reasonable chance of \nsuccess.\n  This is the litmus test, and we must confront it head-on in December. \nAs stewards of America's treasure, both in terms of resources and \nAmerican servicemembers' lives, we owe the American people and our \ndistinguished fighting force nothing less. And the American people \ndeserve no less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3816 \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 578, \n     S. 3816, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     create American jobs and to prevent the offshoring of such \n     jobs overseas.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I start to speak, it is my \nunderstanding I have 30 minutes for our side and I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Dorgan be recognized immediately after my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to tell my colleagues why I think \nthe bill before us, S. 3816, is not a good approach. This bill is being \nsold as somehow having the potential to create American jobs, but it \nwould likely have the exact opposite effect. It would lead to a net \ndecrease in American jobs. For that reason, I encourage my colleagues \nto vote against this bill.\n  The bill has three key aspects: a payroll tax holiday for employers \nhiring U.S. workers to replace foreign workers; a denial of business \ndeduction for any costs associated with moving operations offshore; and \nlastly, ending deferral for income of foreign subsidiaries for \nimporting goods into the United States. This last provision, according \nto my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is the principal issue \nof the three, and from that standpoint, in my opposition, I agree. It \ncertainly is the most dangerous, so that is the one I wish to address \nin detail.\n  To understand this partial repeal of deferral, it is best to consider \nthe topic of deferral more generally and then we can consider this \nparticular idea in context.\n  The term ``deferral'' refers to how U.S. corporations pay U.S. income \ntaxes on foreign earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, only when those \nearnings are repatriated to the United States. That is, the U.S. tax is \ndeferred until the earnings are paid by means of dividend back to the \nU.S. parent corporation. Deferral is not a new policy.\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nRather, it has been a feature of the tax law since 1918.\n  President Kennedy proposed outright repeal of deferral, but the then-\nDemocratic Congress did not agree with him. Instead, the Congress and \nthe President compromised. The compromise was this: For the passive \nkinds of income such as interest, dividends, royalties, and the like \nearned by a foreign subsidiary, the U.S. parent company would pay \nimmediate U.S. tax whether or not the foreign subsidiary sent the \nearnings back to the parent. However, for active business income of the \nforeign subsidiary, there would be no U.S. tax until the foreign \nsubsidiary sent such money to the parent corporation.\n  In short, the compromise during the Kennedy era was this: For passive \nincome, deferral was repealed. For active income, deferral was still \nallowed. That compromise is embodied in subpart (f) of the Internal \nRevenue Code. That compromise was hammered out in 1962 and, with slight \ntweaks at the margin, that compromise has stayed in place for the last \n48 years.\n  The compromise struck in the John F. Kennedy administration was the \nright one. Passive income is easy to move from one jurisdiction to \nanother. If a U.S. corporation had a lot of interest income, it was \nvery easy to instead have the foreign subsidiary earn such interest \nincome in a low tax jurisdiction. So when interest income was earned by \na foreign subsidiary of a U.S. parent corporation, there was a high \nlikelihood that it was earned in the foreign jurisdiction out of \nmotivation for the sole purpose of avoiding the U.S. tax. But with \nactive business income, there are usually legitimate nontax business \nreasons for the income to be earned overseas. The reason a U.S. car \ncompany sells cars in Hong Kong is not out of some desire to avoid U.S. \ntax but, rather, out of a desire to sell cars to customers that live in \nHong Kong.\n  So the underlying rationale to the subpart (f) compromise is this: If \nthere is a high likelihood that a particular type of income is earned \noverseas out of a desire to avoid U.S. tax, then deferral will not be \nallowed. If there is not a significant likelihood of that, then \ndeferral will still be allowed.\n  This is a very sensible rationale that was agreed to during President \nKennedy's administration in the 1960s, because one of the most \nfundamental tax principles of all this is transactions should not be \ntax motivated but should be motivated by business or other nontax \nreasons. Tax motivated transactions should not be allowed the benefits \nof the favorable tax treatment sought. This fundamental tax principle \nprevents the tax laws from distorting decisionmaking and from \ndistorting the economy. And the bill that is now before the Senate \ncalled the ``runaway plant'' bill cannot be justified by any similar \nrationale. They say they want to repeal deferral for foreign \nsubsidiaries having income from importing goods back into the United \nStates. But are they claiming that when a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. \ncompany imports back into the United States, there is a high likelihood \nthat the production of the good would have been in the United States \nbut for the motivation to avoid U.S. tax? They would have to be \nclaiming that, if they wanted to be consistent with a half century of \nreasons why certain specific limitations on deferral have been \njustified.\n  But that simply can't be. There are numerous nontax reasons for \nhaving a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. parent company import goods into \nthe United States, and I will mention a few. One reason could be that \nthere is only small demand for the product back in the United States as \ncompared to the overseas markets. For example, diesel engine cars are \nvery popular in Europe, comprising 50 percent of all car sales. Here in \nthe United States, diesel engine cars are well less than 10 percent of \nall car sales. So there is a very good reason for having diesel engine \ncars made in Europe and not here. Nonetheless, the bill before the \nSenate acts as if the reason these cars are not made here is because of \nour tax laws.\n  It may be that some items simply aren't found in appreciable \nquantities in the United States. For example, there is no diamond \nmining or chromium mining to speak of in the United States. A U.S. \nparent mining corporation with a foreign subsidiary engaged in diamond \nmining or chromium mining where such diamonds or chrome are imported \ninto the United States may find deferral repealed. This could be true \nto the extent that the parent had any domestic restructuring at the \nsame time it started up any foreign operations. But obviously the \nreason for the diamond and chrome mining outside the United States is \nnot tax avoidance. The reason is those minerals are not found here \nwithin the United States. So I wish the sponsors of this bill to make \nclear whether minerals not found in the United States and imported into \nthe United States would be included in this proposal.\n  I wish also to know whether this proposal would have applied to the \nFord Motor Company's ownership of Volvo. Ford owned Volvo cars from \n1999 to 2008. During that time, many Volvos were made in Sweden and \nimported into the United States for sale. If the acquisition had \nhappened after the date of enactment, deferral would be denied in this \nsituation, at least to the extent that Ford may have been shutting down \nany plants in the United States. However, no one can seriously claim \nthat the reason the cars were made in Sweden rather than in the United \nStates was from the desire to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Keep in mind that another foreign car company--let's say Volkswagen--\nwould not be treated the same way Ford's Volvo car income would be \ntreated. Volkswagen would be better off taxwise on competing auto sales \ninto the United States market over Ford's Volvo, thanks to this bill, \nif it were to pass.\n  There are lots of nontax reasons for having foreign subsidiaries of \nU.S. companies import into the United States. But it seems that the \nbill before the Senate does not recognize that fact, or maybe it \ndoesn't care. Perhaps the bill is motivated not by a desire to curb \ntax-motivated transactions but by something else. Perhaps the bill has \nan anti-free trade motivation. Perhaps the bill is attempting to make \nit more difficult for American companies to conduct business outside of \nour country. Whatever the case, the bill's sponsors should make the \nrationale clear--is it to curb tax avoidance or something else?\n  Perhaps the bill's sponsors will admit that the bill has nothing to \ndo with curbing U.S. tax avoidance. Perhaps they will say that it \ninstead has to do with preserving and creating U.S. jobs. But if that \nis their position, that cannot be right. In some limited circumstances, \nperhaps it would increase employment in the United States, although \nprobably mostly for tax lawyers than anybody else. But whatever the \ncase, the net effect would be to decrease employment in the United \nStates.\n  Allow me to explain why the net effect of the bill would be to \ndecrease U.S. employment.\n  First of all, if a U.S. parent company has a foreign subsidiary, then \nthis creates managerial headquarters jobs in the United States that \nwould otherwise not be here. The bill before us might encourage \nAmerican companies to simply sell off their foreign subsidiaries. This \nwould, in turn, mean laying off employees in management positions at \nthe American headquarters.\n  A bigger way this bill would hurt employment in the United States \nwould be to discourage assembly jobs in the United States. A U.S. \nparent company could have foreign subsidiaries engage in manufacturing \nparts that are shipped back to the U.S. parent. The U.S. parent, in \nturn, might assemble those parts here in the United States into a \nfinished product. So, yes, maybe this bill would encourage the company \nto repatriate the parts production, but it is just as easy to imagine \nthat this bill would encourage the company to expatriate the assembly \njobs. So this bill is an unacceptable gamble with American jobs.\n  In the words of the late Senator Moynihan, who preceded me and \nSenator Baucus as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee--he spoke in \nopposition to this proposal 14 years ago, so this issue has been around \nthis body for a period of time. He said this: ``Investment abroad that \nis not tax driven is good for the United States.''\n  Senator Baucus's concern that this would put the United States at a \ncompetitive disadvantage is exactly right. I don't have the exact quote \nof Senator Baucus, but it was in Congress Daily\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nrecently. I am sorry I don't have that quote for my colleagues.\n  Senator Baucus very rightly states it. Phil Morrison, the Treasury \nDepartment's international tax counsel, criticized this proposal in \ncongressional testimony 19 years ago. Mr. Morrison noted that the bill \nwould be very hard to administer and that it departed from the \ntraditional focus of the limited areas where deferral is denied.\n  As President Clinton's international tax counsel, Joe Guttentag, \nexplained in 1995, during the Clinton administration:\n\n       Current U.S. tax policy generally strikes a reasonable \n     balance between deferral and current taxation in order to \n     ensure that our tax laws do not interfere with the ability of \n     our companies to be competitive with their foreign-based \n     counterparts.\n\n  This proposal has been made year after year for 20 years. I ask that \nmy colleagues again reject it, in an effort to keep American companies \nglobally competitive, to protect American jobs, and to preserve the \nunderlying rationale of why deferral should only be denied in limited \ncircumstances.\n  Finally, I wish to briefly comment on one other aspect of the bill--\nthe payroll tax holiday. This, too, has provisions that will be \ndifficult to administer. For example, do foreign workers actually have \nto be fired to have their employer get the payroll tax holiday in the \nUnited States or do they need only to be reassigned job roles?\n  This provision only scores, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, as costing $1 billion. Let's make sure we are clear on this \npoint. The other side is seriously considering raising taxes on small \nbusinesses--the lead creator of jobs--by tens of billions of dollars by \nletting top individual tax rates go back up in the year 2011. But in an \neffort to support job creation, they offer this $1 billion payroll tax \nholiday.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 50 percent of small \nbusiness flowthrough income will be hit by a marginal tax hike of \nsomewhere between 17 percent, on the low end, and 24 percent, on the \nhigh end. That tax increase is scheduled to hit these job-creating \nsmall businesses in just a little over 3 months. Finance Committee \nRepublican tax staff calculates the effect of that tax hike to be 50 \ntimes the benefit provided by this bill. On our side, we don't see the \nlogic of raising $50 in taxes and providing a complicated tax benefit \nof just $1.\n  Why aren't we dealing with the real problem for the folks responsible \nfor creating 70 percent of American jobs? Of course, that is small \nbusiness. We ought to take time out on the tax hit that is coming to \nsmall business this December. That is what we ought to be debating on \nthe Senate floor.\n  But the Democratic leadership would rather spend valuable time \ntalking about a bill that is artfully politically labeled a jobs bill. \nGiven that the bill will lead to a net loss in American jobs, it seems \nthere might be a truth-in-labeling claim against the Democratic \nleadership.\n  Let's have votes on real job creation incentives and get out of this \ngamesmanship. Let's do the people's business and forestall the big tax \nhike coming at American small business.\n  I also wish to take some time to address the issue of the estate tax, \nwhich is going to expire at the end of this year, at the very same \ntime.\n  The majority party has had control of the Senate since January 3, \n2007. That is 3 years, 8 months, and 24 days ago.\n  During the 3\\1/2\\ years of Democratic control, my colleagues have had \nan opportunity to address the death tax.\n  More pointedly, the Democratic leadership had a duty to provide \ncertainty in the law as it relates to the estate tax.\n  My colleagues have had the duty to address the fact that this ill-\nconceived tax will snap back to pre-2001 law on January 1, 2011.\n  That is only a little over 3 months away. To be exact, it is 3 months \nand 5 days from now.\n  Unfortunately, as this chart shows, the estate tax is not the only \npiece of long overdue tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, the practice of ``good government'' is providing \ncertainty in the law.\n  What I mean is, our country is made up of law-abiding citizens. As \nlegislators, we were hired by these law-abiding citizens to make the \nlaw.\n  When we fail to provide certainty in the law, we fail to do our jobs.\n  But despite the fact that the Democratic leadership has not acted in \nover 3\\1/2\\ years we still have 3 months before the estate tax reverts \nback to a 55-percent tax rate and a $1 million exemption amount. So \nCongress still has time to act.\n  But I am skeptical that the Democratic leadership will indeed act.\n  Why? Because when my friends on the other side of the aisle were in \nthe minority earlier in this decade, they blocked--let me repeat \nblocked--Republican efforts to make permanent an estate tax law that \nlaw-abiding citizens all across America could rely on.\n  The first effort was made in 2002. Specifically, on June 12, 2002, \nthe Democratic leadership blocked legislation that would have \npermanently repealed the estate tax.\n  In 2004, Republicans in the House of Representatives approved a bill \nthat would have permanently repealed the estate tax. But due to \nmaneuvering by the Democratic leadership, a vote in the Senate was \nnever allowed to occur.\n  Finally, in 2006, Republicans offered a compromise proposal on the \nestate tax. Under that compromise, the estate tax unified credit \nexemption would have gradually been increased to $5 million. The rate \nwould have also been phased in to a 30-percent tax rate.\n  But again, the Democratic leadership filibustered the proposal to its \ndeath.\n  Mr. President, I believe on our side were practicing good government \nas it relates to the estate tax.\n  We were doing our jobs, and providing certainty in the law.\n  Yet the Democratic leadership stymied the practice of good \ngovernment.\n  To this day, the Democratic leadership continues to stymie efforts to \nprovide certainty in the law.\n  So why is the estate tax being held hostage?\n  Because a number of liberal leaning Senators would be satisfied if \nthe estate tax reverted back to pre-2001 law--that is, a 55-percent tax \nrate and a $1 million unified credit exemption amount.\n  And why wouldn't they? There is $233 billion in extra revenue to \nspend.\n  Also, in this hyperpartisan environment that is plaguing the Senate, \nmany policymakers are politicizing the estate tax issue.\n  What do I mean?\n  A number of Senators have taken to the Senate floor and characterized \na reasonable estate tax rate as a ``give-away'' to the rich.\n  These Senators also argue that if the estate tax is ratcheted up to a \n55-percent tax rate, we could use that revenue to reduce the deficit.\n  I respect every Senator's opinion, but I question whether these \nmembers are actually going to use this revenue to reduce the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen my friends' desire to spend, spend, \nspend. Increasing the deficit one dollar at a time. Not the other way \naround.\n  I will acknowledge that due to the budget rules that we must live by \nhere in the Senate, making permanent an estate tax regime at a tax rate \nlower than a 55 percent will result in revenue loss to the government.\n  For example, my friend Congressman Pomeroy--a Democratic Congressman \nfrom North Dakota--sponsored a bill to make permanent the estate tax at \na 45-percent tax rate and a $3.5 million unified credit exemption \namount.\n  When you compare this proposal against what the estate tax would \nrevert to in 2011--a 55 percent tax rate and $1 million exemption--you \nfind that this change in the law would cost around $233 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Now, when you compare $233 billion to the $2.5 trillion health care \nreform bill that was recently signed into law, it is a drop in the \nbucket.\n  Also, compare this to our $13 trillion national debt.\n  But $233 billion is nothing to sneeze at.\n  While it could be used to reduce the deficit, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have made every indication that they will \nsimply spend this money.\n  My colleagues on the other side will gloss over their plans to spend, \nand instead attack any proposal that includes a tax rate lower than 55-\npercent as a ``give-away'' to the rich.\n  I have some news for my colleagues. A large number of Americans who\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nwould be impacted by a 55-percent tax rate and a $1 million unified \ncredit exemption are not ``rich.''\n  Let me repeat that. Those taxpayers that would be impacted by the \nestate tax if it reverted back to pre-2001 levels are not wealthy \npeople.\n  I would like to take a moment and provide my colleagues with a real \nworld example of an Iowan who would not consider herself ``rich.''\n  Recently, I received an email from Landi McFarland, who is a sixth \ngeneration Iowa farmer.\n  This is what Landi had to say about the impact of the estate tax and \nher ability to continue the family farm:\n\n       . . . As a 6th generation Iowa farmer whose family \n     homesteaded land in Union county 154 years ago, I have \n     concerns about current estate tax law. I am 26 years old and \n     have a dream of pursuing a future in agriculture, the same as \n     the generations that have come before me.\n       I currently raise Angus cattle with my parents and \n     grandparents, where we are tax-paying citizens and supporters \n     of our local economy and schools. My grandparents are both 84 \n     years old, and own about 90 percent of the land, cattle, and \n     equipment on our farm. Their combined estates will total \n     approximately $7 million (the vast majority of this being \n     farm assets like land and cattle). Recent land values have \n     escalated the values of my grandparents' estate.\n       This rise in land values, however, does not increase the \n     value of what the land produces (Angus cattle sell for the \n     same price no matter if the land is valued at $1000 or $4000 \n     per acre).\n       If my grandparents pass away AFTER 2010, and current estate \n     tax laws are not fixed, my family will not be able to afford \n     to pay the estate taxes without liquidating the herd and \n     selling a large portion of the farm ground. This will put an \n     end to our business that we love, and hence and end to our \n     support of local businesses through daily business \n     operations.\n       In the last four years, my family has worked on estate \n     planning to try to help ease the burden of estate tax. This \n     includes taking advantage of the $12,000 tax-free gifting \n     each grandparent can do per person per year.\n       However, this only amounts to a total gifting of $48,000 \n     per year, a drop in the bucket for a combined $7 million \n     estate.\n       We are one of the oldest Angus operations in the country, \n     and is all we wish to do is continue our family business that \n     has been built with our own blood, sweat and tears over the \n     past years. If current estate tax laws are not fixed, there \n     will be thousands of small family businesses like ours put \n     out of business. We need a SENSIBLE and PERMANENT fix.\n       Thanks for your help,\n       --Landi\n\n  Mr. President, Landi's story is not unique to her. There are more \nfarmers like her in Iowa and around the country.\n  I want to talk more broadly now about how failing to address the \nestate tax sunset will affect Iowa farmers.\n  Over the past few years, farm prices have been escalating \ndramatically. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. \nfarm prices have nearly doubled in the last decade.\n  While recent economic troubles have led to home prices dropping, this \nhas not been the case for farmland. In fact, as reported in a recent LA \nTimes article, Wall Street investors have actually turned to purchasing \nfarmland in hopes of finding refuge from an unstable stock market. This \nin turn has pushed farm prices higher. Based on a recent survey by the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Iowa farm prices are up 8 percent in \nthe past year alone.\n  Why is this discussion of escalating farm prices significant?\n  Because this means that should the estate tax law revert to 2001 law, \nmany farmers are going to be surprised to discover they will be \nconsidered ``rich.''\n  Now, I am not talking about wealthy corporate farmers, I am talking \nabout many family farmers, just like Landi, who are taking over a farm \nthat has been passed down for generations.\n  Mr. President, let me walk my friends through some data.\n  In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that there were \n92,800 farms in Iowa.\n  In 2007, the average Iowa farm was 331 acres.\n  According to a survey conducted by Iowa State University, in 2009 the \naverage acre was worth $4,371.\n  Let's do some simple math. If we multiplied the average acreage of an \nIowa farm--which was 331 acres as reported in 2007--by the average cost \nper acre in 2009--which was $4,371 in 2009--we find that the average \nIowa farm is worth $1.4 million.\n  Mr. President, $1.4 million exceeds the $1 million unified credit \nexemption amount that would be in place on January 1, 2011, if Congress \ndoes not act.\n  Admittedly, the value of a farmer's farmland does not tell us \nconclusively whether or not the farmer will be subject to the estate \ntax. Farmers sometimes carry debt. That would reduce the value of the \nfarm. But they also have assets, including equipment and bank accounts, \nthat would increase the value of the estate.\n\n  Let me shift gears and provide my friends with some national \nstatistics.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has told us out of 92,700 estates of \npeople dying in 2011, 49,000 of these estates would be taxable under \nthe 55-percent rate and $1 million exemption. If the law were changed \nto a 35-percent tax rate and $5 million exemption amount, for example, \n3,900 estates would be taxable. That is a ratio of 13 to 1.\n  For every one estate that would be taxable under a 35-percent and $5 \nmillion estate tax regime, a whopping 13 estates would be taxable if \nthe law reverted to a 55-percent rate and $1 million exemption.\n  Even if the rate were set at 45 percent and an exemption amount of \n$3.5 million, this ratio is 8 to 1. That is, for every one estate that \nwould be taxed under the 45-percent rate, with the $3.5 million \nexemption, eight estates would be taxable under the 55-percent rate and \n$1 million exemption if we do not change the law.\n  I will conclude this way. Let's now look at farmers who would be \naffected. Based on the Joint Committee on Taxation in 2011, 3,200 farms \nwould be taxed if the law included a $1 million exemption amount. \nCompare that to 300 farms that would be taxable if the exemption was \n$3.5 million.\n  That means the result of no action will be that 10 times as many \nfamily farms will be hit by the death tax. The time for action on the \nestate tax is now, not a month from now or 3 months from now. We owe it \nto the farmers and small business owners and their young heirs to give \nthem certainty. We need to give to the tax lawyers and consultants who \nadvise people on their estate planning some certainty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe by consent I am to be recognized \nfor 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have heard a couple of very spirited \ndefenses this afternoon on behalf of jobs in China, which I pose is a \nwonderful thing if you live in China and have a job in China. The issue \nhere is what about jobs in our country. What about the people who woke \nup this morning unemployed in America looking for work who could not \nfind it? Who is standing on this floor speaking for those folks?\n  I have heard a lot of discussion about support for jobs in China, \nMexico, or elsewhere. But who is standing up talking about the jobs at \nhome?\n  Let me describe what this issue is about, if I may.\n  I think this issue is something most Americans understand because \nthey have heard it over and over. In recent years, we have seen \nmillions and millions of manufacturing jobs gone from America because \nthe very manufacturing plants that were open in this country to \nmanufacture goods that had a label on it that said made in America are \ngone from America. They are now in China, they are in Mexico, they are \nin Thailand, they are in South Korea, and elsewhere. Let me talk about \nthose jobs and why they have left this country.\n  Listening to my colleagues--and, of course, the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, all of the usual suspects \nwho get in the same tub and make the same thumping sounds--one would \nbelieve that what has happened is that we have actually increased \nmanufacturing jobs in this country and that moving American jobs \noverseas does not hurt anybody; it helps our country. Of course, that \nis just patently untrue.\n  My colleagues were talking about something called deferral. That is \nnot something people sit around a coffee shop talking about--deferral. \nIt means, in certain cases under this bill, those companies that shut \ntheir American manufacturing plant, get rid of all\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\ntheir workers, and move the manufacturing to China or Mexico, for \nexample--let's take China--actually get a tax break from our country \nthat says if they are on one side of the street and their competitor is \non the other side of the street, and they close their plant, fire their \nworkers, scat out of town, go to China, hire people there, manufacture \nthe same product, ship it back here, their country will be generous \nenough to say: Good for you, we will give you a tax break for doing it. \nThat is what is called a deferral.\n  In the narrow scope of what is in this amendment they object to, \ndeferral says if they leave this country with their jobs, shut them \ndown here, move over there, manufacture there with foreign workers, and \nthen ship the product back into this country to compete against the \nbusiness men and women who stayed here, who manufacture here, who \nemploy people here, they are not going to get a tax cut anymore. It is \njust not going to happen.\n  My colleagues say we have to have this principle called deferral. \nWhat about having every American have the opportunity for deferral? How \nabout every American having the opportunity to defer their income taxes \nuntil it is more convenient for them? No, not everybody gets these \nthings. Just the interests at the very top.\n  Then when we tried to narrow it a little bit because it gives a \npernicious incentive to move jobs overseas, we have people standing up \nsaying: We support those companies that are moving American jobs \noverseas. We support those jobs in China. God forbid you want to \ninterrupt this process.\n  My colleague says: In 1962, there was this carefully crafted tax \nagreement on deferral--48 years ago. Do not interrupt that after 48 \nyears. We made this careful agreement 48 years ago.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what has happened since then. I have shown \nthis on the Senate floor before. In the last 48 years, the tax system \nhas changed a little bit. This is a five-story white house on Church \nStreet in the Cayman Islands called the Ugland House. The first time I \nshowed this chart--by the way, this is enterprising reporting by David \nEvans from Bloomberg--there were 12,748 companies in this building. It \nis only a five-story small white building on Church Street in the \nCayman Islands. It was inhabited by 12,748 corporations. A little \ncrowded, I would say. Were they there? No, they just got their mail \nthere. Why did they get their mail there? So they could slip under the \nAmerican Tax Code and not pay taxes to the U.S. Government.\n  When I first showed this chart some years ago, it was 12,748 \ncorporations. But there was room for more. Now there are 18,857 \nentities that call this building home. Is that unbelievable? They must \nenjoy each other's company, or at least their mail must fraternize.\n  Mr. President, more than 18,000 companies claim that little building. \nWe made this careful agreement in 1962 on deferral? How dare you deal \nwith the Tax Code in a way that you would upend that 1962 agreement. \nEverything has changed. There is not a ghost of a chance in 1962 that \nAmerican companies would have even thought of trying something that \naudacious--just gather together in a mailbox in a white building \nsomeplace to avoid paying your obligation to this country.\n  I have shown this as well. Wachovia Bank (formerly First Union Bank) \nbought a sewage system in Bochum, Germany. Why? Did they have sewage \nspecialists on their staff? I don't think so. Did they put out \ntelevision advertisements: Come do business with Wachovia Bank because \nwe know about sewers or we want to buy sewers in foreign cities? No, \nthey did this to avoid paying U.S. taxes. This is Wachovia Bank. They \ndid not pay $175 million in U.S. taxes because they bought a sewage \nsystem from a German city.\n  Did they move the sewage pipes? No. Do they know anything about \nsewers? No. They bought it from the German city and leased it back so \nthey could depreciate it and not have to pay U.S. taxes. Unbelievable.\n  The Tax Code has changed, I say to my friends. It is a punch board of \ngimmicks allowing people to do things they could not previously have \ndone before, and the most significant enterprise is to move American \nmanufacturing jobs overseas and get a tax break for doing it.\n\n  This amendment is very misunderstood based on the discussions by the \ntwo previous speakers. There is discussion on the floor of the Senate \nabout what is the motivation for moving jobs overseas--to serve, for \nexample, a foreign constituency; want to move jobs to China to be able \nto sell into Thailand or Korea. The tax deferral piece of this \namendment does not affect you. You can win that argument we are not \nhaving, if you wish, but you are misstating what the amendment \nsuggests. The deferral part of this amendment does not do anything of \nthe kind.\n  This amendment is narrow--narrower than I would have it, as a matter \nof fact. But it says if you are going to get rid of your American \nworkers, close your plant, move those jobs elsewhere, and then ship \nback into this country to compete with the American businesses that \nstayed here, you do not get the advantage of deferring the payment of \nU.S. taxes. It is just very simple.\n  The question today is not just who is going to stand up for American \njobs on this floor, who is going to stand up for American businesses \nthat stayed here, manufactured here, hired workers here, paid the rent \nhere, who is going to stand here and support that? I have not heard it \nyet.\n  Let me go through some points. Before I do, let me mention one other \nthing. One of my colleagues just said: There are some things you cannot \nmake here. So if you make them abroad, we do not want to punish you in \nour Tax Code from selling them in this country.\n  They previously used bananas. I want my colleagues to understand, we \nactually have a banana exemption. We do not actually spell out bananas, \nbut because the specter of fruit was raised the last time this was \ndiscussed, we included a banana exemption.\n  Of course, we do not grow bananas in the United States. If somebody \nships them back here, they will not be affected by this amendment \neither.\n  There are a lot of points raised that have nothing at all to do with \nwhat we are describing in terms of public policy.\n  Let me go through a few items. Some people may not know this. I \ndescribed previously in unsuccessful attempts to try to do what we are \ndoing that in New Jersey, there are a lot of folks who loved their jobs \nand they worked for a company call Fig Newton. Some actually shoveled \nfig paste. By the way, the company's name was Nabisco, which stands for \nNational Biscuit Company. But it was not quite so national because \nNabisco, the National Biscuit Company, decided the pay they had to \nprovide for people to shovel fig paste in New Jersey was way out of \nline, so they just took Fig Newtons right off to Mexico. If you want \nMexican food, buy some Fig Newtons. It goes on and on. The list is so \nlong.\n  I want to mention, as I have mentioned before, some of these same \nstories because it is important to understand what motivates people who \nwant to stand up for American jobs.\n  Pennsylvania House Furniture--I was in Pennsylvania this weekend--was \nmade in this country for over 100 years with fine Pennsylvania wood. It \nwas a wonderful company making high-end furniture. One day it was sold \nto La-Z-Boy. La-Z-Boy decided: We are going to move Pennsylvania House \nFurniture to China, and we are going to ship Pennsylvania wood to China \nand have Chinese workers put the wood together and ship it back to be \nsold in the United States. It had nothing to do with whether the folks \nat Pennsylvania House Furniture were slothful, indolent workers not \ndoing their job. It had nothing to do with that.\n  What it had to do with is La-Z-Boy did not want to manufacture \nPennsylvania House Furniture in the United States. They wanted to \nacquire 50-cent an hour labor, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week in China.\n  On the last day at work at the Pennsylvania House Furniture \nmanufacturing company, these craftsmen--nearly 500 craftsmen--as the \nlast piece of furniture came off the line, they turned the cabinet \nover, and then they all gathered round to sign their name on the bottom \nof the cabinet. These wonderful American craftsmen signed that cabinet. \nSomebody has a piece of furniture they are probably not aware has all \nthe names of those workers who were fired as those jobs went to China.\n  Why did they do that? Because they cared about their jobs and were \nproud\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\nof their work, but they could not compete with 50-cent-an-hour labor.\n  Stanley Furniture in Virginia is a furniture company that was started \nby Tom Stanley, a young dairy farmer in Virginia. He started it in a \ncity that now is named Stanleytown. A couple of months ago, it was \ndecided that Stanleytown was going to have some pretty bad news. \nStanleytown was going to find out that these jobs were no longer going \nto be in Stanleytown. Stanley Furniture, another fine furniture \nmanufacturer, was going to China.\n  Let me read from the Journal of Commerce of this year:\n\n       Stanley Furniture's decision to close its plant in the \n     small town that bears its name fell like a hammer blow on \n     southern Virginia and resounded across an industry, \n     increasingly now moving overseas. More than 500 workers will \n     lose their jobs this year as the manufacturer shuts down \n     its Stanleytown, VA, plant, where the company has made \n     furniture since 1924.\n\n  So it goes--moving jobs overseas. Let me, if I might, go through a \ncouple of others.\n  I notice the Hershey company--speaking of Pennsylvania--Hershey \ncompany's York Peppermint Pattie is that silver pattie with the \n``York'' in the middle and the advertisement that says: ``The cool, \nrefreshing taste of mint dipped in dark chocolate will take you miles \naway''--in this case, of course, to Mexico because Hershey decided it \nis time to move. So York Peppermint Pattie moves 260 jobs to Monterey, \nMexico--part of a longer term job strategy by Hershey, they said. Well, \nthat is a peppermint pattie. America's manufacturing strategy probably \ndoesn't depend on peppermint patties--who knows.\n  I have previously mentioned a series of American manufacturers, and I \nhave used this one often because they announced with great fanfare some \nyears ago that they were going to leave America altogether. Not another \npiece of underwear was going to be made by Fruit of the Loom in the \nUnited States. The dancing grapes, for all their advertisements, must \nhave been unhappy. Their advertisements were always happy and upbeat, \nwith guys dressed as grapes and such marching in the meadow. They can't \nhave been very happy when Fruit of the Loom said: We are not going to \nmake underwear in America anymore.\n  Radio Flyer's little red wagon. This was a 100-year-old company in \nChicago. All gone. Now made in Mexico.\n  Here is another company. I have been talking about this one for a \nlong time. Last week, my colleague from Ohio talked about this \ncompany--Huffy Bicycles. You can buy them at Walmart and Kmart and \nSears. They were made in Ohio--except, no more. No more. All those \nworkers lost their jobs. All those jobs are in China. All those jobs \nare done by people who make 50 cents an hour, working 7 days a week, 12 \nto 14 hours a day. Huffy said to the workers in Ohio: You know what, \nyou can't compete, so you are done. On the last day at work, where they \nparked their cars in the parking lot, those workers who were fired that \nday left a pair of empty shoes in the places where their cars were \nparked. It was the only thing they could do to say: You can move our \njobs to China, but you can never replace American workers.\n  So I could go on and on, but I want to describe what so many here in \nthis Chamber wish to ignore. This is a quote from Mr. Paul Craig \nRoberts, one of the top Treasury officials in the Reagan \nadministration. Here is what he said this year:\n\n       Outsourcing is rapidly eroding America's superpower status. \n     Only fools will continue clinging to the premise that \n     outsourcing is good for America.\n\n  Only fools will cling to that premise. And I agree with him.\n  Again, another quote from Mr. Paul Craig Roberts:\n\n       In order to penetrate and to serve foreign markets, U.S. \n     corporations need overseas operations. However, many U.S. \n     companies use foreign labor to manufacturer abroad the \n     products that they sell in American markets. If Henry Ford \n     had used Indian, Chinese, and Mexican workers to manufacturer \n     his cars, Indians, Chinese and Mexicans could possibly have \n     purchased Fords but not Americans.\n\n  Again, he is absolutely right. It seems to me the question is, Will \nAmerica remain a world-class economic power without a world-class \nmanufacturing capability? Does anybody really believe that could be the \ncase? You are going to decimate and erode a manufacturing base in this \ncountry and then say: Things will be just fine; don't worry about it. \nWe can all sell hamburgers to each other and things will be just great? \nWe know better than that. What is happening before our eyes is a \nhollowing out of America's manufacturing capability.\n  There is a lot of discussion about what do we do about jobs, what do \nwe do about trying to create new jobs in the country, and that has to \ndo with what is called the faucet. If we are trying to put new jobs in \nthe tub, they say, turn on the faucet. That is fine, and I support a \nrange of policies that try to turn on the faucet to create more jobs in \nthis country. But what about the open drain? As we work on the faucet, \nwhat about the drain, when Stanley Furniture says: Well, I know you are \ntrying to create jobs, but we are out of here; or Etch A Sketch in \nBryan, OH, says: Yeah, we know every kid plays with Etch A Sketch. We \nknow we have always made it in America. But we were told by Walmart \nthat if we couldn't produce it for $9.99 or less, they wouldn't sell \nit. If they don't sell it, we are out of business, so we are closing \ndown our plant and moving to China.\n  The list goes on and on. The question is, What do we do about all of \nthis? My colleagues--too many of them--say: Let's do nothing. Let's act \nas if nothing is really going on. In fact, let's come in here and say: \nYou know, we made an agreement in 1962 on some deferral tax issue, and \nlet's stick with it.\n  One of my colleagues earlier today said: You know, we have to worry \nabout American corporations because they pay some of the highest tax \nrates in the industrial world. Well, that is a little like Penn and \nTeller talking about fiscal policy, and only one speaks and the other \nis silent. It is true that our corporate tax rates, I believe second \nfrom the top of the OECD countries. But there is another truth. The \nother truth is that our corporations in America pay an effective tax \nrate that is right near the bottom. What is the difference? One is a \nstatutory rate--that is what the law says you should pay--and the other \nis how much you pay, which is right near the bottom. Why? Because we \nhave a punchboard of gimmicks to allow that to happen. I have described \na couple: American banks and other companies buying German sewer \nsystems, buying German railcar systems, streetcars, buying German city \nhalls for the purpose of sale-leasebacks so they can avoid paying taxes \nto the United States. It is pretty unbelievable, when you think about \nit.\n  The only reason I have mentioned some of the companies over the years \nwhen I have talked about this is to give them full credit for what they \nare trying to do. They and all their neighbors should understand that \nthey want all the benefits America has to offer, but they don't want to \nsign up for the responsibilities that exist for Americans, including an \nAmerican company.\n  I want our corporations to do well. I want American corporations to \nbe profitable. But I will tell you this: If you have two kinds of \ncorporations, and one decides to stay here and manufacture in our \ncountry and the other decides to take the jobs and move to a low-wage, \nlower tax alternative, I want to be helpful to that corporation that \nstays here, that hires workers here, that keeps the plant open here and \nis proud to put a made-in-America label on their product.\n  There is a company called HMC in this country that makes very \nsubstantial industrial products. You can see that this is a company \neveryone admires. Let me tell you what this corporate CEO has said. The \nCEO of HMC corporation, Robert Smith, said this:\n\n       Offshoring in search of higher profits is a mistake because \n     it ignores manufacturing's larger purpose in U.S. society.\n\n  Here is something else Mr. Robert Smith said, and I compliment him \nbecause you will find precious few who will say it.\n\n       It is my belief that every American citizen, not only me, \n     should feel strongly about maintaining one of the most \n     important cultures we have, and that is manufacturing. Now, \n     why is it important? Does anybody think we would have \n     prevailed in the Second World War without the prodigious \n     manufacturing capability of our country? If anybody is \n     interested in that, go read Manchester's ``The Glory and the \n     Dream'' and understand what we did and how we did it in \n     manufacturing war planes and ships and tanks and\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\n     trucks. We had the most unbelievable manufacturing capability \n     in the history of humankind.\n\n  Some say that none of this matters--why should we pick winners and \nlosers? If the marketplace says we manufacture products in China or \nMexico, if, in fact, we actually import more cars from Mexico than we \nexport to the entire rest of the world, so what? Don't worry, be happy. \nThat is the way the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants it, and it is what \nthe National Association of Manufacturers wants to have happen, \napparently--except I know of companies that belong to both those \norganizations that have called me and written to me and said that they \nare dead wrong. How about having a chamber in the U.S. Senate stand up \nfor American manufacturing?\n\n  I know that when I talk this way and when I say these things, there \nare people in this room--and the Washington Post would be a good \nexample--who will instantly say: Aha, I hear all that nonsense. This is \nabout protectionism. It is about America becoming protectionist and \nbuilding walls around its country to keep goods out.\n  Are you kidding me? Are they nuts when they talk that way? Last \nmonth, we had a $50 billion trade deficit in 1 single month. In a \nrecent year, we had a $750 billion trade deficit. You can make a \nplausible case that our fiscal policy budget deficit is what we owe to \nourselves. You can make that case, and we will pay it back to \nourselves. You can't make that case with a trade deficit. The trade \ndeficit is what we owe others in the world, and we will repay that with \na lower standard of living in this country inevitably.\n  The question is, When will we start to decide that this trade \nstrategy is not working? We are dealing with other countries that are \nengaged in managed trade, and yet we are saying it doesn't matter what \nhappens to us. It just doesn't matter.\n  We, by the way, spent a century doing what other countries wouldn't \nor couldn't--in most cases, couldn't--and we lifted up this country. We \nhad unbelievable battles.\n  The other day, I described the battle on workers' rights. In the \nfirst book I wrote, I described James Fyler. James Fyler was shot 54 \ntimes. I said--and I shouldn't have--that he died of lead poisoning. He \ndied because he was shot 54 times in 1917 in Ludlow, CO. He was shot \nbecause he believed that people who worked underground digging for coal \nought to work in a safe workplace and ought to be paid a fair wage. And \nfor that, he gave his life.\n  There are many things we have done over the past century that people \nhave died for to lift up standards in America, and now they are \nroutine--decent wages, fair labor standards, and safe workplaces. We \ndid all that. Other countries, in many cases, have not. So now the \nquestion is, Is it important for us to lift up others around the world \nor to allow ourselves to be pushed down in terms of the standards we \nhave created and fought for over a long, long time? To me, the answer \nis self-evident: Let's stand up for what this country has done.\n  I am all for helping others. I want to lift them up, create standards \nthat hopefully can mirror ours. I am not interested at all in having a \nHuffy Bicycle management team say to the Huffy workers in Ohio: If you \ncan't compete with China's wages and China's workers, you are out of \nwork, and we don't care what you think.\n  Well, the workers of Ohio said: You know what, we just can't live on \n50 cents an hour, and we can't work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday.\n  The law won't allow U.S. companies to hire kids, so the company said: \nThat is tough luck. You need to understand that it is a new world out \nthere. If you can't compete, you lose.\n  Well, this is a race to the bottom in terms of standards.\n  Some say: Well, we can innovate. We are the innovators, yes, that is \ntrue. I chair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and so I \nheld a hearing last week on counterfeiting and piracy. Do you know \nwhat? We innovate, and then we see it stolen. Intellectual property is \nstolen and produced elsewhere. It is always produced elsewhere. We \ninvented the television set--gone, produced elsewhere; computers--\nlargely produced elsewhere. I could go through a whole list.\n  The question is, What kind of a country do we want to have? For \nexample, we have done a lot of free-trade agreements. In fact, let me \ndo this. I want to just mention a free-trade agreement with South \nKorea, and I could go through all of the free-trade agreements and show \nhow unbelievably ignorant our country has been with respect to its own \neconomic self-interest. But let me give one example.\n  This chart shows the number of cars in South Korea. In South Korea, \n98 percent of the cars driven on the streets and roads are made in \nSouth Korea. Now, you might think that is really interesting, that they \nhave an appetite for buying those South Korean-made cars. It is not an \nappetite, it is what that country decides it wants. They do not want \nSouth Koreans to buy foreign cars, so 98 percent of the cars on their \nstreets are South Korean cars.\n  So let's talk about our relationship with South Korea, and it is \nthis: Last year, because we had a recession, we didn't sell as many \nSouth Korean cars in our country. At one point, it was close to 800,000 \na year. Last year, the South Koreans put 467,000 cars on ships and \nshipped them to America to be sold here in our country. That is \n467,000. Does anybody want to guess how many cars we could sell in \nKorea last year? Six thousand. So 467,000 to 6,000. Why? Because South \nKorea doesn't want us to sell American cars in South Korea, and they \nhave dozens of clever devices to stop it.\n  Our country negotiates a trade agreement with South Korea--guess \nwhat, they don't even mention the bilateral automobile problem, not \neven a word.\n  Our country did a bilateral agreement with China, a country with \nwhich we had a $200 billion trade deficit. We had a huge deficit with \nChina, biggest in the world. Here is what our country said. We said, on \nbilateral automobile trade we will do this: When you ship a Chinese car \nto the United States we will only impose a 2.5 percent tariff on your \ncar, but if we ship an American car to be sold in China, you may impose \na tariff of 25 percent. You may impose a tariff that is 10 times higher \nthan we would impose in bilateral relationship with a country with \nwhich we had a $200 billion trade deficit. If that is not defined as \nignorance, then I have missed the definition of ignorance.\n  Why wouldn't we step up for our economic interest? China, by the way, \nright now is ratcheting up a very aggressive automobile industry. You \nare going to see a lot of Chinese cars on the streets in this country \nin the years ahead.\n  But I rest my case. I mentioned automobiles. I could mention lots of \nother issues. I have written books about this. But the fact is, the \nissue before us today is not somebody coming here and saying, in the \n1962 agreement on deferral--or another speaker talking about how if you \nlet people go overseas there will be more jobs here at home.\n  Let me finally say, this issue of deferral is that in some cases \nthese companies know they never have to pay taxes. The reason? Because \nthey defer and defer on foreign profits. This amendment is only about \nif you have profits in a foreign subsidiary, from selling back into \nAmerica, into this marketplace. Some of them can leave to go overseas \nknowing they will get the advantage of deferral and pay lower taxes \nthan the company that stayed here, but they will get an even better \ndeal. If they hang, we will have somebody in one of these Chambers \nthumbing their suspenders and shuffling around and harrumphing about \nmaybe what we should do is say all of those people who have money \noverseas, let's let them bring it back here and pay a 5.25 percent tax \nrate. You say: Oh, they would never do that. Oh, they sure did. It is \nthe rest of the people who do not get to pay the 5.25 interest. It is \njust the biggest interests who closed their American companies and \nmoved their companies overseas and produced overseas after they got rid \nof their American workers. They were told in addition to getting a tax \nbreak for doing it, we want to give you something on top of that, the \ncherry on top of the sundae: If ever you do bring it back, you get to \npay a tax rate that is one-half of the lowest tax rate that the lowest \nincome American has to pay. What an unbelievable deal.\n  Let me say, as I started, if ever someone wishes to hear the \nstrongest defense possible of sending American jobs to China, listen up \nbecause in the next few hours we will hear some more of it. We have \nalready heard some.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  They don't say it quite this way: We think it is nice that if China \nis not competitive, and their government decided they don't need to do \ncertain things that we have done to increase standards and lift the \nAmerican standards, we think it is OK if American jobs migrate \nelsewhere because we do not believe we have to long remain a world \neconomic power in manufacturing to really be a world economic power.\n  They could not be more wrong. This is not a big step. This is the \nsmallest of steps that you would take in the direction of saying: You \nknow something, we are going to do something about a very serious \nproblem. We are trying to work the faucet to put more jobs into this \ncountry, into this economy, at a tough time. We are also trying to shut \nthe drain in circumstances where our Tax Code rewards those who now \nleave our country and move their jobs overseas.\n  If we cannot do that now, then, in my judgment, we can perhaps never \ndo good public policy that lifts this country's economy, stands up for \nAmerican businesses and American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from North \nDakota. He is retiring. We are going to miss him. He has been a \npowerful voice in the Senate and no more powerful on any issue than on \nthis one, talking about American jobs and how we are giving them away, \nliterally giving them away.\n  Time and time again Senator Byron Dorgan has come to the floor to \nexplain that our Tax Code rewards American companies that want to ship \nproduction overseas. Is that upside down? As Senator Dorgan has said on \nthe floor, and I completely agree with him, we should reward American \ncompanies that keep good-paying jobs in America. That is what our Tax \nCode should reward. If they will pay a living wage and good benefits to \na worker, and stay in the United States of America, we ought to give \nthem every tax break we can give them--help them in every way we can. \nInstead, it is upside down. We create incentives for them to move jobs \noverseas.\n  We are a few weeks away from an election. I wish this election would \nbe a simple referendum on the debate we are having on the floor of the \nSenate right now. The Senate Republican leader has come to the floor \nand said we should not be talking about this issue. He wants to talk \nabout something else. Others, representing the largest corporations and \nbusinesses in America, say that the position being taken by the \nDemocrats to stop the tax breaks for American companies that ship jobs \noverseas should be defeated. I wish to take that question to the \nAmerican voters. You pick the State, you pick the city, you pick the \nneighborhood. I want to be there. I will take our position and I invite \nthe Republican Senators and the Chamber of Commerce and whatever other \ngroups happen to believe the other point of view for an active debate. \nWho in the world believes we should be rewarding corporations in our \ncountry for shipping jobs overseas?\n  We know what we are going through here. This recession has cost us \nmillions of American jobs. Under President William Jefferson Clinton, \nwe created 22 million new jobs in America. We had the growth of small \nbusiness at a pace we had never seen. We had minority ownership, woman \nownership of business at a pace we had never seen. We saw the growth of \nnew home construction and new home ownership at a record pace. During \nthe course of that 8-year period of time, we generated a surplus in the \nFederal Treasury--a surplus. We had not done that for a decade or more.\n  So came the time when President Clinton was leaving office, handing \nit over to President George W. Bush. This is what he gave him: a \ngrowing economy creating jobs, home ownership and business ownership. \nHe said to President George W. Bush: Here is the state of our economy. \nWe are reducing our national debt because we are generating a surplus, \nand the entire national debt of America, given from President Clinton \nto President Bush, was $5 trillion.\n  President Clinton said to President Bush: In addition to a strong \neconomy that is growing, I also want to tell you I am leaving you a \nsurplus in the Treasury--$120 billion in the next year, more than you \nneed for the expenses of our government. President Clinton said: We \nhave been taking the surplus, incidentally, putting it back into the \nSocial Security trust fund, and that fund will now guarantee \nevery payment with a cost-of-living adjustment through the year 2032. \nNot a bad gift from President Clinton to President Bush. That was when \nPresident George W. Bush took office.\n\n  What was the state of America 8 years later, when President Bush left \noffice, when he said to President Obama: Now it is your turn. It was a \nmuch different picture. The national debt in America was no longer $5 \ntrillion. Eight years later, after President Bush, it was $12 trillion. \nIn 8 years, only 8 years, President Bush and the Republicans who \nsupported him more than doubled the national debt. How do you do that? \nHow can you take a debt accumulated from George Washington through \nPresident Clinton of $5 trillion and make it $12 trillion in 8 years? \nYou had to work at it.\n  First, you had to engage in two wars we didn't pay for and then you \ndid something--President Bush did something no President had ever done \nin the history of the United States. In the midst of a war he declared \ntax cuts. Remember that Republican theory: If we give tax cuts, this \neconomy is going to mushroom and grow with jobs? It did not work. In \nfact, it failed miserably. It added to our national debt, more than \ndoubled our national debt during the Bush Presidency, so that when \nPresident Bush left office he handed to President Obama a $12 trillion \ndebt--not $5 trillion, $12 trillion. Instead of handing him a surplus \nin the budget of $120 billion for the next year, as he had been given \nwhen he came to office, he announced it would be a $1.2 trillion \ndeficit in the next year. That is what President Obama inherited. And \nof course jobs were melting away--8 million jobs.\n  The month President Obama was sworn in as President and took his hand \noff the Bible, we lost 750,000 jobs, a leftover from the Bush economic \npolicies.\n  Now come the Republicans. They have announced if they are given \ncontrol of Congress in the next election, they have an idea of where we \nshould go as a Nation. We should go back to the Bush economic policies. \nThat is what the Republican plan for America is, go back to the Bush \neconomic policies of declaring tax breaks for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. Senator McConnell stated proudly on the Sunday talk shows \nyesterday that he has had the courage to step up and put a bill before \nCongress of what he thinks we should do as a Nation when it comes to \neconomic policy. He did. It was historic. It was so historic that \nSenator McConnell suggested a tax program that would nearly double the \nnational debt--nearly double it--during the same period of time: $4 \ntrillion of new debt for America. How does he do it? On the Republican \nside, by suggesting we continue to give tax breaks to those in the \nhighest income categories in America.\n  I for one think that is totally irresponsible. In the midst of a \nrecession, let us help working families, middle-income families \nstruggling to pay their bills, struggling to deal with a home mortgage \npayment where the value of the home may be going down instead of up. \nHelp those families. But for those who are making $1 million a year or \nmore, why in the world would we add to the national debt to give them a \n$100,000 tax cut a year? Why? It only adds to the national debt.\n  The Republican theory is, if you give tax cuts to the wealthiest \npeople in America, this economy is going to flourish. I say to the \nSenators on the other side, it is a theory we tested and it failed. It \nis the same theory we tested over the last 10 years of Bush tax cuts. \nIf tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America is what we need for \nour economy, I have one basic question after 10 years: Where are the \njobs? Where are the jobs to show for it?\n  Our approach I think is more reasonable, reasonable in that we would \ngive tax breaks and tax cuts to those working- and middle-income \nfamilies below $250,000 of income so they can get through this tough \neconomy. I don't care if the economists tell us the\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\nrecession is over. As far as I am concerned, to use the vernacular: It \nain't over until it's over, and it ain't over until we start creating \njobs again.\n  That is what this debate on the floor of the Senate is about, not \njust tax policy but basically what is our policy when it comes to \nshipping jobs overseas.\n  I think American workers are the hardest working, most productive \nworkers in the world. Put them up against anybody. Will they work for \nthe lowest wages in the world? No. And they should not. We should have \na standard of living in this country that we are proud of. But our \nworkers have shown that when paid a living wage, they are productive \nworkers and can compete with anyone.\n  Yet American companies have decided they want to ship their jobs \noverseas and see if they can make more money. As far as I am concerned, \nthat is their choice. I think it is a wrong one. That is their choice. \nBut the last thing in the world we ought to do is give them a tax \nincentive to ship those jobs overseas. We know what has happened to \nAmerican families here over the last 10 years and longer in America. \nThey have been falling a little bit behind each and every year, in \nterms of their earning power.\n  As the Wall Street Journal, which I do not quote very often, put it \nrecently, it was the ``Lost Decade for Family Income.'' The median \nincome in America fell almost 5 percent between 2000 and 2009.\n  Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch reported earlier this summer the number of \nfinancial millionaires in America rose by 16 percent. Solid middle-\nclass manufacturing jobs have been disappearing across the country. The \nAFL-CIO estimates that from 2000 to 2007--that was the period of time \nduring the Bush Presidency--the United States lost 5.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  In the 8 years before, under President Clinton, we had created 22 \nmillion jobs. Under President Bush, we lost 5.5 million manufacturing \njobs. By the end of 2009, the fewest number of Americans were working \nin manufacturing since before World War II. But it is not just the jobs \non the shop floor that disappeared during the Bush administration.\n  Goldman Sachs estimates between 400,000 and 600,000 professional \nservices and information sector jobs have moved overseas in the past \nfew years. That was during a time when these businesses were raking in \nrecord profits and jobs were leaving America. Then, when the boom \nturned into a bust, those wizards of Wall Street, those captains of \ncapitalism, those kings of commerce, those malefactors of great wealth \nexperienced a temporary setback. Profits were down, stocks were down, \nand so compensation was down on Wall Street, for about 15 minutes.\n  Corporate profits are now surging, the stock market is roaring back, \nand endless bonuses are raining down on the chosen few, just like the \ngood old days on Wall Street. But what about the rest of hard-working \nfamilies across America? What about the families who never have made a \nmillion bucks? That is the vast majority of them. What about the \nfamilies who earned the median wage in this country, about $50,000 a \nyear? Those jobs are not coming back fast enough.\n  The Recovery Act that we passed last year, with the support of three \nRepublican Senators--only three who would join us in this effort--has \nat least slowed down the recession and the loss of jobs. It has not \nproduced the turnaround we all want to see. It will take some time. But \nat least it stopped the recession from becoming even worse.\n  This recession would not be over yet by anyone's measure had \nPresident Obama taken the advice from the other side of the aisle. They \nbelieved we should do nothing--nothing--in the midst of a recession. I \nhave heard Senate Republicans come to the floor and criticize President \nObama for loaning money to General Motors and Chrysler. I will tell \nyou, in my home State of Illinois, those automobile manufacturing jobs, \nat General Motors and Chrysler, are good-paying jobs. We have lost a \nlot of them. But the good news is, those companies are back. They are \nprofitable. They are selling fewer cars and trucks now, but they are \nselling and they are competitive.\n  That would never have happened had the Republicans had their way and \nstopped the President from giving loans necessary to these automobile \nmanufacturers. We would have seen maybe one company, Ford, that might \nhave survived. The other two probably would not be here today in any \nform, and all the jobs, the tens of thousands of jobs they provide in \nAmerica, would have been lost.\n  The Recovery Act saved another 2.7 million Americans from the \nunemployment roles, according to economists Alan Blinder and Mark \nZandi. In case you think: Well, Durbin, that must be your favorite \nDemocratic economist, Mark Zandi happened to be John McCain's economist \nwhen John McCain ran for President, and he credits the Recovery Act \nwith saving 2.7 million jobs.\n  But even with all these efforts, there is still a lot to do. It is \nnot enough to help the private sector create more jobs. We need for \nthem to be created right here in America. There is one line I can use \nanywhere in the State of Illinois, and I will bet across this Nation, \nwhich I think typifies what most people think about when they think \nabout our economy.\n  I will bet you I could use this line in the State of Delaware. The \nline is this: I would like to go into the store tomorrow and find more \nproducts stamped ``made in the USA.'' People start applauding. They are \nsick and tired of all the imports coming in and all the jobs going \naway.\n  I know global competition is a fact of life. America could never be a \nwealthy nation if we just did one another's laundry. We need to produce \ngoods and services that are competitive on a global basis, and we can \ndo it. We have done it in the past and we can do it again. American \nworkers can compete with the best in the world.\n  But our laws do not give many of our workers a fighting chance. Why \nshould companies be rewarded for shipping good American jobs overseas? \nChina, Germany and Japan and our other competitors do everything they \ncan to generate more work in their home countries so they can sell \nproducts from China and Germany and Japan all around the world.\n  Meanwhile, our conglomerates and many corporations and their friends \nin Congress defend offshoring tax loopholes that other countries would \nnever allow to stand. That is why I introduced the bill that is going \nto be voted on tomorrow, with the help of my colleagues and friends, \nSenator Harry Reid, the majority leader; Senator Byron Dorgan, who has \nbeen our leader for years on this issue; Senator Chuck Schumer of New \nYork, and many others.\n  It is a bill that has three provisions in it. I think they make \nsense. First, we will make two changes to discourage U.S. companies \nfrom giving out pink slips to Americans while they open the doors at \ntheir new factories overseas.\n  We will say to firms: If you want to shut down operations in the \nUnited States and move somewhere else--I hope you do not make that \ndecision, but if you make it, we are not going to give you a tax break \nto make it easier.\n  We will also say to the firms, if you want to sell your products in \nthis country that you made overseas, we are not going to let you start \nmaking those goods overseas, ship them back to this country, and avoid \npaying your taxes on your profits, something called deferral.\n  Second, we will make it more attractive for companies to bring good \njobs back home. This is a provision from Senator Schumer of New York, \nwhich says to firms: If you bring jobs back from another country, you \ndo not have to pay your share of the payroll taxes on those U.S. \nworkers for 3 years. It is an incentive to bring these jobs back home.\n  There is nothing radical in this proposal. You would think it would \npass by a voice vote. Who in the world would object to ending tax \nloopholes to send jobs overseas? Who would object to creating tax \nincentives for bringing jobs from overseas back home?\n  But that is what this debate is all about. The defenders of these tax \nloopholes have wasted no time in launching an aggressive lobbying \ncampaign against the bill: The Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers have written in opposition to the bill, \nand the Republican\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\nleader has already spoken on the floor against even debating this bill. \nHe does not want us to bring it up.\n  The message they send is clear: Corporate profits are more important \nthan American jobs. I could not disagree more. I have watched too many \nhard-working, middle-class families lose their livelihoods as companies \nfire American workers and then use the Tax Code to make shifting jobs \noverseas more profitable.\n  In August, I was in Rock Falls and Sterling, IL. A woman named Julie \ncame. She had worked at the local national manufacturing company there \nfor 34 years. She was a grandmother, raised her family, and was trying \nto help with her grandkids. She had just been notified that company was \nmoving overseas.\n  I said to her: As painful as it is for you to get that pink slip \nafter 34 years of service to that company, I am sorry to tell you that \nour Tax Code made it easier for that company to leave town, made it \neasier for them to do away with your job.\n  I ran into other workers around Illinois as well. To add insult to \ninjury, after a lifetime of working for these businesses, some of these \nbusinesses actually bring in the workers from China and Mexico and ask \nthe American workers, in their last week or two of employment, to train \nthe foreign workers to do their jobs. Can you imagine how hard that \nmust be--to realize that tomorrow you are out of work, and the person \nsitting across the table, whom you are training, is going to have your \njob?\n  Then, how about this? How about the fact that the cost of bringing \nthat foreign worker over here to be trained is now tax deductible under \nour Tax Code? What is wrong with this picture? A good example of a \ncompany moving good American jobs overseas happened in Hennepin, IL. \nThe local steel mill there was built in 1966. I remember it. I was a \ncollege student out here at the time, and we were so exited. It was \nJones Laughlin, if I am not mistaken, when it first started. It changed \nownership over the years. It was a big employer in the region around \nHennepin.\n  They employed 600 people at their peak in a steel mill. Imagine that. \nAs of last year, they still had 300 people on the payroll. Arcelor-\nMittal, the huge steel conglomerate, bought the plant in 2005. Many in \nthe community said: This is a break, a godsend. That huge company is \ngoing to invest in this plant and we are going to keep our jobs.\n  It did not happen. Arcelor-Mittal decided last year that the \nprofitable plant in Hennepin--they were making money--the profitable \nplant, was no longer worth keeping open. Just like that, 300 solid, \nmiddle-class jobs disappeared.\n  I received a lot of letters from members of the community. A 10-year-\nold girl wrote to me:\n\n       My dad . . . got laid off by Lakshmi Mittal, at Mittal \n     Steel. You see, instead of selling the plant, Lakshmi decided \n     to ship all of the parts over the oceans . . .--\n\n  This 10-year-old wrote to me and said--\n\n       I think the plant should not be closed because if he \n     shipped the parts all over, then hundreds of peoples' jobs \n     will be lost. Please Help Us!\n\n  The heartbreaking news for that young girl is that our Tax Code \nrewarded the plant for shipping the equipment overseas. This 10-year-\nold girl, wise beyond her years, heartbroken that her dad had lost his \njob, may not understand the global implications of plant closings, but \nshe sure knows what it means to her family.\n  Here is what a 30-year veteran of that plant wrote:\n\n       The plant was shut down in the spring even though it made a \n     profit. . . . Being the father of two college freshman, I \n     have to wonder what the future will hold for my children . . \n     . American industry, the backbone of our country, cannot \n     exist in this environment.\n\n  Well, I agree. That is why I am on the floor. That is why this bill \nis on the floor. We have to do something about it. Here is another one. \nThis is a company that once operated in my home State of Illinois, \nHoneywell International. They closed their plants in Freeport, Rock \nIsland, Spring Valley, and Springfield and then sent the jobs to India, \nChina, and Mexico.\n  The Department of Labor certified these workers lost their jobs \nbecause the jobs were actually sent overseas. In my hometown of \nSpringfield, the plant closing cost us 120 jobs in the capital city. \nThis was a plant that had been in production since 1938, long before I \nwas born, when it produced the world's first electric clock for \nautomobiles. The plant also supplied electrical products to support our \ntroops during World war II. In an instant, this piece of American \nhistory vanished to Juarez, Mexico.\n  I received a letter from a victim of this particular example of \noffshoring good American jobs. Here is what he wrote to me:\n\n     . . . stop rewarding Honeywell and other corporations that \n     ship jobs out of the country . . . They don't deserve tax \n     money for making the US unemployment rate go up further.\n\n  Well, that is exactly what this bill before us wants to stop. Let me \nshow you one other illustration. U.S. multinationals are increasing \nhiring abroad and decreasing hiring at home. In total, between 1999, at \nthis end of the chart, and 2008, multinational corporations in the \nUnited States added 2.4 million jobs overseas, a 30-percent increase.\n  Well, there is nothing wrong with companies growing. But look what \nhappened here at home. Here is the problem. During the same period, \nthese American companies cut 1.9 million jobs in America, an 8-percent \ndecrease. It is obvious. The jobs are being shipped overseas and killed \nat home. This notion by some companies that if you let us produce \noverseas it will help our jobs back home, it is not happening. Exactly \nthe opposite is happening--jobs overseas, loss of jobs in the United \nStates.\n  Well, enough is enough. We need to stop rewarding companies, through \nour Tax Code, for killing American jobs, and we need to create \nincentives to bring those jobs back home. This bill is very \nstraightforward. It is a clear choice. Senators can decide. Do they \nwant to stand with American workers? Do they want to stand with those \ncorporate interests that want to ship jobs overseas? Do they believe \nour Tax Code should reward good American companies that pay good wages \nand good benefits to American workers and stay here or do they want to \ncreate an incentive to ship those jobs overseas?\n  That is what this bill is all about. I hope there will be at least \none Republican Senator who will join us in this effort. It would be a \nbreakthrough. I hope it is more than one. But I hope they are hearing \nthe same thing back home. I would just ask those who oppose it to go to \nyour home State, pick the community, pick the town, and invite me to \ncome and debate you, if you are on the other side of the this issue.\n  You pick it. I want to be in on that debate.\n  I believe the bottom line is this: The American Tax Code should be \ndesigned to help American companies create good-paying jobs right here \nin the United States. Our focus ought to be to make sure when people \nwalk in stores across America, they can flip that product over and see \nmade in the USA again. With this vote, Senators will be given a choice \nwhere they want the next round of job creation to be. Do they want it \nin the United States or in China? Middle-class families in this country \nhave been struggling for a long time. They are upset. They want more \njobs. They want a Congress that will stand up and fight for them. With \nthis vote, they will find out who is going to be on their side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern that the \nSenate may adjourn this week without extending the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief provisions which are slated to expire on January 1.\n  These tax laws include important reforms such as the 10 percent tax \nrate, relief from the marriage penalty, and the child tax credit. They \nprovide tax relief to nearly 90 percent of all\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nMainers. If they are not extended, virtually every Maine family and \nmany--indeed, most--of our small businesses will see their taxes \nincrease. If these tax relief provisions are not extended, the typical \nAmerican family of four with a household income of approximately \n$50,000 will see their taxes increase by about $2,900 next year. That \nis right. Coupled with tax increases that are included in the new \nhealth care reform law, which I opposed, the result would be one of the \nlargest tax increases in our history.\n  Many economists contend this is the worst possible time to increase \ntaxes because our economy is so fragile. I fully agree. I cannot \nimagine anyone even contemplating increasing taxes in the midst of a \nrecession. The consequences for small businesses would also be dire. \nHigher taxes would take critical investment dollars away, leaving less \nfor innovation and expansion, not to mention employee wages and \nbenefits. Raising taxes when the economy is still weak would make it \ndifficult and in some cases impossible for small businesses to start, \ngrow, and create jobs.\n  Peter Orszag, President Obama's former OMB Director, recently penned \nand op-ed for the New York Times in which he argued that this is no \ntime to raise taxes. As he pointed out, the failure to extend existing \ntax relief would ``make an already stagnating job market worse.'' He \nwent on to say:\n\n       Higher taxes now would crimp consumer spending, further \n     depressing the already inadequate demand for what firms are \n     capable of producing at full tilt.\n\n  I hope President Obama will heed the advice of his former budget \ndirector and abandon his plan to raise taxes at this critical time.\n  It is important to understand that many small businesses are \npassthrough entities such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S \ncorporations. These small businesses must report their earnings on \ntheir owner's individual income tax returns. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated that there are some 750,000 passthrough small \nbusinesses in the top two tax brackets.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues examples of a couple small \nbusinesses in Maine that would be hurt by this tax increase. They are \nrepresentative of many others, of course.\n  This August, I toured several remarkable businesses in my home state. \nTheir products are diverse and their histories vary greatly, but they \nshare the traits of ingenuity, energy, and a commitment to excellence. \nThe employees and the owners of these small businesses work so hard. An \nexample is D Machine Products of Westbrook. Its name and products may \nnot be familiar to the general public, but it is internationally known \nand respected throughout the pulp and paper, high technology, power, \npetrochemical, food processing, aerospace, and defense industries. Its \nprecision design machining and fabrication operations put Maine on the \ncutting edge of innovation. As is so often the case, success started \nsmall with this small business. D was founded in 1967 by Dave Gushee \nand Fred Loring in a one-car garage behind Dave's home. They \nspecialized in producing custom tooling and dyes for equipment \nmanufacturers in the Portland area and soon added fabrication and \nwelding services. D's founding principles of quality, attention to \ndetail and delivering unsurpassed customer satisfaction paid off.\n  Within a few years, this young company outgrew the tiny garage and \nexpanded into sophisticated design and engineering services. Today D \nhas more than 100,000 square feet of shop space and more than 130 \nhighly skilled and dedicated employees. I met many of them during my \ntour last month.\n  Duane Gushee, who now runs the company, tells me he is very concerned \nabout the impact higher taxes would have on his company's ability to \ncompete. Duane pointed out to me that his company does not compete \nprimarily against other Maine firms or even against other U.S. \ncompanies. It has to compete successfully with companies all around the \nworld for markets and customers. Without constant innovation and \ninvestment in cutting edge technology, D will lose its customers, and \nits employees will lose their jobs. If we don't act, the tax increase \nthat will hit D on January 1 will take money out of its bottom line, \nmoney that is needed to upgrade equipment and stay ahead of foreign \ncompetition.\n  Another small business I visited is Pottle's Transportation, a \ntrucking company headquartered in Bangor. This company was founded in \n1972, and it has grown to more than 200 employees with 150 trucks. \nPottle's now provides service throughout the continental United States \nand Canada, although it concentrates its efforts in the Northeast. It \nis known for maintaining an impressive on-time delivery record without \nsacrificing safety. In fact, it has received award after award in \nrecognition of its safety record. Pottle's is also known for its \ncommitment to the environment. Pottle's is a member of EPA's Smartway \nProgram and received the EPA Environmental Merit Award in 2008.\n  The past few years have been very tough on the trucking industry. \nBarry Pottle, who runs the company, tells me that 1,100 trucking \ncompanies around the country have gone under so far this year. His \ncompany is in the black right now, but it is a real struggle to \ngenerate the capital needed to keep his trucks on the road. Pottle's \nneeds to buy 25 to 30 trucks every year just to maintain its fleet. New \ntrucks used to cost the company about $100,000, but in the past few \nyears, the cost has gone up by another $25,000. Barry tells me this is \ndue to an excise tax on heavy trucks passed in 2006 and new \nenvironmental regulations that require $13,000 in emissions equipment \non each new truck. Together, these changes have raised Pottle's annual \ncost of doing business by about three-quarters of $1 million. On top of \nthis, Barry has to worry about the tax increases his company will face \nif the 2001 and 2003 tax relief laws expire at the end of this year.\n\n  Visiting these businesses and others, reading what economists such as \nPeter Orszag have said, has confirmed my belief that the administration \nmust reverse its present course, which is stifling job growth, \ndiscouraging entrepreneurship and risk taking, and hobbling the \neconomic recovery. Americans should be proud of the spirit, the drive, \nand the determination that has produced small business success stories \nsuch as D Machine Products and Pottle's Transportation.\n  We in Washington must recognize that the policies we adopt or the tax \nlaws we fail to extend have an impact on whether these companies can \nstart up, grow, prosper, and, most of all, create good jobs. So what I \nhave suggested we do as a compromise is to extend these two important \ntax relief laws for another 2 years. That will get us through this \nrecession. It will send a strong signal to the business community.\n  I cannot tell you how many businesses have told me they are holding \non to capital right now. They do not dare invest to create much needed \njobs because of the uncertainty of what is going to happen on tax \npolicy. We know we need to revamp our Tax Code. We need to make it \nfairer. We need to make it simpler. But for right now the best thing we \ncould do would be to extend those two laws--the 2001 and 2003 tax \nreform laws--for an additional 2 years to provide certainty to \nbusinesses and to send a strong signal that we get it. We know we \nshould not increase taxes in the midst of a recession.\n  One of the most startling conversations I had during August was with \na small businessman who owns a small community grocery store. He told \nme he had an opportunity to buy a second store in another rural Maine \ntown. He said he had the financing in place to make the purchase, and \nhe would like to create more jobs and keep this small business going \nserving the needs of the community.\n  I said to him: Well, why don't you just do it? Interest rates are \nlow, so it seems like a good time. Is the uncertainty about what is \ncoming out of Washington keeping you from acting?\n  He said: You know, Senator, it is not so much the uncertainty. It is \nthe certainty, the certainty of higher taxes, of more regulation, of \nhaving to pay more for health insurance for my employees. It is the \ncertainty of more spending. That is what is discouraging me.\n  So I hope we could come together right now, and before we go home \npass a 2-year extension of the current tax\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nlaw, to provide some certainty that we are not going to impose higher \ntaxes on the American people and our small businesses.\n\n\n                          U.S. Postal Service\n\n  Mr. President, in my remaining time, I would like to speak today \nabout the future of the U.S. Postal Service.\n  The Postal Service is in the midst of a dire financial crisis. The \ndata are grim. In the first three quarters of fiscal year 2010, the \nPostal Service posted a net loss of $5.4 billion. By the end of this \nweek, when the fiscal year ends, I expect that number may hit $7 \nbillion that the Postal Service will be in the red for this fiscal year \nalone.\n  Obviously, faced with this much red ink, the Postal Service needs to \ndo everything possible to increase its revenue and reduce costs. Yet \nthe Postal Service's plan for regaining its fiscal footing relies too \nheavily on service cutbacks, relief from funding its known liabilities, \nand the hope that enormous rate increases will be approved.\n  I am a huge supporter of the Postal Service, and I want it not only \nto survive but to thrive. It is a vital American institution that \nserves our Nation and whose roots are found in our Constitution.\n  To help the Postal Service identify additional areas for cost \nreductions, I asked the Postal Service inspector general to review \nthree areas: the benefits the Postal Service pays on behalf of its \nemployees, the Postal Service's contracting policies--which is an area \nwhere Senator Claire McCaskill, who has been a real leader in \nprocurement reform, joined with me--and, third, the Postal Service's \narea and district field office structure to see if there were \nefficiencies that could be realized there.\n  I must say, I was both dismayed and outraged when I received the \nresults of the IG's audits.\n  The IG found stunning evidence of contract mismanagement, ethical \nlapses, financial waste, and excessive executive perks which, if \nremedied, could allow the Postal Service to realize in excess of $800 \nmillion in savings next year alone. That is at a minimum.\n  Let me give you some startling facts the IG found. For a long time, \nwe have known the Postal Service has been more generous in paying the \nhealth insurance and the life insurance premiums of its employees, most \nof whom participate in the same health insurance and life insurance \nprograms as Federal employees.\n  But what we did not know until this review was conducted is that the \nPostal Service pays 100 percent of the health insurance premiums for \n835 of its top executives, an expensive perk that no governmental \nagency appears to provide.\n  This costs the Postal Service an estimated $10 million annually. If \nthe Postal Service brought the contribution for these executives into \nline with federal agencies, it could save $2.8 million per year on this \nchange alone.\n  It is unbelievable to me the Postal Service--awash in debt and asking \nfor huge postal rate increases--is paying the full health care premiums \nfor 835 of its executives.\n  The Postal Service is now paying 79 percent of health insurance \ncontributions for its rank-and-file employees, in comparison to 72 \npercent for the average Federal employee. It is a little hard for the \nPostal Service to make the case to its employees that it needs to \nreduce health insurance if it is paying 100 percent of the premiums for \n835 of its top executives. If the Postal Service brought its benefit \ncontributions in line with other Federal agencies, it could save more \nthan $700 million next year alone.\n  But that is not all. When Senator McCaskill and I requested that the \nIG review the Postal Service's contracting practices, the IG discovered \nunfair and unethical practices replete with no-bid contracts and \nexamples of apparent cronyism.\n  The Postal Service's contract management did not protect it from \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. Indeed, it left the door wide open. The Postal \nService could not even identify how many contracts were awarded without \ncompetition. The inspector general found that 35 percent of the no-bid \ncontracts it did review lacked justification. As part of its review, \nthe IG discovered that more than 2,700 contracts had been awarded to \nformer postal employees since 1991. Of these contracts, 359 were \nawarded as no-bid contracts to former postal employees in the last 3 \nyears. Seventeen of them were noncompetitive contracts to career \nexecutives within 1 year of their leaving the Postal Service.\n  Some former executives were brought back at nearly twice their former \npay--an outrageous practice the IG says raises serious ethical \nquestions, hurts employee morale, and has tarnished the Postal \nService's public image.\n  In one particularly egregious example, an executive received a \n$260,000 no-bid contract just 2 months after retiring. The purpose? To \ntrain his successor.\n  The findings of these three investigations show that the Postal \nService must get more serious about cost cutting. Clearly, there are \nsavings to be had.\n  Faced with shrinking mail volume and a declining workforce, the \nPostal Service understands the need to reduce unnecessary costs but its \nefforts have fallen short.\n  For example, the Postal Service can realize structural efficiencies. \nEven after the Postal Service consolidated 1 area office and 6 district \noffices last year, the structure still includes 8 area offices and 74 \ndistrict offices, costing approximately $1.5 billion during fiscal year \n2009.\n  To determine if additional efficiencies exist, the inspector general \nreviewed area and district offices, which handle administrative \nfunctions but do not actually handle any mail. In doing so, the IG \nidentified several options for consolidating the area and district \nfield office structure.\n  One option, which would entail closing area and district offices that \nhave less than the mean mail volume and work hours, could save the \nPostal Service more than $100 million annually.\n  Another, more conservative, option could save the Postal Service some \n$33.6 million annually by closing district offices that are within 50 \nmiles of one another.\n  Management at headquarters reported that last year's consolidations \nwent smoothly, with no negative impact on operations. That result \nclearly shows that the Postal Service should continue its strategic \nefforts to consolidate.\n  After receiving the results of these three IG investigations last \nweek, I wrote a letter to the Postmaster General, urging him to \nimplement the inspector general's recommendations immediately.\n  In my letter, I emphasized that the IG reports had found concrete \nways for the Postal Service to cut sizeable expenses. Reducing costs is \na far better solution than reducing service and increasing rates \nremedies that run the risk of driving away even more customers.\n  Additionally, the Postal Service should increase cross-craft training \nand collaborate with high-volume customers to increase mail volume \nthrough initiatives like the ``Summer Sale.''\n  It also should work with OMB and OPM to access the more than $50 \nbillion which the Postal Regulatory Commission believes USPS has \noverpaid into the Civil Service Retirement System fund.\n  I have been pressing the Office of Personnel Management to change its \nmethod for calculating the Postal Service payments into the CSRS \npension fund consistent with the 2006 Postal reform law. The OPM, \nhowever, stubbornly refuses to change its methodology or to even admit \nthat the 2006 Postal law permits them to do so.\n  I have continued to stress the importance of this change to both OPM \nand the administration. Clearly, the Postal Service's refund of a more \nthan $50 billion overpayment would greatly aid its current financial \ncondition.\n  In sum, the Postal Service must devote more energy and adapt a laser \nfocus to reducing costs, such as those identified in the recent IG \nreports. It also must develop customer-first programs that can enhance \nrevenue, increase volume, and earn loyalty.\n  The Postal Service is at a crossroads. It must choose the correct \npath. It must take steps toward a bright future that allows it to grow \nand thrive. It must reject the path of service reductions and ongoing \npostal rate hikes, which will only alienate customers.\n  The Postal Service must reinvent itself by embracing change that will \nrevitalize its business model and enable it to attract and keep \ncustomers. These actions are within its reach and will\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nhelp protect and preserve this vital American institution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the legislation that \nis pending, the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act, but \nalso more generally on the issue of the loss of jobs, particularly in \nthe energy sector, as we go forward.\n  When BP Solar closed its Frederick, MD, plant earlier this year, 320 \nAmericans saw their jobs sent overseas to China and India. Bloomberg \nsaid the announcement ``signal[ed the] exodus of US renewable-energy \njobs,'' which it obviously did. In fact, BP Solar's move followed \nGeneral Electric's closing of its Newark, DE, solar panel plant, \nEvergreen Solar's shifting of hundreds of jobs from Danvers, MA, to \nChina, and Gamesa's shutting down of its wind turbine factory in \nwestern Pennsylvania.\n  Given the broad enthusiasm for creating clean energy jobs, few seem \nto notice this alarming trend. But we cannot afford to sit idly by as \nclean energy jobs steadily and stealthily move overseas. So as we \ndebate this Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act--which the \nmajority leader is trying to bring forward for Senate consideration, \nand which I support--I rise to call on the Senate, also, in addition, \nto pass three commonsense, bipartisan measures that will enable the \nUnited States to retain existing clean energy jobs and capture millions \nof new ones that the burgeoning global demand for clean energy will \nsoon create.\n  To begin, let me dispel the myth that the United States cannot lead \nin producing clean energy technology. In fact, we once were the leader. \nAs recently as 1997, we had a ``green trade'' surplus of $14.4 billion. \nBy 2008, that surplus had become a deficit of nearly $8.9 billion. The \nreversal was triggered largely by a steep fall-off in domestic \nrenewable energy technology manufacturing. For instance, only a decade \nago, U.S. solar cell manufacturers controlled 30 percent of the world \nmarket. By 2008, that had been reduced to 6 percent. Meanwhile, Chinese \nproduction has grown from nonexistent in 1999 to 32 percent of the \nworld total in 2008. Similarly, European manufacturers now account for \nmore than 85 percent of the global wind component market. Today, only 1 \nof the top 10 manufacturers is an American firm.\n  What happened to bring about these changes? Simply put, other \ncountries enacted policies to attract investment, both ``push'' \nincentives such as tax incentives and direct subsidies to attract \nmanufacturers, and ``pull'' incentives to create domestic demand. As a \nresult of the incentives they enacted, China displaced the United \nStates last year as the world's leading destination for clean energy \ninvestment. Its total investment was nearly twice that of the United \nStates. Measured as a share of gross domestic product, domestic clean \nenergy investment places us--the United States--in the bottom half of \nthe G20 countries. If the trend continues, we will fall further behind.\n  Over the next 5 years, government investment by China and Japan and \nSouth Korea is expected to outstrip U.S. Government investment by 3 to \n1. This public investment will drive trillions in private sector \ninvestment within those same countries.\n  With global clean energy investments expected to reach $2.3 trillion \nby 2020, we cannot afford to delay measures that will ensure U.S. \nleadership in this area. We must look to create jobs across the clean \nenergy value chain--from engineering to installation to sales. In \nparticular, we must focus on manufacturing jobs, because failing to \ngrow a domestic clean tech manufacturing base will result in trading \nour imported oil dependency for an imported clean energy component \ndependency. In fact, we are already seeing how shortages in renewable \nenergy components and systems have slowed domestic renewable energy \nproduction. As we have begun to see, offshoring manufacturing is \nquickly followed by offshoring of research and development capacity.\n  To grow our manufacturing base, Congress needs to take decisive \naction this year to enact, at a minimum, the three commonsense, \nbipartisan measures I alluded to before. First, we must send the \nappropriate market signal by enacting the renewable energy standard I \nhave introduced along with Senator Brownback. Expanding demand for \nclean energy is essential to raising demand for domestically produced \ngoods. For instance, every gigawatt of installed wind capacity--that is \nroughly enough to power all the homes in Atlanta--is estimated to \ncreate 4,300 jobs, more than three-fourths in manufacturing. European \nfirms that now dominate U.S. wind turbine sales developed technical and \nmarketing expertise by serving their own home markets first. Expanding \ndomestic demand will enable American firms to catch up.\n  As I indicated, Senator Brownback and I have introduced this \nlegislation and we hope very much that in the short session of the \nCongress after the election, that can be brought up and dealt with in a \npositive way.\n  But a demand-side strategy for clean energy cannot suffice. We also \nneed to focus on the supply side to ensure that policies spurring clean \nenergy demand will not only be filled by imports from overseas. So the \nsecond call is to expand the Advanced Energy Project, or section 48C \ntax credit that we created as part of the Recovery Act. That credit \nallows qualifying companies to claim a credit for up to 30 percent of \nthe cost of creating, expanding, or reequipping facilities to \nmanufacture clean energy technologies. The Recovery Act authorized the \nDepartments of Energy and the Treasury to award $2.3 billion in tax \ncredits.\n  There are many success stories about funding that was way \noversubscribed. The government received $10 billion in applications for \nthe $2.3 billion in tax credits that were available under the Recovery \nAct. In December I joined with Senators Hatch, Stabenow, and Lugar in \nfiling the American Clean Technology Manufacturing Leadership Act. That \nbill would add another $2.5 billion in tax credit allocation authority. \nPresident Obama has called for $5 billion in additional funds to be \nmade available this way.\n  The third of the initiatives I wish to focus on today is the need to \naddress financing challenges that companies face in establishing \nonshore clean energy manufacturing facilities. Five years ago, Congress \ncreated a loan guarantee program at the Department of Energy. But from \nits start, the program has faced bureaucratic delays. So far, there are \nonly 14 loan guarantees that have been issued, all of them in the past \n14 months and 10 within the last year. The Recovery Act promised to add \n$6 billion to the program which would leverage about $60 billion in new \nloans for clean energy projects. Unfortunately, this Congress has seen \nfit to treat this funding as a piggybank and withdrew $3.5 billion as \noffsets for unrelated purposes. We need to restore that funding.\n  We need to restore it as well as retool the loan guarantee program. \nThe Energy Committee, which I chair, reported a bill that would create \na robust successor to that program called the Clean Energy Deployment \nAdministration, or CEDA, and I urge the Congress to enact that \nlegislation as well.\n  Alongside these three measures to retain and create clean energy \nmanufacturing jobs, we also need to pass two important additional \nbipartisan packages. The Energy Committee has unanimously supported a \nbill to address the largest oilspill in our Nation's history. The \nAmerican people are waiting for us to enact it. We should do so as soon \nas possible. The Tax Code is an increasingly important mechanism for \ndelivering clean energy incentives. In fact, more than three in five \nFederal dollars spent on energy are delivered through tax provisions.\n  I will return to the floor later this week to discuss a bipartisan \npackage of incentives for clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency \nand I hope that package will receive priority attention by the Congress \nbefore it adjourns as well.\n  Some have said the United States cannot regain its footing in the \nclean energy manufacturing arena. Those who doubt the potential of this \nsector think that clean energy jobs can flow only to low-wage countries \nsuch as China. We need only look at what has happened in Germany where \nemployment in the clean energy industry is second only to the nation's \nstrong automotive industry.\n  We are deservedly proud of our Nation's tradition as a leader in \nresearch\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nand development, in innovation, and in venture-backed investing. With \nthe right policies, we can guarantee that clean technology investment \nwill come to our shores. Let's enact the job-creating legislation \npending in the Senate today and then move swiftly to enact legislation \ncreating a renewable electricity standard and a Clean Energy Employment \nAdministration, and expanding the section 48C credit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is what we are here to talk about \nonce again: making it in America.\n  On Friday, the Department of Labor made available more than $500,000 \nto assist 183 Iowans laid off from the ThermoFisher Scientific plant in \nDubuque. All of the workers were certified as eligible for trade \nadjustment assistance. This grant was designed to help unemployed \nIowans as they attempt to find new work in an economy that is already \ndesperately short of new jobs.\n  I am certainly grateful for the temporary assistance from the Federal \nGovernment, as I am sure are the unemployed workers and their families. \nBut what is wrong with this picture? Once again, we find ourselves \nlending modest assistance to American workers whose jobs have been \neliminated--whose economic security has been destroyed--because U.S. \nmanufacturing is being shipped overseas. I would note that \nmanufacturing jobs, which are generally high paying, have been \nparticularly hard hit in this economic downturn.\n  In my State of Iowa, there has been a steady, relentless drumbeat of \nlayoffs and plant closings as companies from Electrolux to Cummins shut \ndown their plants and move to other countries--including Mexico and \nChina and other countries--that offer low wages, lower workplace safety \nstandards, and only minimal environmental oversight. This is happening \ndespite the fact that American workers, while paid more, tend to be far \nmore efficient and productive.\n  Adding insult to injury, these newly unemployed American workers must \nreckon with the fact that the United States Tax Code actually rewards \ncompanies for sending their jobs overseas. That is right. Most \nAmericans don't know this, but the Tax Code actually incentivizes \ncompanies that shut down operations and kill jobs in the United States.\n  This betrayal of American workers is outrageous on its face. And with \nthe official unemployment rate stuck near 10 percent--that is the \nofficial rate; the actual rate is closer to 18 percent--it is simply \nintolerable.\n  That is why I have come to the floor to speak in strong support of \nthe Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act of 2010. This bill \nwould take three urgent steps to reduce and begin to reverse the \nbleeding of jobs from America.\n  First, the bill would end subsidies for plant closing costs. That is \nright. There are subsidies if you close a plant. It would prohibit a \nfirm from taking any deduction, loss, or credit for costs associated \nwith reducing or ending the operation of a trade or business in the \nUnited States and starting or expanding a similar trade or business \noverseas. Let me note that the bill would not apply to any severance \npayments or costs associated with placement services or employee \nretraining provided to those who lose their jobs as a result of the \noffshoring.\n  Secondly, the bill would end the tax breaks for runaway plants, for \ncompanies that reduce or close a trade or business in the United States \nand start or expand a similar business overseas for the purpose of \nimporting their products back into the United States. Under current \nlaw, U.S. companies can defer paying U.S. tax on income earned by their \nforeign companies or subsidiaries until that income is brought back to \nthe United States. This is known as deferral. Deferral has the effect \nof putting these firms at a competitive advantage over U.S. firms that \nhave stayed here and that hire U.S. workers to make products in the \nUnited States. Imagine that. So you take your company and ship it \noverseas. All of the money that plant makes over there, you don't have \nto pay taxes on it. You keep your money there and keep expanding your \nplant, or make another plant in another country that is low wage and \nhas low environmental oversight.\n  What an advantage they have over good companies, good businesses in \nAmerica that want to stay here. So we have to close that loophole.\n  The third loophole we have to close is the encouragement businesses \nget right now to create jobs that go overseas. We have to create \nincentives for businesses that expand here. This bill would provide \nbusinesses with a 2-year break from paying the equivalent of the \nemployer's share of Social Security payroll tax on wages paid to new \nU.S. employees performing services in the United States that used to be \nperformed overseas. In other words, if they have a plant and a business \nhere and can bring jobs back to the United States, guess what. For 2 \nyears, they get a tax break; they don't have to pay the employer's \nshare of the payroll tax. We will pick it up--the Federal Government, \nthe taxpayers--because those jobs will come back here; people will be \nhired; and they will be paying into this economy.\n  Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nfor introducing this bill. I also salute the senior Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, who has been such an outspoken champion of \nAmerican manufacturing. He has fought long and hard to end the \nprovisions in the Tax Code that have the perverse effect of actually \nencouraging and rewarding U.S. companies that ship jobs overseas. I \nalso commend the Senator from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, who also is a \ntremendous champion of the focus and attention to try to do everything \nwe can possibly do to keep our jobs here. Ohio has especially been hard \nhit. If we look at all of the statistics, Ohio has been especially hard \nhit over the last decade, during the last 8 years of the Bush \nadministration, from all of the jobs that left Ohio and were shipped \noverseas.\n  Let me give an example of the destruction that is caused by this. \nAlmost exactly 1 year ago, workers at the Cummins Filtration plant in \nLake Mills, IA, a small community, were gathered together on the shop \nfloor. Company officials, surrounded by a phalanx of security \nofficials, announced that some 400 jobs would be moved to Cummins \nmanufacturing plants in Mexico.\n  This announcement came out of the blue. The employees immediately \nwent into mourning, trying to make sense of their new status--victims \nof the outsourcing of their jobs to Mexico. Thirty-five married couples \nworked at the plant. So many families lost two jobs in one fell swoop. \nIn one case, the couple had worked at Cummins for 30 years. As one \nplant employee said:\n\n       This is going to be terrible for people, terrible for this \n     town. It's going to hurt everybody, the gas station, the \n     grocery store.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the kind of personal tragedy and devastation \nthat we are seeing in thousands of towns all across America as \ncompanies lay off employees and/or shut down operations and move \noverseas.\n  Since 2001, some 42,000 American factories have closed their doors. \nRoughly three-fourths of those employed over 500 people. Not 42,000 \njobs, Mr. President, but 42,000 American factories closed their doors \nsince 2001.\n  The manufacturing sector lost 1.3 million workers in 2009 alone, \ncontinuing the disturbing loss of more than 5 million U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs from 2001 to 2009. That is right, 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs lost.\n  It is bad enough this is happening, but what is absolutely \nintolerable is that our Tax Code actually encourages companies to kill \nthese U.S. jobs and take their operations overseas.\n  Senator Dorgan, many times, has cited the example of Levi jeans and \nHuffy bicycles.\n  What can be more American than Levi? They moved their production to \nMexico and to other parts of the world. They don't make any Levis here \nanymore. They contract with foreign companies who make Levis for the \nLevi Company.\n  As Senator Dorgan said about Huffy bicycles in Ohio--Senator Brown's \nhome State--workers there made $11 an hour making those bicycles. But \nthey got fired, laid off, and Huffy bikes are now made in China at 30 \ncents an hour. The Huffy Corporation reaped millions of dollars in tax \nbreaks as a result of this offshoring.\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\n  Then, as this chart shows, is Fruit of the Loom, another signature \nU.S. company that has outsourced many thousands of jobs over the last \ndecade. The company has closed plants in Kentucky, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Texas, and elsewhere, and shipped those jobs to Asia, the \nCaribbean, and Morocco, and the U.S. Tax Code has handsomely rewarded \nFruit of the Loom for doing so.\n  Mr. President, these are the Fruit of the Loom guys on the chart, \nwhich shows them leaving for Mexico, and they took 3,200 U.S. jobs with \nthem.\n  It is time to end this outrage, with the U.S. Tax Code actually \nencouraging companies to lay off employees and ship operations \noverseas, even as we struggle to recover from the worst economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression.\n  The way to grow our economy and drive our recovery is to create jobs \nin America and remove policies that encourage companies to ship \nAmerican jobs overseas. We built the middle class by building things in \nAmerica. We can do it again by giving companies incentives to bring \njobs back to America and create new ones here as well.\n  I encourage and urge my colleagues to support the Creating Jobs and \nEnding Offshoring Act of 2010.\n  I assume our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a couple more minutes.\n  First of all, I don't know how anybody can argue with this bill. It \njust says, one, we are going to end subsidies for plant closing costs. \nIn other words, right now, a company could close a plant here and move \nit overseas. All of the costs of closing down that plant and ending \nthat operation would take a deduction--or they could take losses or \ncredit against taxes for the cost of closing that down. If they shipped \nit overseas--if a plant goes belly up, and they can't make it anymore, \nor whatever they have made is not being purchased anymore, that is one \nthing. I can see providing for credits and losses and deductions for \nthat. But if they are closing it down and starting or expanding a \nsimilar trade or business overseas, they should not get any tax \nbenefits whatsoever. That is what this bill does; it ends that \nloophole.\n  It ends the tax break for runaway plants when they expand their \nbusinesses overseas. Why should we allow companies that, as I say, are \nnot good citizens--they take their plant overseas and the money they \nmake over there--first of all, they don't have the same environmental \nprotections. They have terrible working conditions and low wages. But \nthey take all those profits--and a company that is here making the same \nproducts in America pays workers more, pays into Social Security, pays \nhigher taxes, has environmental concerns to deal with--but this plant \nin America has to pay taxes on their earnings. The company over in \nChina, making the same product, can defer those taxes, as long as they \ndon't bring the money back here.\n  You might say, as long as they don't bring the money back here, why \nshould they not get a deferral? Because they take those profits and \nexpand operations in that country or other countries, further putting \nat a disadvantage the good companies that stay in America. We ought to \nend that loophole.\n  Third, this bill provides actual incentives for companies to \nrepatriate jobs into this country--bring jobs back into this country. \nThey get a 2-year break from paying their company's share of Social \nSecurity taxes. That is a good tax break for companies coming back into \nAmerica.\n  For those three reasons, I don't see how anybody can argue with us. I \nam not here to say we have to stop every plant and put laws into effect \nto stop them from going overseas. That is not what I am saying. I am \nsaying don't have the Federal Government subsidize that. That is what \nwe are doing with our trade laws. I am not going to get into that now. \nThat is for another debate maybe later this year or next year about \nredoing our trade laws and what we are doing in the WTO.\n  Why does China get away with undervaluing their currency, which makes \ntheir imports into this country cheaper, and we do nothing about it? At \nleast Japan did something--raised tariffs to equalize the difference \nbetween what the currency could be worth on the open market. That is \nwhat we ought to look at in this country. China should not be allowed \nto get by with this undercutting of their currency just to make their \nexports to this country cheaper because it is taking more American jobs \naway.\n  Again, that is not part of this bill. That is a discussion we need to \nhave, and we need to have it soon in order to, again, have us take a \nmore or a stronger position in world trade than we have been taking in \nthe last couple of decades.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what I consider \nto be a rather disturbing trend on the floor of the Senate. I am \nobserving more and more the majority bringing legislation to the floor \nfor political reasons, knowing it doesn't have enough votes to pass.\n  Rather than working to address our economic woes in any kind of \nmeaningful way, we instead find ourselves voting on what I would \ndescribe as ballot box topics designed to gain favor with select groups \njust weeks before the November elections.\n  Is it any wonder that the American people continue to give Congress \nsuch a dreadfully low approval rating? Is it any wonder that the people \nof this country look at what is going on and have come to the \nconclusion that the problems they are facing every day are not being \nsolved?\n  Back in August, when I was going across the State, I did 14 townhall \nmeetings, open events, where anybody could show up and offer their \nthoughts. What I heard over and over is that people are just exhausted, \nsick and tired of the games and the election year politicking that is \ngoing on, when we should be working to deal with the problems this \ncountry faces.\n  You see, the people don't care who is scoring political points. They \ncare about their jobs, they care about finding a job if they have lost \ntheir job, and they care about keeping food on the family's table. For \nall too many people in this country, they care about the fact that the \njob they once had may never come back. They want action. In fact, they \nare crying out for action.\n  They want thoughtful approaches to our Nation's problems--not \npopulist rhetoric devoid of any real solutions or a serious attempt to \nfind solutions.\n  We find ourselves on the floor of the Senate this week debating a \nbill that has been labeled a jobs bill. Let me point out that there \nhave been no hearings. There has been no debate on the proposal \ncurrently before the Senate. There has been no give-and-take in the \nhearings process to try to figure out if there is a way to come up with \nan approach that would make sense to create a jobs bill. None of that \nhas happened.\n  You see, what this bill tries to do is seek to punish U.S. companies \nthat do business overseas under the very misguided assumption that \ndoing so will somehow result in economic growth and job creation at \nhome.\n  This bill would not create jobs. What it will do is hurt U.S. \ncompanies that do operate globally. Let's take a look at exactly what \nis in this bill and set aside the rhetoric.\n  The first part is a payroll tax holiday. I want to be the first to \nadmit that I supported the payroll tax holiday when the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, offered it during the stimulus debate. It is so \namazing because when that was offered by Senator McCain, our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle wanted no part of the idea whatsoever. \nInstead, what they wanted was to shove tens and tens of billions of \ndollars into government spending, leaving businesses essentially out of \nthe stimulus equation entirely.\n  Now we are seeing an eleventh hour, last-ditch effort that ties \nstrings and redtape to tax relief for businesses.\n  Yet this proposed payroll tax holiday is different from Senator \nMcCain's. Senator McCain, appropriately so, said: If we are going to \nget this Nation's economy going again, we need to include all employees \nin an attempt to bring money to the economy, back to the workers' \nwallets, where they could better spend or better decide how to spend \nthose dollars.\n  What we have here is just a narrow element--only for those businesses \nthat replace a foreign worker with an\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nAmerican worker. How many jobs will that really create? When faced with \na tsunami of uncertainties, ranging from increased taxes to a hostile \nbusiness attitude in this administration--a downright antibusiness \nattitude--will a business really choose to hire because of this 24-\nmonth supposed tax holiday? There are some business groups out there \nthat have answered that question for us. Let me quote from the chamber \nof commerce. They said this:\n\n       The concept of economic growth is not a zero-sum game. \n     Replacing a job that is based in another country with a \n     domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance \n     the competitiveness of American worldwide companies.\n\n  At a time when we have a 9.6-percent unemployment rate and an \nunderemployment rate in the double digits, do we really want to enact \nlegislation that will set back job creators and threaten our ability to \ncompete in this world? Why does it leave out mom-and-pop, Main Street \nbusinesses? Why are they left out in the cold? Even if these small \nbusinesses wanted to hire to get a 2-year payroll tax holiday, they \ncould not because they do not have any foreign employees. How absurd. \nThe payroll tax holiday before us today is designed to only help the \nbiggest of the big multinational conglomerates. Talk about standing up \nfor the little guy. Are you kidding me? It tells Joe's Garage or \nSmith's Tool Shop: You are just simply out of luck. Considering the \nfact that 65 percent of all new jobs are created by those small \nbusinesses--businesses such as those on Main Street in Nebraska--\nexcluding them from hiring tax incentives simply defies any rational \nlogic whatsoever. But that is, unfortunately, what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Let's keep examining the so-called jobs bill.\n  The next part of the legislation is a provision that would \nimmediately tax the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In other words, \nthe legislation would repeal the so-called deferral rule. Currently, \nfirms are able to defer taxation on their foreign-generated income \nuntil it is brought back to the United States. At a time of sluggish \neconomic growth, enacting policies that will threaten U.S. business is \ndownright unwise, and it is reckless economic policy. Repealing the \ndeferral rule will only further hurt the ability of U.S. companies to \ncompete against other companies around the world.\n  The United States imposes a 35-percent corporate tax rate. That is \nalready one of the highest in the world. In fact, we are behind only \nJapan in how aggressively we tax our corporate businesses. Only Japan \nhas a higher tax rate. The average for the other G7 countries is just \nunder 29 percent, while the group of industrialized nations that make \nup OECD average only 19.5 percent. Let me say again that we are at 35 \npercent. We are punishing the job creators already. How can we expect \nthese companies to compete with their foreign counterparts when the \nforeign companies have such a lower tax burden, when their countries \nsay: Look, we want these companies to be successful and have kept the \ntax burden low. How do our companies compete with that? The simple \nanswer is, they cannot. If we really want to spur job creation, we \nwould be lowering our corporate rate, not trying to punish our \nmultinational firms that are trying to compete in the international \nmarketplace.\n  Once again, do not believe me. Go to people who are in the midst of \nthis. The National Association of Manufacturers said of the bill:\n\n       Manufacturers are concerned that the bill's proposed tax \n     increases would impose new costs on American manufacturers, \n     making them less competitive in the global marketplace and \n     jeopardizing U.S. job creation.\n\n  Let me repeat the last piece of that: ``. . . making them less \ncompetitive in the global marketplace and jeopardizing U.S. job \ncreation.'' This is not a jobs bill at all. It is a political \npunishment bill.\n  Once again, the majority has sought to villainize a piece of our \neconomy hoping that somehow by villainizing them, it improves their \nchances. First, it was the credit card companies. Then it was the \nstudent loan makers. Next it was the insurance providers, the energy \ncompanies. And the list goes on and on. Unfortunately, this time they \nare trying to villainize companies that are trying to compete in an \ninternational economy.\n  But this bill also misses a very key point. A big part of the reason \ncompanies are not hiring is because of the vicious onslaught of bad \npolicy Washington is throwing at them. I talk with businesses in our \nState. They are paralyzed with fear over what Washington will do next.\n  Let me share a story. I had a business roundtable in an area of \nNebraska, Sarpy County, NE. A group of small businesspeople were \nsitting there. I was asking them: What can be done to help your \nbusinesses grow so you can hire people?\n  There was one lady there, and she said: Mike, I have a business \nfranchise in both Lincoln and Omaha. Our business in Omaha actually is \nnot too bad. But I have looked at this health care bill. I have \ngathered information on this health care bill, and I have come to the \nconclusion that if I grow my business beyond 50 employees, which is \nright where I am today, I get tangled up in this mess. I do not want \nanything to do with it, so I am not hiring.\n  That is what I am hearing all across our State. And this payroll tax \nholiday for those who bring back workers to the United States is not \nenough compensation for all of the other looming tax increases \nbusinesses are facing. It is not going to offset the problems that have \nbeen created by this onslaught of higher taxes and regulation.\n  I am so disappointed that in these last days before we recess, a \ndecision was made to take up such a flawed piece of legislation. Yet \nwhat is going to happen is this messaging attempt will take up our \ntime. We will recess until after the elections, and we will miss the \nopportunity to take an important vote on what is headed to be the \nlargest tax increase in our Nation's history. A vote on preventing the \nlooming tax increases would have given individuals and some businesses \nsome certainty about the future. We cannot expect any meaningful \neconomic recovery to occur until businesses are provided with some \ncertainty about what is happening in Washington.\n  Every day, I get calls from constituents. Every time I am home in \nNebraska, people are saying: Mike, please tell me what is going to \nhappen on these tax issues. Tell me what to expect on January 1.\n  I can tell you that it is no consolation to them for me to say: We \nare debating a bill that everybody knows is not going to pass. That is \nhow we are using our time between now and a recess that will extend \nwell into November.\n  It does not make any sense whatsoever. No tax credit will prevent the \npunitive measures that are headed toward our population. Again, do not \ntake my word. The National Federation of Independent Business has \ndescribed it this way:\n\n       Uncertainty about the economy and looming tax hikes has \n     kept this sector from hiring new workers, resulting in a weak \n     economic recovery and slow to nonexistent job growth.\n\n  The NFIB went on to say:\n\n       Congress can take an important step to address the \n     uncertainty by holding a vote and passing legislation \n     extending all of the expiring tax rates. No small business \n     owner should face higher taxes.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  As I go across my State--and I doubt it is any different in any other \nState--Americans are struggling to meet this month's payroll. They do \nnot need legislation designed only to gain political points at the \npolls. They want us to come here, to have a debate about what is going \nto happen on January 1 of next year, and that is the largest tax \nincrease in our Nation's history. These good people deserve real \nsolutions, not populous slogans meant to fool the electorate and \nsomehow gain favor between now and November.\n  I know what is happening out there, and if we all think about it, \nwhat we are seeing is the American people are not fooled. They simply \nwill not be fooled. They know that this latest bill supposedly meant to \ncreate jobs will not do a darn thing to address their concerns--looming \ntax increases, mounds of new regulations, and new 1099 paperwork \nmandates.\n  If I were going to design the perfect strategy for economic growth in \nour country, here is what I would say the people of Nebraska are \ntelling me. They are saying: Extend all of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nreductions. Why? Because\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nthat is what makes the most sense for our economy. They see this \nmassive tax increase out there, and they are asking themselves: How \ncould you let that happen in these economic times?\n  Second, they would say: Repeal the 1099 mandate. We had a vote on \nthat issue recently, as you know, Mr. President, on an amendment I \noffered. In that health care bill buried at section 9006 is a provision \nthat says to every small business, every large business, every medium-\nsized business in America: Thou shalt do it this way, and this way is \nthat if at any time during the year you buy more than $600 from any \nvendor, you have to produce and provide to that vendor a 1099 form and \nprovide a copy to the Internal Revenue Service. It doesn't stop there. \nIt also applies to churches, to nonprofits, to State and local \ngovernments. It is an absolute wave of new paperwork. One business \ngroup estimates it would increase paperwork by 2,000 percent. What have \nI heard from my businesses in Nebraska, especially our small \nbusinesses? They are saying: At a time when we need your help, what you \nare doing to us is burying us in paperwork, and we don't have the \nemployees to deal with this.\n\n  This is a crisis that is hitting our job creators, and I am extremely \ndisappointed with where we are today. We are literally not advancing \nthe cause of creating jobs in this country. We are taking a course of \naction, instead, that is all about populism, that is all about gaining \nfavor between now and November.\n  But I will say again: The American people have figured this out. They \nget it, they understand it, and they are watching us very closely. The \nbill we are debating is nothing more than an election year stunt, when \nwe could be acting to prevent the largest tax increase in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  In those 14 townhall meetings, as I traveled from the largest \ncommunity in our State--the city of Omaha--to some of the smallest \ncommunities in our State--Benkelman, in the very southwestern part of \nour State--I heard a common message. People wanted me to come back to \nWashington and fight for them against whom? Against a Washington \ngovernment that they think has lost touch with their real problems, \ntheir real concerns. They wanted me to come back and speak on their \nbehalf about what Washington politicians are doing to their businesses, \nto the job creation which this country depends upon, and to their \npocketbooks. They asked me to come back and speak on their behalf \nbecause they see this tsunami of legislation that has come their way \nand they do not like any part of it.\n  It is no surprise to me whatsoever that what we are seeing out there \nare people who are sick and tired of what is going on here. They are \nsick and tired of a health care bill that is raising their premiums, \nforcing them into individual mandates, and complicating business \ncreation literally to the extent where a job creator says to me: I \ncan't grow this business beyond 50 employees because of what you have \ndone to us in this health care bill.\n  It is a remarkable day in our Nation's history when the people of \nthis great Nation are asking their elected representatives to come back \nhere and fight against their government, but that is exactly what is \nhappening. They are asking us to stand for them and to say to what is \ngoing on here: Enough is enough. We have punished the American people \nwith endless regulations and with endless tax increases. At the end of \nthis week, every Member of this body will be forced to go home and say: \nIn a week where we could have made a difference and given you certainty \nand extended the 2001-2003 tax cuts, it wasn't done. Instead--instead--\nduring this time, politics was played and nothing happened; just like \nwe know today that politics is being played.\n  I think it is an unfortunate situation. I think we can do better for \nthe American people than what is being displayed.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this evening, we will be discussing--\ndebating--a very important principle; that is, whether we are going to \nfocus on making things in America and whether we are going to stop the \nincentives that ship our jobs overseas. This debate is about our \nefforts, through a bill we will be voting on tomorrow, to stop shipping \nour jobs overseas. That is what this is about.\n  We know we are in a global economy. We understand we need to do \nbusiness around the world, but we want to export our products, not our \njobs. Right now, we are exporting too many of our jobs. Frankly, there \nhas been no State that has been hurt more from this set of policies as \nwell as inactions than my home State of Michigan. No State has been \nhurt more.\n  For too long, we have not been enforcing our trade laws. We allow \nChina to manipulate their currency so they can bring products into our \ncountry at a cheaper price artificially, which is against WTO. It is \nagainst the law. But they have been allowed to do that. I am very \npleased the House is going to be taking action this week to address \nthat. A number of us, Senator Schumer and I, Senator Lindsey Graham and \na number of others, have legislation to do that, and we will be \naddressing that as we move forward in the Congress the rest of the year \nto get that done.\n  So enforcing our trade laws, stopping currency manipulation, stopping \ncountries from stealing our patents, from artificially blocking us from \ngoing in and selling to them, this is very important. But we also know \nthere are policies in place that have put the wrong incentives in \nplace--the wrong incentives. That is what the bill we will be voting on \ntomorrow will eliminate. We have two areas where we want to take away \nincentives right now to shift jobs overseas and we want to put in place \nan incentive to bring back jobs--three provisions in our bill.\n\n  There is an incentive to create American jobs by allowing a company \nthat, after the passage of the bill, brings back a job--hopefully a lot \nof jobs--to the United States sometime in the next 3 years. They would \nget a holiday of the payroll tax for 2 years, for 24 months, if they \nare bringing jobs back and it is clear that job was coming back from \noverseas. If they are stopping a job overseas, creating a job here, we \nwant to create an incentive.\n  We also want to take away those things that have encouraged jobs \nbeing shipped overseas. The second provision would deny business \ndeductions of any costs associated with moving jobs overseas.\n  The third provision would end corporate tax deferral of overseas \nincome.\n  Why in the world American taxpayers would want to subsidize \nessentially shipping jobs overseas through our Tax Code is beyond me. \nThat is what we want to change. Someone should not be writing off the \ncosts of moving the jobs overseas and setting up shop somewhere else. \nThis legislation would take away that tax deduction, that business \ndeduction for writing off those costs you use to ship jobs overseas.\n  I have seen the devastation in communities around Michigan from \nefforts where a business will close up shop and will take jobs \noverseas. In many cases it is over the river to Canada or down to \nMexico. I remember Electrolux, in Greenville, MI--it was 2,700 jobs in \na community of 8,000 people--making refrigerators. They were \nproductive, doing a great job. There was a second shift, in some cases \na third shift. But they decided a few years ago to close up shop, 2,700 \njobs lost, and they went to Mexico--where they could pay $1.50 an hour, \nby the way.\n  We have a Tax Code that would allow Electrolux to write off the \nbusiness expenses to take those 2,700 jobs down to Mexico. This \nlegislation stops that. It would provide incentives for bringing jobs \nback.\n  We cannot have an economy unless we are making things. That is the \nsecond part of what we are doing. We want to stop jobs being shipped \noverseas, but we want to make it in America. We want to make things in \nAmerica again. We do not have an economy, no country has an economy, \nunless we make things and grow things and add value to them. I am very \nproud to say in\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nMichigan that is what we do: We make things, we grow things, we add \nvalue to things. If we focus on making things in America again, we will \nnot only bring jobs back, we will bring the middle class back because, \nas we have learned painfully, after seeing the last decade a focusing \non cheap prices but not where things are made, that if we do not have \nmanufacturing in this country and if we are not focused on where things \nare made, we will lose good-paying middle-class jobs. We have lost many \nof them.\n  In fact, from 2001 until 2009 we lost 4.7 million manufacturing jobs \nin America. Nearly 27 percent of the jobs in manufacturing were lost \nduring the last administration, from 2001 to 2009. We want to turn that \naround. In fact, we have been focused on turning that around. We have \nbeen focused in a number of ways to grow manufacturing, for example, in \nthe Recovery Act with the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit--48C it is \ndubbed--which has brought a number of new businesses to Michigan and \nothers around the country, focusing on other kinds of clean energy \nmanufacturing, to make things in America. We have begun to see the \nmanufacturing numbers go up--way too slowly, but one of the ways to \nmake sure it moves more quickly is if we close the incentives to ship \nthe jobs overseas. If we close those incentives for shipping jobs \noverseas and, instead, put the right kinds of incentives in place, we \nwill bring jobs back and we will be able to partner with businesses to \nbe able to do that.\n  One example I was pleased to author in the Energy bill passed a \ncouple of years ago is a retooling loan program to help automakers and \nothers manufacturing to be able to retool older plants and to be able \nto bring jobs back. We have seen a wonderful case of that with Ford \nMotor Company bringing the Ford Focus production back from Mexico to a \nplant in Wayne, MI, partnering with the Federal Government on the right \nkind of incentives to retool a plant--from a truck plant down to an \nenergy-efficient, fuel-efficient car plant. Those are the kinds of \nincentives we need to have in place, not incentives that say if you \nship jobs overseas you can write off the costs on your taxes.\n  We know the kinds of incentives that can work. We have seen them \nwork. We have to have a much more aggressive policy about making things \nin America and making sure that we are closing the loopholes that have \nstopped the efforts to take our jobs overseas.\n  There is so much we need to do. I feel a tremendous sense of urgency \nabout this issue of making things in America because of my great State, \nwhere we make not only automobiles, we make appliances, we make medical \nequipment--you name it and somebody in Michigan is probably making \nparts for it.\n  We have created a whole generation and a middle class because of our \nability to make things in America. Then we see what has happened, where \nwe have seen the pressures coming in an international marketplace with \nother countries rushing to have a manufacturing policy--China, Korea, \nIndia, Germany, of course Japan--rushing to have a manufacturing \neconomy and doing whatever they can, cutting corners, not following the \nlaw, stealing patents, manipulating currency, and putting up trade \nbarriers.\n  We are in a marketplace where we have to fight for our businesses and \nour workers, to keep the opportunities to make things here in America, \nnot fold up and assume that your jobs are going to be lost and, in \nfact, incentivize that by tax policy.\n  The legislation we have in front of us is one of the most important, \nfundamental pieces of legislation that we have voted on this year, in \nterms of jobs and turning the incentives around. We want to make things \nin America and we want to stop shipping our jobs overseas. We want to \nincentivize companies to bring jobs back by giving them a 2-year \npayroll holiday for jobs that are coming back from other countries and \nputting people to work. We want to take away the ability to defer taxes \non profits made on businesses overseas and to use business deductions \nfrom the American tax system to be able to deduct from American taxes \nthose costs that are being expended to ship jobs overseas.\n  This is a time to be focused on fighting for America, on fighting for \ngood-paying jobs and for workers and for businesses that have done the \nright thing. People who do nothing more than get up and go to work in \nthe morning are proud of their skills. We have the best, most skilled \nworkforce, the best engineers. We create the innovation in this \ncountry. But our tax policies encourage that to go overseas to create \njobs. That is what this legislation is meant to address. This is about \nfighting for America, fighting for our American dream. It is about \nmaking sure that our priority is to make things in America again and to \nstop the policies that are shipping our jobs overseas.\n  I see my colleague from California here, who is such a champion on \nthis issue, who has spoken out so many times on behalf of her State of \nCalifornia. We share many things, actually, in terms of innovation. In \nfact, we talk about innovation oftentimes as created in California, \nthat we are buying it and putting it in our automobiles as well as \ncreating it ourselves in Michigan. We have a great partnership.\n  You have more computer power in your automobile than anything else \nyou own and we are very proud of that, and we are proud of the \npartnership we have--I am proud of the partnership with my friend from \nCalifornia, who is such a fighter for her people and a fighter for \njobs.\n  I will relinquish the floor at this time, but let me say this is very \nsimple and the vote tomorrow is very simple. We want to stop shipping \njobs overseas. We want to make it in America again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Stabenow for her \nleadership on this and so many issues relating to jobs--jobs here in \nAmerica. I had the opportunity to listen to a bit of the debate back \nand forth. I heard some of my colleagues who were not in favor of this \nvery important bill that we hope to move tonight, to reward companies \nthat produce jobs and create jobs in America and take away the tax \nbreaks from those who ship jobs overseas and then try to import those \nproducts back to America. We are saying let us reward those who create \nthe jobs here in America. That is as simple as it gets.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side say in a very convoluted \nway that when we give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, \nit actually winds up creating more jobs in America. I wonder if they \nhave met some of the people I met, who actually went to other countries \nto train their replacements. They went to other countries to train \ntheir replacements.\n  We just passed a very important small business jobs bill. I saw the \nPresident today sign it into law. It is going to create jobs right here \nin America because, guess what, it is setting up a lending system, a \ndeficit-neutral fund through our community banks. That $30 billion \ndeficit neutral fund will be leveraged to $300 billion and we will see \na half million jobs created through the small business community. They \nneed access to capital.\n  This is a good step. We cannot stop there. We have to do more. That \nis why, as we wind down before the election, we are trying to say to \nour colleagues: Please, all join together on the way out of this \nparticular session. We will be back after the election. But on the way \nout the door now, let's do something for the American workers, for \nAmerican families.\n  For too long the Tax Code has rewarded companies that ship jobs \noverseas. It seems to me it is common sense. You can make it complex. \nSome of my colleagues have made it complex. But when somebody tells you \nsomething like this--it is complicated--challenge them, because most \nideas are not complicated. People make them complicated. If you create \njobs here in America, guess what, we are going to give you a tax break. \nNot only that, we are going to give you a tax holiday, for the workers \nthat you employ right here in America. We are not going to say if you \nmove jobs overseas you get big tax break and big tax writeoffs. It is \npretty simple. That is it. People who oppose this, I believe, simply do \nnot believe it is important to create jobs here in America. I want to \nsee the words ``Made in America'' again.\n  Manufacturing is an essential part of our economy. We have to do all \nwe can\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nto promote a strong manufacturing base here at home. In my State of \nCalifornia, over 1.2 million Californians work in the manufacturing \nsector, and the products these men and women make contribute $180 \nbillion to our State's economy.\n  But in recent years, manufacturing businesses have left the United \nStates and they have taken their production lines to countries such as \nChina, India, Mexico, and hundreds of those of jobs left my State.\n  The number of U.S. companies with foreign manufacturing affiliates \nincreased 14 percent in the last 20 years, and it continues even during \nthe recession. I think it is important to make a distinction between \ncompanies that sell abroad--all right, we want that--and companies that \nclose down manufacturing here and then manufacture abroad and then \nreimport those products back to America.\n  That is what we are talking about. We want our companies to get out \nthere, make products here and sell them abroad. I think that is very \nimportant, and I want to reward that. I do not want to reward people \nwho close down their manufacturing plants and open a new operation \nabroad, produce their product, and then bring it back to America.\n  That is what we have been rewarding. A Duke University study tells us \nthe number of companies with a corporate offshoring strategy in place \nmore than doubled in the last 3 years. A lot of us know Senator Dorgan \nhas been a real champion on this issue of ending tax breaks for \ncompanies that shift jobs overseas. I was proud to support his measure \nto end those tax breaks at least four or five times. He has come to the \nfloor to tell the stories of American companies that have uprooted \ntheir production lines in the United States, relocated to foreign \ncountries, only to resell their products made by foreign workers to \nAmerican customers, while receiving a tax break for doing that.\n  What is so important about these stories is, it is not just the job \nlosses associated with companies shipping jobs overseas that hurts, it \nis that these companies have served as the center, the heart, of many \nof our communities. When a bicycle manufacturer closed its last factory \nin Ohio, 1,000 Americans lost their jobs to foreign workers who now \nbuild bicycles for American children to ride. So my colleagues on the \nother side can talk about how great that is for the workers, but 1,000 \nAmericans lost their jobs. That is clear.\n  On the day the company left town:\n\n       Nearly 1,000 union workers streamed from a dark factory \n     into the sun-drenched day. One worker, then another, then \n     dozens and maybe hundreds removed their shoes. They walked in \n     their socks to their cars and trucks and drove off the \n     property for the last time. In their wake was a parking lot \n     littered with rows of shoes set neatly on the asphalt. The \n     message: Try filling these.\n\n  When an appliance company announced it would leave Indiana for \nMexico, a woman who had worked decades at the plant wondered what would \nhappen to her friends and neighbors.\n\n       Will they be able to stay and find work? Where is our \n     community headed?\n\n  A candy manufacturer closed plants in Pennsylvania and Oakdale, CA. \nAbout 3,000 jobs were lost between the two shutdowns. At the Oakdale \nplant, a number of employees broke into tears when they were told of \nthe plant closure. Said a worker who had been at the plant for 26 \nyears:\n\n       I was one of the ones who was expecting it, but there were \n     a lot of people in denial who took it really hard. There were \n     a lot of people crying. It's shocking. It is so fast.\n\n  So my colleagues are going to tell you this is complicated. They are \ngoing to tell you: Oh, but you ship these jobs over here and we get \nmore jobs here. Talk to those people--3,000 jobs. Talk to them.\n  This is a quote from the executive director of the nonprofit \nCalifornia Commission for Jobs. He said the plant closure ``kind of \ntears at your heart strings because it is such a piece of Americana.''\n  There are so many examples in my State of companies shipping jobs \noverseas. Here is what they include: a medical device manufacturer that \nmoved 1,200 jobs to Mexico; a speaker electronics company in Chatsworth \nthat shut down its plant and moved to China; an aviation technology \ncompany that closed its manufacturing facility in Hayward and moved \njobs to China; a printer manufacturer in Camarillo that is moving its \nproduction line to China, costing 400 jobs; an optical lens \nmanufacturer that cut 700 jobs in Petaluma and moved production to \nMexico.\n  Here is the thing about our bill. What we do is very smart. We have a \ncarrot-and-stick approach. These companies moved American jobs \noverseas. They were eligible for tax breaks on their way out of town, \nand they are selling American products back to us, back to American \nconsumers, that used to be made by American workers. The Tax Code, as \nit is now, gives tax breaks to these companies. In so many ways it \nencourages them, encourages them to move. Close your plant and moving \nit to China. Right now, the Tax Code gives you the ability to take tax \ndeductions, tax credits, write off losses associated with closing your \nfactory and moving it overseas. It is wrong.\n  U.S. companies have taken great advantage of this tax benefit, \nslashing workers, moving production abroad, and receiving billions in \ntax credit as a result. It seems to me this must end, and we need to \nreward companies that stay in America, that stay in California, that \nemploy our American workers.\n  Earlier this year, we passed legislation to keep over 16,000 teachers \nin California in the classroom, and we paid for that bill by closing \ntax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas. That was an \nimportant step. But more needs to be done to bring those jobs back home \nto help American businesses invest in our economy.\n  I have talked to American businesses that are creating jobs here at \nhome. They are thrilled to do it. But they look at me and say: Why \nwould you reward people who pack up, move out, and slash the American \nworkforce? My answer is: I should not be doing that, and thank you for \nraising the subject with me.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It will end tax \nsubsidies businesses can receive for closing U.S. factories and moving \nthem overseas. Remember, we are not talking about foreign sales. So do \nnot let anybody confuse you on it. We are talking about manufacturing, \nproduction. We are talking about a company that produces a product here \nand decides to move that operation abroad. They are encouraged to do so \nby our Tax Code.\n  Today, we are saying--and we hope we get support from our \ncolleagues--let's end those incentives and incentivize those who create \njobs in America. The bill promotes job creation here at home. It \nincludes, as I said, a 2-year payroll tax holiday for U.S. companies \nthat hire new American workers to replace foreign employees, creating \nincentives for companies to bring jobs back home and invest in \nAmerica's economy--in America's economy.\n  When people say: I am a jobs creator, I want them to mean, I am \ncreating jobs in America, not in India, not in China, not in Malaysia \nbut right here at home. I want to see those words ``made in America'' \nagain. That is what this debate is about. I want to rebuild our \nmanufacturing base, creating jobs here at home by taking advantage of \nAmerican innovation to help lead us toward new technology, including \nclean energy technology.\n  We know the world is going green. Everyone in the world wants clean \nenergy. We need to create those right here in America--right here in \nAmerica--and export those products to the world. I am very proud of my \nState of California. We have led the way when it comes to creating \nclean energy jobs. But we should be incentivizing those companies and \nmaking sure they stay in America, that they do not move their \nmanufacturing abroad.\n  That is why our legislation is so crucial. The Pew Charitable Trust \nlooked at California through this recession. You know what they found? \nThat because of our clean energy laws in California, we have seen \n10,000 new businesses and we have seen 125,000 new jobs created and the \nwords ``made in America,'' again, are on those technologies. They are \nmaking the solar panels. They are installing them, and people are very \nexcited about this.\n  But if we incentivize companies to move overseas, we could lose that. \nWe want to be the innovators, the creators. We also want to be the \nproducers. So it seems to me, if we proceed\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\nto this bill, we are taking a big leap forward, and that leap forward \nmeans we are sending a clear signal: If you choose to create jobs in \nAmerica, we want to give you every incentive--tax breaks, tax \nholidays--for your employees. But if you choose to close shop and send \nthose jobs elsewhere, to China, to India, wherever, what we are saying \nis: You can do that, but we are not going to give you a reward for it.\n  It is as simple as that. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 578, S. 3816, a \nbill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create American jobs \nand to prevent the offshoring of such jobs overseas; that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The distinguished Senator from California said that if \nwe choose to proceed, we will have a vote tomorrow at 11:30 on this \nbill. I think her actions are premature, so I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I have come to the floor today in support of the \nCreating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act, which I believe, as \nwas well stated by the Senator from California, will go a long way \ntowards promoting job creation in the private sector and leveling the \nplaying field for American workers.\n  In recent months, reports have shown that retail sales are up, hourly \nwages are rising, and household debt is at its lowest point in a \ndecade. We have seen some particularly promising bright spots in \nMinnesota, where our manufacturing exports increased 19 percent in the \nsecond quarter to $4.3 billion.\n  Minnesota also has one of the lower unemployment rates, 7 percent, \ncompared to 9.6 percent nationally.\n  But while the numbers are starting to point in the right direction, \ntoo many Minnesotans, and too many Americans are still out of work. As \none of my constituents recently put it, ``unemployment may be 7 percent \nin the rest of the state, but it's 100 percent in my house. That is \nwhat matters to me.''\n  He is not alone. Nationwide, there are still 15 million Americans out \nof work, and another 6.6 million who have joined the ranks of the long-\nterm unemployed.\n  I received a letter from one of them just the other day--a \nconstituent of mine named Jon, from Northfield, MN--and I would like to \nshare what we wrote. He says:\n\n       I am 63 years old and I have worked my whole life. I lost \n     my job in January 2009, and I've applied for every job I've \n     seen since--even for some that'd pay half of what I \n     previously earned. What's being done now for the millions of \n     us without work?\n\n  The bill we are discussing today is not a silver bullet solution to \nour economic woes. But it will help answer Jon's question, a question \nthat is on the minds of millions of Americans right now.\n  First, it will create a payroll tax holiday for businesses by \neliminating the employer share of the Social Security payroll tax on \nwages paid to new U.S. employees. This will be available for 2 years \nand applies to any new American worker who is hired to replace a \nforeign employee.\n  For far too long, we have seen our homegrown jobs shipped overseas. \nIt is time to level the playing field for American workers, and the \npayroll tax holiday creates a market-based incentive for that. It \nencourages companies that might otherwise hire foreign employees to \ncreate jobs here at home--in places like Northfield, MN, not Mumbai, \nIndia.\n  Second, this bill will close the tax loopholes that have put our \nworkers at a competitive disadvantage, a provision that will also \nencourage companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.\n  That is important, but I want to point out that this bill is about \nmore than just job creation. It is about rebuilding our economic \nfoundation. It is about reviving our manufacturing base and moving away \nfrom the mindset of the last decade, a mindset that glorified debt, \nconsumption and the empty churn of money.\n  What we need now are policies that allow us to be a country that \nthinks, invents, and makes things again, a country where you can walk \ninto any store on any street in any neighborhood, purchase the safest \nproduct at the best price and be able to turn it over and see the \nwords: ``Made in the USA'' stamped on the bottom.\n  As Tom Friedman, the New York Times columnist and Minnesota native, \nhas put it, we need to be doing some ``nation building in our own \nnation.''\n  I often think about the opening ceremonies at the 2008 Summer \nOlympics in Beijing, the ones that featured that perfectly synchronized \n2,000-man drumming routine. Well, those drumbeats are only getting \nlouder and louder.\n  While China builds the world's leading solar energy industry, we \nsadly still have not passed an energy bill, despite some that call for \na renewable energy standard. While India encourages invention and \nentrepreneurship, we give our innovators the runaround. And while \nBrazil produces more engineers, we let our students fall behind.\n  The world is moving ahead fast. But we are not going to let it pass \nus by.\n  As a country, we have always been home to the most productive, \ninnovative, and resourceful workers in the world. I am talking about \nthe men and women who have mined, manufactured and constructed every \ngreat product of American innovation, from cars to airplanes to solar \npanels to satellites.\n  In other words, the men and women who are doing the kind of work our \ncountry was built on, the kind of work that made America great in the \nfirst place.\n  We have before us a bill that makes sure that work is done right here \nin America, in our factories, in our office buildings and in our \nmanufacturing plants. It is a good step towards not only rebuilding our \ndomestic industry, but towards putting more Americans back to work, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding--and I am asking \nthe Presiding Officer--that under rule VI, No. 4, at 7 we are going to \nbe presented with a live quorum call. Is that not correct? Is that the \nschedule for the Senate? I am asking to determine how much time I have \nbetween now and 7 o'clock.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is under the impression \nthat a live quorum call will be made at 7. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It says, for those who take the time to be familiar with \nproceedings of this distinguished body, that:\n\n       Whenever upon such roll call it shall be ascertained that a \n     quorum is not present, the majority of the Senators present \n     may direct the Sergeant at Arms to request, and, when \n     necessary, to compel the attendance of the absent Senators, \n     which order shall be determined without debate; and pending \n     its execution, and until a quorum shall be present, no debate \n     nor motion, except to adjourn or to recess pursuant to a \n     previous order entered by unanimous consent, shall be in \n     order.\n\n  So I thank the President for making that very clear. Hopefully, that \nsheds some light on what we are doing on a Monday evening, which some \nSenators would simply call a bed check. We are scheduled to vote at \n11:30 tomorrow on whether to proceed with a debate that has been taking \nplace here on the Senate floor. I think that obviously would be the \ntime for the debate. But I think I have about 20, 25 minutes here to \nmake my comments. I shall proceed.\n  We are really talking about a tax bill. I know the authors of the \nbill, the people who have spoken before, obviously think it is a major \nissue. It is a very important issue, but what we are really talking \nabout is bringing to the floor a debate that raises taxes on U.S. \ncompanies and makes them less competitive globally. I don't think that \nis a very good idea, a tax increase on these companies, given the \ndifficult times we have and given the difficult times we have in our \nexport markets, to make our U.S. companies that deal\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\noverseas less competitive. But I don't think we should be surprised, \ngiven that the majority has not yet acted to keep taxes from increasing \nfor families and small businesses--everybody--come next January. That \nis the real bill we should be considering. That is the bill we \ncertainly should be considering before we adjourn until the lameduck \nsession of Congress which I assume is still being planned.\n  It is most unfortunate that we are going to a lameduck session of \nCongress. I had a constituent say: Lameduck; that is going to be a \nDaffy Duck. I think that is a little harsh given the intent of both \nHouses of Congress, but what we really ought to be talking about is the \ntax increase that is going to take place in less than 90 days unless \nCongress acts. I know there was a great discussion within the majority \ncaucus as to whether we should move on that, whether we should take a \nvote on that, both in the House and the Senate. That is really why I \ncome to the floor.\n  This is a looming tax increase that will take effect next year. It is \ngoing to hit every American who pays income taxes. There has already \nbeen a great deal of debate about who will pay these higher taxes. The \nPresident and many of his supporters in Congress say they will not \nraise taxes on those families earning under $250,000 or individuals \nearning under $200,000. That was a campaign pledge of the President.\n  The American dream--or at least it was when I was growing up, and I \nhad hoped it would be for my kids and grandkids meant one could climb \nthe ladder of success, the ladder of economic success as high and far \nas they wanted, and nothing government-made or manmade would stand in \ntheir way, except they had to do the climbing. Now we find that when \nyou hit $250,000, if you are filing a joint tax return or if you are \nearning $200,000 individually--you are rich. They describe people who \nearn over $200,000, $250,000, and regardless of their obligations, \nregardless of whether it is a small business, and regardless of what \nthose circumstances may be, bingo, they are going to have to pay that \nhigher tax rate. So we have somebody in Washington describing in \nmanifest detail who is rich and who is not in the United States. I find \nthat to be the antithesis of the American dream, at least as I \nunderstood it. I think now there is a hue and cry of, let's level \neverybody with everybody else. I do not think that is where we want to \nbe in terms of our national intent.\n  The health care reform law has already broken the pledge in regard to \nthat of the President, the $250,000 and the $200,000, because that \nimposes a slew of new taxes on small businesses and health care \nconsumers, including those earning well under these income levels. So \nwe should be weary of any pledge by the President or the majority to \nprotect taxpayers from the harmful tax increases that are set to take \neffect in January. With less than 90 days--about 3 months--left in the \nyear, this administration and the majority in Congress have done \nnothing except talk about it in their caucuses and to find out where \nthe votes were and to find out how it was playing before the election. \nThat is the truth. Nothing to prevent this massive tax hike on American \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  Now it is September. I don't think most families are really thinking \nabout their income taxes right now. They should, but they are not. They \nput the frustration of April 15 behind them. Tax freedom day is \nsomewhere down the road in April or May. That is when you are paying \nall the taxes, and that is where all of your income goes to government \nand you finally have tax freedom day. That becomes something that comes \nto their mind right off the bat in the spring. But some families were \nfortunate enough to able to take a vacation as of this summer or late \nsummer. However, many were working instead and very happy to do so, \ngiven the situation in regard to jobs. They are just happy to have a \njob to provide for their families. But none of them are probably \nthinking about what is going to happen on January 1. They will be \nhanding more of their paycheck over to Uncle Sam. That is exactly what \nis going to happen if the administration and the majority in Congress \ndo not act and do not act soon. We should act before a lameduck \nCongress.\n  Some have dubbed this tax relief package the ``Bush tax cuts,'' \nsaying they only benefit the wealthy. Let me point out, that is simply \nnot correct. I don't see how continuing existing tax policy that has \nbeen in effect for 10 years constitutes a tax cut. It is preventing a \ntax increase. If we want to get partisan about it, it is not about a \nBush tax cut, it is about a President Obama tax increase that we are \ntrying to prevent.\n  Let's take a minute and look at how this tax relief passed on a \nbipartisan basis and supported by several Senators in the majority who \nare still serving in this body let's take a look at it and how it has \nbenefited families and small businesses across all income levels.\n  The bipartisan tax relief doubled the child tax credit from $500 to \n$1,000. This credit amount will be cut in half next year. The bill \nlowered capital gains and dividend tax rates to benefit families who \ninvest long term and save for their future.\n  These taxes will go up dramatically next year. If you read any \nfinancial publication, are aware of any think tank that deals with \ntaxes and finances and the economic outlook for this country, you find \nout that is going to have a dramatic effect--a very unfortunate law of \nunintended effects. Those taxes will go up, as I said, very \ndramatically next year by as much as 33 percent for capital gains and \n164 percent for dividends.\n  This bill lowered income tax rates for every taxpayer who pays \ntaxes--I am talking about the 10-year existing tax relief--whether you \nare a lower income taxpayer, a middle-income taxpayer or an upper \nincome taxpayer. So unless we act soon--and that is in the hands of the \nmajority--taxes will go up for every taxpayer as of next year, and that \nis the bill we should be considering now, not a bill that is going to \ncause quite a bit of harm to every company that does business overseas.\n  Here are just a few examples of what this will mean to working \nfamilies if the majority allows these provisions to expire: A single \nparent with two children who earns $30,000 will see a tax increase of \n$1,100 a year. A family of four who earns $50,000 will see a tax \nincrease, on an average, of $2,100 per year.\n  Clearly, these families are earning well below the $250,000 threshold \nthe President promised not to raise taxes on, these folks. Yet in just \n3 months, that is exactly what is going to happen. So you might want to \nthink about it, America, as well as what is going to happen down the \nroad a little bit. You have Halloween. That is about when the lameduck \nCongress comes back. You have Halloween and then you have Thanksgiving, \nChristmas--not the time you are thinking about a big tax increase that \nis going to whack you right in the forehead, but that is exactly what \nis going to happen.\n  The President's supporters in the Congress have yet to introduce a \nbill to prevent this tax hike. It is that simple. We certainly do not \nsee any language on a bill to prevent these massive tax hikes that go \ninto effect on January 1.\n  However, the President and his supporters in the Congress say they \nwant to extend tax relief for everyone but those taxpayers they say are \nwealthy. Who are these folks? Who are these wealthy taxpayers? Well, \nunder the President's proposal, and presumably the proposal supported \nby most in the majority, it is any individual who earns more than \n$200,000 in income per year or any family who earns more than $250,000.\n  I know there are some who earn much less than these amounts who think \nthat sounds fine. Well, maybe to some it does. It is always:\n\n       Don't tax me. I won't tax thee. Tax the guy behind the \n     tree.\n\n  There is a little bit of envy here that goes on among all of us, I \nthink, in our hearts when we look at people who earn huge salaries. \nSomehow, some way that we have now defined those people at $250,000 and \n$200,000.\n  I think that is unfortunate because we all benefit--we all benefit--\nwhen incomes increase and people become successful. That is how the \neconomy gets turned around. That is how we have people who are \nentrepreneurs and they invest and they provide more jobs. When incomes \ngo up and people have more of their own money to spend and invest as \nthey see fit, more businesses are started, expanded, more jobs are \ncreated and--guess what--more income comes into the government.\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\n  There is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting. If you do \nnot take more money out of people's pockets, you will see, I think, a \nburst of economic activity that results directly or indirectly to the \nFederal Government.\n  I was just reading in the Wall Street Journal an article about that. \nI intended to bring it over, but I failed to do so. You can just take \nit from me. When incomes go up and people have more of their own money \nto spend and invest as they see fit, more businesses are started and \nexpanded and more jobs are created.\n  To see the harm in raising the top two tax rates, to target those \nearning over the $200,000/$250,000 threshold, we only have to look at \nwhat allowing this tax relief to expire means for small businesses to \nsee the danger in allowing this tax increase to take place.\n  Because many small business owners pay their taxes on their \nindividual income taxes, if the top two income tax rates are increased \nas the President proposes, small business owners in these tax brackets \nwill pay those higher income tax rates.\n  The administration says these higher taxes will affect only 3 percent \nof small businesses, so we should not be concerned about raising these \ntaxes. If we have heard 3 percent, we have heard that enough over and \nover and over again: only 3 percent. But those numbers downplay the \nimpact of raising taxes on small businesses.\n  Let's look at what such a tax hike would mean for America's small \nbusinesses. Keep in mind, these are the same businesses that, by the \nPresident's own admission, are the Nation's job creators. They create \n70 percent of the jobs in this country--70 percent. Yet under the \nPresident's proposal, tax rates would increase by at least 17 percent \non small businesses.\n  According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, that means \nthree-quarters of a million businesses--750,000 small businesses--will \npay higher taxes.\n  Allowing the top rates to expire subjects nearly $500 billion--\nanother $\\1/2\\ trillion--in small business income to higher taxes. This \nis a very conservative number. Further, small businesses with between \n20 and 299 workers employ about 25 percent of the U.S. workforce. So we \nare taking action to raise taxes on 25 percent of the U.S. workforce.\n  These small businesses will have to recover the cost of higher taxes \nsomewhere. It may come from lower wages. Will they lay off workers? \nWill they reduce benefits or raise the cost of their products? That is \ndicey, given this kind of environment in regard to consumers and what \nthey are able to do. None are good options.\n  With unemployment holding steady at over 9 percent, common sense \nwould indicate, that raising taxes on those businesses that are \ncreating jobs is a very bad idea. As small businesses face a \nsignificant tax hike come January, workers will inevitably pay the \nprice. By one estimate, an increase in the top tax rate would cost jobs \nby reducing small business hiring by as much as 18 percent. That is 18 \npercent we do not need.\n  Raising taxes on small businesses will also likely slow the already \nweak economic recovery. We see a lot of headlines saying: The recession \nis over. But let's talk about the economic recovery we all wish--both \nDemocrats and Republicans, all of us wish--would take place. The \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, the NFIB, has said the \nsecond most cited concern of small businesses is taxes. As a result, \nsmall businesses are sitting on the sidelines until they know whether \nthey are going to be facing higher taxes come January 1. That ought to \nbe obvious. Small businesses need certainty about how much they are \ngoing to owe in Federal taxes.\n  Yet, once again, this administration's rhetoric on small business \ndoes not match the reality of its proposals. The administration says it \nwants to help small businesses, and it has touted the recently passed \nsmall business bill as proof of that. Yet this same administration \npushes through a health care bill that Americans do not want that \nimposes higher taxes on small businesses. Now it wants to raise taxes \neven further on these same small businesses by increasing their Federal \nincome taxes.\n  It seems a bit ironic to watch the majority touting the small \nbusiness bill that the President is, in fact, signing into law today. \nThey said small businesses needed this tax relief so they could grow, \nexpand, and create jobs. During debate on this bill, they criticized \nRepublicans for holding up important tax relief for these businesses.\n  So it is curious now, that many in the majority who supported this \nrelatively modest tax relief and who repeatedly stressed the importance \nof tax relief to small businesses are the same ones who oppose \nextending income tax relief that benefits small businesses.\n  Let me make it as clear as I can. The same members of the majority \nwho supported the small business bill and who insisted we must provide \nthem tax relief are the very ones who oppose extending income tax \nrelief that will benefit small businesses. That is a contradiction. \nThat is tough to explain, it seems to me. I am pretty sure a lot of \npeople are simply not going to understand that, especially in the next \nmonth or in November.\n  If it is so important to provide tax relief to small businesses in \nthis bill, why isn't it equally important to extend other small \nbusiness tax relief? We will not get our economy back on track until \nsmall business begins hiring, period, and they are not going to hire if \nthey have to pay more taxes in January on top of what they have already \nbeen burdened with in the health care bill. Yet that is precisely what \nthe administration's proposal will do.\n  Why would our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to allow \nincome taxes to go up at the end of this year for hundreds of thousands \nof small businesses? Why are we having a vote tomorrow on proceeding to \nanother bill that could be very hurtful in regard to our competitors \noverseas. How does that aid the economy? How do higher taxes help put \nunemployed Americans back to work? How does a higher tax burden allow a \nsmall business to grow and expand? How do higher taxes on small \nbusinesses aid the economy?\n  The answer is pretty straightforward. Small businesses are hurt by \nhigher taxes. They cannot hire new workers and they cannot buy \nequipment or a new building or make other investments that can help \ntheir business grow.\n  This approach by President Obama and the majority is absolutely the \nwrong approach to take if we want to ensure job creation and grow our \neconomy. We need to continue the tax relief passed in 2001, by a big \nbipartisan majority, that has lowered income tax rates for all \ntaxpayers and encouraged families to save and businesses to invest. \nContinuing this tax relief, rather than more spending, will help get \nour economy back on track.\n  What I usually hear from my friends--and I want to comment on it--on \nthe other side of the aisle, especially when you talk about tax cuts--\nyou say: tax cuts, and then, bingo, for the rich, for the wealthy. We \nare beating a dead ``class warfare'' horse, it seems to me. But that \nsimply is not an accurate picture of the massive tax increases that are \nfacing American families next year.\n  The majority has been in power for nearly 4 years. They have had \nplenty of time to address this issue, plus estate tax reform, plus the \nAMT, plus all the other things we say we are going to do as members of \nthe Finance Committee. I am privileged to serve on that committee. Yet, \nsimilar to a child who has not done his homework, they have put this \noff until the last minute, creating enormous uncertainty for families \nand small businesses.\n  They try to justify these massive tax hikes by saying this bipartisan \ntax relief contributed to the Nation's current fiscal problems.\n  The popular refrain Americans have heard from the President and his \nsupporters in the Congress is that they inherited the current deficit, \nand that it is a result of the tax relief we passed, again, on a \nbipartisan vote, in 2001.\n  But the numbers do not add up. Did you know the Federal deficit \ndecreased as the 2001-2003 tax relief took effect? The deficit stood at \n$412 billion in 2004 but dropped to $161 billion in 2007. That is the \nyear the majority took control of the Congress. I was here. I know. I \ncould list Senators on both sides of the aisle who made tremendous \nprogress in regard to reducing that deficit from $412 billion in 2004 \ndown to $161 billion in 2007--tough to do. We had Katrina,\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nhad all sorts of problems, Iraq, two major wars, but we did that.\n  Three short years later, the deficit has more than quadrupled and \nthis year is estimated to come in at approximately $1.3 trillion--not \nbillion, trillion. ``Trillion'' has become the watch word of the day; \nnot billion, trillion.\n  That is a direct result of the massive spending agenda the President \nand his supporters in Congress have undertaken, including a failed \nstimulus bill, bailouts of failed companies, and a health care bill \nthat a majority of Americans do not want--growing by the day when they \nfind out the details of the bill.\n  What is particularly ironic about all of this is that the President \nhas seen no reason to offset the billions in Federal Government \nspending that he and his supporters have put in place--billions in new \nFederal spending on a failed economic stimulus program and billions to \nfailed companies, billions that have contributed to the largest deficit \nin this country's history.\n  Further, the President has already said he doesn't plan to pay for \nthe cost of extending about 74 percent of the expiring tax relief--that \nis about $2 trillion--that benefits lower and middle-income taxpayers. \nI am for that. Everybody here is for that. And that number is actually \nexpected to go higher. Yet the remaining 26 percent of the tax relief--\nthat tax relief that in part benefits small businesses--the President \ndoesn't want to extend. Why not? Here is the kicker. He says we can't \nafford it.\n  We can't afford it? This, from the same President whose spending \nspree has driven up the deficit to unprecedented levels? The same \nPresident who spent well over $700 billion on last year's failed \nstimulus program? The same President who handed out billions in Federal \ntax dollars to failed businesses? That is right. The President says we \ncan't afford to extend income tax relief for small businesses to help \nthem create jobs, grow, and continue to employ more than 20 million \nAmericans who work for small businesses.\n  Well, we have a saying for this in Dodge City. It sort of resembles a \nlot of what we have in our Dodge City feedlots, but I am not going to \ngo into that.\n  A recent observation by Kevin Hassett and Alan Viard with the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute writing in the Wall Street Journal sums \nthis up very nicely:\n\n       The administration is right to view the deficit as a \n     serious issue, but this sudden commitment to fiscal \n     responsibility is bizarrely inconsistent. The administration \n     professes deep concern about the $700 billion revenue loss \n     from extending the tax cuts at the top, but apparently views \n     the revenue loss of nearly $2 trillion from extending the tax \n     cuts for the middle class as too inconsequential to mention.\n\n  I repeat, again, we are all for that.\n\n       They continue:\n       Nor has the administration's concern about the deficit \n     driven it to reduce federal spending.\n\n  That is the key. It seems to me it is disingenuous for this \nadministration to say we cannot afford to provide tax relief that helps \nsmall business and gets our economy moving in the right direction when \nthe same administration has pursued failed policies of unrestrained \nspending that do little but grow the deficit.\n  We can and should provide tax relief to all taxpayers, and that \nshould be the business of the day, not a live quorum call or a bed \ncheck and then go out this week and then come back in a lameduck \nCongress to debate that. Then it would be, what, 40 days before the ax \nwould fall in regard to every American paying more taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you. We can and should provide tax relief to all \ntaxpayers--tax relief that helps families keep more of their hard-\nearned dollars and tax relief that provides certainty to small \nbusinesses so they can make investments and create jobs without the \nfear that their taxes will go up. We need to extend this tax relief \nthat keeps money in the hands of families and small businesses rather \nthan putting it in the pocket of Uncle Sam.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time that the distinguished \nPresiding Officer granted me.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 5 Leg.]\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Bond\n     Cardin\n     Collins\n     Kohl\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Merkley\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Vitter\n     Webb\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to \nrequest the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A quorum is present.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto S. 3816. The time is organized in 30-minute alternating blocks.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3072\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside and that the Committee on Environment and Public\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\nWorks be discharged from further consideration and the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 3072, introduced by my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, that would delay for 2 years \nU.S. EPA implementation of carbon regulations; I further ask unanimous \nconsent that if the majority is serious about protecting American jobs, \nthat we must be allowed to take bipartisan action to protect the \nAmerican people from the backdoor national energy tax coming in the \nform of new job-killing carbon regulations from EPA; that the bill be \nread three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \ncolleague from Missouri, clean energy jobs are the jobs of the future. \nAs we create more clean energy jobs, we will find a way to compete with \nChina and other nations that are trying to take over this whole area. \nThey know the whole world is moving toward more sensitivity to \nemissions and the environmental damage they cause. As a result of that, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the regulations the EPA is proposing will \nhit every American family with higher electric bills, more expensive \nfood and clothes, and more pain at the pump. American workers, \nespecially those in energy-intensive manufacturing jobs, will face job \nloss or more difficult job prospects.\n  We have bipartisan language. Six Democrats have already stated on the \nfloor they favor this. Whatever one thinks about the cap and tax, I \nbelieve there is a strong majority who thinks a regulatory agency \nshould not establish it bureaucratically.\n  There is a lot of work we need to do in energy. We need to develop \nour own energy. When we talk about nuclear power, when we talk about \nclean coal technology, when we talk about biofuels and woody biomass, \nall of these things are good. But when we talk about wind power and \nsolar power, how much is it going to cost us? We have found that the \ncosts are overwhelming.\n  I welcome a discussion of this issue, but the first thing we need to \ndo is make sure our country is not shut down by overreaching EPA \nregulations. That is why I proposed the unanimous consent request. I \nunderstand the leader on the majority side has promised we can vote on \nthe Rockefeller bill. We need to vote by the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3617\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I will offer a unanimous consent request \nin a moment that will permanently lock fairness into the Tax Code.\n  American taxpayers are currently allowed to deduct either State \nincome or sales taxes on their Federal tax return. Americans who live \nin States with a State income tax have always been able to deduct their \nState taxes. Since passage of the 1986 tax reform, Americans living in \nStates without a State income tax have been out of luck.\n  With the leadership of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Congress \nresponded by reinstating a deduction for State sales tax. This \nprovision provided financial relief for millions of taxpayers, and it \nbrought back some fairness to the Tax Code. Americans in States that \nhave no income tax, such as Wyoming, Texas, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, \nSouth Dakota, and Washington, finally received relief similar to \nindividuals in States with State income taxes.\n  The sales tax deduction needs to be made permanent. Now is not the \ntime to raise taxes on American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3617; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and the text of S. 35, a bill to provide a permanent \ndeduction for State and local general sales taxes, be inserted; I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. This is one \nprovision we need to pass. There are, however, many other provisions we \nneed to pass. They are in the category of tax extenders.\n  Clearly, the State and local sales tax deductions should be passed \ninto law. Senator Murray from the State of Washington has been working \nhard. Washington, obviously, is a State that needs this deduction. \nThere are many States that need it.\n  Unfortunately, the provision called for by the Senator from Wyoming \nis not paid for. It is going to add to the deficit. I might add that \nthe other provisions that must get passed which expired at the end of \nlast year, I say with embarrassment, must be passed this year, and \nState and local sales tax deduction is one of them.\n  What are some of the others? Research and development tax credit, we \nhave not extended that. It expired in the last year, as did the State \nand local sales tax deduction. It expired in the last year. There are \nmany others that expired in the last year.\n  What is the Senate doing? The answer is nothing because the other \nside of the aisle would not let us bring up the package of extenders. \nThe Senator from Wyoming picked out one little one. The fact is, we \nhave to get them all passed; otherwise, many people are going to be in \na very disadvantageous economic position.\n  I object to the request made by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4994----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at this time, it is my understanding \nthat this time is reserved for the minority party.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the parliamentary procedure?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator wants just 1 minute, I would----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thought we were going back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4994\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--it is on the same subject--\nthat the Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 4994, taxpayer assistance; that the Senate then proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of the Baucus substitute amendment, the text of Calendar \nNo. 572, S. 3793, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the substitute \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \ntitle amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsay that Senator Thune has a bill similar in design to deal with a \nnumber of needed concerns and considerations, and in light of the fact \nthat Senator Thune's legislation has been objected to and not yet been \nable to get clearance from the other side, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                         Global Competitiveness\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the World Economic Forum recently \npublished its global competitiveness survey. It shows that the \ncompetitiveness of the United States has declined from first place in \nthe world to fourth place since President Obama took office in January.\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n  What is the main reason for this decline? Too much debt and too much \nspending. There are other reasons, but that is the primary one they \ncited. I would suggest that the proposals to drive up the cost of \nenergy by regulation and cap and tax--supposedly to create green jobs--\nare another form of anticompetitiveness that hurts our productivity as \na nation. A study of Spain, which has some of the most powerful \nalternative energy proposals and has taken some of the most dramatic \naction, has shown that even though there are green jobs created, the \noverall rise in the cost of energy in Spain has cost that nation more \njobs than were created by the green activities.\n  According to the Washington Post, a senior economist at the World \nEconomic Forum said:\n\n       It was government debt and the country's overall economic \n     outlook that pushed the United States down.\n\n  The article goes on to note:\n\n       Government debt affects a country's competitiveness by \n     limiting its ability to respond to crises or to make \n     infrastructure and other investments that could boost future \n     productivity. It may also lead to higher interest rates.\n\n  I would note also that the EU has a corporate tax rate of 19 percent, \nwhereas the United States has a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, and \nthat costs jobs in America. I talked to a CEO recently who said that \n200 Alabama jobs were lost because of the higher corporate tax rate in \nthe United States. We cannot sustain that.\n  How high is our debt today? It is $13.6 trillion or $44,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in America, and it is 93 percent of our gross \ndomestic product, which is significant because a famous study produced \nearlier this year by economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart \ndemonstrated that economic growth slows substantially--it reduces GDP \ngrowth by 1 percent--when debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP. We are \nalready over that. And when our economy is only growing at 1.6 \npercent--as it was in the second quarter--an extra 1 percent is a lot \nwhen you are talking about growth. They talk about a new normal where \nwe may be showing only 1, 2, 3 percent growth for years to come. So if \nyou lose a percent based on debt, that is very damaging to the American \neconomy. Well, do we have a plan to reduce it? Have we taken any steps? \nActually, the President's budget makes the problem worse. It shows that \nthe gross debt by 2019 would go to $23 trillion--106 percent of GDP.\n  Look at this chart on interest payments. It is so stunning that I \nthink every American needs to examine it. It reflects the analysis by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, our professional budget office that \nserves us, the leadership of which is hired by the Democratic majority. \nThey are good people, and this is what they have calculated. In 2009, \nthe interest we paid on all the debt in this country was $187 billion. \nBy 2020, they calculate that the 1 year's interest payment would be \n$916 billion--almost $1 trillion. This is a stunning figure. Last year, \nthe baseline budget--or at least 2 years ago--on highways was about $40 \nbillion. I think the spending on education totally is about $100 \nbillion.\n  So we are talking about $900 billion in interest now because the \npublic debt will triple from last year to 2019 under the budget \nsubmitted by the President. You would think we would be talking about \nthat in Congress and we would be dealing with a budget and plans to try \nto bring that under control, would you not? Surprisingly, we haven't \nhad any real discussion about the budget this year. Indeed, we haven't \ndebated the budget on the floor of the Senate at all. This will be the \nfirst year since the modern budget process was created in 1974 that \nCongress has not even considered a budget. It was not brought up. It \nhas not even been produced here.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased. I see my colleague from Mississippi \nis here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Let me make sure the people within the sound of our \nvoices tonight understand this. For the first time in the history of \nthe modern-day Budget Act, the Congress has not even brought forward a \nbudget plan to be debated, much less amended and voted on by the \nelected representatives of the people; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. And this is astonishing in light of what the Senator has \npointed out with regard to where we are going on payment of interest on \nthe national debt. Anytime we are paying interest, that is money that \ncan't be used for highways, for infrastructure. If someone wanted to \ntry a stimulus for small businesses by cutting their taxes, that is \nmoney that is not available to us for that purpose.\n  I wonder whether the Senator would like to talk about his particular \nplan, a bipartisan plan, that at least attacks the exponential growth \nwe have had in discretionary spending. I think the Senator has a plan \nwith the Senator from Missouri that would attack this issue at the \ndiscretionary level, virtually freeze domestic discretionary spending, \nand, at least for that small part of the budget, give us some relief; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct, and I thank my colleague for \nmentioning that.\n  Senator Claire McCaskill, my Democratic colleague from Missouri, and \nI have offered legislation that would essentially take the budget that \nwas submitted last year, which had a 5-year number. The first-year \nnumbers were not very good.\n  I will show some of the spending increases last year in our baseline \naccounts. I know my colleagues will find this hard to believe because \nit is so stunning, but the State Department and Foreign Operations got \na 32-percent increase in baseline spending last year. EPA got a 35-\npercent increase. Commerce, Science, Justice, that is, the Commerce \nDepartment and the Justice Department, received 12.3 percent. The \nTreasury-HUD number was 23 percent; Agriculture, 8; and Defense, 4.1.\n  So we have been spending rapidly, but the budget called for less \nspending this year and next year and the next year. It was a 5-year \nbudget. So we asked our colleagues: Let's, on a bipartisan basis, pass \nlegislation very similar to what was passed in the 1990s. That really \nwas a critical act in achieving a balanced budget in the late 1990s, \nand this action would say that if you went above that spending level, \nwhich is basically projected to be 1 percent or so, it would take a \ntwo-thirds vote of the Congress. This would help us maintain spending, \nwouldn't my colleague agree, if we had a two-thirds vote?\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senator would continue to yield, I would say that \nI think it would certainly be a start. And I daresay that if Senator \nSessions and I were the sole deciders on this issue, we might find a \nway to cut spending even further. But on a bipartisan basis, we ought \nto at least be able to say: Mr. President, let's bring to the floor for \ndiscussion a proposal that would virtually freeze domestic \ndiscretionary spending for 1 year.\n  I would commend to my colleagues a letter dated July of this year \nfrom every Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee pointing \nout, No. 1, the enormity of the Federal debt and the problem and direct \nthreat it poses to national security; the need for a long-term plan; \nthe fact that the committee is compelled, outside of a budget because \nwe didn't even get a chance to debate one, to come up with a top-line \nnumber; pointing out the Sessions-McCaskill legislation that would \nessentially freeze nondefense spending, and, importantly, every \nRepublican on the Appropriations Committee said we were committed to \nthat number. I think that as the American people begin to look at us, \nparticularly as we move toward this crucial vote on November 2, it is \nimportant for them to understand that Republican appropriators have \nmade that commitment and made it in writing as long ago as July of this \nyear.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I think that is important to note, and I would \nfurther note that every single Republican supported the McCaskill-\nSessions amendment, but also 18 Democrats supported that. I believe \nthat if we had the leadership just say yes instead of no, it would pass \neasily. It would be a healthy thing because it would send a message to \nthe financial markets worldwide that we at least have some fiscal \ndiscipline, and it would be very\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\nunlikely that spending would go above this level if we had a two-thirds \nsupermajority point of order to object to spending over that level.\n  I would note that the amendment is supported by a number of \nbipartisan groups, including the Concord Coalition, the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget, the National Taxpayers Union, the Heritage \nFoundation, former Congressional Budget Office and OMB Director Alice \nRivlin--she served under President Clinton--and former CBO Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin. So this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nwould bring us to a point that, I believe, we can say to the world that \nwe are going to stand by the numbers the President gave us last year--\nnot Republican numbers but the President's numbers.\n  Remember, the baseline budget increases are already there. So I think \nwhat we are really going to have to do--when we really get a budget and \nget some new leadership and get committed after this election, when we \nget a spanking by the American people--is to get budget numbers based \non the 2008 spending levels. It will not bankrupt us. The country is \nnot going to sink into the ocean. If we went back to the 2008 levels, \nthe 2007 levels, and then had some modest increases based on inflation \nrates, we would see an even larger improvement in our financial \nsituation and be more competitive.\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senator would yield one more time--I know we are \nlimited on time--some other people are scheduled at the top of the \nhour, but I think this is very important.\n  We were spending an enormous sum of money in fiscal year 2008. I do \nbelieve that in this crisis we have, we can get back to that level and \nmake do. That is so important in light of what this Congress and this \nadministration have done to the national debt in 3 short fiscal years. \nLast year, this government added $1.4 trillion to the national debt. \nThat is $1.4 trillion we spent here in Washington that we didn't have. \nThis year, it will be almost that much--$1.34 trillion. And if things \ndon't change, the national deficit, which will add to the debt, the \nnext fiscal year will be $1.42 trillion. It is a crisis. We need to \naddress it, and this legislation is a start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am going to be talking about a very \nserious crisis of offshoring, but before I do, I want to say a word \nabout the budget. I am glad to hear my Republican colleagues being so \nvery concerned about our budget deficit. My question is, where were \nthey during the Bush administration when the budget debt of this \ncountry nearly doubled? We went to a war in Iraq, which some of us \nvoted against, which will end up costing this country $3 trillion--\nunpaid for. I did not hear a concern at that point.\n  They gave many hundreds of billions of dollars to the top 1 percent \nin tax breaks, unpaid for. We didn't hear about the national debt \nconcern there.\n  They brought forth legislation to bail out Wall Street, unpaid for; \nthey passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug program, unpaid for.\n  I am very glad today our Republican friends are concerned about the \ndeficit and the national debt. It would have been helpful to this \ncountry if they had been concerned about that issue 5 or 6 years ago, \nwhile they were in the process of doubling our national debt.\n  But the issue I did want to talk about this evening is, as I think \nmost people understand, the middle class of this country----\n  Mr. WICKER. Was the Senator asking a rhetorical question or would he \nyield for an answer to that question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will be delighted to, when it is your time.\n  Mr. WICKER. Clearly it was a rhetorical question.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, one of the major reasons the middle class \nof this country is in decline and why the working class is being \ndecimated and why real wages are going down for millions of American \nworkers who are working longer hours for low wages is that for a number \nof years now we have been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs. While this \ntrend has in fact been going on for decades, it accelerated during the \n8 years of the Bush administration. During that period, those 8 years, \nwe went from 17 million manufacturing jobs to about 12 million. We lost \nsomewhere near 5 million manufacturing jobs during that 8-year period, \na decline of about 30 percent in manufacturing jobs. Today, here in the \nUnited States, we now have the fewest number of manufacturing jobs \nsince the beginning of World War II.\n  As Senator Durbin pointed out on the floor today, from 1999 to 2008, \nmultinational corporations based in the United States laid off nearly 2 \nmillion American workers at exactly the same time period as they were \nhiring over 2 million workers abroad. They laid off 2 million workers \nin this country and hired 2 million workers abroad.\n  Under President Bush, our trade deficit with China more than tripled, \nand our overall trade deficit nearly doubled. Today our trade deficit \nis over $370 billion. In other words, we are importing $370 billion \nmore than we are exporting.\n  There are a number of reasons why manufacturing jobs are \ndisappearing, but a very major one is that corporate America continues \nto increase its bottom line by hiring workers in China, Mexico, \nVietnam, and other developing countries instead of employing American \nworkers at decent wages in this country.\n  In my view, if large corporations want us to buy their products--and \nthey certainly do; you cannot turn on television without corporate \nAmerica telling us how much we should be buying their products--the \ntime is long overdue for them to reinvest in the United States and \nbuild manufacturing plants here and not in China. A country that cannot \nproduce the goods its consumers require and becomes more and more \ndependent on other countries for what it needs is not a country that \nwill remain a major economic power in this global economy.\n  The legislation we are debating today, the Creating American Jobs and \nEnding Offshoring Act, is a good first step. This bill uses the Tax \nCode to begin to bring more manufacturing jobs back into America. But \nlet us be clear: This is just a beginning. Much more needs to be done. \nThe simple truth is that American workers cannot and should not be \nasked to compete against desperate people in developing countries, \npeople in China, Mexico, Vietnam--other countries, where workers there \nare paid pennies an hour, where they may go to jail if they try to form \na union, and where there are very few environmental standards. It seems \nto me to be absolutely unacceptable that our people are forced to \ncompete against folks who are earning so little.\n  What we should be engaged in is a race to the top, not a race to the \nbottom. Yet that is exactly what is happening. If the United States is \nto remain a major industrial power, producing the products our people \nneed and creating good-paying jobs, we must develop a new set of tax \nand trade policies that work for the American worker and not just for \nthe CEOs of large corporations. The American people are sick and tired \nof losing decent-paying jobs to China, to India, to Mexico, as \nmultinational companies throw American workers out on the street, go \nabroad, produce their products for pennies an hour, and then bring \nthose products back into the United States.\n  In August I had about a dozen town meetings throughout the State. In \nevery single town meeting I had in Vermont, people stood up and they \nsaid: It is becoming increasingly difficult to buy a product \nmanufactured in the United States of America. How are we going to \ncreate jobs for our kids if we don't have a manufacturing sector?\n  I very much agree with that sentiment. We have to stop giving large \nprofitable corporations tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas and start \ngiving immediate tax relief to businesses that bring jobs back to the \nUnited States. That is exactly what this bill would do and that is why \nI am a strong supporter of it. But let's let there be no doubt, much \nmore needs to be done. As somebody who voted against NAFTA when I was \nin the House, as somebody who voted against Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with China, I think the evidence is now overwhelming that we \nneed to fundamentally rewrite our trade policy to benefit the middle \nclass of this country and to raise the living\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nstandards of people around the world instead of promoting a destructive \nrace to the bottom, which is what we are seeing now.\n  Supporters of unfettered free trade told us over and over how their \npolicies were going to lead to more jobs and a better life for the \nmajority of Americans. Unfortunately, they have been proven dead wrong. \nNAFTA turned a trade surplus with Mexico into a huge trade deficit and \nwe lost over 1 million jobs as a result. That is what NAFTA has done.\n  As a direct result of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, we \nlost over 2 million jobs to China and our trade deficit with that \ncountry nearly tripled. Anyone who has shopped at a Wal-Mart or any \nother large store in this country knows it is almost impossible to find \nanything made in the United States of America today. We are not just \ntalking about sneakers; we are talking increasingly about high-tech \nproducts.\n  Let me give a few examples. Today, 80 percent of toys sold in the \nUnited States are made in China. Today, about 90 percent of vitamin C \nsold in the United States is made in China. Today, 85 percent of \nbicycles sold in the United States are made in China. Today, over 80 \npercent of all shoes sold in the United States are made in China. \nToday, about 90 percent of U.S. furniture production has moved to \nChina. On and on it goes.\n  We have to recognize that if this country is going to remain a major \neconomic force in the global economy, if we are going to have decent \njobs for our kids and our grandchildren, we must rebuild the \nmanufacturing sector of this country. We must demand and develop \npolicies that enable corporate America to start rebuilding our \nmanufacturing sector rather than moving abroad in underdeveloped \ncountries. The legislation we have before us is a good start but, as I \nhave indicated before, much more has to be done. I hope when we come up \nwith a cloture vote tomorrow we can at least get the support of several \nRepublicans, just a couple who are prepared to stand with the American \nworker, who are prepared to help us rebuild our manufacturing base so \nwe can create the desperately needed good jobs we have to build.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish to echo the comments of the \nSenator from Vermont who has been discussing and debating and \ncritiquing and understanding these issues of job sourcing as well as \nanybody in this institution. I am incredulous that we are fighting to \nbring this legislation to the floor, this legislation which will help \nus rebuild our industrial base, which will help us create, enlarge, \nstrengthen the middle class, which helps us with our budget deficit and \nour trade deficit and will help us again become a country that knows \nhow to make things.\n  In my State of Ohio we know how to make things. We know how to make \nchemicals and paper and cement and steel and autos and aluminum and \nglass. We led the Nation in many of those things. Yet look around and \nwe see what has happened in our country.\n  The bill we are debating today is about helping Americans, not \nappeasing the Fortune 500, which is what the Republicans are doing \ntonight. It is about saving jobs. It is not about padding corporate \nbonuses. As they have done again and again over the last year and a \nhalf, my Republican colleagues are selling out the middle class.\n  I wonder if my Republican colleagues have met people who have lost \ntheir jobs to China; if they know anybody who has seen a plant close \nand they know what it does to the family. They lose their job, they \nlose their health insurance, they sometimes lose their house. They have \nto explain to their teenage children: Sorry, we are going to have to \nmove. You are not going to have your own room anymore. I am not even \nsure what school district you are going to go to.\n  Do they know people such as that when they stand up on an issue this \nimportant, and their answer is to talk about the budget deficit as if \nthey didn't run the largest surplus in American history 10 years ago \ninto the largest budget deficit in American history in 8 short years of \nGeorge Bush government, of tax cuts to the rich, wars that were not \npaid for, bailouts to the drug and insurance companies in the name of \nMedicare privatization, deregulation of Wall Street and these trade \nagreements that continue to send jobs overseas?\n  Let me put up a chart here to show some examples in my State of some \ncompanies that are pretty well known: ``American Standard Company \nfactory in Tiffin To Close.'' If you go into a restroom, most of the \nplumbing equipment was once made by American Standard in Tiffin, OH. \nBain Capital out of Massachusetts, Governor Romney's company, came in \nand basically did away with that company.\n  ``Etch A Sketch Leaves Home.'' Etch A Sketch is called the Ohio Art \nCompany, in Bryan, OH.\n  A small town at the corner of Senator Stabenow's Michigan and \nIndiana. Walmart came to Ohio Art Company and said: We want to make \nEtch A Sketch. We want to sell it at Walmart for under $10. The only \nthing that Ohio Art Company could do was shut down that part of the \nfactory and move it to China.\n  One hundred years of vacuum cleaner production comes to an end in \nStark County in Canton, OH. Same story. To the lowest bidder go the \nlowest paying jobs. Huffy Bicycle, Celina OH, on the Indiana border. \nSenator Dorgan has talked about what happened to Huffy Bicycle. So they \nmoved that bicycle production to China. These were good-paying, \nindustrial, union jobs usually--not all union jobs. They do not have to \nbe union jobs. But they were jobs that created a middle class.\n  But do you know what has happened? Not since colonial times has \nAmerican business had a business plan where they lobby Congress to \nchange the rules. My Republican friends all go along with them because \nit is part of the big corporate agenda; they lobby Congress to change \nthe rules, they then shut down their plants. In Burlington, VT, in \nProvidence, RI, in Detroit, MI, and Toledo, OH, they shut down their \nplants, they move them to China, they obviously exploit the lowest paid \nworkers they can get.\n  They then sell the goods back to their home country. They shut down \nthe plants here, they move them 7 or 8 or 9 or 10,000 miles away. Then \nthey sell the produced products back home to the United States. Look \nwhat that does to individual people.\n  Again, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, do they know \npeople who lost their jobs when a plant closed and went to Mexico? Do \nthey know people who lost their health insurance when a plant shut down \nand went to China? Do they know people who had their homes foreclosed \non because they lost their jobs and their health insurance and they \nhave nowhere else to turn?\n  Yet, instead of debating this, instead of their standing and arguing \nin support of these tax laws and trade laws that have started to \nbankrupt our country, and surely have caused our industry to decline, \nthey just change the subject. They do not want to debate it. Senator \nDurbin said--and I would echo it and make the same offer. I will go to \nany State in the country with any of my Republican colleagues and we \nwill have an open, fair debate on this tax law and on this trade law.\n  I would love to go anywhere in the United States and have a public \ndebate to show the public and show the American people how much this \nhas undermined our sovereignty, our wealth, our manufacturing base. \nThey are not willing to debate it. But when we bring this forward, you \nknow they will object, and you know what the Senate rules are. One \nperson can stand and object and we cannot pass the bill. They are more \ninterested, way more interested in scoring political points than they \nare in debating the merits and showing what exactly we need to do as a \nnation to begin to restore our manufacturing base.\n  I would conclude with this. I hear my Republican colleagues talk and \nbe critical of everything President Obama has done. That is fine. That \nis politics. But what they are arguing that we should do is go back to \nthe policies that got us into this.\n  Let me put in a little bit of historical context. Eight years of \nPresident Clinton, January 20, 1993, to January 20, 2001. Those 8 \nyears, 22 million private sector net job increase in this country. \nEight years, from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009, 8 years of \nGeorge\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nBush, 1 million jobs created, not enough to even keep up with an \nincrease in population.\n  The 8 years of President Clinton, wages went up for the great \nmajority of Americans. Eight years of George Bush, wages went down for \nthe majority of Americans. Eight years of Bill Clinton, at the end of \nhis eighth year, he left a budget surplus that was the highest in \nAmerican history. After 8 years of George Bush, he left a deficit that, \nat the time, was the highest in American history, and they have the \ngall to be critical of everything Barrack Obama has done, like he \ncreated this.\n  They have the gall to argue that the voters should choose them to go \nback to the same philosophy. They are not saying do anything different. \nThey still say tax cuts for the richest Americans. They still say \nprivatization of Medicare and privatization of Social Security. Thank \nGod we did not pass that 5 years ago.\n  They still say more trade agreements that outsource jobs. They still \nsay do not change the tax laws no matter how much damage they have done \nto us. They still say we should deregulate Wall Street. That is the \ncontrast. That is what this debate is all about, the contrast.\n  Do we want to move forward? Do we want to move forward and write tax \nlaw and trade law that will create a middle class so we do not see \nanother American Standard close in Ohio and another Ohio Art Company \nclose and another vacuum cleaner producer and another Huffy Bicycle \ncompany close in Ohio and move offshore.\n  In the end, it speaks volumes about Republican loyalties, loyalty to \nthese large corporations that outsource jobs, no real loyalty to \ncommunities, no real loyalty to these small companies, and no real \nloyalty to workers. When a plant closes, we know the heartache it \nbrings to the worker, to the families. We know the damage it does to \ncommunities as they lay off teachers and firefighters and mental health \ncounselors and libraries and police officers and we know what it does \nto the wealth of our country and the standard of living of far too many \npeople.\n  The question ultimately is: Whose side are you on? One thing for \nsure, it is clear who is on the side of working families in \ncommunities. That is why this legislation is so important. That is why \nwe need to move on fixing our trade law and our tax law, so \nmanufacturing jobs begin to move back to this country, and we can \nprotect that industrial base that is so important for our national \nsecurity and so important for the economic security of our families and \nof our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague who \nhas spoken before me. The reason we are here tonight is because \nSenators Brown and Sanders said: Why talk about outsourcing of jobs, \nlet's do something about it. That is what we are trying to do tonight. \nWe are trying to actually do something about it. This is not just \nverbiage.\n  We see before us the faces of the people who have lost their jobs. We \nsee the families, we hear the children, and so there is an urgency to \ndo something. Every place I go in New York--it can be in upstate, an \nold manufacturing place; it can be on Long Island, supposedly the new \neconomy--I hear about jobs leaving New York and leaving America and \ngoing overseas.\n  Then, there is some talk as if this is inexorable. It is not \ninexorable. That is what we are here to say tonight. We can do \nsomething to stop this, and stop it we must. Manufacturing used to be \nthe backbone of our economy. It supported millions of families, was the \nstaple of middle-class communities. It is no secret what happened.\n  Company after company after company began sending jobs to China and \nVietnam and Malaysia, to Mexico and Brazil and parts of South America. \nThese countries have lax enforcement of work rules, environmental \nrules, and pay rules. So it is cheap to produce goods. We have heard \nthe statistics, how the United States lost millions of manufacturing \njobs in the last 10 years--in New York, 90,000 manufacturing jobs in \nthe last 3 years alone. One-third of our manufacturing base has \ndisappeared nationally. In fact, I recently read that the United States \nhas lost 42,000 factories since 2001, and 75 percent of those factories \nemployed more than 500 workers. The bigger factories leave. Forty-two \nthousand factories closed, most of them employing more than 500 people.\n  I think of the people I have met who have lost their jobs. I go \naround my State and sit down with people who cannot find work. They \ncome from all walks of life. I wish to tell you about Clay, a high \nschool graduate who rose to the top of his industry in tool and die. He \nhad a great life, married, six children, so his wife did not work.\n  Clay lost his job a year and a half ago because his company \ndownsized, because they were sending jobs overseas. Here is what Clay \ndoes every day, every week. He wakes up Sunday night in upstate New \nYork, drives down to Virginia. He looks for work in his field--he is a \nhighly skilled tool and die worker--in Virginia. Tuesday, he goes to \nWashington, Baltimore; Wednesday, to Philadelphia, Allentown and \nothers; Thursday, in the New York City area; and then goes back home \nFriday to find a job.\n  When he comes in the door Friday night, there is his wife and the \nkids, aged 2 to 14. You can bet a majority of them look at him and say: \nWell? These are not just statistics. There is a Clay in every \ncommunity, many Clays in every community. That is just manufacturing.\n  Service sector jobs are going. I think of Dorothy, whom I met. \nDorothy lost her job in the service industry, also because the company \nwas moving jobs overseas. Dorothy told me she lost her job in June of \n2008. I talked to her in January of 2010. She is about 50, did not have \na family. Her life was her work. She loved her job. Here is what \nDorothy told me. When you sit down and talk to people who have lost \ntheir jobs, little things stick with you. Here is what Dorothy told me. \nShe said: Christmas morning I usually wake--she is a religious person. \nShe goes to church and then goes to open the gifts with her nieces and \nnephews who are in her community.\n  She said: Do you know what I did this Christmas morning? I got up at \n6 a.m. and I went online because I had this brilliant idea the night \nbefore, that maybe there would be jobs posted Christmas morning and no \none else, everyone else would be too busy to go online and I would find \nit and get the job.\n  These are the people we are talking about. Whether it is in \nmanufacturing or service, one of the most cited studies--and it is \ncited among conservatives--predicted that by 2015, 3.3 million U.S. \nservice jobs will have moved offshore. So if you think you are safe \nbecause you are in a manufacturing job, forget it. No one is safe. No \none. Whatever your income level is, whatever part of the country you \nare in, whatever industry you are in, no one is safe. By one estimate, \nabout one-fourth of all U.S. jobs possess characteristics that make \nthem susceptible to outsourcing within the next 10 to 20 years.\n  Sherrod Brown, my colleague, talked about Ohio and New York. Fisher \nPrice Toys, well known. Three locations in western New York--started \nthere. In 1990, they stopped manufacturing in East Aurora and Holland. \nIn 1997, they closed the plant in Medina. Two thousand jobs were lost \nwhen the three manufacturing plants closed. In 2001, they moved all \ntheir manufacturing to Mexico. Fisher Price still has a call center in \nEast Aurora as well as its headquarters. Now they are considering \nmoving the call center to India--both manufacturing and service.\n  Syracuse China. Famous. Founded in 1871. These are companies that go \nwith the communities. They started and grew with them. It is in Geddes, \na suburb of Syracuse. Onondaga Pottery Company is what the name was \nwhen it started.\n  If you went to a restaurant or a hotel, you were eating off Syracuse \nChina, one of the region's oldest manufacturers. In 2008, after \nconsiderable downsizing, they closed their plant in Salina, 275 jobs. \nYou can still get Syracuse China. It says ``Syracuse China'' on the \nplate or on the cup or on the saucer, but it is made in China, not in \nSyracuse.\n  Watson Pharmaceuticals, high-end company, Putnam County. Five hundred \njobs, high-end jobs in Putnam County, a growing suburb, moved to India.\n  NXP Semiconductors. Again, you think: Oh, semiconductors, that is a\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nbig, new growing industry. I am going to be safe--600 jobs. East \nFishkill, Dutchess County. Europe and Singapore.\n  Pfizer, largest pharmaceutical company in the world, used to have \nsignificant manufacturing operations in Rockland County. But as part of \ntheir worldwide restructuring, after Pfizer purchased Wyeth, 1,500 jobs \ngone to Ireland, Belgium, Canada, Puerto Rico.\n  We could all tell a few stories in every one of our States. I guess \nsome of us, I hope everyone on both sides of the aisle knows the \nDorothys and the Clays and the others who give this reality.\n  But there is another element to this debate. When companies move \nproduction overseas, it takes a human toll. Here is the most telling \nstatistic of the last 10 years. From 2001 to 2007, a period of \nprosperity, median income went down. Even though we were prosperous, \neven though average income went up, wealth went up, GDP went up, but \nfor the average middle-class person, income buying power went down. \nThere are no statistics, but it would be hard not to assume that a good \namount of it was because of outsourcing.\n  Last week, there were headlines quoting economists saying that, \ntechnically speaking, the recession was over. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, to the average middle-class person whose paycheck is lower \nbecause they have less income, the recession ain't over. To most \nAmericans, it sure doesn't feel like a recovery yet. The bottom line is \nthat there won't be a true recovery until we create jobs in America, in \nthe U.S.A. If we want to get our economic prosperity back, we need to \nbring the jobs back. We need to have ``make it in America'' become a \nreality on the floor of this Senate legislatively.\n  With this bill, we make our boldest attempt to reverse the trend of \noutsourcing. We do it in three ways.\n  First, the legislation eliminates tax breaks for firms that move \nfacilities offshore.\n  Amazingly, right now if a company were to shut down a factory in \nSyracuse and move those jobs overseas, the company could deduct from \ntheir taxes the expense of closing that factory and the expense of \nshipping the materials. This legislation would end that.\n  Second, the legislation ends the Federal tax subsidy that rewards \nU.S. firms that move their production overseas. Under current law, U.S. \ncompanies can defer paying U.S. tax on income earned overseas until \nthat income is brought back to the United States. This provides an \nincentive to keep that income overseas and employ people there.\n  Our bill says that if you close down your operations here in the \nUnited States and reopen overseas, you no longer get to defer paying \nyour taxes.\n  This should be a no-brainer.\n  It is perverse that American taxpayers provide benefits to firms that \noffshore jobs. By rewarding the companies that bring jobs back to \nAmerica, this legislation puts the incentive back where it should be.\n  Some say that this provision puts U.S. companies who open foreign \nsubsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage to U.S. companies that \ndon't. But I say that is just plain false. Under current law, if you \nhave two companies in Oswego that are both going to expand capacity and \ncreate 100 jobs, our Tax Code puts the company that chooses to keep the \nplant in Oswego at a competitive disadvantage over the company that \nchooses to move jobs to China. Our bill would level the playing field, \nso that companies that keep jobs here aren't penalized.\n  These two measures will go a long way towards fixing the problem of \noutsourcing. But our bill doesn't just rely on sticks, it also contains \na big carrot.\n  That carrot comes in the form of a major tax cut. We propose giving \ncompanies a tax cut--an actual cut, not a credit--for every position \nthey bring back to America from overseas.\n  As long as the company can prove the employee is doing work that was \nonce done overseas instead, the company won't have to pay the 6.2 \npercent social security payroll tax for that employee over a two year \nperiod.\n  For a $60,000 factory worker, that is a $7,440 tax cut. For a \n$100,000 manager, it is a $12,400 tax cut. That is real money. And it \nis not a tax credit that a business has to wait a year to receive. It \nis tax revenue that isn't collected in the first place, much like the \nHIRE Act that we passed back in March. So it is a tax cut that puts \ncash right in the pocket of a business, small or large, with no strings \nattached.\n  For once, rather than reward outsourcing, let's give employers an \nincentive to bring jobs home. I don't think that anyone who supports \nthe motion to proceed on this bill believes that this modest piece of \nlegislation is a silver bullet that will end offshoring. We need to do \nmuch more. We need to enforce our trade laws; we need to push China on \nits currency practices; we need to reform our tax code to make it \nsimpler and more streamlined and representative of the modern economy; \nwe need to get our fiscal house in order; we need to invest in science \nand education and infrastructure. We still have a lot to do to put \nAmerica firmly on the road to prosperity.\n  But every step counts.\n  Earlier this year, as I just mentioned, this chamber passed the HIRE \nAct, a measure I worked on with Senator Hatch. It provided a payroll \ntax break for companies that hired an unemployed American. Already, \nthrough September, 5.6 million eligible employees have been hired under \nthe act.\n  Just today, President Obama signed the small business bill that \nRepublicans repeatedly tried to block in this Chamber. As a result, \n1,400 small businesses signed the dotted line today on a loan that no \nbank would provide. That is $730 million worth of credit that flowed \njust today.\n  Under that same bill, eight new tax cuts for small businesses became \neffective today.\n  These are real results. So we should not stop trying things.\n  Right now, no issue bothers Americans more than the nonstop flow of \njobs overseas. With this bill, we have a chance to do something about \nit. We can help the American dream launch a comeback.\n  This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Every single one of \nus has factories that have closed. Families don't have it easy anywhere \nin the country.\n  Politics is supposed to stop at the water's edge. The flow of jobs \nshould, too.\n  So before we leave for the year, let's come together to take up and \npass this measure to reverse this trend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I am a little under the \nweather, so if my voice fades in and out, I will do my best to muscle \nthrough it. It has been a tough three against one in a battle like I \nwill have to do for the next half hour.\n  I enjoyed the signs. I didn't bring one. Maybe I can borrow that sign \nbecause I agree, it should be made in America. How are we going to do \nthat when we make America uncompetitive, when we don't give America the \ntools and the resources businesses need to be competitive worldwide? \nThis is not a U.S. economy solely where we just sell to Americans; we \nhave to sell and compete worldwide.\n  I know I have said this before, but I am the new guy. I am the second \nnewest guy here now. What I have observed is that there is plenty of \nblame to go around. We talk about President Clinton and everything \nwonderful he did. Yes, he did some great things, but he did it with a \nRepublican Congress and their help as well. It was a bipartisan effort \nto solve problems. Unless I am mistaken, the majority party has been in \nthe majority for the last 5 years, with the Presidency for almost 2 \nyears. You don't hear about the problems we have had since that \nhappened. I say there is plenty of blame to go around. Quite frankly, \nthe rhetoric is white-hot. We should try to solve problems instead of \npointing fingers at each other and saying that back then this happened \nor back then that happened and we should do it this way or that way. We \nhave to focus on today, what is happening today.\n  Right now, we are not competitive. To think this effort to so-called \nclose a corporate loophole is going to help--have you actually gone out \nto businesses and asked: Will this help you? Are you in favor of this?\n  It doesn't work unless we also lower the corporate tax rates to make \nthem competitive worldwide; otherwise, if we keep the corporate tax \nrate the second highest in the world, we are just\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\ngoing to chase huge amounts of jobs overseas. We are going to \nexacerbate the problem we are experiencing now.\n  I often wonder, why does it take the Chinese less than a year to \nbuild, say, a 500,000-square-foot building? I have experiences with \nshopping malls, just to put on an addition, and it takes years, the \nsiting, the permitting, the regulation at the local level, the \nharassment businesses get. If you are a business or a corporation, the \nmentality is that you are evil, that you are not good. We should be \nembracing businesses for employing. What is a corporation? Last I \nheard, it is a group of individuals forming together to take advantage \nof protections and opportunities to expand and be competitive globally. \nSince when did being a corporation become a bad name in Washington? Am \nI missing something? How do you think we are going to get out of this \neconomic mess? It is not going to be by hammering corporations and \nsmall mom-and-pop businesses and raising taxes in the middle of a 2-\nyear recession. Are you kidding me? It makes no sense. High taxation, \noverregulation, reregulation, siting, permitting--take the municipal \nlaws and regulations, couple them with State laws and regulations and \nFederal laws and regulations, then throw in the EPA just for the heck \nof it, or any other agency--the National Labor Relations Board; just \npick an agency--then throw in the taxation levels at the city and town \nlevels, State levels, the Federal level. Why do you get out of bed to \nturn on the lights? Are you kidding me? What is the incentive for \npeople to actually keep jobs in the United States of America?\n  In Massachusetts, the NFIB and AIM, Associate Industries of \nMassachusetts, have deemed Massachusetts the worst business climate in \ndecades. That feeling is around the country. When I got elected, they \nsent a very powerful message. They were tired of business as usual in \nWashington, the disconnect when we deal with taxes and regulation and \ndebt and spending. You don't seem to have learned the lesson.\n  We are going to do something right now where we are going to offer a \nlittle piece of candy by offering a potential tax break for closing a \ncorporate loophole. The majority party is apparently protecting Main \nStreet. Isn't that nice. Apparently, I, the new guy here, am protecting \nWall Street, apparently, and big corporations. I didn't know that. I \nthought I was fighting for the people of Massachusetts to get this body \nworking together to solve real problems.\n  Enough of the rhetoric. Enough of the blame. Enough of the posturing \nfor the upcoming November elections. How about just solving problems? \nHow about getting our country moving again and get us competing \nglobally?\n  We just can't wave a magic wand and all of a sudden the tax policy in \nthe United States is competitive with the world. If we do this, if we \nmove this forward, we will be in deep, deep trouble, especially if we \ndon't mirror it with a corporate tax rate reduction to counter the \nmoves that will absolutely happen almost overnight.\n  If you think that by doing this, jobs are going to come flooding \nback--if you fire a foreign worker and hire a U.S. worker, you get a \ntax credit. Oh, that will really work. How about if you do this, you \nget a payroll tax reduction. Correct me if I am wrong, I made that \noffer about 3 months ago, a payroll tax reduction paid for by \nunallocated stimulus dollars. I got four votes.\n  Want to talk about jolting the economy and giving money to people? \nWant to talk about helping corporations and businesses stay \ncompetitive? How about making the R tax credits permanent. How about \nfixing that 1099 mess? How about accelerated deappreciation for small \nand medium-size businesses to give them incentives to create jobs? Do \nyou know how much money is on the sidelines? I have done my homework. \nIn this position, I have to be prepared or else. Do you know how much \nmoney is actually on the sidelines?\n  Corporations and businesses are saying: You know what, the health \ncare bill, that is going to cost me about $440 million.\n  One corporation in Massachusetts, one of the biggest employers, has \nthe market on a device that saves people's lives; hires, I guess, about \n25,000 people throughout the world. If we do this, if we close this \nloophole, so-called, those jobs that were in Massachusetts in the \nUnited States are going. So let me see, it costs them $200 million \nbecause they are a medical device company. Then with the implementation \nof the health care bill, that is another $240 million. So that is $440 \nmillion. So where does that come from? R, employees, expansion? Why \nwould they hire or even talk about hiring workers? Why?\n  That is just one effort, one thing that has been passed by this \nCongress and this administration to crush jobs. It crushes \nMassachusetts' businesses and jobs. We already had 98 percent of our \npeople insured. Now we are getting lesser coverage, potentially longer \nlines, $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. Give me a break. There is no \nend in sight. The true numbers are coming out.\n  So why would a corporation or a mom-and-pop business or anybody who \nis even thinking of starting a business make that effort? Why would \nthey even bother to open the door? There is the high cost of doing \nbusiness, transportation costs, energy costs. They are concerned about \ncap and trade. They are concerned about maybe card check. They are \nconcerned about a whole host of things that are keeping them on the \nsidelines. To take this and throw this in, forget about it.\n  The one thing I didn't hear and I thought I would was that Main \nStreet--you know, you guys in the majority party, you are protecting \nMain Street. I didn't hear that I am protecting corporate America. I \nhear it in everything else. It is usually Wall Street. Up until this \nyear, I have never been on Wall Street. I think I walked through it \nonce. I am fighting for the people of this country, the people of my \nState, to get us financially viable, to get us to solve problems.\n  Sometimes I am the 41st Senator. I am. When it comes to debt and \nspending and taxation, I am going to be the guy who is going to hold it \nup to make sure we don't go further in debt. When I got here, $1.95 \ntrillion was the national debt. It is over $13.2 trillion now, in 7 \nmonths.\n  I have been blessed. I am so honored to be here. You can't even \nimagine my life. I am the most honored guy to be here in this Chamber. \nI have been honored to visit the troops in Afghanistan. I went to \nPakistan, Dubai, Israel, Jordan in that 7-month period. The thing that \nwas fascinating to me was, from the kings and queens and prime \nministers and leaders all over those regions, all they talked about was \njobs. That is all they talked about: jobs so al-Qaida would not \ninfiltrate their youth, to get produce to market, to secure the region \nso we can leave--jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President. If I faint, will you save me? Thank you. I \nfelt it was that important to come and make my point that I have been \nhere about 7 months, and we have spent 10 days talking about jobs. Am I \non a different planet or something? We should be talking about jobs \nevery single day we are in session. We have spent 4 days, 3 or 4 days \ntalking about the DISCLOSE Act. Give me a break. Do you think the 15 \nmillion, give or take, unemployed people throughout the country are \nconcerned about the political content of political ads in the middle of \nan election season to give one party a tactical advantage or are they \nconcerned about jobs? I know the people I speak to in Massachusetts and \nthroughout the country want to talk about jobs.\n  How can we do it immediately? We can talk about the R tax credit \nand making that permanent. That 1099 bill--there is no reason we can't \ntake that separately and put it forth in a bipartisan manner, clean up-\nand-down vote to protect the small businesses that are getting crushed \nthrough paperwork. There is no reason we should not be able to fix \nthat. If we can't do that, we are in deep trouble. Accelerated \ndepreciation, an across-the-board payroll tax reduction, a freeze on \nFederal hires, a freeze on Federal pay increases--I know it is not \npopular, but we have to look at these things. We have to look at \nentitlements. We have to collect moneys owed to us from contractors \nwhom we overpaid or through fraud and abuse. Common sense, folks.\n  The thing I kind of get sad about--I know it wasn't popular in some \ncircles for me to work on the financial reform bill. I got a lot of \nheat. But I looked at it, and I said: That doesn't include Fannie or \nFreddie. I know that. Do we\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\ndo nothing? We do nothing, right? We don't fix the regulations that \nhave potentially been outdated for 50 years? We don't prohibit the \nclosing of an entire industry overnight? We allow dentists and doctors \nand people who are going to finance the fillings in your teeth to be \nall encompassed in this thing? We are going to allow that? I am not \ngoing to allow it. I knew they had the votes anyway, but I took the \ntime to work it through. I will tell you what. Since I have been here, \nthat is the most proud I have been to work across the aisle with people \nfor what we did--11 weeks, I think, working with every thinker and \nleader in this country when it dealt with financial issues.\n  I have to admit, I learned a lot, sleeping 5 hours a day maybe, slept \nin my office trying to figure it out and do it right. I was the most \nproud to work on that bill in a bipartisan manner. I am part of \nhistory. Is it the best bill? No. Is it going to get better? I hope so. \nCan we fix it after November? I hope so. Did we close TARP? Yes. Did we \nstop too big to fail? Yes. Did we stop the bank tax? Yes. Did we do a \nlot of things people are concerned about? Yes. Did we do some things \nwrong? Yes. But--do you know what--ever since we got back after July it \nis as though we do not talk anymore. We are just filing bills with no \nhope of them passing.\n\n  The Defense authorization bill--give me a break. I remember being in \ncommittee on the Defense authorization bill. I was sitting there in the \nArmed Services Committee, all eager, ready to go, being someone who was \nin the military. ``Gosh, I am going to make a difference. I am going to \nmake a difference, everybody.'' You get there, and it was an \ninvigorating process. We worked our tails off. The chairman said: ``You \nknow, Scott, the things you are concerned about that affect \nMassachusetts and the New England area, we will do it on the floor.'' \n``Oh, good.''\n  I find out when it gets to the floor the amendment tree is filled. We \nwere offered 20 amendments. That is not good enough. The process is \nabout just scoring points, political points for November. I think the \nAmerican people are fed up. They are tired of the rhetoric. They are \ntired of the finger pointing. They are looking for leadership. They are \nlooking for somebody to say: Do you know what? Sometimes I am going to \nbe the 41st Senator, but other times when it comes to getting this \ncountry moving, I am going to be the 60th Senator. I do not care if I \nget reelected or not, but while I am here, I am going to fight every \nsingle day to get this country moving again because we are in deep \ntrouble, folks. And if you do not recognize it, by doing this piece of \nlegislation--this is helpful? It is not helpful on its own. They say: \nWell, it is the first step.\n  Do not come to me with a first step. Come to me with a real plan, one \nthat is comprehensive and can actually work and that can get some full \nsupport from your own party. Tell me you have every member of your \nparty and I will say you are not being truthful. And then try to blame \nus as the party of no. With all due respect, since I have been here \nthat has changed. But do you know how many times the majority party has \nvoted with me? Zero. OK. So the party of no thing, I will tell you \nwhat, it is getting a little old--from the administration and the \nmajority party, a little old. The numbers do not speak for themselves \non that one.\n  I do not want to seem like a downer, Mr. President, because you are a \ngood man. I respect you greatly, and I respect the people who spoke \nprior to me. Being here and being in this historic Chamber--are you \nkidding me? To be part of this process is like the greatest honor in \nthe world. Aside from my marriage and the birth of my kids, this is it. \nAnd to think we are wasting this amazing opportunity, this amazing \nopportunity to get our country competitive again and to get us firing \non all cylinders.\n  You cannot tell me we cannot find one thing to agree on. The leaders \ncannot get together and find one thing? Take the Energy bill. You are \ntelling me we cannot do one thing, take the easiest thing everybody \nagrees on and do one thing, make it clean and get it through, and send \nit over to the House and make sure it comes clean and not filled with a \nsubstitution bill and comes back clean? Can we do one thing--just one? \nAm I the only one who believes this?\n  I get that the bill on the floor tonight is important to the majority \nparty, and I respect that. I do. I get it. And pollsters, if you listen \nto them--which I tend to not--when they talk about companies that ship \njobs overseas, I get that too. I understand that is bad. But it is what \nis in play now. If we change this one thing and not change and reduce \nthe corporate tax rate to make them have an incentive to staying, it is \nnot going to work.\n  I believe without a doubt this bill will cause real harm to the \neconomy, and that job creators are united in their opposition to this \nlegislation. I guess it is bad to make money in America, to pay the \nbills. I am in favor of corporations making money. I am in favor of the \nemployees making money. I am in favor of free trade and free \nenterprise. I am also in favor of government regulation. It has its \nplace. But the government needs to know when to get out of the way too \nand to stop overregulating. There is a role for government, absolutely. \nBut government needs to know when to get out of the way, to let free \nenterprise, free market--you cannot regulate every single thing. You \ncannot do it.\n  I have gone around. I have tried to do my research. As I said, I have \nto. The major employers in Massachusetts whom I have talked to--and we \nhave a tremendous amount, thank goodness. They are not hiring, but they \nare there. They are not going to expand because of health care and \nregulation and taxation and the uncertainty of the business world.\n  I remember I read it or I heard it, Senator Baucus, chairman of the \nFinance Committee, said he was worried that this bill would put the \nUnited States at a ``competitive disadvantage.'' Those words are his, \nnot mine. This bill puts the United States at a ``competitive \ndisadvantage.'' I believe that in my heart. Again, echoing his words, \nthis bill will make American multinational companies less competitive. \nSo it is not just Republican Senators. My colleague, whom I have great \nrespect for on the other side of the aisle, is questioning also the \nwisdom of this legislation.\n  Having the second highest corporate tax rate--I notice my colleagues \nwho spoke earlier said--well, I do not want to characterize how they \nspeak. But the companies that are going overseas, yes, they are taking \nadvantage of lower tax rates. Absolutely. But you would believe, in \nlistening to them, that there are also lower labor costs as well. Yes, \nin some countries that is absolutely true. But in places such as \nBelgium and Ireland, I respectfully disagree. Companies are doing this \nto get a good solid workforce, paying good wages, but taking advantage \nof the 11-percent, 12-percent corporate tax rate versus a 35-percent \ncorporate tax rate.\n  But I have to take exception to the statement that everybody is going \noverseas to take advantage of the tax rates.\n  Well, yes, this is a global economy. We are fighting a battle here. \nAnd when China can do the things they are doing and basically provide--\nwell, let's step back. I remember growing up, and you would look at \nspace exploration, roads and bridges, and teachers, and all that, R \ntax credit money, all that great stuff we would use to lure businesses \nfrom other parts of the world here. Do you know where that is now? It \nis all debt service to China. So when I see and when I speak to the \ncompanies back home in Massachusetts, and they say: We need A, B, C, \nand D, I am like, we have no money. It is all in debt service to China \nright now. I would love to give it to you.\n  So how do we get our financial situation moving forward? We are not \ngoing to do it by having the tax cuts expire. We need to address the \ntax extenders. We cannot play games and push it off and push it off. \nHow about the death tax? Oh, my God, how many billionaires have died \nand we have not gotten a penny? Good for them. One over on the \ngovernment. But is it good for the Federal Government to not get a \npiece? I am all for people getting money, but we have not even \naddressed the death tax.\n  I remember in my first caucus, when I went in, we were talking about \nit, and in the second caucus, the third caucus, the fourth caucus, and \non and on. It is time to kind of come together to solve some real \nproblems so tax planners and\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\nfamilies can kind of get their planning done. It is all about \nuncertainty. The reason we are in part of this mess is because of the \nfinancial uncertainty associated with the continued overregulation, the \nfear of more taxation, the fear of governmental interference, and the \nthings we are trying to do. You can go on and on and on.\n  So as I said, what is the point? Why even bother getting out of bed?\n  Mr. President, may I ask, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Six minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. President, I am fading fast, and I would ask if my colleague \nwishes to take the remaining part of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. \nBefore I walked down to the floor tonight, I was watching him on \ntelevision as he gave his remarks. I know he is more than a little bit \nunder the weather. I thank him for his comments, and I thank him for \nhis refreshing point of view because he comes here as a common man to \ntry to do the best he can for the people of Massachusetts and the \npeople of this country, and he knows in the short time he has been here \nthat this system is broken. It is not working for American families. It \nis why Americans are so upset at their government.\n  It is not America that is broken. It is the government that is \nbroken--a government that is now saying: We do not want you to profit. \nWe do not want the business to succeed, sending all the messages that \nsay America is not open for business, with too much regulation, too \nmuch taxes, too much spending, too much uncertainty, too much of \nCongress pulling these big levers on government and on the economy that \nstops job creators in their tracks.\n  When I visit businesses in Florida, as I often do, they tell me: \nLook, Senator, we do not know--actually, they call me George--we do not \nknow, George, what is going to happen with our business. We do not know \nwhat this 2,000-page health care bill is going to do for our business. \nAre we going to hire one more employee and fall under some new fine or \nmandate? Is this financial regulation bill going to make business more \nexpensive?\n  Small businesses, medium-sized businesses, and the few large \nbusinesses we have in Florida are frozen in their tracks. They will not \nhire. Worse still now, we have these tax cuts that are set to expire at \nthe end of the year, and these businesses do not know what their taxes \nare going to be. Is their tax on their dividends going to go up? Are \ncapital gains going to go up? Are they going to be paying a higher tax \nrate themselves because they file as if they are an individual because \nthey are a subchapter S corporation? All of this uncertainty, all of \nthis regulation, all of this taxing, too much debt, too much spending, \ntoo much borrowing freezes business in its tracks.\n  Now we have this Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. I \nam new here too. I have been here about a year. But you can mark my \nwords, when you hear a title like that, you better read the details. \nBoy, it sure sounds good. We want to end the offshoring of jobs. Who \nwould not be for that? It sounds great. But the truth of it is, you are \ngoing to tax American corporations that are doing work in foreign \ncountries. You are going to double tax them under this proposal and \nmake them uncompetitive.\n  So when Caterpillar sends bulldozers to India, they are going to be \ntaxed more, which is going to hurt the folks in this country who are \nbuilding bulldozers. You can apply that to any business that is doing \nwork overseas. We do not need to be discouraging exporting. We need to \nbe encouraging exporting. We know when we invest in exporting we get a \nhuge return on investment. That is what we should be doing. But that \ndoes not make a nice sound bite. That does not sound good right before \nan election.\n  We should not be imposing more taxes on businesses that are trying to \ncreate jobs overseas which employ more people in this country. That is \nuncompetitive. That does not make any sense. What we should be doing is \nreinstating these tax cuts that have been around for 7 and 9 years \nrespectively and not raising taxes in the middle of a recession. Can \nyou imagine that we are going to go back for the next month and \nbusinesses in our country are not going to know what their tax rate is \nnext year. And people wonder in this Chamber why people are not hiring. \nBecause there is too much uncertainty. They do not know what their \ntaxes are going to be.\n  Do you know what businesses want? They want a level, fair playing \nfield, and they want predictability. All this government does, all this \nCongress does, is change the rules every couple months to make things \nunpredictable.\n  I heard my colleague from New York talking about the fact that the \nlast decade was lost to the middle class, that they lost wages, that \nthey actually went down, not up. That is something that appeals to all \nof us. But government is not going to be the solution to that problem. \nGovernment is not going to fix that. The private sector is going to fix \nthat.\n  Why are we demonizing business? Why are we demonizing profits? This \nhas never been a country where we said we are going to bring you up by \npulling other people down. This has been a country where we said we \nwill give you the opportunity to succeed, and then you can be rich too \nsomeday.\n  That is the American dream. That is what separates us from every \nother country in the world. We look on these other countries such as \nIndia and China and say, look, they are going to overtake us. They are \nmore competitive. They are not playing by the rules. They are doing \nthings cheaper in those countries, opening call centers, stealing \nAmerican jobs.\n  Let me tell you, I have had the opportunity to travel to some of \nthese countries in my stead as a Senator. And on its best day, India is \nnot as good as we are on our worst. There is nothing America can't do. \nThere is nothing Americans can't do.\n\n  The thing that is failing America now is this Congress and this \ngovernment. What we should be doing is creating certainty. What we \nshould be doing is approving the three free-trade agreements that we \nstill have outstanding with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. That \nwould get Americans back to work. What we should be doing is cutting \nthe payroll tax across the board for every employee and every employer. \nLet's cut it temporarily by 3 percent. Let's give every employee a 3-\npercent pay raise and every employer 3 percent more that they can use \nto hire new employees, buy new equipment, and get Americans back to \nwork.\n  People in this Chamber are willing to work across the aisle to be \nproblem solvers. I did that on the small business bill because it was \nthe right thing for Florida, and it was the right thing for this \ncountry.\n  Let's not demonize each other. Let's not demonize American business \nbecause we know American business is what creates jobs. We don't need \nto create more government jobs. We need to create more private sector \njobs. That is what is going to get this economy back up and running.\n  What I fear is what Senator Brown talked about and his notion of why \nyou get up in the morning. Is the next Bill Gates who started \nMicrosoft, is the next Hewlett Packard who started that company in \ntheir garage--the next innovator, the next entrepreneur--just going to \nsay: Look, there is too much taxes, too much regulation, too much \nuncertainty; I am not going to go pursue that idea. Have we taken away \nthe American dream? As someone just recently said to the President in a \ntownhall meeting: Is this my new reality? Is the American dream lost?\n  It is not. We will get through this. But we are only going to get \nthrough this when we realize that government is not the creator of \njobs, the private sector is the creator of jobs. Our obligation is to \nhave regulation for it to be fair, to make sure people don't cheat; \notherwise, our job is to get out of the way and let business succeed to \nemploy our people and allow them to achieve their dreams. This bill \ndoesn't do that. It makes us less competitive. It will hurt jobs.\n  What we should do is reinstate the tax cuts to create certainty and \nnot raise taxes in the middle of a recession. We should cut payroll \ntaxes, we should approve the free-trade agreements, and we should focus \nevery day we are here on jobs, not on campaign election laws,\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\nnot on this frolic, not on this detour but on jobs.\n  The American people are hurting. The people in my State are hurting \nbadly. It is the worst recession that anyone can remember in Florida--\nthe worst recession that anyone can remember. Unemployment is near 12 \npercent. In some cities it is 14 percent. When we figure in the \nunderemployed, it is more than 20 percent--people who want to work but \ncan't. Let's give them certainty. Let's not raise taxes on them, and \nlet's make sure we have a level playing field for business so business \ncan do what business does best, and that is create jobs.\n  With that, I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have found it interesting, having the opportunity to spend this \nevening listening to colleagues on the other side of the aisle. A lot \nof things have been talked about except the bill we are going to be \nvoting on tomorrow. We certainly want to focus on the legislation we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on together tomorrow to decide whether \nwe are going to take up a bill that will stop shipping our jobs \noverseas. That is what this is about. We want to make things in America \nagain and stop the incentives for shipping jobs overseas.\n  I also wish to indicate that today, talking about certainty--and I \nagree with my friends on the other side of the aisle that we need \neconomic certainty. I agree with that. It would be so helpful if \neverything was not filibustered and there wasn't sand thrown in the \ngears at every turn when we are trying to move forward and create \neconomic certainty, making it take much longer in terms of trying to \nget to economic certainty. But I agree, and we agree, that we need \ncertainty.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from Florida for working with us on the \nsmall business jobs bill that was just passed. The previous speaker \nsaid we need bonus depreciation. Well, but that particular Senator and \nthe majority of the Senators voted against that in the small business \nbill. We need to extend expensing provisions, we were told a while ago. \nWell, the majority of Republicans voted against that. We need tax cuts \nfor small business, we were told. Well, we just had a bill with $12 \nbillion in tax cuts for small businesses that the majority of the \nRepublicans voted against. Again, with all due respect to my colleague \nfrom Florida who reached across the aisle and helped make that happen--\nand we are very grateful--but I have been listening all evening to \npeople talking about how we need tax cuts who just voted against tax \ncuts. They have talked about how we need certainty, and certainly one \nof the areas where we need certainty is in small business lending, and \nwe have just created that.\n  In fact, tomorrow, we are told, the SBA is going to provide about \n1,400 loans for small businesses to be able to grow and expand and hire \npeople--tomorrow--because of what was signed today. So that creates a \nlittle bit more certainty. We certainly need more of that. I am all for \ndoing that, and I am all for creating the kind of level playing field \nthat was talked about as well.\n  We want to export our products, not our jobs. But at every step of \nthe way, from the Recovery Act we passed 18 months ago to focus on \nmanufacturing--making things in America, clean energy, advanced battery \ntechnologies, jobs and infrastructure--from that time until now we have \nseen nothing but delay tactic after delay tactic after delay tactic, \nslowing down the economic certainty that colleagues are now talking \nabout this evening. So we want that certainty.\n  We want certainty for middle-class families in this country who have \nbeen torn apart because of the fact that we have lost jobs. We have \nlost 4.7 million manufacturing jobs in this country under the policies \nof the last administration that now, we were told last week, they want \nto do again. The proposals unveiled by our Republican colleagues are \nexactly the same proposals that cost my State 1 million jobs. We are \nnot interested in going back to that. We want to keep on a course that \nis going to get us out of the hole.\n  So what is this bill about? I will soon turn this over to my \ncolleagues to speak as well. What are we really talking about tonight? \nWe are talking about doing three things that will bring jobs back that \nhave been lost overseas. These jobs have been lost to China time and \ntime again. They have been lost to India, lost to Brazil, lost to \nMexico, and lost to many other countries because of a system we have \nthat doesn't have a level playing field on trade, is not enforcing our \ntrade laws, having some trade agreements that are not fair, and then \nhaving incentives that reward companies to write off their costs here \nwhile the jobs are shipped overseas. So we want to stop that.\n  This bill, in fact, would prohibit a firm from taking any deduction, \na loss or credit, for amounts paid in connection with reducing or \nending the operation of trade or business in the United States and \nstarting a similar trade or business overseas. What is that about? \nWell, we don't think American taxpayers should have to pay the bill \nthrough a deduction or a credit while their jobs are being shipped \noverseas. Companies shouldn't be able to write that off their taxes.\n  We are also saying through this bill that we want to end the Federal \ntax subsidy that rewards U.S. firms that move their production \noverseas. Finally, we want to provide a carrot to say, if in the next 3 \nyears a company closes down operations and brings jobs back--and we \nhave success stories like that to tell of companies that are doing \nthat--but if they do that, close operations in the next 3 years, bring \nthe jobs back, they will get a 2-year payroll tax holiday. So they will \nget a tax cut if they bring jobs back.\n  That is the simple bill. It is very simple. It is very \nstraightforward. We want to take away the incentives to ship jobs \noverseas--the subsidies that cause Americans to lose their jobs--\nturning around and then subsidizing the jobs overseas, and we want to \ncreate incentives to bring jobs back. That is what this is about. This \nadds to what the President signed today in terms of the small business \nbill that creates jobs. This is another step in our effort to make sure \nwe are focusing on American jobs.\n  We want to make sure we are making it in America again. It is no \nsurprise we have lost the middle class as we have lost manufacturing. \nOur ability to have good-paying American jobs is built on the premise \nof a foundation that says we are going to make things in this country. \nWe are going to make things. We are going to grow things. We are going \nto add value to it. That is what has created the middle class of this \ncountry. We are losing that. People are losing their jobs, losing their \nfutures, their ability to care for their families, as we are seeing \nthese jobs shipped overseas. This bill is about bringing them back. It \nis one piece of the puzzle. Take away the tax deductions and bring them \nback. That is what this is about.\n  Tomorrow, the question is, Do you want to debate it? Do you want to \nmove to the bill? It is not final passage; it is voting to move to the \nbill so we can have the debate about creating that certainty and \ncreating jobs and making things in America again.\n  I see my friend from Rhode Island, and I wish to turn things over to \nhim because I know he is a passionate advocate for jobs, as I am. We \noften share, unfortunately, the same kinds of concerns about jobs in \nRhode Island and Michigan. I know the Senator from Rhode Island cares \npassionately about bringing those jobs back to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nMichigan who has worked so long and hard on this. We do, indeed, have \nin Rhode Island the distinction of being in the top three or four \nStates for unemployment for month after month after month. Rhode Island \nis still hovering near 12 percent unemployment.\n  For a State that was once the manufacturing capital of the world, for \na State that was once the place where the industrial revolution was \nsparked off, to be in this situation is very painful for a lot of Rhode \nIslanders, and it is particularly painful and frustrating to have that \nsituation exacerbated by our country's tax and trade laws. At last we \nare getting around to doing something about it.\n  So I am here today in strong support of the Creating American Jobs \nand\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nEnding Offshoring Act. I wish to speak a little bit about the bill \nitself because one of the things I have noticed about my colleagues on \nthe other side is that they have spoken about anything and everything. \nThey have spoken about taxes. They have spoken about the deficit. They \nhave spoken about wages. They have spoken about every economic issue \nthey can bring to mind, but they haven't spoken about this bill. Nobody \nhas said this is a bad piece of legislation; they just don't want to \nget to it. They want to give long speeches about macroeconomics rather \nthan look at this bill and how it will help. It is a shame because we \nare just trying to get to this bill.\n  Last week, Leader Reid made a procedural motion that the Senate take \nup this legislation to address the epidemic of companies laying off \nAmerican workers and moving their jobs overseas.\n  I was just in a facility in Rhode Island a few weeks ago and there \nwere machines running and there were people working. But if you walked \naround the machine shop floor, you could see marks on the floor marked \noff in tape with holes where bolts had been taken out. Those were \nmachines that had been taken out of a Rhode Island factory and shipped \nto South America so that South American workers could work those \nmachines and sell the exact same products that had been made in Rhode \nIsland back into America.\n  So this is a very real and practical problem we have to face. With \nthe kind of unemployment we have still in this country, I hope every \none of my colleagues, Republican as well as Democrat, will acknowledge \nthat this is a topic that is worthy of debate in the Senate.\n  Senator LeMieux from Florida was just here. He is a very \ndistinguished Member of this body, and I consider him a personal \nfriend. He came forward with a great list of ideas he believed we \nshould be considering in order to improve our jobs posture and move \nAmerica forward. Those were all fine ideas, and every single one of \nthem he could have offered as an amendment if he would vote yes to go \nto this bill.\n  Where we are is the Republicans saying we are not even going to \ndiscuss this piece of legislation. So every good idea or what they \nconsider to be a good idea we have heard about tonight, bear in mind \ntheir votes will prevent them from offering amendments to implement \nthose very ideas that they are claiming are good ideas.\n  This is a basic, smart piece of legislation. The Creating American \nJobs and Ending Offshoring Act would close some really perverse \nloopholes in the Tax Code that, right now, reward American companies \nfor moving American jobs overseas. The law, right now, permits \ncompanies that close down American factories and offices and move those \njobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with \nmoving the jobs to China or India or wherever. Those machines that were \nunscrewed, unbolted from that Rhode Island shop floor and shipped to \nSouth America so that South American workers could run them--the cost \nof that was a tax deduction subsidized by the American taxpayer. That \nsimply doesn't make sense.\n  If we want to send a message that we are tired of sending American \njobs offshore, then giving people a tax deduction for doing that should \nbe a practice that ends. We would end those taxpayer subsidies for the \nexpenses of moving American jobs overseas.\n  That taxpayer subsidy is just the cherry on top--the big prize--for \ncompanies that are offshoring jobs. The real money comes from their \nability to defer paying taxes on profits they earn overseas. Here is an \nexample. Let's say a company manufactures a boat in my State of Rhode \nIsland. That company pays taxes on its profits from selling that boat \nevery year that it earns a profit. Let's say there is a company right \nacross the street--a competitor--that also makes boats, and it decides \nthat it is going to take its manufacturing and move it overseas to \nChina. They will make the same boat but will make it in China and then \nsell it back to the same U.S. customer. They are identical except that \none company moved its jobs overseas. The company that moved its jobs \noverseas is not obliged to pay income taxes on its profits from the \noverseas manufactured boat at that time. It can strategically defer and \nmaneuver its taxing to pay it later and use the money in the meantime \ninstead of having to borrow capital or pay it at a time when it has \noffsetting deductions. This deferral gaming can be quite lucrative for \nthe companies that move jobs overseas, and it can be quite costly for \ntaxpayers. So we close this loophole too.\n  These tax loopholes that reward shipping jobs overseas have served as \npowerful incentives for companies to do so, and the numbers bear this \nout. According to our Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1999 to 2008, the \nnumber of U.S. employees of multinational companies declined by nearly \n2 million--1.9 million jobs--out of America from multinational \ncorporations. During the same period, these same companies increased \ntheir foreign employment by 2.4 million--2 million jobs out of this \ncountry and into foreign countries by American multinationals.\n  Some people think that is a wonderful idea. These are our friends at \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is a letter they sent on September \n23 to the Members of the Senate from the Chamber of Commerce of the \nUnited States of America:\n\n       Replacing a job that is based in another country with a \n     domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance \n     the competitiveness of American worldwide companies.\n\n  This is our U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the same entity that is out \nrunning ads trashing candidates on behalf of Republicans, the same \nentity that represents all the big multinationals--Exxon, BP, the big \ninsurance companies, the big banks, the folks charging you a 30 percent \ninterest rate on your credit card. That is whom these people represent. \nAgain, they bring this idea to the table:\n\n       Replacing a job that is based in another country with a \n     domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance \n     the competitiveness of American worldwide companies.\n\n  I will tell you what it does. It will enhance the heck out of the \neconomic growth of the family who gets that domestic job. It will \nenhance the heck out of the economic competitiveness of a neighborhood \nthat doesn't have a factory shipped overseas so that the company can \nmove the jobs offshore. I don't know whom these people are interested \nin--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--but it is definitely not the American \nfamily, the American neighborhoods or the American worker. ``Replacing \na job that is based in another country with a domestic job. . . .'' \nThat is really astounding.\n  So we need to get to this bill, and we need to begin to reverse the \ndecades-long decline in U.S. manufacturing. This cannot do everything, \nbut it would be a first step.\n  When we were growing up, the vast majority of the clothes we wore, \nthe cars on our roads, and the food on our tables was all produced in \nthe United States. That time has passed, that time is gone, that time \nis no more. Today, you would be hard-pressed to find items in a \ndepartment store that were made domestically. Just go to Walmart--it is \nChina-mart.\n  It is not just consumer goods either. Earlier this year, I had a \nmeeting with an organization in Rhode Island that runs one of our major \nports. Together with Senator Reed, we were able to argue successfully \nfor one of the TIGER grants in the economic recovery bill to help \nsupport this port so that they can grow jobs and add to the business \nthat comes to Rhode Island. Part of what they need to do is purchase \nand install a big cargo crane, a port crane to offload the goods that \ncome in and stack them so they can go onto trains and trucks and off \ninto commerce. Guess what we discovered. We discovered that the Rhode \nIsland organization didn't plan to buy the multimillion-dollar crane \nfrom an American company. Do you know why that is? That is because no \nAmerican company any longer makes a port crane. No matter how much you \nwant to buy a crane for an American port from an American company, you \ncan't do it. We don't make them any longer. Something has gone badly \nwrong when you go to the biggest retail outlet in America and you can't \nbuy American-made products--it is 90-plus percent from China--and when \nyou go to a port and the crane that is unloading the Chinese goods \ncannot even be made in America any longer.\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n  So we need to get to work. We need to support our American \nmanufacturing base, and we need to take the wrinkles out of the Tax \nCode that make it advantageous for a company to move those jobs \noverseas, with taxpayer subsidies and competitive advantage against a \ncompany that is struggling at home trying to do the right thing and \nkeep jobs here.\n  All we are asking of our colleagues is that they allow us to go to \nthe bill and have this debate. When they come to the floor and object \nto this procedural motion, and they have nothing to say about this bill \nbut only general bromides--I have had so many bromides that I am ready \nfor some Bromo-Seltzer. They won't talk about this bill. The reason is \nthat it is a good bill, and it would help American jobs, and they don't \nwant anything to pass now. I urge them to change their minds. It is too \nimportant to let this opportunity pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see my colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I have to say to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, we will get some of that water that fizzes because we will need \nit as the night goes on.\n  The point is simple. To the American people, to the Alaskans who are \nwatching, this process we go through here, which is really about \ngetting us to a bill--that is what we are trying to do so we can have a \ndebate across the aisle, have a discussion about what is the right \npolicy when it comes to jobs and how to make sure we do the right thing \nregarding our economy. Instead of having to debate, they would rather \nstop the motion to proceed and end the story.\n  I rise this evening for the same reason many other folks are talking \ntonight--in support of the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring \nAct. I believe we should reward companies that keep Americans working \nhere in our country.\n  As a former mayor, and really longer than any time I have served in \npublic office, as a small business owner--that is what I spent my life \naround. I understand the impact of legislation and what it means for a \nbusiness owner. As I have said in the Budget Committee and on the \nfloor, I am probably one of the few who have filled out--in one of the \ndebates we had a couple weeks ago--1099 forms. I understand what it \nmeans for a small businessperson to spend the time to try to build \ntheir business and what it means.\n  Tonight, in my view, it is unacceptable that we currently reward \ncompanies that ship American jobs overseas while businesses that are \ndoing their best to provide decent wages and benefits are struggling \njust to make payroll. We should reward businesses that don't just keep \nbut create jobs here at home. It makes no sense to me, when you think \nabout it--you have business A and business B both doing the same \nproduct. But the one that decides to invest in America, to invest in \nAlaska, who competes against the person across the street who decides \nto close up and go overseas, who gets tax breaks and special benefits \nand subsidies and other things, the person here who is working hard \nevery day to keep Americans working is at a disadvantage. It is clearly \ntime that we stop shipping our jobs overseas and make it right here in \nAmerica.\n  American manufacturing jobs have been some of the hardest hit by the \neconomic downturn. States that have significant manufacturing bases are \nthose with the highest unemployment rates.\n  This legislation is a commonsense response to our job crisis. Under \nthe bill, payroll tax relief will be rewarded to companies that hire \nemployees domestically during a 3-year period, beginning now. The tax \ncut would come in the form of relieving the companies of paying Social \nSecurity payroll taxes on each job that was brought back home to this \ncountry for the next 2 years.\n  This legislation also eliminates tax breaks for companies that move \njobs overseas. I will repeat that because people who might be watching \nare saying: What do you mean, we give companies tax breaks for moving \njobs to another country and not reward people who work here? That is \nthe case. We actually give breaks, which include deducting expenses for \ncompanies that close their factories in the United States and move them \noverseas. I don't know about all other taxpayers, but I am taxpayer and \na businessperson, and that seems ridiculous that we would give a tax \nbreak to companies that ship jobs overseas. Taxpayers subsidize these \ncompanies. As I mentioned, our tax laws currently reward these \ncompanies in many different ways for moving jobs overseas.\n  Here is a startling reality--the data. We hear a lot from the other \nside, and they are kind of good sound bites and they get on the news \nand get coverage, but here is the data. This is how people should \nmeasure the success or failure of the policy we have had regarding this \nissue. That is why we need to pass this new legislation. Between \nFebruary 2001 and February of 2009, almost 4.7 million manufacturing \njobs were lost to overseas operations--4.7 million American jobs that \nwere shipped overseas, like a parcel package. They are gone. Between \n1999 and 2008, employment of foreign affiliates of American parent \ncorporations grew from 7.8 million jobs to 10.1 million. That is an \nincrease of 2.4 million jobs or 30 percent. Again, there are jobs that \nhave been shipped off, and then these American companies then produce \njobs overseas that could have been produced here in this country. But \nthey have not done it.\n  To my friends across the aisle, many of you seem to have the \nimpression that extending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans will \nmean more jobs.\n  I just got back from a weekend in Alaska, for 2\\1/2\\ days moving \nthrough cities, talking with folks. I have to be honest. Only the \npeople across the aisle are thinking that because that is not what I \nhear back home. They see through it. The 97 percent who will receive a \ntax break, a tax cut, middle-class Americans see that benefit. But the \nsmall 3 percent, 2.5 percent, they are not going to create jobs with \nthat money, no question about it. As we all remember back in the Bush \nadministration, President Bush decided to extend these tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans in the middle of the Iraq war. The thought was \nthis would spur our economy and create new jobs.\n  Not surprisingly, the exact opposite happened. The national debt \ndoubled. When President Obama was sworn into office, just before he was \nsworn in, over half a million jobs were lost just in that month alone \nbefore he was sworn in. We have to stop shipping jobs overseas and make \nit right in America.\n  I implore my colleagues on the other side to allow the debate, to \nallow us to proceed. It is not complicated.\n  I will end on this comment and say, when I was a mayor, anybody could \nbring any idea to the table. You could debate it. Sometimes we debated \nuntil midnight, sometimes we started the next day and debated some \nmore, but ideas were debated.\n  We are recovering from an economic crisis. We are, at the moment, to \nlook at some new options, new opportunities to have our businesses \nthrive and move forward. I ask our colleagues on the other side: Allow \nthe debate to occur. As a small businessperson, as a Member of the \nSenate, I ask them to step to the table and let us move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend the remarks by the Senator from \nAlaska and before him the Senator from Rhode Island and others tonight. \nOne of the reasons we are here tonight is because we have been trying, \nover the last 18 months, to get some of our colleagues on the other \nside to join us in job creation strategies. We had almost no Senators--\nat the time just three on the other side--join our side to pass the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That legislation, which we \npassed in the early part of 2009, has created--one rather conservative \nestimate--about 3 million jobs. But in an economy where we lost 8 \nmillion, we have to keep going and put in place other strategies.\n  We passed the HIRE Act not too long ago. When we pass a lot of \nlegislation, it goes right by people. That HIRE Act provided a payroll \ntax credit for the hiring of an individual who has been unemployed for \n60 or more days. That has created a number of jobs.\n  We just passed a bill, and the President signed into law today, the \nSmall\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nBusiness Jobs and Credit Act, a direct infusion to small businesses \nacross the United States of America--$12 billion in tax breaks directly \nto small businesses.\n  In addition to that, there is a loan fund for our smaller banks, our \ncommunity banks, to provide most of the capital to most of the \nbusinesses in America because we know small businesses create most of \nthe jobs.\n  We have been taking step after step. None of it is perfect. Not one \nbill will lead to a full recovery. But we have been trying to push this \neconomy--the image of coming out of the ditch we have all used is a \ngood analogy. One bill is one push. One bill is not enough to get this \neconomy fully recovered, but we have been making progress.\n  Today we come together, once again, to try something we have \nadvocated again: to try to take some steps to stop the offshoring of \njobs, the shipping of jobs overseas because we have the wrong tax \npolicies in place.\n  What does this bill do? What does the Creating American Jobs and \nEnding Offshoring Act do? Basically, three things. It is not \ntremendously complicated for those who are running businesses but \ncritically important to our jobs, our families, and our future.\n  No. 1, it would create a payroll tax holiday for companies that \nreturn jobs to the United States from overseas. What happens there is \nwe would be providing relief from the employer's share of the Social \nSecurity payroll tax on wages paid to new U.S. employees performing \nservices in the United States. It is as simple as that. We should have \ndone it a long time ago. We could have taken these steps before, but \nour friends on the other side, just like they have blocked almost every \njob creation bill I can think of in the last 18 months, they blocked \nthis over and over again.\n  No. 2, this bill would end subsidies for plant closing costs. As some \nof my colleagues have noted, the bill would prohibit a firm from taking \nany deduction loss or credit for amounts paid in connection with \nreducing or ending the operation of a trade or business in the United \nStates, starting or expanding a similar trade or business overseas. We \nhave made it easier. We have created incentives to ship jobs overseas \ninstead of creating disincentives for companies to send jobs overseas. \nIt would end that basic policy that ships jobs overseas.\n  No. 3, we would end tax breaks for runaway plants--plants that go \noverseas and have no penalty applied to moving jobs overseas, instead \nof keeping jobs in America.\n  I mentioned before the HIRE Act, legislation that provides a payroll \ntax credit for the hiring of an individual who has been unemployed for \n60 or more days. We are building on that policy. I commend our majority \nleader, Senator Reid, Senator Durbin, our Presiding Officer, Senator \nSchumer, and others for building upon what we did in the HIRE Act \nearlier this year and introducing this bill to provide employer relief \nfrom the employer share of the Social Security payroll tax on wages \npaid to a new U.S. employee performing services here.\n  In other words, we are trying to bring jobs back to the United \nStates. We are not saying this bill is a magic wand that solves all our \neconomic problems. One bill is not a recovery, but it is another \nforward step in furtherance of that objective to lift this economy \ncompletely out of the ditch it has been in for far too long.\n  We know this did not happen overnight. We know our economy did not \nfall into a ditch overnight. We also know the loss of manufacturing \njobs did not just occur over the last several years. It occurred over \nmany years. But if you just look at the last 9 or 10 years, I know, for \nexample, in Pennsylvania we lost over 200,000 jobs. The best estimate \nis 207,000 jobs just in Pennsylvania that are categorized as \nmanufacturing jobs. In some States it is a lot higher than that. My \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, was remarking earlier that \nMichigan had lost over 1 million jobs in that time period, just \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  We know the unemployment rate across the country is intolerably too \nhigh. In our State, fortunately, it is below 10. A lot of States cannot \nsay that. But 9.3 or 9.5 roughly in Pennsylvania over many months \nequates to almost 600,000 people. It got as high as 592,000 people out \nof work. Now we are down a little but down to only 585,000 people out \nof work.\n  I went across Pennsylvania during the latter part of the summer. In 4 \nweeks, I was in some 31 counties, most of them small and rural \ncounties, most of them counties that have a lot of small towns in them \nand a lot of geography, a lot of space. Whether you go to a county such \nas Potter County, which has less than 20,000 people in it and almost \n100 percent rural, their unemployment rate is 11.5 percent.\n  Philadelphia, the biggest city and biggest county as well, has an \nunemployment rate of 12 percent now. More than 75,000 people are out of \nwork in the city of Philadelphia.\n  Whether you go to a small town or rural community or whether you go \nto the biggest city in our State, the unemployment rate is far too \nhigh.\n  It is my obligation to not just say the Recovery Act created 3 \nmillion jobs. It may not have been perfect or popular, but it created a \nlot of jobs. But that is not enough. That is why we supported the HIRE \nAct. That is why we supported the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act. \nThe community bankers, by the way--this is not a number from a \nDemocratic office--tell us it will create 500,000 jobs.\n  What if they are off by a big number? What if it is only 400,000? My \ngoodness, if we can pass any bill that will create 400,000 jobs, that \nwill be remarkable. If they are right, it will be more than that. It \nwill be 500,000 jobs.\n  We are pushing and pushing to move this economy fully out of the \nditch, to have a full and robust recovery because we know what happens \nwhen the economy recovers. We saw it in the late 1990s, during \nPresident Clinton's two terms in office. We not only had recovery but \ntremendous growth. We were investing in priorities such as health care \nand education and the skills of our workers for the future for a \nstronger economy. We had not only eliminated the deficit--the Congress \nand the President at the time--but the surplus was $236 billion when \nPresident Clinton left office. He handed that to President Bush.\n  When President Bush handed over the keys to the White House, so to \nspeak, to President Obama, the $236 billion in surplus was now $1.3 \ntrillion in deficit. That is where we are today. We are still \nrecovering, despite a lot of steps, to have a full recovery. But we \ncannot fully recover if we are going to continue to subsidize the \nmovement of jobs overseas.\n  It is hard to comprehend the strange and almost perverse policy that \nhas led to taxpayers being called upon because of the policy that has \nbeen in place for far too long, the policy where taxpayers are \nsubsidizing the costs associated with the closing of a plant in the \nUnited States of America. We should not just lament that, we should end \nthe policy and instead have taxpayer support strategies to keep jobs \nhere or support strategies that actually pull jobs back from overseas.\n  You cannot lament the movement of jobs overseas and then just keep \nvoting the way some are voting against tax policies to keep jobs in \nAmerica. You cannot lament job loss and vote against, whether it is a \nRecovery Act, the HIRE Act or the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act. \nYou cannot say you are in favor of helping small business and then turn \naround the next day and vote against $12 billion in tax cuts for small \nbusiness.\n  You cannot say you support small communities and the small banks in \nAmerica and then vote against a loan fund that will help those very \nsame small banks across America help their small businesses to invest \nand grow and hire more people and help us recover.\n  What tomorrow's vote is about is not the bill itself. Tomorrow's \nvote, of course, as everyone knows, is just to get over that procedural \nhurdle to allow us to debate. Having a debate about ending the \noffshoring or doing everything we can to end the offshoring of jobs is \nworthy of at least 1 day or a couple hours of debate.\n  Someone over there might say: I am not going to vote for this bill \nfor this or that reason. They have that right. It is hard to say I do \nnot like the fact we have been shipping jobs overseas and have tax \npolicies that incentivize that and we have other policies we can put in \nplace to change that and to turn that around and move in the direction\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nof helping taxpayers keep jobs here and pulling jobs back from \noverseas, you cannot say all that, make a big speech on it and then \nvote the next day and say: I am not only going to vote against the bill \nbut vote against any debate on the bill. That is a pretty hard argument \nto make. I am not sure there are many people who can make it with a \nstraight face and with any degree of integrity.\n  We will see what they do. We will see if they are going to vote \nagainst debating obviously one of the most important issues for people, \nstopping jobs from going overseas. I hope the other side does not do \nwhat it did with the small business bill and say it supports small \nbusinesses and then vote against tax cuts and vote against community \nbanks to help our small businesses.\n  Maybe tomorrow there will be a flash of light in the darkness of this \npolitical debate and folks on the other side will let us debate this \nfor a couple hours and then maybe vote the right way: to stop jobs from \ngoing overseas. But we will see. We will see what the morning light \nbrings.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Creating \nAmerican Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The bill before us utilizes \nboth carrots and sticks. It ends certain egregious tax breaks that \npromote the movement of American jobs overseas, and provides a payroll \ntax holiday to companies that relocate jobs back to the United States.\n  I thank Senators Durbin, Reid, Schumer and Dorgan for their \ninitiative in crafting legislation designed to create more jobs on \nAmerican soil at a time when it is critical. This bill is a positive \nfirst step.\n  Robust industry has always been the hallmark of American \ncompetitiveness.\n  It once was that you could see the ``Made in America'' logo on the \nback of a t-shirt, on a shoe, a dress, a coat, and knew that you had a \nproduct that was both high quality and safe.\n  But from 2000-2005, U.S. companies slashed 2.1 million jobs in the \nUnited States while hiring 784,000 jobs internationally. This is from \nthe Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n  Examples are the iconic little red wagon company, ``Radio Flyer'' \neliminated half its workforce in Chicago and moved its manufacturing \noperations to China in 2004; Levi Strauss cut its workforce by roughly \n20 percent, closing factories across the country and outsourcing its \nmanufacturing work to Latin America in 2002; Motorola has laid off over \n40,000 workers and invested more than $3 billion in China in 2001; and; \nrecently, the Whirlpool Corporation announced it will close a \nrefrigerator plant in Evanston, Indiana, resulting in the loss of \nhundreds of jobs. Whirlpool has plans to open a new plant in Mexico.\n  And Hewlett Packard is opening a global call center in Chongquing, \nChina. The reason for all these relocations is plain and simple--less \ncost.\n  Today, the ``Made in America'' logo is not often seen, and with its \ndemise has been the loss of good American jobs.\n  It is time for the United States to refocus on a modernized \nindustrial policy that promotes global competitiveness and creates jobs \nfor the American people.\n  And this legislation is a beginning.\n  Simply put, we can no longer hang our hats on American inventiveness \nand ingenuity while ignoring the steady stream of jobs lost to our \ninternational competitors.\n  Americans have always had good ideas, but those good ideas used to \nlead to good jobs here in the United States. Now, our intellectual \nproperty contributes to abundant employment opportunities, but many are \noften in other countries.\n  American industry has changed the world. From the automobile to the \nairplane, from landing a man on the moon to developing the Internet, \nthe combination of revolutionary ideas and productive labor has been \nthe backbone of American strength for generations.\n  But we should not be willing to cede that essential part of our \nAmerican identity. We must find a way to ensure that American ingenuity \ncreates American jobs.\n  Statistics indicate that we are losing our identity as a \nmanufacturing power--and that is bad news for this country.\n  Thirty years ago, the founder of Sony and the head of the august \nKeidanren in Japan said to me: ``When America ceases to be a \nmanufacturing power, she will become a second-rate power.''\n  I have thought a lot about those words over the decades as I have \nseen American jobs go overseas.\n  The slow bleed of manufacturing jobs has been a stark reality for \nyears. From 1997 to 2007, the U.S. manufacturing sector lost 3.5 \nmillion jobs--an estimated 20 percent of the workforce.\n  But offshoring isn't just a problem for factory workers, it is having \na growing impact on the service sector as well. Today, even highly \nskilled workers can no longer rely on their education or training to \nobtain a job or have any measure of job security. It is estimated that \n1.2 million white-collar jobs were sent offshore between 2003-2008; the \nBureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 31 percent of service-sector \njobs are currently at risk of being sent overseas; at the current rate, \n25 percent of all U.S. jobs may be in danger of being shipped overseas \nin the next 10 years, from the CRS.\n  Several studies indicate that up to 250,000 American jobs may go \noverseas by 2015; and this includes highly skilled fields like computer \nscience and mathematics, which are becoming increasingly vulnerable to \nbeing sent overseas.\n  The Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act is a first step \ntoward addressing these trends. The bill provides a payroll tax break \nto companies that move jobs back to America--employer share--roughly 8 \npercent of salary--2 year holiday; eliminates the tax breaks that have \nprovided incentives to companies to move production and jobs overseas--\neliminates tax deduction, loss, or credit for costs associated with \nmoving operation overseas; and; ends tax deferral for companies that \nmove production overseas, only to sell those products back in the U.S.\n  The time has come for Congress and the business community to come up \nwith an industrial policy that will promote American competitiveness \nand create jobs.\n  While we have promoted trade and globalization, we have overlooked \nthe negative effect it has on job creation here in the U.S. Many of our \nbusinesses have thrived in the modern global marketplace, but our \npolicies here at home lag behind.\n  Free trade may reduce the price of goods, but this doesn't do much \ngood if unemployed Americans can't afford to buy them.\n  We need to look at the structure of taxation, of education, and of \nhealth care. We need to decide what must change in order to achieve our \ngoals.\n  In August I spoke to a gathering of the top business minds in Silicon \nValley. With California's unemployment rate lingering at 12.4 percent, \nmuch of the discussion turned to maintaining American dominance in a \nway that would engender job creation in my home State.\n  I asked them to work with me to find common ground on these issues.\n  Today, I ask all of us in the Senate to do the same.\n  The provisions included in the Creating American Jobs and Ending \nOffshoring Act are a positive first step.\n  However, to profoundly impact the future of American industrial \ncompetitiveness, we cannot rely solely on carrots and sticks.\n  We as a government must lay a stable foundation upon which American \nbusiness ingenuity can foster top down growth. And the business \ncommunity must focus not only on the bottom line. It must rededicate \nitself to the pursuit of a thriving American economy and labor force.\n  Bottom line: These are the things we must do if we are to maintain \nAmerica's position as the driving force of the global economy. This \nlegislation is a good first step down this road.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Senate will have a cloture vote \nshortly on the motion to proceed to S. 3816. I hope that we will \novercome a procedural roadblock to the Senate considering this \nlegislation and proceed to the bill and pass it. While the National \nBureau of Economic Research, NBER, has determined that the recession is \nover, it is clear that we have much more work to do getting Americans \nback to work. According to NBER, the recession lasted 18 months, which \nmakes it the longest of any recession since World War II.\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\n  It is important to note that NBER did not conclude the economy has \nreturned to operating at normal capacity. Rather, NBER determined only \nthat the recession ended in June 2009 and a recovery began in that \nmonth. According to NBER:\n\n       (E)conomic activity is typically below normal in the early \n     stages of an expansion, and it sometimes remains so well into \n     the expansion.\n\n  Aggregate employment frequently reaches its trough after the NBER \ntrough for overall ``economic activity'' and the 2007-2009 recession is \nno exception. That is why this jobs bill is critically important. The \neconomy is still fragile; everyone knows that. So let's do something \nabout it.\n  S. 3816 has incentives to create jobs here in America and \ndisincentives to moving American jobs overseas.\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Labor certified a Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, TAA, petition brought on behalf of human \nresources personnel at Hewlett-Packard in 10 different States, \nincluding Maryland--Ellicott City--that have seen their jobs shipped to \nPanama. Now, if H-P employees have questions about their pay or their \nleave or their benefits, they have to call Panama. It is exactly that \ntype of shipping jobs offshore that we need to prevent.\n  S. 3816 removes tax incentives that allow companies such as H-P to \neliminate jobs here, outsourcing that work with the products or \nservices consumed in the U.S. market.\n  Just since the beginning of 2007, the Department of Labor has \ncertified 50 TAA petitions involving laid-off workers who live in \nMaryland.\n  In many cases, the firms involved in these certifications had U.S. \ntax incentives to ship jobs overseas. S. 3816 helps to eliminate those \nincentives.\n  To encourage businesses to create jobs here in the United States, the \nbill allows businesses to skip the employer share of the Social \nSecurity payroll tax for up to 2 years on wages paid to new U.S. \nemployees performing services in the United States. To be eligible, \nbusinesses have to certify that the U.S. employee is replacing an \nemployee who had been performing similar duties overseas.\n  This payroll tax holiday is available for workers hired during the 3-\nyear period beginning September 22, 2010. The Social Security trust \nfund will be made whole from general revenues, a provision that costs \n$1.09 billion over 10 years.\n  The bill eliminates subsidies that U.S. taxpayers provide to firms \nthat move facilities offshore. It prohibits a firm from taking any \ndeduction, loss, or credit for amounts paid in connection with reducing \nor ending the operation of a trade or business in the U.S. and starting \nor expanding a similar trade or business overseas.\n  This provision raises $277 million over 10 years.\n  The bill would not apply to any severance payments or costs \nassociated with outplacement services or employee retraining provided \nto any employees who lose their jobs as a result of the offshoring.\n  S. 3816 also ends the Federal tax subsidy that rewards U.S. firms for \nmoving their production overseas. Under current law, U.S. companies can \ndefer paying U.S. tax on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries \nuntil that income is brought back to the United States. This is known \nas ``deferral.''\n  Deferral has the effect of putting these firms at a competitive \nadvantage over U.S. firms that hire U.S. workers to make products here \nin America.\n  The bill repeals deferral for companies that reduce or close a \nbusiness in the U.S. and start or expand a similar business overseas \nfor the purpose of importing their products or services for sale in the \nUnited States. U.S. companies that locate facilities abroad in order to \nsell their products overseas are unaffected by this proposal.\n  Ending deferral raises $92 million over 10 years.\n  I think there is a huge need and a great deal of merit in considering \na bill to encourage American firms to keep their plants and factories \nhere in America and to hire American workers.\n  Too many Americans are looking for work and can't find jobs. The \nrecession hasn't ended for them. I hope the Senate will move forward on \nlegislation that will keep jobs in America and put Americans back to \nwork and begin to put this terrible recession behind us. It is time to \nship American goods and services--not American jobs--overseas.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Congress is now close to passing \nand enacting an intelligence authorization bill for the first time \nsince December 2004. Pending at the Senate desk is House bill H.R. \n2701, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which \nthe House passed on February 26, 2010.\n  On behalf of Senator Bond and myself, I have filed an amendment to \nthis House bill, and have asked the majority leader to request \nunanimous consent that the amendment, in the nature of a substitute, be \napproved and that the bill be sent back to the House for its final \npassage.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to describe the \namendment and discuss why the passage of this legislation is of great \nimportance to the Intelligence community and for oversight of \nintelligence.\n  In all but three respects, this amendment is identical to Senate bill \nS. 3611, which the Senate passed in August by unanimous consent. That \nbill had been negotiated with the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence and had the support of the administration. However, the \nHouse did not act on that bill. Instead, last week, the House sent its \nlegislation to the Senate for consideration.\n  Per agreement with the House and the executive branch, I am therefore \nintroducing this amendment, which replaces the text of the House bill \nwith the previous Senate bill, with the three changes as follows:\n  The first change is necessary given that fiscal year 2010, the year \nfor which this legislation was first written, ends later this week. The \nlegislation I have offered today therefore does not include a \nclassified annex that describes authorized funding levels for the \nintelligence community. The amendment text omits references to the \nclassified annex, as well as other provisions that were specific to \nfiscal year 2010, that were present in S. 3611. This is reflected \nthrough the deletion of six provisions in S. 3611: sections 101, 102, \n103, 104, 201, and 348. The amendment includes a new section 101, which \nis being included at the request of the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence. This section makes clear that all funds \nappropriated, reprogrammed, or transferred for intelligence or \nintelligence-related activities in fiscal year 2010 may be obligated or \nexpended. This provision is necessary to meet the terms of section \n504(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. Sec.  414.\n  This legislation also amends section 331 from the version of the bill \npreviously passed by the Senate concerning notification procedures. The \namendment adds text to ensure that in the case of a limited \nnotification of a covert action to the House and Senate leaders and \nchairmen and ranking members of the two intelligence committees--the \nso-called ``Gang of\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nEight''--in place of the full membership of those committees, the basis \nof the limited notification will be reviewed in the executive branch \nwithin 180 days and reasons for continuation of the limited \nnotification will be submitted to the Gang of Eight.\n  The amendment also adds text to require that in the case of a limited \nnotification, the President shall provide to all members of the \nintelligence committees a ``general description'' of the covert action. \nThis implements the idea first described by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee in 1980 that the limited notification procedure is to protect \nin extraordinary cases certain sensitive aspects of an intelligence \nactivity; the purpose of the authority is not to shield entire \nintelligence programs from the oversight of the full intelligence \ncommittees.\n  Recent legislation from the Select Committee on Intelligence has \nincluded similar provisions to the requirement to provide to all \ncommittee members a ``general description.'' The committee's bill, S. \n1494, which the Senate passed unanimously in September 2009, included a \nsimilar provision, but the version of the bill passed in August 2010, \nS. 3611, did not.\n  Of note, the legislative language in this amendment makes clear that \nthe general description of the covert action is to be provided by the \nPresident to all members of the committees, consistent with the reasons \nfor not yet fully informing all members of the intelligence committees. \nThe administration agrees that this gives the President sufficient \nflexibility in extraordinary circumstances to protect sensitive \nnational security information.\n  Finally, the amendment I am offering includes a new section, section \n348, on access by the Comptroller General to the information of \nelements of the intelligence community. Both S. 1494 and H.R. 2701 \nincluded sections on audits of intelligence community elements by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO. No GAO provision was included in \nS. 3611 because, at the time that S. 3611 was reported and then acted \non by the Senate, no agreement had been reached on a provision that \nwould be acceptable to both the administration and the Congress.\n  Section 348 represents a compromise that the Congress and the \nadministration can support. It requires the Director of National \nIntelligence, DNI, to issue a directive on GAO access. While the \ndirective shall be issued following consultation with the Comptroller \nGeneral, the amendment is clear that this is to be the DNI's directive. \nIt is the DNI who has the responsibility to craft a directive that is \nconsistent with existing law, both as regards the authority of the \nComptroller General under title 31 of the United States Code and the \nprovisions of the National Security Act. The directive shall be \nprovided to the Congress before it goes into effect and the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress can then take whatever legislative or \noversight actions they deem appropriate.\n  The Department of Defense has issued a directive governing GAO access \nto Defense special access programs. This directive is regarded as \nhaving resolved successfully the issues that the Department and GAO had \npreviously encountered. As the DNI carries out the duties of this \nsection, it will be important for him to be mindful of the manner in \nwhich individual departments with intelligence components have \nestablished procedures governing access by GAO. This is true for the \nDepartment of Defense as well as other Departments, such the Department \nof Homeland Security and its intelligence component, the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis. We expect that the DNI will coordinate \nclosely with the heads of such departments in order to ensure that the \nDNI's directive resolves outstanding issues without disrupting GAO's \nworking relationships with such departments.\n  As written, this section requires the Director of National \nIntelligence to submit this directive to ``the Congress.'' The intent \nof this provision is to have this directive broadly available, in \nunclassified form or classified form as the case may be, to those \ncommittees with jurisdiction over the DNI, the 16 intelligence entities \nin the intelligence community, the departments in which those agencies \nreside, and the GAO.\n  There are additional technical, typographical and conforming changes \nincluded in this legislation from S. 3611, the intelligence bill passed \nby the Senate in August 2010. This includes a change in section 322, \nthe business system transformation section, in several places where an \naction was to be taken by September 30, 2010. Those actions are now \nrequired to be taken within 60 days after enactment.\n  In all other respects, the Feinstein-Bond amendment consists of \nexactly what the Senate has already passed by unanimous consent. The \nlegislative history of S. 3611 is fully applicable to the provisions of \nthis amendment that are carried over from S. 3611. This legislative \nhistory includes the committee report, S. Rep. No. 111-223, and the \nfloor statements and letters placed in the Record on Senate passage of \nS. 3611, see 156 Cong. Rec. S6795-6799--daily ed., August 5, 2010. S. \nRep. No. 111-223 has a detailed section-by-section description of the \nprovisions of S. 3611, including a description of the reconciliation of \nHouse and Senate provisions from H.R. 2701, as it passed the House, and \nS. 1494.\n  I received today a letter from the general counsel in the Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Robert Litt, indicating that \n``the President's senior advisors would recommend that he sign this \nbill if it is presented for his signature.'' I will ask that this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  As I noted at the outset, there has not been an intelligence \nauthorization act enacted in nearly 6 years. Prior to December 2004, \nthere had been such a bill every year since the creation of the \nintelligence committees in the late 1970s.\n  It is vitally important for the intelligence committees to pass an \nauthorization bill this week. Failure to enact an authorization bill \nweakens congressional oversight and it denies the intelligence \ncommunity appropriate updates in the law.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize some individuals who have \ndevoted enormous time and effort to reaching this point. First, Senator \nKit Bond, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been fighting for \nthis legislation with me in a completely bipartisan way since we began \nat the beginning of last year. Second, the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee who have contributed important provisions in the bill, and \nhave supported our efforts to keep the bill moving even in some cases \nwhere their provisions had to be dropped.\n  And finally, the staff, who have drafted this bill three separate \ntimes and conducted negotiations with the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, other offices in the House, the Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence, and the White House for more \nthan a year. I would like to commend and thank my counsels: Mike \nDavidson, Christine Healey, and Alissa Starzak for their work. I thank \nas well Senator Bond's counsels, Jack Livingston and Kathleen Rice.\n  While there is no classified annex to authorize funding levels in \nthis bill, I appreciate the work begun by Lorenzo Goco and continued by \nPeggy Evans in putting together the annex that accompanied the \nintelligence authorization bills that passed the Senate last September \nand this August.\n  Finally, I appreciate the work of Tommy Ross, national security \nadviser to Majority Leader Harry Reid, for his substantial efforts to \nmake sure that the House and the executive branch remained engaged in \nthe negotiations over this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Senate amendment to the House \nbill. If we are able to reach unanimous consent on this measure, it \nwill go back to the House for final passage and presentment to the \nPresident. I am hopeful that we can accomplish this prior to recessing \nlater this week for the November elections, and urge support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from Mr. Robert Litt to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\n\n                                            Office of the Director\n\n\n                                     of National Intelligence,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman and Vice Chairman Bond: On June 10, \n     2010, the Director of OMB wrote to inform you that, on the \n     assumption that there would be no material changes to the S. \n     3611, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010, the President's senior advisors would recommend he sign \n     the bill. The Administration has reviewed the proposed \n     amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2010, embodied in the draft amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute to H.R. 2701 provided to us on September 24, 2010. \n     There are two significant changes from S. 3611 passed by the \n     Senate on August 5, 2010 relating to the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) and congressional notification. \n     Earlier provisions on these issues were subject to a veto \n     threat. However, based on our interpretation of the changes, \n     which I have outlined below, the President's senior advisors \n     would recommend that he sign this bill if it is presented for \n     his signature.\n       The proposed Senate amendment includes a new provision that \n     would require the Director of National Intelligence to issue \n     a directive, in consultation with the Comptroller General, \n     governing access of the Comptroller General to information in \n     the possession of an Intelligence Community element. Nothing \n     in this provision changes the underlying law with respect to \n     GAO access to intelligence information. We interpret this \n     provision to provide the DNI with wide latitude when \n     developing the directive to ensure that it conforms with (1) \n     the statutory provisions governing GAO's jurisdiction and \n     access to information; (2) the intelligence oversight \n     structure embodied in the National Security Act; and (3) \n     relevant opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       The second significant change relates to the provision that \n     alters the current congressional notification framework. It \n     is important to note at the outset that the Administration \n     has already indicated that, with respect to the requirement \n     to provide ``the legal authority under which [an] \n     intelligence activity is being or was conducted,'' we \n     construe that requirement only to require that the \n     Executive Branch provide the committee with an explanation \n     of the legal basis for the activity; it would not require \n     disclosure of any privileged information or disclosure of \n     information in any particular form.\n       The proposed amendment would significantly change the \n     earlier version of this provision by requiring that the \n     Executive Branch provide all congressional intelligence \n     committee members who do not receive a finding or \n     notification a ``general description regarding the finding or \n     notification, as applicable, consistent with the reasons for \n     not yet fully informing all members of such committee.'' The \n     Administration has previously threatened to veto the \n     Intelligence Authorization Bill over a congressional \n     notification provision that contained similar language. This \n     provision, however, differs from the earlier provision \n     because the requirement to provide a ``general description'' \n     is limited to a description that is ``consistent with reasons \n     for not yet fully informing all members of such committee.'' \n     We interpret this new language as providing sufficient \n     flexibility to craft a description that the President deems \n     appropriate, based on the extraordinary circumstances \n     affecting vital interests of the United States resulting in \n     the limited notification, and recognizing the President's \n     authority and responsibility to protect sensitive national \n     security information in the context of the notice and general \n     description requirement.\n       We wish to confirm that you understand and agree with these \n     interpretations. We would prefer to reduce this \n     interpretation to writing for inclusion in the amendment \n     itself, and will work with you to that end; otherwise, we \n     wish to ensure that you agree with our interpretation of \n     these provisions. With these understandings, the President's \n     senior advisors would recommend that he sign this bill if it \n     is presented for his signature.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's Program, there is no \n     objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert S.

Goetz\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of Captain Dale A. Goetz. Captain \nGoetz, assigned to the 4th Infantry Division, based at Fort Carson, CO, \ndied on August 30, 2010, of injuries sustained when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his vehicle. Captain Goetz was serving \nin support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the Arghandab River Valley, \nAfghanistan. He was 43 years old.\n  A native of White, SD, Captain Goetz graduated in 1995 from Marantha \nBaptist Bible College in Watertown, WI, with a bachelor's degree. After \nserving in White for several years as a pastor, Captain Goetz enlisted \nin the Army in 2004 and served tours in Japan, Iraq and Afghanistan--\nall with decoration.\n  During his years of service, Captain Goetz distinguished himself \nthrough his courage, dedication to his soldiers, and unremitting \ndevotion to his faith. His skillful ministry comforted troops and made \nthem more effective in the field, and he never hesitated to engage and \ncounsel others who held beliefs different than his own.\n  Captain Goetz worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered by those \nwho knew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment \nto excellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated husband and as a \nloving father to his three children.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Captain \nGoetz's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Iraq and Afghanistan. And though his fate was uncertain, he \npushed forward, counseling our soldiers and promoting the ideals we \nhold dear. For his service and the lives he touched, Captain Goetz will \nforever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.\n  To his wife Christina, his sons Landon, Caleb, and Joel, and his \nentire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope \nthat, in time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in \nDale's service and by your knowledge that his country will never forget \nhim. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Casey J. Grochowiak\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor \nthe life and heroic service of SSG Casey J. Grochowiak.

He enlisted in the\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nArmy in 2000, serving two tours in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan--\nall with decoration.\n  During nearly 11 years of service, Sergeant Grochowiak distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and absolute \ncommitment to his troops. Despite having received a medical waiver for \nhis last tour in Afghanistan, Sergeant Grochowiak shipped out and \nfought on anyway, citing his obligation to protect his young soldiers.\n  Sergeant Grochowiak worked on the front lines of battle, serving in \nthe most dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the \nWyoming Army National Guard 300th Armored Field Artillery Battalion \nCowboy Cannoneers.\n  On October 1, 2010, the 300th soldiers will gather for their final \nbattalion reunion. This reunion marks the 60th anniversary of their \nKorean war mobilization.\n  On August 19, 1950, the citizen soldiers of 300th AFA answered the \ncall, picked up their rifles and put on their uniforms to defend our \ngreat country. My wife Bobbi's father, Sergeant First Class Robert L. \nBrown was one of these brave men.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7502, September 27, 2010, the Record reads: On August \n19, 1950, the citizen soldiers of 300th AFA answered the call, \npicked up their rifles and put on their uniforms to defend our \ngreat country. My wife Bobbi's father, Robert L. Brown, was one of \nthese brave men.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: On August 19, \n1950, the citizen soldiers of 300th AFA answered the call, picked \nup their rifles and put on their uniforms to defend our great \ncountry. My wife Bobbi's father, Sergeant First Class Robert L. \nBrown, was one of these brave men.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  After 21 days at sea, the 300th finally landed at Pusan, Korea on \nFebruary 15, 1951. In the Spring of 1951, the Chinese People's \nVolunteers launched a major offensive of human wave style attacks.\n  Master Sergeant Bill Daly described his first encounter with a \ncommunist human wave:\n\n       The morning of 16 May and all hell is breaking loose--Fire \n     Mission! Fire Mission! The gun crews sprang into action, the \n     300th with its 12 105mm howitzers, fired mission after \n     mission. We could see the Chinese coming across the rice \n     paddies and down the road toward us from Chau-ni as our \n     shells land among them . . . It's a human wave.\n\n  From the Battle of Soyang to the Battle for the Punchbowl, the Cowboy \nCannoneers provided unrivaled fires support for the U.S. Army X Corps \nand 1st Marine Division. In 256 days of combat, the 300th fired 300,000 \nartillery rounds. No other battalion sent a battery farther north of \nthe 38th parallel than the 300th. As a result, the 300th was awarded \nthe Army Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea \nPresidential Unit Citation.\n  For over 59 years, recognition of the heroism of the 300th was \nincomplete. The Cowboy Cannoneers were not included in the 1st Marine \nDivision Presidential Unit Citation. Yet history shows they delivered \ndevastating artillery fire support that pounded enemy positions in \nsupport of the 1st Marine Division.\n  Jim Craig (MSgt USMC Ret.) of Sheridan, WY, asked me to help COL Tim \nSheppard correct the Marine Corps history. They worked closely with \nCharles Ziegler of my staff to present evidence to the Secretary of the \nNavy, Ray Mabus, and Commandant of the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway. \nThe overwhelming evidence supported including the 300th in the 1st \nMarine Division Presidential Unit Citation.\n  I am pleased to announce that General Conway recommended including \nthe 300th as a reinforcing unit to the 1st Marine Division. Secretary \nMabus has signed the order. The record is now correct for the 300th and \nits descendent unit the 2-300th Field Artillery Battalion.\n  I would like to thank MG Ed Wright, COL Tim Sheppard and COL Larry \nBarttelbort (Ret) for their resolve and commitment to uncover the facts \nabout the historic service of the 300th. I would also like to thank \nSecretary Mabus, Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, General Conway and \ntheir teams.\n  We all know the Korean war is commonly referred to in the history \nbooks as ``The Forgotten War.'' Not in Wyoming.\n  In Wyoming, we never forget the service of our brave men and women \nwho wore the uniform of the United States. We realize that we live safe \nand free today because of the heroism exemplified by the 300th Cowboy \nCannoneers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of Wyoming's citizen soldiers who served with the 300th at \nthe time of the Korean war mobilization.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Headquarters and Headquarters Battery\n\n\n                300th Armored Field Artillery Battalion\n\n                           Sheridan, Wyoming\n\n\n                                Officers\n\n       Lt.

COBLENTZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with deep sorrow that I join \nmy colleagues today in honoring the memory of an incredible public \nservant and a dear friend of mine, William Coblentz. My heart goes out \nto his family, whom he loved so much: his wife Jean, sister Lolita, \ndaughter Wendy, son Andy, son-in-law Jim, daughter-in-law Shari, and \nfour grandchildren: Nikki, Ben, Jake, and Gena. A loving family man, \ngifted attorney, and astute political figure, Bill left an enduring \nimpact on the city of San Francisco, the State of California, and our \nNation. Bill passed\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\naway on September 13, 2010, in San Francisco. He was 88 years old.\n  Bill, a native of San Francisco, was born in 1922 and attended Lowell \nHigh School. After graduating from UC Berkeley in 1943, Bill served in \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. Upon completing \nhis service, Bill attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1947.\n  Although Bill's monumental legal career began in land use law, it \nquickly expanded to reflect the diversity of his interests and \npassions. His private practice, Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, played \nan essential role in guiding the development of several transformative \nSan Francisco projects including Yerba Buena Gardens, Levi Plaza, \nMission Bay, and AT Park. In the 1960s, Bill helped rock concert \npromoter Bill Graham win a permit to open San Francisco's renowned \nFillmore Auditorium.\n  Bill's passion for civic engagement was unyielding. He entered the \npolitical scene as a young adviser to then-California Attorney General \nPat Brown. When he became Governor, Brown offered Bill a seat on the \nUniversity of California Board of Regents, which he occupied for the \nnext 16 years. During this time, he developed a reputation for \ndefending the rights of outspoken students and faculty. Bill had a \nstrong passion for the promotion of civil rights. In 2008, Bill's law \nfirm honored his civil rights work by establishing the Coblentz \nFellowship for Civil Rights at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.\n  I had the honor of calling Bill a friend. His ability to connect with \npeople was unparalleled. From his influential clients, to his political \nadvisees, to his fellow San Franciscans, Bill treated everyone with the \nrespect, humor and consideration he believed they deserved. His \nrelationship with San Francisco was with its people, and it was one \nthat he cherished throughout his life.\n  Bill approached the people and experiences in his life with a rare \ncombination of courage, humility, and authenticity. His wisdom and \ncamaraderie were consistent sources of inspiration that will truly be \nmissed. Although he is no longer with us, Bill left us not only with \nthe tangible symbols of his legacy in San Francisco, but also with \nenduring memories of his engaging personality and steadfast \ndetermination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7504-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING KENNETH RAY HALL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Connecticut \nState trooper first class Kenneth Ray Hall of Hartford, CT, who was \nkilled in the line of duty earlier this month. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to Trooper Hall's \nfamily, his colleagues on the Connecticut State Police force, and all \nthose who knew and loved him. The sense of loss they must feel is \nundoubtedly immense, and I know that I speak for all residents of the \nState of Connecticut when I say that we stand with them during this \ntime of unimaginable grief.\n  Every single day, in communities large and small throughout this \ncountry, law enforcement officers take on incredible personal risks to \nsafeguard our lives and property. Trained to act bravely and selflessly \neven in the most harrowing of situations, these heroic men and women \nfrequently put themselves in danger to protect people they have never \neven met. And all too often, these individuals are called upon to make \nthe ultimate sacrifice, giving their own lives in defense of their \nfellow citizens. Indeed, since the department's founding in 1903, 18 \nConnecticut State troopers have died in the line of duty.\n  Trooper Kenneth Hall was no different in that regard. A 22-year \nveteran of the Connecticut State Police who also served as a marine \nsniper in Vietnam, Trooper Hall's life exemplified the kind of personal \ncourage and unflinching dedication to public service that are so \nengrained in the culture of America's law enforcement community. \nTrooper Hall loved his job and was absolutely devoted to helping and \nprotecting the people of his State and Nation. And that was ultimately \nwhat he died doing.\n  Late in the afternoon on September 2, Trooper Hall stopped a vehicle \non I-91 in Enfield, CT, for a routine traffic violation. While he was \npulled over on the side of the road filling out paper work, Trooper \nHall's police cruiser was struck from behind by a pickup truck. The car \nwas severely damaged, and Trooper Hall was rushed to Baystate Medical \nCenter, just across the border in Springfield, MA. Tragically, in spite \nof the best efforts of first responders to save his life, Trooper Hall \npassed away not long after the accident. He was only 57.\n  In death, Trooper Hall left behind a number of significant, enduring \nlegacies. He was beloved by his colleagues on the Connecticut State \nPolice force, who saw him not only as a wonderful officer, but as a \nfirst-rate friend. And he was also part of a larger family of local and \nState law enforcement officers across the country who considered him a \nbrother in arms. Is it any wonder then, that thousands of police \nofficers, some from as far away as Louisiana and California, gathered \nat his funeral in Hartford on September 11? What a fitting tribute for \nsuch an amazing officer, a man who dedicated the better part of his \nlife to serving the public good.\n  But perhaps the most important of the numerous legacies Trooper Hall \nleft behind is his large, closely-knit, and incredibly loving family. \nFor his wife Sheila, seven adult children, Tara, Troy, Norman, Teon, \nTyco, Andrea and Michael, and countless other family members, Trooper \nHall was more than just a dedicated member of Connecticut's State \nPolice force. He was the consummate family man--an individual who \nrelished every opportunity to spend an afternoon with relatives or dote \non his grandchildren.\n  So, it is with great sadness that I join Trooper Hall's loved ones, \nfriends, colleagues, and everyone else whose life was touched in some \nway by this wonderful man, in mourning his untimely death. While I \nrealize there are few words that can assuage the enormous sense of \ngrief they undoubtedly feel, it is my hope that Trooper Hall's years of \ncommendable service to his State, love for his family, and devotion to \nhis friends will provide them with some measure of comfort during the \nmonths and years that lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7504-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7504-S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR ``KENNY'' AND JUDY SIMMONS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize two \nvery special parents in my home State of West Virginia--parents who \nhave so defined the unconditional love that a parent can have for a \nchild, that their actions have had a national impact in the fields of \nadoption and foster care.\n  Each year, Members of Congress have the honor and privilege of \nrecognizing, through the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, \nextraordinary persons who have answered one of our Nation's most \nimportant calls to action to provide our most vulnerable children with \na forever family.\n  Children are the future leaders of our great country, and adoption \nand foster care are causes that has always been close to my heart. I am \nproud to officially recognize two West Virginian angels--Arthur \n``Kenny'' and Judy Simmons--as true angels in adoption.\n  Kenny and Judy adopted two 13-year-old boys, Joshua and Terry. The \nwillingness to open a home to older children is special; all too often \nthese children are left behind. Prior to adoption, these young boys \nstruggled with uncertainty and one child endured 23 different homes \nwhile waiting for permanency. Judy and Kenny have given him a home, \nsecurity and a future. The needs of children in foster care are \nchallenging. But when we help these vulnerable, young people, we change \ntheir life, and in fact the lives of the entire family and communities. \nThis is why throughout my Senate career, I have worked to improve \nFederal policies for adoptions and child welfare including the 2008 \nFostering Connections Act and the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n1997. We should provide support and encouragement for foster and \nadoptive families the quality training and education they need and the \nall of the support possible for the caseworkers and judges making the \ntough decisions about a child's placement.\n  Each fall, I have the pleasure of honoring one of the families in our \nState who have opened their hearts and homes to children in need. It is \nmy great honor to highlight these heroes\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\namong us. The Simmons' family gives all they can and never gives up. \nThey are the eptiomy of what a committed, forever family, is all about. \nFor this, I want to recognize, honor, and thank them for their passion \nand dedication and for being true angels in adoption I admire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7505-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7505-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7505-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 24, 2010, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1674.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\n     Congress to protect and preserve the ability of California \n     wineries, as all American wineries, to ship wine directly to \n     consumers without discrimination between in-state and out-of-\n     state wine producers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas. California is the fourth largest wine producing \n     region in the world, after France, Italy, and Spain; and\n       Whereas, California has 2,972 bonded wineries; and\n       Whereas, California has 4,600 winegrape growers; and\n       Whereas, California has 531,000 acres of winegrapes; and\n       Whereas, California winegrowers ship over 193 million \n     cases, representing some 467 million gallons of wine to the \n     United States wine market; and\n       Whereas, the California wine industry creates more than \n     330,000 jobs, billions of dollars in economic impact, and \n     preserves agricultural land and family farms; and\n       Whereas, the California wine industry generates higher \n     taxes than most industries because, as a regulated industry, \n     it pays excise taxes to the state and federal government on \n     every gallon of wine; and\n       Whereas, the California wine industry has an annual impact \n     of $61.5 billion on the state's economy and produces the \n     number one finished agricultural product in the state; and\n       Whereas, the economic impact of the United States wine \n     industry on the national economy is $121.8 billion annually; \n     and\n       Whereas, California's wine industry attracts 20.7 million \n     tourists annually to all regions of California and generates \n     wine-related tourism expenditures of $2.1 billion; and\n       Whereas, currently 37 states and the District of Columbia \n     allow direct shipping of wine from winegrowers to consumers; \n     and\n       Whereas, the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit of small \n     California wineries drives the entire industry to improve and \n     progress; and\n       Whereas, in order to reach consumers in other states, many \n     California wineries have turned to direct marketing and \n     shipping of their wines; and\n       Whereas, since 1985 California has pioneered consumer \n     access to wine through reciprocal and permit shipping to \n     alleviate scarcity at the retail level of California wines; \n     and\n       Whereas, over the past 10 years, consolidation trends \n     within the wholesale tier have made it difficult for \n     California wineries to achieve adequate distribution, and, as \n     a result, have limited consumer choice; and\n       Whereas, California wineries have offered voluntarily to \n     have their direct marketing and shipping permitted and \n     regulated by other states to ensure that those states collect \n     the same taxes that wines sold through the three-tier system \n     must pay, that direct deliveries would be made only to \n     adults, and that direct deliveries are not made in ``dry'' \n     areas, as defined under the laws of each state; and\n       Whereas, the California wine industry has developed \n     comprehensive model direct shipping legislation to address \n     all of the concerns expressed by state alcohol regulators \n     across the country; and\n       Whereas, California has enacted a law to open direct \n     shipping of wine from other states to its own residents \n     without limitation through a simple permit system to comply \n     with the decision in Granholm v. Heald (2005) 544 U.S. 460; \n     and\n       Whereas, States' rights to regulate wine and alcohol \n     granted by the 21st Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution have always been subject to constitutional \n     limitation and judicial review; and\n       Whereas, court decisions over the last 40 years balance \n     state authority to regulate alcohol with the framer's belief \n     that the nation would only succeed if interstate commerce \n     thrived; and\n       Whereas, the Commerce Clause has been applied judiciously \n     by the courts to foster national economic goals while \n     preserving nondiscriminatory state authority; and\n       Whereas, the landmark 2005 United States Supreme Court \n     case, Granholm v. Heald, reaffirmed states' rights under the \n     21st Amendment to the United States Constitution to regulate \n     wine as long as they do not discriminate between in-state \n     producers and out-of-state producers, and correctly ruled \n     that these rights do not supersede other provisions of the \n     Constitution; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would severely limit consumer choice in \n     California wine throughout the nation as direct-to-consumer \n     laws are amended or repealed; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would imperil market access for \n     California wineries that cannot secure effective wholesale \n     distribution; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would stunt competition among the \n     nation's 7,011 wine producers as markets are artificially \n     constrained and access is limited; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would allow certain state alcohol laws \n     to avoid judicial scrutiny through a presumption of validity; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would reverse decades of long-\n     established jurisprudence that has balanced interstate \n     commerce concerns with state regulatory authority and \n     fostered a dramatic growth in wine production, sales, and tax \n     revenue; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would insulate and sanction \n     discriminatory state laws by reversing evidentiary rules for \n     Commerce Clause legal challenges and increasing the burden of \n     proof of plaintiffs; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would frustrate legitimate challenges to \n     superficially neutral, but nonetheless discriminatory, state \n     laws like the landmark Massachusetts production cap case, \n     Family Winemakers of California v. Jenkins (2010) 592 F.3d 1; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 5034 would be an unprecedented shift in the \n     relationship between federal and state authority over wine; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby respectfully urges Congress to protect and \n     preserve the ability of California wineries, as well as all \n     American wineries, to ship wine directly to consumers without \n     discrimination between in-state and out-of-state wine \n     producers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     urges the defeat of H.R. 5034; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-143.

Stevens. \nIn Stevens, the Supreme Court overturned the 1999 Act banning \ndepictions of animal cruelty on the basis that it was \nunconstitutionally overbroad, in violation of the First Amendment.\n  The Stevens case did not involve crush videos and the Court \nspecifically stated that it was not deciding whether a statute limited \nto crush videos would be constitutional. Instead it left the door open \nfor Congress to enact a narrowly tailored ban on animal crush videos.\n  Our legislation would ban animal crush videos that fit squarely \nwithin\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\nthe obscenity doctrine, a well-established exception to the First \nAmendment. The Senate Judiciary Committee received testimony earlier \nthis month on the obscene nature of crush videos. Dr. Kevin Volkan, a \npsychology professor with an expertise in atypical psychopathologies, \ntestified about the sexual nature of crush videos and the specific \nparaphilias associated with them. He stated that in his professional \nopinion the crush videos contain elements of specific forms of \nparaphilia in varying degrees and that people, usually men, watch crush \nvideos for sexual gratification. The Humane Society's two crush video \ninvestigations also confirm the inherent sexual nature of many crush \nvideos. Those investigations also found a growing market for custom-\nmade videos for those with crush paraphilia.\n  The United States also has a long-history of prohibiting speech that \nis essential to criminal conduct. In the case of animal crush videos, \nthe videos themselves drive the criminal conduct depicted in them. \nEvery State and the District of Columbia have laws criminalizing the \nanimal cruelty depicted in the videos, but these laws are hard to \nenforce. The acts of extreme animal cruelty are committed secretively \nand anonymously. The nature of the videos also makes it difficult to \ndetermine when and where the crimes occurred or that the crime occurred \nwithin the relevant statute of limitations. These prosecutorial \ndifficulties are confirmed by the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. \nGiven the difficulty in prosecuting the underlying conduct using state \nlaw, the integral connection between the video and the criminal \nconduct, and the recent proliferation of animal crush videos on the \nInternet since the Stevens decision, it is necessary for Congress to \nenact a new Federal law targeting the interstate distribution network \nfor animal crush videos.\n  This measure will also take an important step by banning non-\ncommercial distribution of animal crush videos. We believe this is \nnecessary given the nature of the Internet and the propagation of file-\nsharing and peer-to-peer networks that exist today. Similar to other \nFederal criminal statutes that prohibit non-commercial distribution, \nthere is an exception for law enforcement purposes.\n  I want to thank Senators Leahy and Sessions and their staffs for \ntheir assistance in addressing this important issue and holding a \nhearing on the topic in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I also want to \nthank the Humane Society for bringing this issue to Congress' attention \nand working tirelessly to address it.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support this legislation and work with \nme to swiftly enact it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Franken, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 3842. A bill to protect crime victims' rights, to eliminate the \nsubstantial backlog of DNA samples collected from crime scenes and \nconvicted offenders, to improve and expand the DNA testing capacity of \nFederal, State, and local crime laboratories, to increase research and \ndevelopment of new DNA testing technologies, to develop new training \nprograms regarding the collection and use of DNA evidence, to provide \npost conviction testing of DNA evidence to exonerate the innocent, to \nimprove the performance of counsel in State capital cases, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Justice \nfor All Reauthorization Act of 2010, together with Senator Franken. The \nJustice for All Act, passed in 2004, was an unprecedented bipartisan \npiece of criminal justice legislation and the most significant step \nCongress had taken in many years to improve the quality of justice in \nthis country, and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the \nAmerican justice system. After several hearings and much work, today we \nbegin in earnest the process of building on that foundation to go still \nfurther to ensure our criminal justice system works fairly and \neffectively for all Americans.\n  In 2000, I introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which aimed to \nimprove the administration of justice by ensuring that defendants in \nthe most serious cases receive competent representation and, where \nappropriate, access to post-conviction DNA testing necessary to prove \ntheir innocence in those cases where the system got it grievously \nwrong.\n  The Innocence Protection Act became a key component of the Justice \nfor All Act, along with important provisions to ensure that crime \nvictims would have the rights and protections they need and deserve, \nand that States and communities would take major steps to reduce the \nbacklog of untested rape kits and give prompt justice for victims of \nsexual assault. These and other important criminal justice provisions \nmade the Justice for All Act a groundbreaking achievement in criminal \njustice reform.\n  The programs created by the Justice For All Act have had an enormous \nimpact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them. Unfortunately, the \nCommittee's hearings and recent headlines have made clear that simply \nreauthorizing the existing law is not enough. Significant problems \nremain, and we must work together to address them.\n  In too many communities around the country, large numbers of untested \nrape kids have come to light, many of which have not even made their \nway to crime labs. It is unacceptable that rape victims must still live \nin fear and wait for justice. We must act to fix this continuing \nproblem.\n  We have also seen too many cases of people found to be innocent after \nspending years in jail, and we have faced the harrowing possibility \nthat the unthinkable may have happened: the State of Texas may have \nexecuted an innocent man. We must act to ensure that our criminal \njustice system works as it should so that relevant evidence is tested \nand considered and all defendants receive quality representation.\n  I thank Senator Franken for working with me on these important issues \nand helping to craft this important bill. I also appreciate the \nRepublican Senators, including Senators Sessions and Grassley, who have \nprovided input for this bill and participated in the process. I am \nconfident that this legislation will be enacted in a bipartisan \nfashion, just as the original Justice for All Act was, and I look \nforward to working with Democrats and Republicans to reach that goal.\n  The original Justice for All Act included the Debbie Smith DNA \nBacklog Reduction Program, which authorized significant funding to \nreduce the backlog of untested rape kits so that victims need not live \nin fear while kits languish in storage. That program is named after \nDebbie Smith, who lived in fear for years after being attacked before \nher rape kit was tested and the perpetrator was caught. She and her \nhusband Rob have worked tirelessly to ensure that others need not \nexperience the ordeal she went through. I thank Debbie and Rob for \ntheir continuing help on this extremely important cause.\n  Since we passed this important law in 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has \nresulted in hundreds of millions of dollars going to States for the \ntesting of DNA samples to reduce backlogs. I have worked with Senators \nof both parties to ensure full funding for the Debbie Smith Act each \nyear.\n  As I have researched the problem of untested rape kits, there is one \nthing that I have heard again and again: the Debbie Smith program has \nbeen working and is making a major difference. I have heard from the \nJustice Department, the States, including Vermont, law enforcement, and \nvictims' advocates, that Debbie Smith grants have led to significant \nand meaningful backlog reductions and to justice for victims in \njurisdictions across the country.\n  Unfortunately, despite the good strides we have made and the \nsignificant Federal funding for these efforts, we have seen alarming \nreports of continuing backlogs. A 2008 study found 12,500 untested rape \nkits in the Los Angeles area alone. While Los Angeles has since made \nprogress in addressing the problem, other cities have now reported \nbacklogs almost as severe. The Justice Department released a report \nlast year finding that in 18 percent of open, unsolved rape cases, \nevidence had not even been submitted to a crime lab.\n  That Justice Department study gets to a key component of this problem \nthat has not yet been addressed. No matter how much money we send to \ncrime labs for testing, if samples that\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\ncould help close cases instead sit on the shelf in police evidence \nrooms and never make it to the lab, that money will do no good. Police \nofficers must understand the importance of testing this vital evidence \nand must learn when testing is appropriate and necessary. In too many \njurisdictions, rape kits taken from victims who put themselves through \nfurther hardship to take these samples--rape kits that could help law \nenforcement to get criminals off the street--are sitting untested.\n  The bill we introduce today will finally address this part of the \nproblem by mandating that the Department of Justice develop practices \nand protocols for the processing of DNA evidence and provide technical \nassistance to State and local governments to implement those protocols. \nThe bill authorizes funding to States and communities to reduce their \nrape kit backlogs at the law enforcement stage by training officers, \nimproving practices, developing evidence tracking systems, and taking \nother key steps to make sure that this crucial evidence gets to the \nlabs to be tested.\n  The bill will also help us get to the bottom of this problem by \ncalling for the development of a standardized definition of \n``backlog,'' covering both the law enforcement and lab stages, and by \nimplementing public reporting requirements to help us to identify where \nthe backlogs are. It also takes steps to ensure that labs test DNA \nsamples in the best order so that those samples which can help secure \njustice for rape victims are tested most quickly. It will also put into \nplace new accountability requirements to make sure that Debbie Smith \nAct money is being spent effectively and appropriately.\n\n  The bill makes important changes to existing law to ensure that no \nrape victims are ever required to pay for testing of their rape kits, \nand that these costs are covered with no strings attached. Senator \nFranken has been a strong advocate of this important provision, and I \nthank him for his help.\n  We have also taken important new steps to ensure that defendants in \nserious cases receive adequate representation and, where appropriate, \ntesting of relevant DNA samples. As a former prosecutor, I have great \nfaith in the men and women in law enforcement, and I know that in the \nvast majority of cases, our criminal justice system does work fairly \nand effectively. I also know, however, that the system only works as it \nshould when each side is well represented by competent and well-trained \ncounsel, and when all relevant evidence is retained and tested. Sadly, \nwe learn regularly of defendants released after new evidence exonerates \nthem. We must do better. It is an outrage when an innocent person is \npunished, and it is doubly an outrage that, in those cases, the guilty \nperson remains on the streets, able to commit more crimes, which makes \nall of us less safe.\n  This legislation takes important new steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive constitutionally adequate representation. It requires the \nDepartment of Justice to assist States that want help developing an \neffective and efficient system of indigent defense, and it establishes \na cause of action for the Federal Government to step in when States are \nsystematically failing to provide the representation called for in the \nConstitution.\n  This is a reasonable measure that gives the States assistance and \ntime needed to make necessary changes and seeks to provide an incentive \nfor States to do so. Prosecutors and defense attorneys recognize the \nimportance of quality defense counsel. Houston District Attorney \nPatricia Lykos testified, quite persuasively, before the Judiciary \nCommittee about how competent defense attorneys help her do her job as \na prosecutor even better. I have also learned through this process that \nthe most effective systems of indigent defense are not always the most \nexpensive. In some cases, making the necessary changes may also save \nStates money.\n  This legislation will also help ensure that the innocent are not \npunished while the guilty remain free by strengthening the Kirk \nBloodsworth Post Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, one of the key \nprograms created in the Innocence Protection Act. Kirk Bloodsworth was \na young man just out of the Marines when he was arrested, convicted, \nand sentenced to death for a heinous crime that he did not commit. He \nwas the first person in the United States to be exonerated from a death \nrow crime through the use of DNA evidence.\n  This program provides grants to States for testing in cases like \nKirk's where someone has been convicted, but where significant DNA \nevidence was not tested. The last administration resisted implementing \nthe program for several years, but we worked hard to see the program \nput into place. Now, money has gone out to a number of States, and the \nCommittee has heard strong testimony that the program is making an \nimpact. The legislation we introduce today expands the very modest \nauthorization of funds to this important program and clarifies the \nconditions set for this program so that participating States are \nrequired to preserve key evidence, which is crucial, but are required \nto do so in a way that is attainable and will allow more States to \nparticipate.\n\n  The bill also asks states to produce comprehensive plans for their \ncriminal justice systems, which will help to ensure that criminal \njustice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of \nthe system work together and receive the resources they need. The bill \nreauthorizes and improves key grant programs in a variety of areas \nthroughout the criminal justice system. Importantly, it increases \nauthorized funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement \nGrant program, which is a vital program to assist forensic laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting perpetrators. I appreciate Senator Sessions' \nlongstanding support for this important program.\n  Finally, the legislation strengthens rights for victims of crime. It \ngives crime victims an affirmative right to be informed of all of their \nrights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act and other key laws, and it \ntakes several steps to make it easier for crime victims to assert their \nlegal rights in court. I thank Senators Feinstein and Kyl for their \nleadership in this area and their assistance in developing these \nprovisions.\n  In these times of tight budgets, it is important to note that this \nbill would make all of these improvements without increasing total \nauthorized funding under the Justice For All Act and that many of these \nchanges will help States, communities, and the Federal Government save \nmoney in the long term.\n  Today, we rededicate ourselves to building a criminal justice system \nin which the innocent remain free, the guilty are punished, and all \nsides have the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to advance the \ncause of justice. Americans need and deserve a criminal justice system \nwhich keeps us safe, ensures fairness and accuracy, and fulfills the \npromise of our constitution. This bill will take important steps to \nbring us closer to that goal. I hope there will be strong bipartisan \nsupport for these efforts moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3842\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Over-Classification \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 Commission'') \n     concluded that security requirements nurture over-\n     classification and excessive compartmentation of information \n     among agencies.\n       (2) The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that the \n     over-classification of information interferes with accurate, \n     actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the \n     cost of information security, and needlessly limits \n     stakeholder and public access to information.\n       (3) Over-classification of information causes considerable \n     confusion regarding what information may be shared with whom, \n     and negatively affects the dissemination of information \n     within the Federal Government and with State, local, and \n     tribal entities, and with the private sector.\n       (4) Over-classification of information is antithetical to \n     the creation and operation of the information sharing \n     environment established under section 1016 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 \n     U.S.C. 485).\n       (5) Federal departments or agencies authorized to make \n     original classification decisions or that perform derivative \n     classification of information are responsible for developing, \n     implementing, and administering policies, procedures, and \n     programs that promote compliance with applicable laws, \n     executive orders, and other authorities pertaining to the \n     proper use of classification markings and the policies of the \n     National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Derivative classification and original \n     classification.--The terms ``derivative classification'' and \n     ``original classification'' have the meanings given those \n     terms in Executive Order No. 13526.\n       (2) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 105 of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (3) Executive order no. 13526.--The term ``Executive Order \n     No. 13526'' means Executive Order No. 13526 (75 Fed.

Bartlett;\n       (5) Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican Senator in \n     the history of the Senate, served as President pro tempore of \n     the Senate from 2003 through 2007 and as President pro \n     tempore emeritus from 2008 to 2009, and over the course of \n     his career in the Senate, Ted Stevens served as assistant \n     Republican leader, Chairman of the Select Committee on \n     Ethics, Chairman of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, Chairman of the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and \n     Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation;\n       (6) Ted Stevens worked tirelessly for the enactment of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), \n     which provided for the conveyance of approximately 44,000,000 \n     acres of land in the State of Alaska to the Aleut, Eskimo, \n     and Indian peoples and created Native Corporations to secure \n     the long-term economic, cultural, and political empowerment \n     of the Native peoples of the State of Alaska;\n       (7) Ted Stevens was a leader in shaping the communications \n     policies of the United States, as he helped to establish the \n     spectrum auction policy, negotiated the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996, authored the Digital Television Transition and \n     Public Safety Act of 2005 (47 U.S.C. 309 note; Public Law \n     109-171), and passionately advocated for the connection of \n     rural America to the rest of the world and to improve the \n     lives of the people of the United States through the use of \n     telemedicine and distance learning;\n       (8) Ted Stevens was a conservationist who championed the \n     safe development of the natural resources of the United \n     States, as illustrated by his authorship of the Trans-Alaska \n     Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.), the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), which established the 200-mile \n     exclusive economic zone and led to a reduction in the \n     dominance of foreign fishing fleets in the fisheries of the \n     United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-479; \n     120 Stat. 3575), which established conservation measures \n     designed to end overfishing, and the High Seas Driftnet \n     Fisheries Enforcement Act (16 U.S.C. 1826a et seq.), which \n     provided for the denial of entry into ports of the United \n     States and the imposition of sanctions on vessels carrying \n     out large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive \n     economic zone of any nation;\n       (9) Ted Stevens was committed to health and fitness in his \n     personal life and in his legislative accomplishments, as \n     illustrated by his authorship of the Ted Stevens Amateur and \n     Olympic Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et seq.), his \n     encouragement of providing equality to female athletes \n     through the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments \n     of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), and his leadership in \n     improving physical education programs in schools through the \n     Carol M. White Physical Education Program (20 U.S.C. 7261 et \n     seq.);\n       (10) Ted Stevens unconditionally supported the needs of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States through visits to soldiers, \n     sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guardsmen in every major \n     military conflict and war zone where United States military \n     personnel have been assigned during his service in the \n     Senate, including Vietnam, Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and \n     Afghanistan, and in his role as Chairman and Ranking Member \n     of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations for more than \n     20 years;\n       (11) Ted Stevens was a devoted husband, father, and \n     grandfather who worked to promote family-friendly policies in \n     the Federal government;\n       (12) Ted Stevens was well-respected for reaching across the \n     aisle to forge bipartisan alliances and enjoyed many close \n     friendships with colleagues in both political parties and \n     with his staff, who were deeply loyal to him; and\n       (13) the designation of the unnamed highest peak in the \n     State of Alaska, along with an icefield in the Chugach \n     National Forest in that State, in honor of Ted Stevens would \n     be a fitting tribute to his honorable life and legacy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 413, H.R. 553.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 553) to require the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security to develop a strategy to prevent the over-\n     classification of homeland security and other information and \n     to promote the sharing of unclassified homeland security and \n     other information, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Over-Classification \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 Commission'') \n     concluded that there is a need to prevent over-classification \n     of information by the Federal Government.\n       (2) The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that the \n     over-classification of information interferes with accurate, \n     actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the \n     cost of information security, and needlessly limits public \n     access to information.\n       (3) Over-classification of information causes considerable \n     confusion about what information may be shared with whom, and \n     negatively affects the dissemination of information within\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\n     the Federal Government and with State, local, and tribal \n     entities, and the private sector.\n       (4) Excessive government secrecy stands in the way of a \n     safer and more secure homeland. Over-classification of \n     information is antithetical to the creation and operation of \n     the information sharing environment established under 1016 of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     (6 U.S.C. 485).\n       (5) Federal departments or agencies authorized to make \n     original classification decisions or that perform derivative \n     classification of information are responsible for developing, \n     implementing, and administering policies, procedures, and \n     programs that promote compliance with applicable laws, \n     executive orders, and other authorities pertaining to the \n     proper use of classification markings and the policies of the \n     National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2701, the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, received from the House and at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2701) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2010 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished Chair \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence in supporting the passage of \nH.R. 2701, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, \nwith a Senate substitute amendment. This substitute amendment is very \nsimilar to S. 3611, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent nearly \n2 months ago in an effort to encourage House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to \nallow consideration of an intelligence authorization bill.\n  It is often said that the third time is the charm. I certainly hope \nso. Last summer, we passed our intelligence authorization bill through \nthe Senate in time for the Intelligence Committee to impact fiscal year \nspending. Unfortunately, our bill got held up in the House for \npolitical reasons. So, in August of this year, we tried again. Still, \nour bill was held up. Now, here we are, on the eve of a new fiscal \nyear, and it looks like we finally have a compromise that will allow \nCongress to pass an intelligence authorization bill once again.\n  Why does passing an authorization bill matter at this late date in \nthe fiscal year? This bill does more than just authorize funding for \nintelligence activities--a vital purpose in and of itself. By providing \ncurrent congressional guidance and statutory authorities, we can ensure \nthat the intelligence community has the maximum flexibility and \ncapability it needs to function effectively, spend taxpayer funds \nwisely, and keep our Nation safe.\n  The intelligence authorization bill before us is a good bill. It will \ngive the intelligence community much-needed flexibility and authority \nand will ensure appropriate intelligence oversight by this committee.\n  Two months ago, the Senate confirmed a new Director of National \nIntelligence. I have often said that in creating the DNI, we gave him \nan awful lot of responsibility without all the authority he needed. \nWell, our bill attempts to address that problem by giving the DNI \nclearer authority and greater flexibility in overseeing the \nintelligence community. As Director Clapper takes on his new \nassignment, I expect these provisions will play a big part in helping \nhim lead the intelligence community--and ensuring the rest of the \nintelligence community recognizes his role, too.\n  There are also a number of provisions in this bill that I believe are \nessential for promoting good government and smarter spending. Too \noften, we have seen programs or acquisitions of major systems balloon \nin cost and decrease in performance. That is unacceptable. We are in \ndifficult economic times and the taxpayers are spending substantial \nsums of their hard-earned money to ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity has the tools it needs to keep us safe. If we do not demand \naccountability for how these tools are operated or created, we are \nfailing the intelligence community and, ultimately, we are failing the \nAmerican people.\n  So, for the past several years, I have sponsored amendments that \nrequire the intelligence community to perform vulnerability assessments \nof major systems and to keep track of excessive cost growth of major \nsystems. This latter provision is modeled on the Nunn-McCurdy provision \nwhich has guided Defense Department acquisitions for years. I am happy \nto say that these provisions are part of this bill. I believe that \nthese, and other good-government provisions, will encourage earlier \nidentification and solving of problems relating to the acquisition of \nmajor systems. Too often, such problems are not identified until \nexorbitant sums of money have been spent--and, unfortunately, at that \npoint, bureaucratic inertia takes over and there is often reluctance to \ncancel the project.\n  Similarly, the intelligence community must get a handle on its \npersonnel levels. In these tough economic times, it is more important \nthan ever to make sure that the intelligence community is appropriately \nresourced so it can effectively perform its national security missions.\n  This is not, however, an open invitation for more contractors. Far \ntoo many times, contractors are used by the intelligence community to \nperform functions better left to government employees. There are some \njobs that demand the use of contractors--for example, certain technical \njobs or short-term functions--but the easy, quick fix has been to just \nhire contractors, not long-term support. And so, our bill includes a \nprovision calling for annual personnel level assessments for the \nintelligence community. These assessments will ensure that, before more \npeople are brought in, there are adequate resources to support them and \nenough work to keep them busy.\n  These are just a few of the provisions in this bill that I believe \nare important for the success of our intelligence collection efforts \nand equally important for ensuring sound oversight by the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Now, the substitute amendment does not change any of these \nprovisions. It does make some minor technical changes, and because the \nfiscal year will be over before the bill becomes law, some of the \nauthorizing provisions have been removed.\n  The most significant changes in the substitute reflect the compromise \nreached by Speaker Pelosi with the Senate and the administration on the \nissues of congressional notification and the relationship between the \nintelligence community and the Government Accountability Office.\n  This new version of the congressional notification provision revives \nlanguage similar to the first fiscal year 2010 intelligence \nauthorization bill that passed the Senate by unanimous consent last \nyear. This language provides that the executive branch will be required \nto provide a ``general description'' to all of the members of the \ncongressional intelligence committees regarding a covert action finding \nor congressional notification that has been limited to the ``Gang of \nEight.'' This provision is limited to a description that is consistent \nwith the reasons for not yet fully informing all the members of the \nintelligence committees, so the provision is somewhat weaker than our \noriginal language.\n  Another change to the congressional notification provision is the \ninsertion of a requirement that the decision to limit access to ``Gang \nof Eight'' findings and notifications be reviewed within the executive \nbranch every 180 days. If the President determines that such \nlimitations are no longer necessary, then all the members of the \ncongressional intelligence committees will be provided access to such \nfindings and notifications.\n  These limitations are often revisited periodically by the executive \nbranch, so this time period should not cause difficulty for the \nadministration. We have seen in the past the benefits that come from \nbringing the full committees into the loop as soon as possible. \nMoreover, operational sensitivities can change over time. By requiring \na periodic review, this provision ensures that highly sensitive matters \nwill remain protected as long as necessary, while also promoting a full \ncooperative relationship between the two branches.\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\n  The substitute amendment contains only one real new provision, \nsection 348, which requires the DNI to issue a written directive \ngoverning GAO access to information in the possession of the \nintelligence community. This provision does not change the underlying \nlaw with respect to GAO access to intelligence information, but will \nallow Congress to study this issue more closely in the future.\n  It is well past time that Congress sent an intelligence authorization \nbill to the President for his signature. Only by fulfilling our \nlegislative function will we get back on track with performing \neffective and much-needed intelligence oversight.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership in shepherding this \nbill through the committee and the Senate. I appreciate her willingness \nto work through the countless issues raised throughout this process. I \nalso thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.\n  This 2010 intelligence authorization bill has the full support of the \nSenate. Senior administration officials have said they will recommend \nthat the President sign this compromise text into law. I urge the House \nof Representatives to pass this bill as soon as possible so that we can \nget back on track with our intelligence oversight.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent the Feinstein-Bond substitute \namendment which is at the desk be considered and agreed to, the bill as \namended be read a third time, that after the reading of the Conrad pay-\ngo letter into the Record the Senate bill be passed, as amended, that \nany statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Theodore ``Ted'' Fulton Stevens, who began serving in \n     the Senate 9 years after Alaska was admitted to Statehood, \n     represented the people of the State of Alaska with \n     distinction in the Senate for over 40 years from 1968 to 2009 \n     and played a significant role in the transformation of the \n     State\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\n     of Alaska from an impoverished territory to a full-fledged \n     State through the assistance he provided in building energy \n     facilities, hospitals and clinics, roads, docks, airports, \n     water and sewer facilities, schools, and other community \n     facilities in the State of Alaska, which earned him \n     recognition as ``Alaskan of the Century'' from the Alaska \n     Legislature in 2000;\n       (2) Ted Stevens distinguished himself as a transport pilot \n     during World War II in support of the ``Flying Tigers'' of \n     the United States Army Air Corps, 14th Air Force, earning 2 \n     Distinguished Flying Crosses and other decorations for his \n     skill and bravery;\n       (3) Ted Stevens, after serving as a United States Attorney \n     in the territory of Alaska, came to Washington, District of \n     Columbia in 1956 to serve in the Eisenhower Administration in \n     the Department of the Interior, where he was a leading force \n     in securing the legislation that led to the admission of \n     Alaska as the 49th State on January 3, 1959, and then as \n     Solicitor of the Department of the Interior;\n       (4) in 1961, Ted Stevens returned to the State of Alaska \n     and, in 1964, was elected to the Alaska House of \n     Representatives, where he was subsequently elected as Speaker \n     pro tempore and majority leader until his appointment on \n     December 24, 1968, to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused \n     by the death of Senator E.L. Bartlett;\n       (5) Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican Senator in \n     the history of the Senate, served as President pro tempore of \n     the Senate from 2003 through 2007 and as President pro \n     tempore emeritus from 2008 to 2009, and over the course of \n     his career in the Senate, Ted Stevens served as assistant \n     Republican leader, Chairman of the Select Committee on \n     Ethics, Chairman of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, Chairman of the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and \n     Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation;\n       (6) Ted Stevens worked tirelessly for the enactment of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), \n     which provided for the conveyance of approximately 44,000,000 \n     acres of land in the State of Alaska to the Aleut, Eskimo, \n     and Indian peoples and created Native Corporations to secure \n     the long-term economic, cultural, and political empowerment \n     of the Native peoples of the State of Alaska;\n       (7) Ted Stevens was a leader in shaping the communications \n     policies of the United States, as he helped to establish the \n     spectrum auction policy, negotiated the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996, authored the Digital Television Transition and \n     Public Safety Act of 2005 (47 U.S.C. 309 note; Public Law \n     109-171), and passionately advocated for the connection of \n     rural America to the rest of the world and to improve the \n     lives of the people of the United States through the use of \n     telemedicine and distance learning;\n       (8) Ted Stevens was a conservationist who championed the \n     safe development of the natural resources of the United \n     States, as illustrated by his authorship of the Trans-Alaska \n     Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.), the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), which established the 200-mile \n     exclusive economic zone and led to a reduction in the \n     dominance of foreign fishing fleets in the fisheries of the \n     United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-479; \n     120 Stat. 3575), which established conservation measures \n     designed to end overfishing, and the High Seas Driftnet \n     Fisheries Enforcement Act (16 U.S.C. 1826a et seq.), which \n     provided for the denial of entry into ports of the United \n     States and the imposition of sanctions on vessels carrying \n     out large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive \n     economic zone of any nation;\n       (9) Ted Stevens was committed to health and fitness in his \n     personal life and in his legislative accomplishments, as \n     illustrated by his authorship of the Ted Stevens Amateur and \n     Olympic Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et seq.), his \n     encouragement of providing equality to female athletes \n     through the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments \n     of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), and his leadership in \n     improving physical education programs in schools through the \n     Carol M.

Res. 618\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of their workplaces are key \n     predictors of workers' job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to employers and of employers' ability to \n     retain workers;\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the 2008 National Study of Employers \n     by the Families and Work Institute, employees in more \n     flexible and supportive workplaces are more effective \n     employees, are more highly engaged and less likely to look \n     for a new job in the next year, and enjoy better overall \n     health, better mental health, and lower levels of stress than \n     employees in workplaces that provide less flexibility and \n     support;\n       Whereas, according to a 2004 report of the Families and \n     Work Institute entitled ``Overwork in America'', employees \n     who are able to effectively balance family and work \n     responsibilities are less likely to report making mistakes or \n     feel resentment toward employers and coworkers;\n       Whereas, according to the ``Best Places to Work in the \n     Federal Government'' rankings released by the Partnership for \n     Public Service and American University's Institute for the \n     Study of Public Policy Implementation, work-life balance and \n     a family-friendly culture are among the key drivers of \n     engagement and satisfaction for employees in the Federal \n     workforce;\n       Whereas, according to a 2009 survey of college students by \n     the Partnership for Public Service and Universum USA entitled \n     ``Great Expectations! What Students Want in an Employer and \n     How Federal Agencies Can Deliver It'', attaining a healthy \n     work-life balance was an important career goal of 66 percent \n     of the students surveyed;\n       Whereas a 2008 study by the Partnership for Public Service \n     entitled ``A Golden Opportunity: Recruiting Baby Boomers into \n     Government'' revealed that workers between the ages of 50 and \n     65 are a strong source of experienced talent for the Federal \n     workforce and that nearly 50 percent of workers in that age \n     group find flexible work schedules ``extremely appealing'';\n       Whereas finding a good work-life balance is important to \n     workers in multiple generations;\n       Whereas employees who are able to effectively balance \n     family and work responsibilities tend to feel healthier and \n     more successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends;\n       Whereas 85 percent of wage and salaried workers in the \n     United States have immediate, day-to-day family \n     responsibilities outside of their jobs;\n       Whereas, in 2000, research by the Radcliffe Public Policy \n     Center revealed that men in their 20s and 30s and women in \n     their 20s, 30s, and 40s identified a work schedule that \n     allows them to spend time with their families as the most \n     important job characteristic for them;\n       Whereas, according to the 2006 American Community Survey by \n     the United States Census Bureau, 47 percent of wage and \n     salaried workers in the United States are parents with \n     children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in their children's lives and research demonstrates \n     that parental involvement is associated with children's \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates;\n       Whereas the 2000 Urban Working Families study demonstrated \n     that a lack of job flexibility for working parents negatively \n     affects children's health in ways that range from children \n     being unable to make needed doctors' appointments to children \n     receiving inadequate early care, leading to more severe and \n     prolonged illness;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to the beginning of 2008, 1,700,000 \n     active duty troops served in Iraq and 600,000 members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve (133,000 on more than one tour) \n     were called up to serve in Iraq;\n       Whereas, because so many of those troops and National Guard \n     and Reserve members have families, there needs to be a focus \n     on policies and programs that can help military families \n     adjust to the realities that come with having a family member \n     in the military;\n       Whereas research by the Sloan Center for Aging and Work \n     reveals that the majority of workers aged 53 and older \n     attribute their success as an employee by a great or moderate \n     extent to having access to flexibility in their jobs and that \n     the majority of those workers also report that, to a great \n     extent, flexibility options contribute to an overall higher \n     quality of life;\n       Whereas studies show that \\1/3\\ of children and adolescents \n     in the United States are obese or overweight, and healthy \n     lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical \n     activity, can lower the risk of becoming obese and developing \n     related diseases;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence children's health and \n     development and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally;\n       Whereas unpaid family caregivers will likely continue to be \n     the largest source of long-term care services in the United \n     States for the elderly;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services \n     anticipates that by 2050 the number of such caregivers will \n     reach 37,000,000, an increase of 85 percent from 2000, as \n     baby boomers reach retirement age in record numbers; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as ``National Work and Family Month'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2010 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and to healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7563-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7563-S7564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Res. 649\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and \n     the cost of retirement is increasing significantly;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement and that the actual amount of retirement savings \n     of workers lags far behind the amount that will be needed to \n     adequately fund their retirement years;\n       Whereas financial literacy is an important factor in United \n     States workers' understanding of the true need to save for \n     retirement;\n       Whereas saving for one's retirement is a key component to \n     overall financial health and security during retirement \n     years, and the importance of financial literacy in planning \n     one's retirement must be advocated;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options for \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for their own retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them, through \n     their employers, access to defined benefit and defined \n     contribution plans to assist them in preparing for \n     retirement, yet many of those employees may not be taking \n     advantage of those plans at all or to the full extent allowed \n     by those plans as prescribed by Federal law;\n       Whereas the need to save for retirement is important, even \n     during economic downturns or market declines, making \n     continued contributions all the more important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to develop personal budgets and financial plans that \n     include retirement savings strategies and to take advantage \n     of the availability of tax-preferred savings vehicles to \n     assist them in saving for retirement; and\n       Whereas October 17 through October 23, 2010, has been \n     designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Save for \n     Retirement Week'', including raising public awareness of the \n     various tax-preferred retirement vehicles as important tools \n     for personal savings and retirement financial security;\n       (2) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     availability of a variety of ways to save for retirement \n     which are favored under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \n     are utilized by many Americans, but which should be utilized \n     by more;\n       (3) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and the \n     continued existence of tax preferred employer-sponsored \n     retirement savings vehicles; and\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\n       (4) calls on the States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities, \n     with the goal of increasing retirement savings for all the \n     people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "27", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/27/senate-section/article/S7564-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
