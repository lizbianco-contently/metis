Madam President, both parties claim they are friends of \nsmall business. This bill gives Members of both parties the opportunity \nto prove it. This is not just talk. Listen to what this bill has in it.\n  This bill is called the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. There is a \nsmall business access to credit provision. SBA estimates the loan limit \nadjustments will increase lending to small business by $5 billion \nwithin the first year of its enactment. This is a bipartisan provision: \nLandrieu-Snowe.\n  Small business trade and export promotion: It is believed this will \nsave and create as many as 50,000 jobs this year.\n  Small business contracting: Increasing contracts to small business by \n1 percent could create more than 100,000 jobs. This is bipartisan: \nSnowe-Merkley, Landrieu-Snowe, Landrieu-Crapo-Risch.\n  Small business management and counseling will create or save more \nthan 10,000 jobs in 2011. It is bipartisan: Snowe-Landrieu.\n  Small business disaster loan improvements: This is also supported by \nLandrieu and Nelson of Nebraska. This is not bipartisan, but everyone \nknows these two Senators work on a bipartisan basis on virtually \neverything they do.\n  Small business regulatory relief: This is bipartisan: Snowe-Pryor.\n  Exclusion of capital gains tax: This allows investors in small \nbusinesses to take a 100-percent exclusion from capital gains tax on \nsmall business investments made this year. It is bipartisan: Kerry-\nSnowe-Menendez.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  Increased deductions for startups: Temporary increase in maximum \ndeduction for business startup in 2010-11. This would increase the \nlimits to $10,000. It is bipartisan: Merkley-Alexander.\n  Extension of section 179: Extends small business expensing. This is \nsupported by Senator Snowe; it is her provision. It extends section 179 \nexpensing provisions.\n  Tax equity for self-employed: Allows self-employed taxpayers to \ndeduct health care costs for payroll tax purposes on their 2010 tax \nreturns. Bipartisan: Bingaman-Hatch-Landrieu.\n  Extension of ARRA: That is the stimulus bill bonus depreciation. \nBipartisan: Baucus-Grassley-Brownback-Inhofe-Johanns-Menendez.\n  Small business penalty relief: Makes a penalty for failing to \ndisclose listed transactions proportionate to the tax savings. This is \nbipartisan: Baucus-Grassley-Crapo.\n  Remove cell phones from listed property: Delists cell phones and \nother telecommunications devices from the category of ``listed \nproperty'' for tax purposes. Bipartisan: Kerry-Ensign.\n  S corporation holding period: Reduces the asset holding period for \nconverted S corporation from 10 to 5 years: Snowe.\n  General business credits not subject to AMT limits: Allows small \nbusiness to use all types of general business tax credits to offset the \nAMT liability: Grassley.\n  Carryback up to 5 years: Allows sole proprietorships, partnerships \nand nonpublic trading corporations with less than $50 million in \naverage gross annual receipts for the prior 3 years to carry back \nunused credits for 5 years: Grassley.\n\n  Small business lending fund: Bipartisan: LeMieux-Landrieu. This is \nthe one that has created all the interest all over the country, a \nprogram level of $30 billion, which by conservative estimates would \nlead to $300 billion in small business lending. It is not related to \nTARP. There are no TARP-like restrictions.\n  Utilizing predictive modeling to fight health care fraud: That is \nbipartisan: LeMieux-Landrieu.\n  Export promotion: Klobuchar-LeMieux, LeMieux-Landrieu. Very well \naccepted in the business community.\n  We have agriculture disaster relief. Bipartisan: Lincoln-Chambliss.\n  State small business credit initiative, bipartisan--developed with \nthe support of 28 Republican Governors.\n  That is the bill. How could we have anything more bipartisan? That is \nwhy 80 different organizations support this legislation, including many \nGovernors. The majority of the Governors support this legislation. \nThose who don't are maybe not familiar with it. But there are so many \norganizations that support this legislation.\n  Naming just a few, there are some 80 of them: Marine Retailers \nAssociation, people who sell boats; National Restaurant Association; \nCommunity Bankers for a number of States; National Small Business \nAssociation; Small Business Majority, and 76 other organizations. This \nis about as fair as it can be.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have indicated they want to \noffer some amendments. We say go ahead and do that. They can't take yes \nfor an answer. I hope those Republicans who voted with the Landrieu-\nLeMieux amendment on Thursday would do so again on cloture. This is a \nbill that will help businesses all over America.\n  This bill is literally on the verge of final passage. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle have said the only thing standing between \nus and their support for final passage is giving them the opportunity \nto vote on their amendments. Here are the amendments they said they \nwanted: Grassley amendment on biodiesel; Hatch amendment on research \nand development; Johanns amendment on corporate reporting requirements. \nWe said: Fine, go ahead and offer those. We will have our alternatives \nto those, as we do here. That is how it works. I propounded a consent \nthat gave the Republicans votes on all three of these amendments along \nwith the Democratic alternative.\n  So I wish to close by expressing my appreciation--I think I can say \nthis without any reservation--the appreciation of the country, small \nbusinesses in America. We would not be where we are but for the work of \nSenator Landrieu and Senator LeMieux. Others have joined in. I had \nphone calls late last night with one of the most deliberate Senators. \nShe has impressed me for so long. I got a call from Senator Landrieu. \nAt her home was Senator Cantwell, who is a truly good legislator, and \nthe two of them worked late into the night trying to come up with \nsupport for this legislation. But it wasn't only last night. Senator \nLandrieu, as chairman of the Small Business Committee, has been \ntireless. I had a conversation with her today. I have been so proud of \nher work on the floor--great speeches that she has gotten people to \ngive in support of this legislation.\n  I can remember when she was a brandnew Senator and she was working on \na military issue, and the headline in a Louisiana newspaper had \n``Military Mary'' because she was fighting so hard for the troops. She \nhasn't stopped fighting for the beleaguered State of Louisiana, which \nhas had so many problems. But for her aggressive work on behalf of her \nState, that State would not be where it is today. It was doing so well \nwhen the oilspill came. But who has been out in front on the oilspill? \nMary Landrieu.\n  So I am proud of her being in the Senate. She has great lineage. I \nhave such fond feelings for her father who was a legend in his own \ntime, but that legend has been caught by his daughter, Mary Landrieu. \nSo Moon is very happy, I am sure, with her legislative skills, as he \nshould be, and as her mom is.\n  So anyway, thank you very much. I see my friend, the chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, is here. I would ask that the Record be \npretty clear that there be an hour from now until the cloture vote. So \nI ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6460-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate prior to the cloture vote on amendment No. \n4519, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each, with the final 10 minutes reserved for the two leaders \nor their designees, with the majority controlling the final 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Leader \nReid for his very kind comments regarding the work that is going into \nthis bill. It has been my pleasure and honor to help lead a team, \nactually, which the Presiding Officer has been a part of, as well as \nMs. Cantwell, the Senator from Washington; Senator Murray;\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nSenator LeMieux from Florida; and many others. Senator Cardin, who I \nknow is on the floor, is an outstanding member of the Small Business \nCommittee and a long-time advocate of small business, serving many \nyears in the House of Representatives, and now brings his expertise to \nthe floor of the Senate. I like having bulldogs on my committee and he \nis one of them and I greatly appreciate his support.\n  Let me be very clear that in 1 hour, we will come to the end of a \nvery long, important public and open debate on the best way we can help \nMain Street.\n  This bill is not about Wall Street. We have had enough of those. This \nbill is not about big corporations; they take up 80 percent of the \nagenda in this place on any given day. This bill is about the 27 \nmillion small businesses that need the Members of the Senate to stand \nup for them today. If we can stand up for small businesses today, they \nwill stand up for us and lift this country out of the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. I want to repeat that. It will not be the \nbig banks that do this. It will not be the big international firms that \ndo this. As it always has been since the beginning of America, since \nthe first small business, the first enterprise, it will be small \nbusinesses that create jobs.\n  For 1\\1/2\\ years, this debate has been going on--not 1\\1/2\\ weeks, \nnot last month, but for 1\\1/2\\ years we have been debating, as we \nshould as Senators, about the best way to do that. There have been \ndifferences of opinion. There have been two primary committees focused \non building this package, including the Finance Committee, which has \nput forward in a completely bipartisan fashion a $12 billion tax cut \npackage for small business. The leader just spoke about some of those \nprovisions this morning. The chairman of that committee, Max Baucus, \nhas been to the floor on several occasions to explain the \nextraordinarily significant tax cuts I will mention. I will mention \nonly one.\n  For a decade, Members on both sides of the aisle have been trying to \nget the self-employed in America to have parity with other businesses \nwhen it comes to health care. Madam President, the Chair knows that her \nState of New York is full of self-employed people. Do they get the same \ntax break as General Electric? No. Do they get the same tax break as \nGeneral Motors? No. These individuals who are self-employed pay more \nfor their health care than big corporations. Is that right? No. We \ntried to help them in the health care bill, and we could not. We didn't \ngive up the fight. They are in this bill--a $2 billion tax cut for the \nself-employed. That is just one of the good tax provisions.\n  Senator Reid read off the list, and I will share it with you because \nI know there are going to be critics coming to the floor, and \nunfortunately some people will vote against cloture. I hope most people \nare smart enough not to. If some of them do, I want them to know we \nhave widely distributed this red line document to every news outlet in \nthe country. We have distributed it to many, many organizations. There \nare over 70 organizations supporting this. This is what we call our red \nline document. So there is no confusion, the most wonderful thing about \nthis document is that it is just four pages. It is very easy to read. \nThere are not 40 pages. It is not 4,000 pages. There are no special \ndeals. It is all here, and it is all bipartisan.\n  I am going to read some of the names associated with the bill: Kerry-\nSnowe-Menendez; Snowe; Merkley-Alexander; Snowe; Bingaman-Hatch-\nLandrieu; Grassley; Baucus-Grassley-Brownback-Inhofe-Johanns-Menendez; \nBaucus-Grassley-Crapo; Kerry-Ensign and 72 bipartisan cosponsors \nequally divided between Democrats and Republicans; Snowe; Grassley; \nGrassley.\n  If somebody comes to the floor and says this bill doesn't have \nbipartisan support, they might want to answer why their names are here: \nLandrieu-Snowe; Snowe; Snowe-Landrieu; Snowe-Merkley; Landrieu-Snowe; \nLandrieu-Crapo-Risch; Snowe; Landrieu-Nelson; Snowe-Pryor; Snowe.\n  I don't know how many more items a Senator can have in a bill. \nSenator Snowe wrote lots of pieces of this bill. LeMieux-Landrieu; \nLeMieux; LeMieux-Landrieu; Klobuchar-LeMieux; LeMieux-Landrieu; \nCantwell-Boxer-Murray. That lists just a few.\n  So we bring a bipartisan bill to the floor, and then we have a 12-\nhour debate on one amendment, the first amendment, which is a \nRepublican amendment by Senator LeMieux and myself--it is LeMieux-\nLandrieu-Nelson. Both Senators from Florida have been extraordinary in \ntheir advocacy for this. We had a public, open vote, and we got 60 \nvotes. So now the small business lending provision is in this bill, \nwhich makes it even better, even greater, and equally bipartisan. If \nsome people aren't happy with that--I don't write the rules of the \nSenate. I showed up, and that is what the rules were. If you got 60 \nvotes, you got your amendment on the bill.\n  There are other Members who are coming to speak. I want to just say \nthis has been a very vital debate. This is the time for us to say yes \nto Main Street. There are literally millions of business owners who not \nonly want this package to pass, they need it to pass. If it passes now, \nthey might be able to hold on. They might be able to create the jobs \nthat are necessary. It is now our chance to deliver a bipartisan bill \nthat will help 27 million small businesses on Main Street.\n  In conclusion, we have spent a lot of time helping big auto \nmanufacturers from Detroit. Today, we can help that repair shop in our \nneighborhood. This is about corner stores. This is about small banks. \nAre we going to vote for them or are we going to leave them high and \ndry?\n  I see the chairman from the Finance Committee, who I think is \nscheduled to speak. I also see the Senator from Maryland. I will soon \nyield to the Senator from Maryland, a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, to say a word, and then we have the time under our control. \nI am sorry, the Senator from Washington is here. I didn't see the \nSenator. I was blocked. I apologize. I see the Senator from Washington \nand the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I believe I was next.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thought we had the first half hour and the Senator's \nside had the second, but I understand now that it is back and forth.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to express my frustration and \ndisappointment with the decision of the majority leader yesterday that \nseems to have effectively precluded Republicans from offering \namendments to the small business lending bill that is before us today.\n  Let's understand one thing. Since the health care bill, we have not \nmarked up one bill in the Finance Committee. That is just not right. \nThese bills have been brought to the floor through a rule XIV \nparliamentary procedure without the impetus and agreement of all of us \nwho are on the Finance Committee. I am not going to blame anybody for \nthat other than to say I don't think that is the proper way to do \nthings. Then we get here on the Senate floor and the majority leader \nfills up the amendment tree so that neither Republicans nor Democrats \nhave a chance to amend this bill.\n  Having said that, let me say that the majority leader has put forward \nthis small business lending bill in an ostensible effort to help the \neconomy create more jobs. Of course, this is what every Senator on both \nsides of the aisle wants to see happen. This is what every American \nwants to see happen. Yet once again we are faced with an ``it is my way \nor the highway'' attitude in dealing with this legislation.\n  Let me be clear. The small business lending bill before us includes \nmany positive provisions. I commend those who have put them in there. \nIt has a number of tax provisions that I fully support and that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike believe would be helpful to small \nbusiness growth.\n  Yet, I do not believe that any Member in this Chamber truly believes \nthat this bill would do enough to solve our job creation problem. This \nis because it ignores the main problems that are afflicting the economy \nand preventing the kind of job creation that we need right now.\n  This is exactly why Republicans want to improve this bill. Many parts\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nof the bill are fine as far as they go. But, again, they do not go \nnearly far enough.\n  One of the amendments the Republican leader was trying to get \npermission to offer to this bill is a motion I would like to make to \ncommit this bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to report \nit back to the Senate with an amendment to address the biggest problem \nfacing small businesses at this time. And that problem is the threat of \nthe largest tax increase in history that is due to hit this country \nlike a monster tsunami in just 155 days.\n  In just over 5 months from now, on January 1, a good share of \nAmerica's most prolific potential job creators--small businesses that \ngenerally employ between 20 and 500 workers--are going to face large \ntax increases unless Congress acts to stop them. The problem is that \nPresident Obama and many of his allies in Congress have already made it \nclear that they have no intention of stopping these increases.\n  The President called on the Senate yesterday to pass this legislation \nto help small businesses so they can create jobs. But, ironically, he \nand his supporters just cannot seem to see that their support for \nallowing these massive tax increases to hit these fastest growing small \nbusinesses will do far more harm than the good that could come from \nthis bill as it now stands.\n  The bill before us, while well intentioned, misses the boat.\n  The real problem that this bill does not address is that the threat \nof these tax increases, combined with the other business unfriendly \nchanges this Congress has recently passed, have created such an \natmosphere of uncertainty in this country, that no one wants to take \nthe jump and risk their capital on new business ventures or expansions. \nThese other changes include the recently enacted financial regulation \nbill, the tragically misguided health care bill from earlier this year, \nand the menace of a monstrous climate bill that still hangs over our \nheads.\n  Let us briefly review what it takes to create a private sector job in \nour economy. First, we need an entrepreneur--a risk taker. Second, we \nneed an idea. Third, we need some capital. Finally, we need some \ncertainty so that the risk the entrepreneur is facing is manageable.\n  We have plenty of entrepreneurs in our economy. America has always \nhad these, and they are a big part of what has made this country great. \nWe also have lots of good ideas for new businesses. This is another \narea in which our Nation has never lacked.\n  We also have lots of capital in our economy. Studies indicate that \nbanks are flush with money and corporations have more cash on their \nbalance sheets that at any time in the past 50 years. Investors have \nmoney too and are just waiting for the last ingredient.\n  And that last ingredient is what is missing. A degree of certainty \nthat the business climate will begin to improve, or at least not get \nany worse. This means stable tax rates, a manageable level of \nregulation, and customers who are not worried about the future.\n  But if we have a situation, as we have now, where the investors and \nentrepreneurs cannot see any real stability, risk taking freezes up. \nEveryone decides to stand on the sidelines and wait it out and see how \nthings look in a few months, or next year.\n  The result of this inaction is that the new expansion to the \nmanufacturing plant is put on hold, the bank loan is not extended, and \nthe new equipment is not ordered. The result, of course, is that the \nnew job is not created, and everyone stands and waits.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle and in the \nadministration seem to be puzzled as to why the economy has not yet \nstarted to create the jobs we so desperately need. After all, the huge \nstimulus bill that they pushed through last year was supposed to solve \nthese problems.\n  A very big part of the reason for this lack of jobs is this terrible \nuncertainty, which has a corrosive effect on the economy. We need to \nadd the lubricating oil of lower taxes, fewer regulations, and \ncertainty to the engine of economic growth.\n  Instead, we have been adding the acid of uncertainty to the engine--\nuncertainty about higher taxes, uncertainty about a worse regulatory \nclimate, and uncertainty of what might come next. It is small wonder \nthat the engine is not working as it should.\n  What little certainty that might have existed in the recent past has \nsurely been evaporating because of the President's broken pledge to not \nraise taxes on those making less than $200,000 per year and the \nDemocratic leadership's obvious willingness to allow these huge tax \nincreases to go into effect for millions of Americans.\n  This attitude is often excused by the misguided belief that the \n``rich'' are not paying their fair share of taxes and need to \ncontribute much more to the Treasury.\n  Many of our colleagues forget that a high percentage of new and small \nbusinesses, where most of the new jobs are created in a recession, pay \ntheir taxes as individuals. This means that attempts to make the so-\ncalled rich pay more will backfire and harm the very people our liberal \ncolleagues are trying to help--those who desperately need employment.\n\n  This is not so much a question of fairness as it is of economic \nreality. If we raise the top rates on individuals, we raise tax rates \non small and growing businesses and stifle them from fulfilling their \njob-creation potential.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, tax increases on those \nmaking more than the limits the President has pledged to protect will \nattack one-half of all small business income. Owners of these small \nbusinesses, as well as those who want to invest and start new \nenterprises, are frozen on the sidelines. They are not going to take \nthe risk as long as these tax increases are hovering on the horizon. As \nlong as they do not act, they will not create those jobs.\n  Let us look at the calendar. We simply do not have the time to pass \nsmall Band-Aid bills when the patient--our underperforming economy--\nneeds a blood transfusion. We need to address the real problems facing \nour economy, not play around at the edges. Our first job should be to \nreduce the uncertainty that is throwing sand into the cylinders of the \njob creation engine of small businesses, and the first step of this is \nto remove the threat of these huge tax hikes.\n  Let us assure investors, entrepreneurs, lenders, and other players in \nthe job creation machine that we will not raise taxes in 5 months. Let \nus dispel these clouds of uncertainty and let the private sector do \nwhat it does best--innovate and create and put America to work.\n  Having said all that, it is important for me to add to this \ndiscussion a few other points.\n  Dr. Christina Romer, Chair of the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, in last month's issue of the ``American Economic Review'' \nsaid this:\n\n       . . . tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, \n     and highly negative impact on output.\n       . . . [T]he more intuitive way to express this result is \n     that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output \n     effects.\n\n  Senator Kent Conrad, our great Budget Committee chairman--and he is \nalso on the Finance Committee--had this to say:\n\n       As a general rule, you don't want to be cutting spending or \n     raising taxes in the midst of a downturn.\n\n  That was in the Wall Street Journal on the 23rd of this month.\n  He also said:\n\n       In a perfect world, I would not be cutting spending or \n     raising taxes for the next 18 months to 2 years. This \n     downturn is still very much with us, unfortunately.\n\n  He said that on CNN on the 26th of this month.\n  Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska ``supports extending the expiring \ntax cuts at least until the economy is clearly recovering and supports \naddressing them before the fall elections.''\n  Senator Evan Bayh had this to say:\n\n       And so raising taxes right now--\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 \nmore minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object unless--it is off his time. Fine. I do not \nobject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Evan Bayh said:\n\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\n\n       And so raising taxes right now would be the wrong thing to \n     do because it would dampen consumer demand and lessen \n     business investment.\n  `` `We're not creating jobs, and raising taxes now would not be a \ngreat idea,' Rep. Michael McMahon, a New York Democrat, said this \nweek.''\n  This is a quote from the Wall Street Journal on July 21:\n\n       Martin Vaughan and John McKinnon: ``Bush Tax Cuts Split \n     Democrats.''\n\n  ``Rep. Bobby Bright, a Democrat facing a tough reelection race in \nAlabama, said tax increases, even if limited to the wealthiest \nfamilies, could imperil the recovery.''\n  This is a quote from The Hill newspaper on July 22:\n\n       Alexander Bolton: ``Democrats may stop Bush-era tax cuts \n     for wealthy from expiring.''\n\n  `` `I think the recovery is sufficiently fragile that we ought to \nleave tax rates where they are,' said Rep. Gerry Connolly, a freshman \nDemocrat from Virginia. Connolly said Democrats should not allow the \n2001 Bush tax cuts to expire for anybody.''\n  Again, a quote from The Hill newspaper on July 22:\n\n       Alexander Bolton: ``Democrats may stop Bush-era tax cuts \n     for wealthy from expiring.''\n\n  The leader of the Federal Reserve, Dr. Ben Bernanke, said: ``In the \nshort term I would believe that we ought to maintain a reasonable \ndegree of fiscal support, stimulus for the economy . . . There are many \nways to do that. This is one way.''\n  I do not blame the distinguished chairman of the committee because we \nhave not marked up these bills. I blame the leadership here for not \nrealizing that is why we have a Finance Committee, to mark up these \nbills and let both sides have a chance to make them better if they can.\n  We all have an interest in spurring small businesses and getting the \neconomy going. Bringing these important bills right to the floor and \nbypassing the Finance Committee, and then doing what has been done on \nevery bill since the health care bill and even before--locking up the \nparliamentary tree so we cannot have a reasonable shot at even putting \nup some amendments--is not the way to do business. It is not what \ncreates the bipartisanship we need right now in our Senate.\n  I wanted to make that point and hope we can change our ways so the \nSenate will be what it ought to be--the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana for granting me additional time. I \nappreciate him as leader of the Finance Committee. I enjoy working with \nhim, and I enjoy working with my colleagues on the other side. But my \ngosh, let's stop this business of locking up the tree on everything and \nnot debating the way we should, not giving people half a reasonable \nshot of bringing up their amendments, and, above all, let's start \nmarking up these very important bills in the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I know other Senators have risen before \nme, so I will be very brief. I will take a minute. The Senator from \nWashington is next. I thank her for her indulgence in letting me take 1 \nminute.\n  This is very clear: The American people want us in Congress to do \ntheir work. They want us to do something that is reasonable and makes \nsense. Most Americans are not way off on the left side, and they are \nnot way off on the right side. They are basically in the middle and do \na good job.\n  Most Americans would want us to help small businesses in a good way, \nin a solid way--maybe not in the exact way each American would want but \nin a good, solid way. This bill clearly does that. It does what the \nAmerican people want.\n  Small businesses generate jobs. They are the small engine of growth. \nWe need to help small businesses. This bill does that. It cuts taxes \nfor small businesses. It gives lending authority for small businesses. \nThere are many other provisions I do not have time to explain that help \nsmall businesses.\n  This is not some small Band-Aid bill. This is a bill that makes sense \nfor small businesses. It provides certainty to small businesses. It \nhelps them. We cannot solve all the world's problems in one bill, but \nwe can certainly help small businesses in this bill.\n  I can say--and I am pleading, frankly, with a few Republican Senators \nwho have not quite decided how they are going to vote on this cloture \nvote--this is a good bill, a solid bill, a start in the right \ndirection. Let's pass it. Let's not get hung up on who said what to \nwhom, caught up on debating points, and come across like kids in a \nsandbox. Let's pass this bill. It is a good bill. It is good for \nAmerica.\n  We can deal with other issues, such as the expiring tax cuts, another \ntime in the future. But right now this is small business. It is solid. \nIt is getting done. It is going to help people. That is what people \nwant us to do. They want us to do the right job. I urge us to pass this \nbill.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my good friend from Washington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, on Tuesday, I came to the floor to \nvoice my support for this bill by telling the stories of small business \nowners in every corner of my State who have struggled so hard to get \ncredit since this recession began.\n  I talked about people who were driven by their passions, who want to \ngrow their businesses, who want to hire, but who have been stymied by \nthe lack of credit flowing from our banks.\n  I talked about the drivers of our economy and job creation. But if \nsmall businesses are the driver of our economic recovery, then our \ncommunity banks are the engine. Right now we all know that engine is in \nneutral. That is because for far too long, our community banks have \nbeen ignored in our economic recovery.\n  Since this recession began, we have seen banks fail one after \nanother, lending dry up to our small businesses, and job growth suffer. \nWhile Wall Street institutions, such as AIG and Goldman Sachs, were \ndeemed ``too big to fail,'' the collapse of our community banks has \napparently been ``too small to notice.''\n  Last year, I introduced the Main Street Lending Restoration Act which \nwould have directed $30 billion to help jump-start small business \nlending. That is why I have spoken with Secretary Geithner and \nPresident Obama about this directly and why I have been pushing so hard \nto make small business lending a priority.\n  I have felt very strongly that we have to focus more on our community \nbanks if we want to make progress and bring true recovery to our Main \nStreet businesses. It is why I am so proud to stand here today and \nsupport this bill. I thank Senator Landrieu and others for working with \nus in creating the Small Business Lending Fund and the State Small \nBusiness Credit Initiative.\n  This Small Business Lending Fund takes the most powerful idea from my \nMain Street Lending Restoration Act and sets aside $30 billion to help \nour local community banks--those that are under $10 billion in assets--\nto help them get the capital they need to begin lending to our small \nbusinesses again. It is going to reward the banks that are helping our \nsmall businesses grow by reducing the interest rates on capital that \nthey get under this program, and it will help our small support \nbusiness initiatives run by our States across the country that are \nstruggling because of local budget cutbacks. And, as Senator Landrieu \nhas told us, it will save taxpayers an estimated $1 billion.\n  It is a bill that should have broad support and, in fact, it does \nfrom small business groups of all stripes, community bankers, and so \nmany others across this country who have found common cause with this \nbill.\n  Once again we are finding ourselves faced with opposition from the \nother side. Once again a commonsense bill that will save taxpayers \nmoney is being held hostage by political calculation. I think an \neditorial in yesterday's Seattle Times on this bill summed up some of \nthe frustration in living rooms and communities across the country very \nwell on the obstruction we see every day.\n  The editorial first noted the importance of this bill we are \nconsidering by saying:\n\n       Economic recovery is all about jobs. And American \n     consumers, who help power the economy, are spending less in \n     the shadow of a shaky employment market. Small banks lending \n     to small businesses puts people to\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n     work. Access to credit is key. Helping Main Street rekindles \n     hiring, boosts consumer confidence in overall economic \n     conditions, and fuels the recovery.\n\n  That is how the editorial started. It went on to say this is ``part \nof a larger package of legislation for small business and Main Street \nAmerica that has attracted scant Republican interest or support.''\n  Then the editorial briefly, but very accurately, summarized what I \nthink so many in our country are thinking when they return home from \npounding the pavement, looking for work only to turn on their TV to see \nthat a bill such as this is blocked from consideration. It said:\n\n       Nothing should be more nonpartisan than putting people back \n     to work.\n\n  It is a line that speaks volumes in this Chamber because it is a line \nthat truly represents how so many of our constituents feel. This is a \nnonpartisan bill. This is a bill that puts credit back into the hands \nof our small business owners. It puts people back to work. And nothing \nshould be more nonpartisan than putting people back to work.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to listen to the voices of their \nconstituents and small business owners. Support this cloture motion. \nLet's get this sent to the President.\n  Quickly, I do want to say that I worked very hard to include funding \nin this bill to help save over 130,000 teacher jobs. Again that effort \nhas been blocked by Republican obstruction.\n  I remind all of us, every day we see more reports about the \ncontinuing wave of layoffs affecting our school districts. This is not \njust about school districts. It is about losing teachers, and it may be \nthe only teacher who touches a child in their classroom. It is about \nkids in every one of our States. We need to be sure we do not lose \nfocus of this issue.\n  I am going to continue to fight to ensure that our teachers return to \nthe classrooms and our kids have the best instructors in September.\n  Again I thank Senator Landrieu for her tremendous work on this bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 36 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Maryland has been on the floor for \nalmost an hour. May he have the next 3 minutes? I see the Senator from \nMaine who could then speak after him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nincredible leadership and work in regard to the Small Business Jobs and \nCredit Act of 2010. This is the work of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee and the Finance Committee.\n  As Senator Landrieu pointed out, it has been the work of Democrats \nand Republicans working together on many important provisions to help \nthe small business community. It truly is a bipartisan bill. It is a \ncritically important bill. I, quite frankly, do not understand why \nthere are those who want to oppose us getting this done.\n  It contains many provisions that have been brought to us by the small \nbusiness community that we need to get done. We all profess and \nunderstand that the growth engine of America is in small business. That \nis where new jobs are created. Sixty-four percent of the net nonfarm \nnew jobs are created by small businesses.\n  Innovation is the way for America to stay on the cutting edge. More \npatents and more copyrights are created through small businesses per \nemployee than a larger company.\n  This bill is about creating jobs for Americans who desperately need \nthem. This legislation combines many bills reported out of the Small \nBusiness Committee. I say congratulations to Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Snowe. These are bills that both of them worked on together \nthat are important for us to get done.\n  Let me just summarize some of the important bills that came out of \nour committee that are included.\n  We helped small businesses with international trade, leveraging $1 \nbillion of export capital. This alone will affect 40,000 to 50,000 \njobs. We deal with government contracting. We have had hearings--I had \na hearing in the State of Maryland on behalf of the Small Business \nCommittee--where small business companies pointed out how difficult it \nis for them to access the government procurement system. So our \ncommittee went to work.\n  Thank you, Senator Landrieu; thank you, Senator Snowe. We went to \nwork and reported out a bill that is incorporated that deals with the \nabuses of bundling. Bundling is when the agency puts together a lot of \nsmall contracts into a large contract where a small company can't \ncompete for it. We have taken action to correct that in this bill so \nthat small companies can access government procurement in an easier \nway.\n  We started to attack what is known as prime contract abuse, where \nprime contractors don't pay their small contractors on time or abuse \ntheir small contractors, which are more likely to be small businesses. \nThat is dealt with in this legislation.\n  We deal with gender equity by investing in the Women's Business \nCenter. As Senator Landrieu has pointed out, working with the Finance \nCommittee, we deal with tax equity. Business owners can deduct the cost \nof health care for their families in calculating the self-employment \ntax. This is a matter of fairness for small business owners to be \ntreated equally with larger companies; to be able to increase the \namount of startup costs that can be deducted from $5,000 to $10,000.\n  These are all important issues. If you are a small business owner \nstruggling to make payroll or to keep your doors open, this help could \nbe the difference between hiring another employee or not.\n  Lastly, Madam President, it deals with credit. It extends credit to \nsmall businesses. We all talk about that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. The credit provisions are critically important. We make \npermanent the SBA guarantee programs--90 percent guarantees, the cost \nreductions, the 7(a) limits from $2 million to $5 million, the 504 \nlimits from $1.5 million to $5.5 million, the microloans. We boost \nlending, by that alone, in the first year by $5 billion. Then, as our \nchairman has talked about, the State programs are funded as well as the \ncommunity bank programs.\n  I want to mention one additional point, if I might. I am disappointed \nthe surety bond extension is not in this bill. I will work with the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee and the Finance Committee to \nmake sure we find a way to include that in the American Recovery Act. \nWe increase that from $2 million to $5 million. It deals with small \nconstruction companies.\n  It is very important because for State and Federal contract projects \nover $100,000, you need to have a surety bond. If you are a small \nbusiness owner, what you need to pledge in order to get that surety \nbond can deny you credit in the market. We have to extend that to the \n$5 million that was included in the Recovery Act, and I feel confident, \nafter talking to the chairman, that we will find a way to get that \ndone.\n  The bottom line is this is a critically important, well-balanced bill \nthat will help small businesses. This is our opportunity to vote for \nit. In half an hour, we will have a chance to decide whose side we are \non. Are we on the side of small business owners, to help this economy \nrecover, or are we just going to continue this partisan division in the \nSenate? I hope my colleagues will vote on the side of small businesses.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, all I can think of, in listening to the \nSenator from Maryland, is if we could have limited this legislation \nbefore the Senate to the provisions we agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis--in fact, many of which passed unanimously in the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee--clearly, we would be in a far better position than \nwe are today. That is the regrettable dimension to the situation we are \nfacing procedurally in the Senate.\n  I know from the majority side there is not an inclination to \naccommodate\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nthe rights of the minority, but that is the tradition in the Senate. \nThe majority rules, but you accommodate the rights of the minority. \nThat is the essence of what the institution of the Senate is all about.\n  I regret we are where we are today in the Senate on this issue that I \nhave been championing since January of this year. It seems to me we are \nall worried about the legislative train running out of the station. If \nwe are all concerned about the limited time we have available to \naddress the issues of small business and job creation, which are the \nforemost issues in the United States of America, I would have \nsuggested--and I did and I asked and I pleaded--that we should have \naddressed this issue in January, at the outset of the legislative \nsession, not, at the end of July, when we are about to recess for \nAugust.\n  So everybody is worried about the recess. We only have 1 week left. \nWell, that is right. What do we know today that we didn't know earlier? \nJobs and the economy are the foremost issues facing the country, facing \nAmericans. If it took several months to address those issues, then we \nshould have taken several months to address those issues. But now we \nare faced with a procedural impasse because we are being denied the \nopportunity to offer some amendments to this legislation.\n  Now, you would think we ran out of time. We didn't run out of time. \nWe didn't run out of time. We had 81 days this year--81 days--in which \nwe did not have rollcall votes; 81 days excluding weekends and Federal \nholidays, all through yesterday, when we didn't have any recorded \nvotes. We could have addressed this issue long before now, given it the \nattention it deserved, rather than treating it as a mere afterthought \nin the legislative process that we have to ram through here and deny \nthe minority the opportunity to offer a few amendments. That is all we \nare asking.\n  Now, you think we just dropped this bill on the floor of the Senate \nyesterday? This bill was on the floor more than 3 weeks ago. How many \namendments have we been able to offer on this bill on our side? Zero. I \nwill give them the lending facility that was offered by Senator \nLeMieux. But, obviously, that was an amendment the majority wanted. I \nrecognize the Chair here, and that was one of her major issues, an area \nin which I disagreed in creating a $30 billion lending facility. But we \nhave not been able to offer any amendments.\n  We have had this bill on the Senate floor for 3 weeks. We have had \nthree substitutes--three substitutes. No amendments. No amendments. \nThen yesterday, no votes on anything. We could have been finished with \nthis bill by now, if you had given the minority the right to offer a \nfew amendments. We are shutting down this process, Madam President, \ndenying the opportunity to debate the foremost issue facing America--\ncreating jobs. We have a 9.5-percent unemployment rate. We need to \ncreate jobs in America.\n  As illustrated last month, only 83,000 jobs were created in the \nprivate sector, and we are saying we don't have time to address this \nissue? It is not only frustration, Madam President, it does a \ndisservice to the American people. They know better. We have had plenty \nof time to address this issue. This bill has been on the floor of the \nSenate for 3 weeks and we have had three substitutes and 81 days that \nwe have had no rollcall votes. We had no rollcall votes yesterday. \nThen, suddenly, what appeared last night was that we have a substitute \nand we have side-by-sides, or alternatives, to Republican amendments. \nNo opportunity to review them, no opportunity to have a discussion or \nto reach a true unanimous consent.\n\n  The majority has said we have a unanimous consent agreement, but \nactually it is an ultimatum to the minority--take it or leave it. So we \nhad no opportunity to review these alternatives because they were just \nfiled. Actually, the amendments were not even filed. The majority \nleader posed them in his unanimous consent agreement that we either had \nto accept or reject. There was no opportunity to have a discussion \nyesterday. How could we reach an agreement, maybe on several amendments \nthat would be important to this legislation, Madam President?\n  So we had four amendments that were filed on the majority side, and \nnow we are faced with a cloture vote today at 10:40. Why are we rushing \nto a cloture vote? Why don't we spend more time talking to each other \nto get the policy right? Is it something that we are not familiar with \nanymore--how to sit down and talk to one another, to discuss the \nissues?\n  What are the alternatives the majority provided in the unanimous \nconsent agreement that wasn't a consent agreement because nobody talked \nto anybody about it? Well, it is adding issues that were in the \nsupplemental. It is basically taking the supplemental, the tax \nextenders bill, fiscal assistance to the States, education funding, and \nagricultural appropriations disaster funding that is actually in the \nnew substitute that was filed. Those are the alternatives that have \nbeen offered to this bill.\n  So this has become a mega bill. It is a mega supplemental, it is a \nmega tax extender bill, it is now an agricultural disaster bill on the \nsmall business bill. So if we were to take the issues that we agreed to \non a unanimous and bipartisan basis in the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, we could have had 75 to 80 votes. But that wasn't sufficient \nfor the majority. It wasn't sufficient.\n  So here we are today with a cloture motion--take it or leave it--\nbecause we only have 1 week left. Well, why do we have 1 week left? Why \ndon't we take as long as it requires to do what is right, to try to get \nthe best policy to create jobs in America instead of facing this \nfigurative legislative brick wall that is artificially contrived? It is \nall political theater. It is not about legislating anymore. It is all \npolitical theater. It is scoring political points. It is all for the \nnext election, which is coming very shortly. It is not about getting \nthe right policy for America--for small businesses that are suffering, \nfor the 8 million who have lost their jobs, the nearly 15 million who \nare a part of that, with the underemployed who are desperate and who \nneed certainty.\n  The House is adjourning tomorrow. So where is this legislation going? \nThis was supposed to be a jobs agenda legislative session. That is what \nwe were told by the majority. That is what we were told by the \nPresident of the United States. I said back in January--I sent letters \nto the President, to the Small Business Administrator, to the \nmajority--saying let's do it now. I had a major initiative that I filed \nin early March, and I was asked by the majority leader to defer because \nhe said we were going to be addressing this on the floor of the Senate \nbefore the April recess.\n  Well, according to my calendar, we are at the end of July, and here \nwe are. We are not even going to get done before the August recess \nbecause the House is adjourning tomorrow. So we have to get this done. \nSo we are going to ram it and jam it and take it or leave it, but we \nare not going to be able to offer any amendments on this side. We are \nnot going to be allowed to offer any amendments because the majority is \ngoing to dictate the will of the minority on a few amendments.\n  Madam President, this is unacceptable. I regret this. I deeply regret \nthis, as one who has worked across the political aisle. I wish more \nwould do it on both sides--look at the policy and see what is right and \nwhat works. Now we are talking about these side-by-sides offered by the \nmajority last night--the night before a cloture vote. We filed a \ncloture vote on the third substitute that has disallowed any amendments \nto be offered by the majority; the third substitute in the third or \nfourth week this bill has been pending. The third substitute was filed \non Tuesday and we are having a cloture vote at 10:40 this morning, \nMadam President, with no amendments because the majority is going to \ntell us what amendments we can offer. But they are going to offer \nplenty of amendments that aren't even related to the small business \nbill.\n  Enough is enough. This has been anything but a jobs agenda. The \nAmerican people are suffering. I suspect we will all go home and talk \nto our constituents. What do you think is happening on Main Street? Yet \nhere we are, all for jobs. Oh, but by the way, we are going to offer \nthe supplemental that we dropped last week.\n  Last week, before we voted on the lending facility amendment, I \ndeferred my remarks on the lending facility out\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\nof deference to one of our colleagues on the other side. I never made \nmy final arguments because we went to the supplemental. They stripped \neverything and sent it to the House. Now they are taking all the rest \nof it and putting it in this package on top of tax extenders, the \nfiscal assistance and education funding? They are talking billions and \nbillions. $40 billion here, $20 million there, all that added to the \nsmall business bill.\n  For what purpose? Is that the way we legislate? Well, the American \npeople know. They know it. They can see through this masquerade. They \nsee it all the time. They know it. That is why they have lost \nconfidence. That is why we are at a historic low, Madam President, in \nterms of public approval. It is a disgrace for this institution. It is \na disgrace and a shame, and I am speaking as one who has worked \nmightily across the political aisle for more than 30 years, in both the \nHouse and the Senate. My career and my legislative record is replete \nwith examples of bipartisanship. I think this is nothing but a disgrace \nand a shame and I regret that--more than anything else, for the people \nwho are suffering in America in every one of our communities. We all \nknow better.\n\n  We had no votes yesterday. It was possible to sit down and talk and \nsee what unanimous consent request could be agreed to between the \nminority leader and the majority leader. But, no, we decided we are \ngoing to forgo all that. We are going to play a political game. Isn't \nthis nice, offer these side-by-sides so the American people should know \nthere are so-called alternatives to whatever the majority would allow \nus to offer. It is a sad commentary because two-thirds of the American \npeople disagree with the direction we are going.\n  But more than anything else, they need jobs to support their \nfamilies. I supported the unemployment benefit extension, much to the \nconsternation of the minority leader and others on this side, because \nthey wanted to pay for it and I would have preferred to also, but I \nknew that would not be acceptable on that side. But I was willing to do \nit because I didn't want to put people in the terrible position of \nmaking a choice in their lives about how they are going to put food on \ntheir table. I have talked to people in Maine. I talk to my \nconstituents and I listen, so that is why I supported it, because I \nthought it was important to do it for the American people, and I hope \nthere could be some reciprocity here, to do what is right for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what the American people want from us is \nfor us to work together. They don't want partisan political attacks. \nHere is what is so strange about this particular partisan attack we \nhave just heard. The Senator from Maine said she wants a chance for her \nside to have ``just a few amendments.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the offer made \nby the majority leader to allow that. Any of the amendments they \nwanted, the other side wanted, matched by amendments we wanted. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Leader: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \n     pending motion to commit be withdrawn, and all pending \n     amendments be withdrawn except #4519, and that the following \n     amendments be the only amendments in order to amendment \n     #4519, with no motions to commit or motions to suspend the \n     rules in order during the pendency of H.R. 5297; that all \n     amendments included in this agreement be subject to an \n     affirmative 60 vote threshold; and that if the amendment \n     achieves that threshold, then it be agreed to and the motion \n     to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if it does not \n     achieve that threshold, then it be withdrawn; that any \n     majority side-by-side amendment be voted first in any \n     sequence of votes; further that debate on any amendment \n     included in this agreement be limited to 60 minutes each; \n     with all time equally divided and controlled in the usual \n     form:\n       Baucus amendment re: information reporting provisions \n     health care as a side-by-side to the Johanns 1099 reporting \n     amendment; Johanns amendment 1099 reporting; Murray/Harkin \n     amendment re: education funding; Republican side-by-side \n     amendment re: education funding; Hatch amendment re: R \n     Reid amendment re: FMAP/Cobell funding Grassley amendment re: \n     biodiesel.\n       That upon disposition of the listed amendments, no further \n     amendments be in order; that the substitute amendment, as \n     amended, if amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \n     read a third time, and without further intervening action or \n     debate, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; \n     finally, that once this agreement is entered, the cloture \n     motions on the substitute and bill be withdrawn.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I also work across the political aisle. \nI worked with Senator Snowe on the Passenger Bill of Rights. I worked \nwith the former Senator Smith on guns in the cockpit. I worked with \nSenator Ensign on afterschool, I worked with Senator Inhofe on highway \nbills, on WRDA bills. We all work across the aisle and I too compliment \nthe Senator from Maine for standing with us on some very tough votes. \nBut I have to say--she is asking for a bipartisan bill?\n  Let me read the sections of this bill and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave this printed in the Record. S\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JL10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JL10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JL10.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JL10.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The first amendment written by Landrieu-Snowe; the \nsecond, Snowe-Landrieu; the third one, Snowe-Merkley; the fourth one, \nSnowe-Landrieu; the next one, Landrieu-Nelson; the next one, Snowe-\nPryor--and on and on.\n  The next section: Merkley-Alexander. We all know Senator Hatch worked \nwith Senator Bingaman on many of these. Senator Grassley is involved in \nthis, Senator Brownback is involved.\n  I have to say, of all the bills we have taken up, this is the most \nbipartisan. I think that to make a process argument now is a shame.\n  Let me read some of the groups that support this bill, even though \nthe Senator from Maine doesn't like it. Let me tell you where you are. \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Pass this bill; National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses: Pass this bill; the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce: Pass this bill; the Black Chamber of Commerce: Pass this \nbill; the National Association for the Self-Employed; the Small \nBusiness Majority--and on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire list printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Supporters of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF)\n\n       American Apparel and Footwear Association; American Bankers \n     Association; American International Automobile Dealers \n     Association; Arkansas Community Bankers; Associated Builders \n     & Contractors; California Independent Bankers; Community \n     Bankers Association of Alabama; Community Bankers Association \n     of Georgia; Community Bankers Association of Illinois; \n     Community Bankers Association of Kansas; Community Bankers \n     Association of Ohio; Community Bankers of Iowa; Community \n     Bankers of Washington; Community Bankers of West Virginia; \n     Community Bankers of Wisconsin; Conference of State Bank \n     Supervisors; Fashion Accessories Shippers Association; \n     Financial Services Roundtable; Florida Bankers Association; \n     Governors of Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, \n     Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, North \n     Carolina, Oregon, Washington, West Virginia.\n       Heating, Air conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors \n     International; Independent Bankers Association of Texas; \n     Independent Bankers of Colorado; Independent Community \n     Bankers Association of New Mexico; Independent Community \n     Bankers of America; Independent Community Bankers of \n     Minnesota; Independent Community Bankers of South Dakota; \n     Indiana Bankers Association; International Franchise \n     Association; Louisiana Bankers Association; Maine Association \n     of Community Banks; Marine Retailers Association of America; \n     Maryland Bankers Association; Massachusetts Bankers \n     Association; Michigan Association of Community Bankers; \n     Missouri Independent Bankers Association; National \n     Association for the Self-Employed; National Association of \n     Government Guaranteed Lenders; National Association of \n     Manufacturers; National Automobile Dealers Association.\n       National Bankers Association; National Council of Textile \n     Organizations; National Marine Manufacturers Association; \n     National Restaurant Association; National RV Retailers \n     Association; National Small Business Association; Nebraska \n     Independent Community Bankers; Pennsylvania Association of \n     Community Bankers; Printing Industries of America; Small \n     Business California; Small Business Majority; Tennessee \n     Bankers Association; Travel Goods Association; Virginia \n     Association of Community Banks; Women Impacting Public \n     Policy.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Senator from Maine is right when she \nsays we have to move to help this economy, and this bill is one of the \nanswers. That is why it has such broad support. Republicans and \nDemocrats across the country support this, Independent voters support \nthis, small businesses support this. The only group that is \nfilibustering this bill happens to be the Republicans in the Senate. I \nam telling you, if they say no again, they are hurting this economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand the leadership has 5 minutes each, equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time remaining currently \nbelongs to the Republican leader. There is 5 minutes, followed by the \nmajority leader.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is fine. Thank you. I would like the minority \nleader to go ahead. It is his 5 minutes, and I will reserve the last 5.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to hear the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, a few moments ago, speak on the \nmeasure before us and how it has seemed to become completely enmeshed \nin the political agenda of the other side. I commend her for her \nefforts to get this bill right. Senator LeMieux was on the floor \nearlier, another one of our colleagues on the Republican side who \nworked long and hard to get this bill across the finish line.\n  But I must say, it takes a lot of effort to make a partisan issue out \nof a bill that should have broad bipartisan support. You have to go out \nof your way, as Senator Snowe pointed out, to make a small business \nbill controversial, but our friends on the other side have managed to \npull it off.\n  They have outdone themselves. We got this bill in late June. This is \nJuly 29. Since then, the Democrats have set it aside six separate times \nto move on to something else. So, from the beginning, this bill clearly \nwas not a priority to them until they realized they didn't have \nanything to talk about when they go home in August. I think one \nDemocratic Senator put it best when he suggested this week that a \nmidterm campaign that revolves around his party's agenda and that of \nthe White House is a losing proposition for the majority.\n  He was summing up their strategy on this bill. They knew they could \nnot run on a record of job-killing taxes, burdensome new regulations, \nmassive government intrusions and record deficits and debt. So what do \nthey do? What do they do? They create an issue where there is none. \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n  It was clear from the beginning there was a path for this bill to \npass with a very broad bipartisan majority. Instead, we are standing \nhere this morning looking at a third version of a bill and we have yet \nto engage in any substantive amendment process. They have been adding \neither controversial or completely unrelated matters to the bill--all \nto avoid any real debate and to avoid voting on Republican amendments.\n  This bill now has over $1 billion in agricultural spending in it. It \nhas $1 billion in agricultural spending in a small business bill, in \nthe core bill--the most recent version of the core bill. As I said, we \nhave been on this since June 29.\n  Republicans have asked for a total of eight amendments. That is about \ntwo votes a week if we had been on this bill. That is not too much to \nask.\n  It is obvious what is going on. They wanted to make this an issue so \nthey have something to talk about other than their failed economic \npolicies. The President made that clear 2 weeks ago when he accused \nRepublicans of blocking this bill, a statement every single fact \nchecker in town has shown to be false. So they can try to deflect \nattention all they want, they can manufacture a legislative impasse--\nand that is what has happened here, a manufactured legislative \nimpasse--but the American people know what is going on. Nearly every \nmajor piece of legislation this Congress has considered has had painful \nconsequences for small business. Nearly every major piece of \nlegislation this Congress has considered has had painful consequences \nfor small business. Attempting to create a controversy is not going to \nhide that from anyone.\n  Hopefully, if cloture is not invoked, we can return to the original \nintent of this bill, strip it of its controversial add-ons and pass a \nsmall business bill that attracts broad bipartisan support and helps \nAmerican small business owners. Given the legislative record of this \nCongress, they could certainly use the help.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have 5 minutes left; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to my friend from Louisiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would like to respond directly to \nthe minority leader because I wish to make clear that there are no \nextraneous provisions in this bill other than disaster relief for \nfarmers. The last time I checked, they were small business owners, many \nof them. They are running a\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\ndifferent kind of business. It is not a hardware store, it is not a \nrestaurant--they go out and actually get their food out of the ground. \nThe last time I checked or thought about it, they were small \nbusinesses.\n  If the minority leader is suggesting there is not bipartisan support \nfor agricultural disaster relief, I urge him, at his next available \nopportunity, to file an amendment to repeal it because I think his side \nwould have strong objection to that. That was put in at the request of \nSenator Lincoln and Senator Chambliss from Georgia, and he very well \nknows that--through the Chair to the minority leader.\n  There were only two arguments made this morning against this bill \nbecause it was just a political advertisement that the minority leader \noutlined, so I will not even respond to him, to the Senator from \nKentucky, but I will respond, in closing, to Senator Snowe and Senator \nHatch.\n  Mr. Hatch came to the floor, the Senator from Utah, and said we \ncouldn't possibly pass a $12 billion tax cut for small business today \nunless we could, as a Senate, in the next few hours, make final \ndecisions on whether to extend the entire tax package passed by George \nBush when he was President 8 years ago. I think that is a big lift for \nthe Small Business Committee. We want to give $12 billion of tax cuts \ntoday. I hope people will vote for them.\n  Second and finally, Senator Snowe does deserve the last reference on \nthis because she is an outstanding Senator, one of the finest I have \never worked with, but this issue is a public debate between those of us \nwho support the Small Business Lending Fund and those who do not. She \ndoes not support it. She has made excellent arguments. Her arguments \nare given merit. We voted on it, but we got 60 votes.\n  Senator Reid, I know, has the last minute and he has been outstanding \nin this, but, please, there are only two legitimate arguments. We \ncannot solve extension of all the tax cuts in the next 2 hours. Our \nsmall businesses have picked up enough weight. They cannot handle that \nweight. If we don't give them some help now, today, many of them are \nnot going to be here, I want the Senator from Kentucky to know, when we \nshow up in September.\n  I yield the last minute to the leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let me bring all of the Senators up to \ndate as to where we are.\n  A member of the minority indicated that that Senator would vote for \ncloture if we took out a provision we put in, the agricultural disaster \nrelief. So after having conferred with a number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, I have agreed we will take that out. With that \nprovision not in the bill it got 60 votes on Thursday night, that same \nprovision. But even to show good faith, which I am not sure it is \nnecessary, but to show we are going to go the extra mile, I will not \nonly agree to take out that extra provision but also have the same \namendments we asked for yesterday; that is, the three amendments the \nRepublicans wanted, which are the Johanns, Hatch, and Grassley \namendments. I will be more specific on the legislative language in a \nminute. So we would take the agricultural disaster relief out and have \nthe same amendments we had yesterday and offer the same amendment we \nhad.\n  I don't know how we could be more fair. In fact, a number of my \nMembers think we should go ahead with this, but we are willing to do \nthat.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Title 4, part 3, under \nsubstitute B, be stricken; and that the pending motion to commit be \nwithdrawn, and all pending amendments be withdrawn except No. 4519, as \namended, and that the following amendments be the only amendments in \norder to amendment No. 4519, with no motions to commit or motions to \nsuspend the rules in order during the pendency of H.R. 5297; that all \namendments included in this agreement be subject to an affirmative 60-\nvote threshold; and that if the amendment achieves that threshold, then \nit be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat if it does not achieve that threshold, then it be withdrawn; that \nany majority side-by-side amendment be voted first in any sequence of \nvotes; further, that debate on any amendment included in this agreement \nbe limited to 60 minutes each, with all time equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form:\n  Baucus amendment regarding information reporting provisions health \ncare as a side-by-side to the Johanns 1099 reporting amendment; Johanns \namendment 1099 reporting; Murray/Harkin amendment regarding education \nfunding; Republican side-by-side amendment regarding education funding; \nHatch amendment regarding R Reid amendment regarding FMAP/Cobell \nfunding; Grassley amendment regarding biodiesel; that upon disposition \nof the listed amendments, no further amendments be in order; that the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time, and without further intervening \naction or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; \nfinally, that once this agreement is entered, the cloture motions on \nthe substitute and bill be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nfirst compliment my friend the majority leader. I think we are \nbeginning to make some real progress here toward making a bill that was \ninitially bipartisan bipartisan again. This doesn't quite get back to \nwhere I had hoped we could get, but I think we are making progress.\n  Therefore, I would encourage my Members to oppose cloture on the \nvote, but we are going to continue the discussion. This is only 11:30 \non Thursday. I think we are getting closer to getting where we may be \nable to do some business and get this bill out of here, but there will \nhave to be some amendments on our side. Actually, I think our friends \non the other side knew it would have to be more than three. I \nappreciate the movement in the direction with the three, but that would \nnot be enough, at least for this juncture right now, to be \nsatisfactory. Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. My frustration is pretty high. I cannot possibly understand \nhow my friends on the other side of the aisle could vote against \ncloture. We have agreed to take out the provision dealing with \nagricultural disaster--take it out. We have agreed to have the \namendments they have indicated they have wanted for days. We have \nagreed to do that. It is unreasonable.\n  Some people said, Well, why don't you talk to Senator McConnell. I \nhave talked to Senator McConnell. It is obvious that no one on the \nother side of the aisle wants this bill to pass. I am so disappointed.\n  We are going to have this cloture vote in a minute. I hope Senators \non the other side of the aisle understand the good faith we have \nengaged in. This is not a victory for Democrats or a defeat for \nRepublicans; it is an effort to help small business. It is an effort to \nhelp small business. I went over line by line what this does for small \nbusiness. It is miraculous. Hundreds of thousands of jobs--not tens of \nthousands--will be created with this legislation.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the Small Business Committee leading \nthis effort. I understand that I said Lincoln-LeMieux; of course I \nmeant Landrieu-LeMieux when I spoke earlier. I am not going to mention \nRepublicans by name, but there are some Republicans who have stepped \nforward, and I appreciate it very much. Again, it is not for my \nappreciation, it is for the appreciation of the American people. Look \nwhat this message will send. We have at least 80 groups, entities, \nwhich support this legislation. Major small business conglomerates \nsupport this legislation. This is all they have. We shouldn't leave \nhere and not complete this legislation. It would be too bad. This \nshould not be partisan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we turned to this bill initially on \nJune 24. We have left it six times over the\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nlast month. There is widespread agreement on a bipartisan basis that we \nshould pass a small business bill. We are finally making some progress. \nIt has become less a political instrument and more the initial bill, as \nSenator Snowe has been asking us to do for quite some time. I think we \nshould continue to discuss it after the vote.\n  It is only 11:30 on Thursday. I think there is a chance we may be \nable to make some significant progress very soon. In the meantime, we \nshould go ahead and have the vote. The majority leader and I can \ncontinue to try to unsnarl this problem and see if we can move forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. There is nothing to unsnarl. We have agreed to take out the \noffending provision that Senators on the other side of the aisle said \nthey wanted out. I took it out. They wanted to offer amendments. I have \nagreed to let them offer amendments. There is nothing snarled. There is \nonly an effort to stop passage of this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the majority leader is graciously \ngiving us three amendments. What I am saying is three amendments is not \nenough, and he knows that. So we are not expecting to have an unlimited \nnumber of amendments, but three amendments will not suffice.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, could I ask the minority leader a \nquestion, please. Will he yield?\n  Would the minority leader be willing to say how many amendments might \nbe enough? The Senator from Maine, the ranking member, said a few. The \nSenator from Florida--if I could finish--the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nLeMieux, said he thought it would be fair if there were four or five. \nWe have offered three. Is there any sort of possibility--because that \nwould help us get even further.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will tell my friend from Louisiana that is the sort \nof thing the majority leader and I work on every day, is to try to \ndetermine the number of amendments, and we ought to continue to try to \ndo that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, let me press for a minute on this \nquestion, because with all due respect to the minority leader, until we \ncan finally agree on that number, it is going to be hard to figure out \na path forward. So my question to the minority leader is, so we can do \nthis in a more public way----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate has a cloture vote at \nthis time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Regular order.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid-Baucus \n     substitute amendment No. 4519 to H.R. 5297, the Small \n     Business Lending Fund Act of 2010:\n         Harry Reid, Max Baucus, Edward E.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nmotion on H.R. 5297 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, we have had a very enlightening debate \nthis morning on the floor that started at 9:30. It has been continuing \nuntil now. The good news about this debate is that although we did not \nwin on this vote--cloture was not invoked--Main Street is still winning \nand we are alive. We are still standing. Earlier this morning, the two \nleaders came to the floor and said--basically agreed--that if we can \nhave a few more amendments, what I heard the minority leader say, the \nSenator from Kentucky--the minority leader said a few more amendments, \nwe could then bring some help to Main Street.\n  Main Street has been waiting for a year and a half. We have had bill \nafter bill, amendment after amendment. What I heard this morning from \nthe minority leader was very positive. He said: All we need is just a \nfew more amendments. I asked what ``a few'' was. Was that two or three \nor four or five? That answer never came. I am assuming that ``a few'' \nis a few, and if we work hard over the next few hours and come up with \na few, Main Street could win because this bill is about Main Street and \nbusinesses on Main Street. It is not about Wall Street. It is not about \nbig banks. It is about small community banks and the small businesses \nin our country that are desperate for help.\n  This bill has $12 billion in tax cuts for small business, not big \nbusiness. This bill has a $30 billion lending program that is \nvoluntary, with no restrictions for small banks, not big banks. This \nbill is supported by over 70 organizations. I would like my colleagues \non the other side to know that the chamber of commerce and the National \nFederation of Independent Business are supporting this bill. Chambers \nand community bankers all over America are supporting this bill. And we \nare two votes from passage.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I very much would like to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am just asking a question through the Chair. This is \nthe time of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I have watched the Senator from Louisiana make a case for this \nbipartisan bill day after day, and I have heard her lay out why we \nshould come together, Republicans and Democrats, to do something right \nfor small businesses that create 62 percent of all jobs. It is \nastounding to me that we could not get even one Republican to join with \nus today. But I do have hope. As we speak, we see the majority leader \nand the minority leader discussing amendments.\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\n  I want to ask my friend two questions. The Senator from Maine gave a \nvery impassioned speech saying that the Democrats were the ones who \nwere stopping this legislation. She said all we needed to do was offer \n``a few'' amendments to the Republicans.\n  My first question: Is it not true, I say to my friend who is managing \nthis bill, that, in fact, the majority leader, Harry Reid, did offer \nthe other side a few amendments--clearly did before this cloture vote? \nAnd the second question is whether my friend would be willing to share \nwith our colleagues and the people who are engaged in this debate how \nthis bill is perhaps the most bipartisan bill ever to come out of any \ncommittee. I know my friend gave me that information--title after title \nafter title containing the names of Republicans and Democratic \nSenators.\n\n  So if she would answer those two questions, No. 1, when the Senator \nfrom Maine says that our leader did not offer a few amendments to the \nother side; isn't she incorrect? And, No. 2, isn't this one of the most \nbipartisan efforts to come out of any committee?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to answer the Senator from California by \nsaying the record will speak for itself because that vote we just took, \nthere were 59 Senators, all on this side of the aisle, who pushed a \ngreen light, and there were 41 on the other side who pushed a red \nlight. So it is very clear who is trying to move forward and who is \ntrying to stop this bill. It is very clear.\n  I don't think there is anyone, even in the press, confused about that \nbecause this debate, amazingly, has been so open. So much of it has \ngone on on the Senate floor that they can actually follow it. These \ndeals are not being done in back rooms; they are being done right here \non the Senate floor, and they are following it. They know there are 70 \norganizations, and they know this bill is bipartisan.\n  I am just going to read the names, not the provisions, that the \nSenator was asking about: Landrieu-Snowe, Snowe-Landrieu, Snowe-\nMerkley-Landrieu-Crapo-Risch, Snowe-Landrieu, Landrieu-Nelson, Snowe-\nPryor.\n  And let's continue: Kerry-Snowe-Menendez, Merkley-Alexander, Snowe, \nBingaman-Hatch-Landrieu-Grassley, Baucus-Grassley-Brownback-Inhofe-\nJohanns-Menendez, Baucus-Grassley-Crapo, Kerry-Ensign--there are 72 \ncosponsors that Senators Kerry and Ensign put on this bill--Snowe, \nGrassley.\n  For the ranking member to come and suggest that there are not enough \nbipartisan amendments, let me continue. There are more: There is \nLeMieux-Landrieu, Nelson is on this one, LeMieux-Landrieu-Nelson-\nKlobuchar.\n  This bill came out of the Finance Committee and the Small Business \nCommittee with bipartisan support. One of the things we couldn't agree \non was the Small Business Lending Fund. I understand the rules; I have \nbeen around here 14 years. So we had a vote on it. You know what. It \ngot 60 votes. The Small Business Lending Program got 60 votes on the \nfloor of the Senate after it passed the House of Representatives.\n  When I was in school, I learned that once a bill was passed, it comes \nto the Senate, they pass it, and it goes to the President for \nsignature. Maybe there are some people who don't want that provision to \ngo to the President for signature. I understand that. But we got 60 \nvotes on the bill, as the Senator from California knows.\n  So here we are. The other side is very good about hiding behind \npages. They bring out these big pages of bills and they say: We don't \nknow what is in it, and we can't tell. So I sent the four pages in my \nhand to all the press organizations today. It is just four pages. \nAnyone can read this. They are on my Web site and lots of other Web \nsites. There are just four pages. That is all that is in the bill--all \nsmall business items.\n  There was an agricultural provision that was in the bill that I \nactually support. Senator Lincoln put it in the bill, along with \nSenator Chambliss. But you heard the minority leader say this morning \nthat he didn't think farmers were small businesspeople. I will let him \nexplain that to the farmers in Kentucky. But he said he did not think \nthe provision for the farmers had anything to do with small business. \nMaybe he hasn't been in a seed store lately, or maybe he hasn't been \nwhere people purchase hay and supplies. Maybe he hasn't been to a John \nDeere dealership, but they sure are all over Louisiana and Arkansas.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course. I just have one more question for my friend.\n  We hear every Senator--Democratic, Republican, Independent--say the \nbiggest issue before us, the biggest one is jobs--jobs, jobs, jobs. \nWhen my friend goes home, I know she has to deal with the oil disaster \nand still rebuilding after Katrina. In California, we have our series \nof deep problems in tough, tough times. But she knows that whatever we \ndo here we have to push forward with policies that create jobs, and we \nhave to keep our eye on the deficit.\n  So my friend has brought forth a bill, along with Senator Baucus and \nmany Republicans--because she just went through the many bipartisan \nprovisions--that will leverage $30 billion into $300 billion from the \nprivate sector. If we turn that into jobs, we are talking thousands and \nthousands of jobs created by the innovators, the small businesspeople \nwho have gotten no help. That is why my friend has the sign ``Main \nStreet.'' We have to help Main Street.\n  So I want to ask in the form of question, and then I will leave the \nfloor at that point: Isn't this a bill that is desperately needed by \nour small businesses? Aren't our small businesses the creators of jobs? \nIs this bill not paid for? And won't this bill deliver the kind of \npolicy that will allow for job growth through growth of small \nbusinesses that are solid, with community banks that are solid? Isn't \nthis bill just what we need to do before we leave to go home and be \nwith our constituents in August?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely, the Senator is correct. I am glad I have \nthis chart to answer her question because she has been representing the \nState of California beautifully for so many years. She knows this \nwithout me showing it, but 81 percent of the jobs lost in America are \nfrom small business.\n  So when the other side complains and complains and just flaps and \nflaps and flaps all day long about it is a jobless recovery, we have a \nbill on the floor to create jobs from small business and they say no. \nThat vote today was a ``no'' vote to give help to small business. They \ncan color it, paint it any way they want. That is what it was.\n  We know this recovery is having a hard time with jobs. I am going to \nyield in a minute because there are eight other Senators on the floor \nwho want to speak on different subjects, so I will conclude with this. \nThis isn't Mary Landrieu information. This comes from the monthly \nnational employment reports from 2008 to 2010--the job losses with \nsmall business.\n  That crew over there on the other side of that aisle can't run fast \nenough to help big business, to help Wall Street. But when it comes to \nvoting to help small businesses that are bleeding jobs, they want to \nrun and hide off the floor.\n\n  The minority leader said a few amendments. I would like to know how \nmany is a few? Is it three, is it four, is it five, is it six? Let's \nget a deal done today. I would just as soon do it here, out in the \nopen, but I guess that is not the way things are done here.\n  So I will yield the floor and let other Senators speak about judges \nand other things that have to be done because there are other problems \nin the world. This isn't the only one. This is a big one, but it is not \nthe only one.\n  I will end with this sign because this is what this debate is about. \nIt is about Main Street. You are either for it or you are against it. \nIt is about as simple as that.\n  When I became chair of this committee, I said: We are going to fight \nhard for small business, and I asked the chamber the other day: How \nmany of your members are small businesses? They said: Senator, you \nwould be surprised. It is 96 percent of the members of the chamber.\n  I asked: Are you all standing up for this bill? They said: Yes, we \nare. So I thank the chamber and I thank the NFIB. I feel like I am \nAlice in Wonderland. Most of the time they are on that\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\nside, but this time they are on our side, and we can't get the \nRepublicans to vote.\n  Finally, the Senator from Utah came to give a feeble argument this \nmorning. He said he could not vote for it because we haven't debated \nthe entire extent of the Bush tax cuts. That is a big debate that we \nneed to have, but we don't have to have it on this bill. These people \ncan't take any more waiting. They have had enough. We can handle that \ndebate on another day, on another bill, but not on this one. So I would \nsuggest to the Senator from Utah that he has quite a few amendments on \nthis bill, and of the few amendments we might have, he may have two.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see the Senator from Florida is here, but I wanted to \nask a question through the Chair.\n  Is it my understanding that we have been debating this small business \nbill, which has come out of the committee the Senator from Louisiana \nchairs, for quite some time now? Isn't this the second week, or maybe \neven longer? Is it true the other side objected to a provision in the \nbill because it related to agricultural disaster assistance in a few \nStates?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Louisiana argued that farmers are small \nbusinesspeople too. So it is not unreasonable to include it. But we \ndecided, in an effort to get a bipartisan agreement on the bill, that \nwe would remove the section they objected to. Then they came in with a \nlist of three amendments and said they wanted to offer these three \namendments, which have maybe a loose connection with small business but \nnot much more of a connection, and we said: Fine, you can offer those \nthree amendments, and we will offer three amendments, and let's go and \nget this done. Then they came back and objected again.\n  So isn't it correct that right now we are trying to get to a point \nwhere we are providing credit to small businesses all across the United \nStates through good sound banks, and that credit will help these small \nbusinesses survive and hire more employees, and we are being stopped by \nthe Republicans in our effort to help small business? Is that what is \nhappening?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is exactly what it looks like. The Senator from \nIllinois has described it accurately. If anybody believes he has not \ndescribed it accurately, let them come to the floor because he has \ndescribed the truth. He has said the truth.\n  So I am going to yield right now because others wish to talk, but I \nthank the Senator from Illinois. This battle is going on, and we intend \nto win it for Main Street. I hope the other side will get their short \nlist of a few amendments together pretty quickly.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, before the Senator from \nLouisiana leaves the floor, I just want to say that this issue is very \nsimply characterized as Main Street versus Wall Street. It is a \nquestion of whether we are serious about reviving this economy and \ngetting money into the hands of small business through community banks. \nAnybody voting no on a motion to invoke cloture to go to a bill that is \nready to be embraced is inexcusable.\n  This legislation is critical to getting small businesses back on \ntheir feet. That is certainly the case in my State of Florida. It gets \nthe credit flowing again on Main Street through the community banks.\n  The statistics about small business and jobs is all too familiar. \nSmall businesses create most of the jobs in this country. In the last \n15 years, they have created 12 million jobs or two-thirds of the \nAmerican jobs that have been created. When the economy falters, guess \nwho takes it on the chin the hardest? Small business does. Over the \npast couple of years, small firms have accounted for between 64 and 80 \npercent of net job losses. So it is time for us to step up and help \nthem.\n  For example, in Florida, small businesses play an even bigger role in \nthe local economy. According to the Small Business Administration, \nsmall business employers account for 99 percent of the State's \nemployers and provides for nearly half of the State's private sector \njobs. Just when it looked as though things could not get worse for \nsmall businesses--and especially so in our State--along came the tragic \nexplosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform, and our seasonally \nadjusted unemployment was 12 percent, representing in our State 1.1 \nmillion people out of work in a labor force of 9 million.\n  We have not yet gauged the full impact of that oil spill on Florida's \neconomy, but there is ample evidence that it is the small businesses \nthat are the ones that have been hurt the worst and the ones who have \nhad to lay off the jobs as a result of that oil spill.\n  There was a study done by Dun & Bradstreet that found that the impact \nof the spill on Florida tourism, boating, and fishing industries--these \nbusinesses located along the gulf coast--is going to affect 46,000 \nbusinesses, with almost 300,000 employees and $14 billion in sales \nvolume. One of the key features of this legislation and another main \nreason why we need to pass it is that Small Business Lending Fund. It \nsets up the voluntary capital investment program, under which the \nTreasury Department can purchase up to $30 billion in equity from small \nbanks, those whose total assets fall under $10 billion. Although the \nfund is set at $30 billion, conservative estimates indicate it will \nlead to $300 billion in new small business lending. This is the \neconomic shot in the arm that so many States need, including ours. I \ncosponsored the amendment that was added to this overall small business \nbill that put the lending facility back in the bill.\n  It is an overlooked feature of the legislation that it actually \nprovides $56 billion in tax relief for small businesses over the next \ncouple years. Upfront tax relief comes in the form of early tax \nwriteoffs for investments in new equipment, new machinery, and new \nconstruction. That is all a part of this small business bill. Together \nwith the tax breaks, the targeted tax incentives, and the lending fund, \nwe have a package that is exactly the type of relief small businesses \nneed today. We need to jump-start them and that is what this bill \naccomplishes.\n  Obviously, as the Senator from Louisiana has already said, this bill \nhas very wide support. I underscore the Independent Community Bankers \nof America, and 29 State community banking associations have urged \napproval of this plan. So does the American Bankers Association, the \nNational Small Business Association, the National Association for the \nSelf-Employed, the Small Business Majority, the National Bankers \nAssociation, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\n  I have heard from many constituents--including small business owners, \nbankers, chambers, entrepreneurs--who believe this legislation is \nneeded. I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to join as a cosponsor of the Baucus-Landrieu \nsubstitute amendment because I think it is the right thing to do and \nthe right thing for our State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is my hope we can pass this substitute \namendment without further opposition as we are continuing to see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, it has been my privilege to work on the \nmeasure that is before the Senate, the small business bill that has \nbeen championed by my friend from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, that Ms. \nCantwell, the Senator from Washington, has been so instrumental working \non, as well as my friend, Senator Klobuchar, with whom I worked on the \nexport portion of this bill.\n  To the American people at home watching this, this must be a rather \nconfusing process. Why is it that there is a piece of legislation, a \nSmall Business Promotion Act, that has bipartisan support--why is it \nnot being voted on today? Frankly, there are a lot of things around \nhere we cannot agree on--the majority of things, it seems. But this is \nsomething we can agree on. It is going to be good for America. I was \npleased to sponsor the amendment along with my friend from Louisiana, \nthe LeMieux-Landrieu amendment, which is the lending facility. It is a \nprovision that will bring\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nmoney to local community banks to loan money to the people on Main \nStreet--not Wall Street bankers but the bankers you see at Rotary or \nKiwanis or at church or synagogue who loan to the auto mechanic, to the \ndentist, to the hair stylist, to the people working in your local \ncommunities.\n  In my home State of Florida, that is the vast majority of our \nbusinesses--nearly 2 million small businesses in Florida, small \nbusinesses that are struggling in the worst economy anyone can \nremember, the worst economy in Florida since the Great Depression.\n  Today I saw a report out of Florida Trend, one of our leading \nbusiness magazines, saying that for the first half of the year, Florida \nnow leads the country in home foreclosures. We are No. 1 behind on \npayments on our mortgages. Our unemployment rate is 11.4 percent, but \nthat does not truly capture how bad the situation is because that \nunemployment rate is a moving average over time, and after a certain \nperiod of time when you have been out of work, you are no longer \ncounted as unemployed because those who make these statistics believe \nyou are not actively in the job market anymore. The truth of it is, if \nyou walk down the street in my home State of Florida, you have a 1-in-5 \nchance, if you see an able-bodied adult, that they are unemployed or \nunderemployed. Twenty percent is the real number of people who don't \nhave a job or don't have enough of a job.\n  The people in my State are hurting. This is a bipartisan bill and it \nshould pass. I am hopeful our leaders, Leader Reid and Leader \nMcConnell, who are meeting right now, are going to come to an agreement \non amendments.\n  Let me break this down for the American people so they can understand \nwhat is going on. Our friends on the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocrats, are in the majority. They have 59 votes. They can control \nthe agenda. We, here on the Republican side, want to offer amendments \nto bills, but we can only offer amendments by agreement. The majority \nthat is in charge only lets us offer amendments if they agree to it, so \nwe have little bargaining power. But we believe we should have the \nopportunity to make bills better.\n  So we are going to have some amendments to this bill, and we should \nhave some amendments to this bill. You know what. If they are good \nideas, the power of our ideas will prevail and the other side will \nagree to them and if they are not, they will not. If the American \npeople, later on, think we have better ideas, maybe they will send more \nof us here and if they don't, maybe they will send more of them. But we \nshould have the opportunity to offer our amendments.\n  On the other side, they are going to have some amendments, too, and \nthat is fine, but they should be relevant to this bill. They should not \nbe leftover appropriations on issues that have nothing to do with small \nbusiness just because this is the train leaving the station and some \nMembers of this body want to see their stuff put on it. I understand \nwhy they want to get things done, but this small business bill should \npass, it should pass with relevant amendments from both sides, and we \nshould do it today. We should do it today and pass it and send it over \nto the House so the House can pass it and send it to the President and \nhe could sign it.\n  I say that as a Republican because, before I am a Republican, I am a \nFloridian and I am an American, and this bill is good for our country \nand it is especially good for my State.\n  I was pleased that the leader, Leader Reid, came down and made some \nchanges in his proposal. I am heartened he is meeting with Leader \nMcConnell right now. I hope they can work this out, because if they \ncannot work this out, shame on us. Shame on us if we cannot get this \ndone when there is bipartisan support for this bill, a bill that will \ncut taxes for small businesses providing much needed credit and lending \nfor local community banks to lend to small businesses without \nincreasing taxes and without increasing the debt or deficit. When do we \nget to do that around here? Not too often--we do not.\n  I have tried to work in good faith with my friends on the other side \nto facilitate the negotiations today to get us to a place where we can \nhave reasonable amendments, where the rights of the minority will be \nprotected and in the same vein we can still get this bill passed and I \nhope we can do so because we have good people on the other side of the \naisle who I know want to get this done.\n  I remain hopeful. I thank Senator Landrieu and Senator Cantwell. I \nsee my friend from Rhode Island, whom I also thank for his good work on \nthis bill, and I hope today we will get this done with a reasonable \naccommodation so we can help the American people.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I am pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Through the Chair, if I can inquire of the junior \nSenator from Florida, is it not true that if one Member of his caucus, \njust one, had voted with us just a few moments ago on this vote, we \nwould actually be on this bill and we could begin to move to amendments \nand consider the bill; is that not correct?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. That reminds me, my friend, if I may, reminds me of the \nsaying that half the truth is no truth at all. Yes, that part is true. \nBut the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say, is if this bill \nwere not loaded with all these appropriations bills that have nothing \nto do with small business, we would be on this bill right now and it \nwould be passed.\n  The keys to the kingdom lie with the majority. This deal could be \ndone right now and we could get to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise on an important matter \nthat affects all of us, Senators and citizens of our States alike, and \nthat is the shortfall in the process of confirming nominations to the \nFederal bench. In particular, I wish to talk about one outstanding \nnominee from my home State of Colorado, William Martinez. Bill has an \ninspirational story. I will tell you more about it in a minute, but \nfirst I wish to explain why there is such an urgency to confirm this \nfine nominee.\n  The situation in the Colorado District Court is dire--and I do not \nuse that word easily or casually. There are currently five judges on \nour court and two vacancies, both of which are rated as judicial \nemergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. These five \njudges have been handling the work of seven judges for nearly 2 years, \nand it has been over 3 years since our court had a full roster of \njudges.\n  But there is more to the story. In 2008, based on the significant \ncaseload in Colorado, the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrecommended that an eighth judgeship be created. So you could argue we \nare actually three judges down from what we should have.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nChief Judge Wiley Daniel to Leaders Reid and McConnell, explaining the \nprofound impact this vacancy is having on the courts of the District of \nColorado.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                     United States District Court,\n\n\n                                         District of Colorado,\n\n                                          Denver, CO, May 6, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell, I write this letter in my \n     capacity as Chief Judge for the District of Colorado. As more \n     fully detailed in this letter, our court has suffered \n     multiple judicial vacancies for years. Presently, we are down \n     two district court judges. It is important that you \n     understand that these vacancies have caused a profound impact \n     on the court's ability to discharge its important obligations \n     to the citizens within the State and District of Colorado in \n     a timely and efficient manner.\n       As you are aware, President Obama nominated William \n     Martinez to be a judge on the court several months ago. \n     Within the past several weeks, he was voted out of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and is presently on the Senate floor \n     awaiting a vote. I urgently ask the two of you, in your \n     capacities as Senate Majority and Senate Minority Leaders, to \n     reach a ``Time Agreement'' so that a Senate vote on Mr. \n     Martinez's nomination can occur. As I am sure you understand, \n     this is a critical resource issue for me as it is my \n     responsibility to ensure the adequacy of judicial resources \n     to handle the business of the court.\n       The court is presently authorized seven judgeships. At this \n     time, the court has five\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n     active judges and the assistance of five senior judges with \n     each senior judge having various levels of a partial \n     workload.\n       A history of vacant judgeships continues to impede the \n     public service of the court to the citizens of Colorado and \n     to those outside of the state who depend on the court for \n     timely judicial rulings. For more than three years, the court \n     has not had a full complement of authorized judges.\n       In March, 2007, Judge Phillip S. Figa underwent medical \n     treatment necessitating extended periods of absence from the \n     court. Following nine months of intermittent service, Judge \n     Figa, unfortunately, passed away on January 5, 2008. During \n     the time of Judge Figa's illness, the majority of his \n     caseload responsibilities were covered by other judges. \n     Following his untimely death, his cases were permanently \n     reassigned to other judges resulting in an average ten \n     percent increase in per judge workload, and the number of \n     active judges went from seven full-time active judges down \n     to six full-time active judges.\n       Shortly thereafter on March 31, 2008, Judge Walker D. \n     Miller elected to take senior status, and on April 4, 2008, \n     Judge Lewis T. Babcock took senior status. As senior judges, \n     each exercised their discretion to assume reduced caseloads. \n     With the unfortunate death of Judge Figa, and the taking of \n     senior status by two active judges, the number of full-time \n     active judges was reduced to four full-time active judges, a \n     judge vacancy rate of 42.8%.\n       In July, 2008, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     conducted a scheduled biennial judgeship need survey. The \n     survey reviews the caseloads of all district courts \n     throughout the nation applying a workload formula to \n     determine the need for additional judges. The survey \n     indicated, and the Judicial Conference subsequently approved, \n     the need for an eighth authorized Article III judge for the \n     District of Colorado. At the time of the survey, the court \n     was attempting to address a workload requiring eight judges \n     with only four full-time active judges.\n       In October, 2008, two of the three vacant judgeships were \n     filled with the appointments of Judge Philip A. Brimmer and \n     Judge Christine M. Arguello. As a result, the court's \n     judgeship vacancy numbers were reduced from three to one. The \n     court was now staffed with six full-time active judges; \n     however, the overall workload numbers continued to justify a \n     need for eight judges.\n       On October 29, 2008, Judge Edward W. Nottingham elected to \n     resign from the court. The court was again down by two \n     judges, with five full-time active judges and two vacancies. \n     Over 200 civil and criminal cases formerly assigned to Judge \n     Nottingham were reassigned drastically increasing per judge \n     caseload assignments. From that date to the present, the \n     vacancies have contributed to a growing case backlog within \n     the court.\n       Before leaving his senatorial office, Secretary of Interior \n     Ken Salazar worked with a local committee of legal experts to \n     identify possible nominees for the vacant two judgeships. In \n     a January 16, 2009 press release it was reported that then \n     Senator Salazar was asking Senator Mark Udall and Senator-\n     Designee Michael Bennet to continue to urge the early \n     appointment of qualified judicial candidates to fill the two \n     vacant positions. In a reported letter to Senator Udall and \n     Mr. Bennet, Senator Salazar wrote ``Over the last thirty \n     years, the U. S. District Court has often been plagued with \n     vacancies that have prevented the court from functioning at \n     its full capacity.''\n       Though the court has the continued assistance of well \n     qualified senior judges, and has also been relying on \n     visiting judges from other courts to assist with heavy \n     workloads, having a fully staffed cadre of authorized judges \n     is the most effective method by which the court can address \n     the needs of those depending on its vital services.\n       In that the U. S. District Court for the District of \n     Colorado has been subject to lengthy periods of judicial \n     vacancy, I believe it is in the best interest of the court, \n     and the public it 2 serves, that the judicial nomination and \n     appointment process proceed at a responsible pace designed to \n     yield qualified judges within a reasonable period of time. \n     Reasonableness to me means that the two of you agree, without \n     further delay, to set a date certain for a vote on Mr. \n     Martinez's pending nomination.\n       As the work of the court continues to grow, the court needs \n     judicial officer resources sufficient to conduct the business \n     of the court in a timely and efficient manner. The overall \n     integrity of the federal judicial process can best be \n     maintained by having a sufficient number of judges to address \n     the disputes of our citizenry without unnecessary delay or \n     expense.\n       In closing, I appreciate your consideration of my viewpoint \n     as to the judgeships urgently needed by the court. Until the \n     two judicial vacancies are filled, it is impossible for the \n     court to possess the judicial resources that are necessary to \n     effectively discharge the business of the court. Scheduling a \n     vote on Mr. Martinez's nomination is the next critical step \n     in this important process. I await your response to this \n     letter including your indication of the date on which the \n     Senate will vote on Mr. Martinez.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Wiley Y. Daniel,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Judicial understaffing in Colorado and in the \nhome State of the Presiding Officer and all the Senators has a real \neffect on residents and businesses. As the caseload increases for each \njudge, more and more time must be devoted to criminal cases. That is \nbecause the Constitution guarantees a speedy trial. But as time and \nenergy shifts to the criminal docket, the civil docket in turn suffers. \nIt continues to become increasingly difficult to schedule a trial as \nthese backups grow longer and longer.\n  This increased caseload I am referencing also has a huge impact on \nour rural and tribal communities around the State as well. Our Federal \nDistrict judges are all located in Denver, but they often have to \ntravel to other parts of the State for hearings or trials. The \ngeography in Colorado makes travel a little more complicated than in \nsome other States. We have a big State with the Rocky Mountains running \nright through the middle of our State, and I can tell you from my own \nexperience getting around the mountainous areas of Colorado during the \nsnowy winter months is not easy. As a result, all over the State, \nresidents on the Western Slope and down in the valleys, my tribal \nconstituents, they have a more difficult time accessing the Federal \njudicial system--as plaintiffs, defendants, even as witnesses.\n  As pressing as this situation is in Colorado, I know it is not \nunique. Of the nearly 100 current judicial vacancies, 42 are considered \njudicial emergencies--almost half. I understand our Senate has \nconfirmed only 24 nominees so far this year and 36 total since \nPresident Obama was elected. That is a historic low.\n  I don't wish to turn my comments on these nominations to a partisan \naffair, but the Senate has not kept up with the pace of past \nPresidents' judicial nominees.\n  In fact, last year the Senate confirmed the fewest judges in 50 \nyears--50 years.\n  Bill Martinez, the man whom I spoke of when I began my remarks, was \nnominated in February of this year, had a hearing in March, and was \nreferred favorably by the Judiciary Committee in April. Today, his \nnomination has been sitting on the Senate Executive Calendar--on that \ncalendar--for 105 days. Here is the question: Can we set aside our \npartisanship and support the people who need our system of justice and \nthose who work in our system of justice? The people of Colorado want us \nto vote on Bill Martinez and help us reduce the workload on the Federal \nDistrict Court of Colorado.\n  Senator Bennet has joined me, and I know he is going to speak in a \nfew minutes.\n  Last year, we convened a bipartisan advisory committee so that we \ncould have the best candidates put forward. It was ably chaired by \nDenver lawyer Hal Haddon, a well-known figure, and former Colorado \nSupreme Court Justice Rebecca Kourlis. The committee interviewed \nnumerous candidates, and based on his life experience, his record of \nlegal service, and his impressive abilities, we both recommended, on \nthe advice of the committee, Bill Martinez for a Federal judgeship.\n  I know I was very impressed with Bill. In addition to being an \naccomplished attorney and a true role model in his community, Bill has \na personal story which captures what is great about America and \nhighlights what can be accomplished when you have focus, discipline, \nand you work hard.\n  Bill was born in Mexico City and lawfully immigrated to the United \nStates as a child. He worked his way through school and college and \ntoward a career in the law. He received undergraduate degrees in \nenvironmental engineering and political science from the University of \nIllinois and earned a law degree from the University of Chicago. As a \nlawyer, he is an expert in employment and civil rights law. He \ncurrently practices in those areas. He previously served as the \nregional attorney for the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission in Denver.\n  I believe--as we all do, I think--in strong, well-balanced courts \nthat serve the needs of our citizens. Bill Martinez brings that sense \nof balance because of his broad legal background, professionalism, and \noutstanding intellect. I am pleased to have been able to recommend \nBill, and I am certain that once he is confirmed, he will make an \noutstanding judge.\n  I was going to ask for unanimous consent that we move to consider Mr.\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nMartinez's nomination. I am going to hold back on that request for the \ntime being, but I want those who watch the Chamber to know that a group \nof us who are going to speak to this backlog are going to ask, at the \nappropriate time, for that to be considered.\n  Whatever happens today in these unanimous consent requests--and I \nwould hope they would be granted--I am not going to give up. I am going \nto continue to work with people on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nany Senator who might have reason to block Bill Martinez's nomination, \nto find a reasonable solution so we can fully stock our courts and we \ncan deliver justice and services to our citizens, who deserve courts \nthat are up and running fully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I also rise today in support of Bill \nMartinez's nomination to serve on the Federal district court in \nColorado.\n  Before I talk about that, I wish to take a moment to address this \nsmall business bill that is before the Senate because people are \nwatching this in my State, and they are saying to themselves: We have \nspent 18 months with credit frozen--longer than that for small \nbusinesses--and Washington cannot seem to do anything for us.\n  Today is the day Washington could do something for small businesses \nin my State and across the country. And it is not a case of Democrat \nagainst Republican; this feels to me like a case of Washington politics \nagainst the rest of the country. So I lend my voice to the Senator from \nFlorida and say that I hope the leadership can get it together.\n  I wish to add my push today for the unanimous consent request of the \nsenior Senator from Colorado to consider this nomination of Bill \nMartinez. We need him confirmed so he can begin serving our State.\n  Bill appeared before the Judiciary Committee in March, where I had \nthe privilege of introducing him. His nomination passed the committee \nwith votes to spare in April. The Martinez nomination, like so many \nothers, has gotten stuck because of the obstructionist tactics of a \nfew.\n  So this man with a breadth of public and private sector legal \nexperience that makes him more than qualified to serve on the Federal \nbench is being held up month after month.\n  Like my senior Senator, I am frustrated with the secret delays in \nthis body. The purposeless shelving of nominations such as this one and \neven of important legislation affects real lives and poisons the \natmosphere in the Senate.\n  There are 99 vacancies in the Federal court right now. To date, the \nPresident has nominated 39 individuals to fill these vacancies. For the \nsake of judicial efficiency and ensuring fair access for all of our \npeople to our courts, I think it is time to move ahead on outstanding \nnominees who have cleared the Judiciary Committee easily. For the \nnominees, careers and families are being put on hold. If a nominee is \nunqualified or unfit for office, then let's have those concerns \nregistered for public consumption.\n  Like far too many Coloradans, I am so frustrated with our broken \npolitics. Instead of making sure qualified candidates are confirmed to \nkey government posts, the Senate has secret holds and stall tactics. It \nis painful to watch, and it is painful to the American people to live \nthrough.\n  Bill Martinez, for one, has earned better treatment through a \nlifetime of professional achievement. He has a stellar reputation and \ncredentials in Denver and possesses rare intangibles too. His career \nspans the legal profession and represents a true immigrant success \nstory on which this country is founded. Bill was the first in his \nfamily to attend college. His experience is an inspiration to all \nColoradans.\n  Is there any reason this attorney with an expertise in employment law \nand civil rights, coupled with years of courtroom experience, should \nnot receive an up-or-down vote? I, for one, would like to know, as \nwould the people of Colorado. I ask my colleagues to end the delay of \nconsideration of Bill Martinez. Let's have an up-or-down vote on Bill \nMartinez and then move forward and go through other remaining nominees \nbeing needlessly upheld.\n\n\n                     Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act\n\n  With the indulgence of my colleague from Minnesota, I wanted to \nmention one last thing. While I am here, I would also like to call \nattention to another priority that languishes as the Senate wastes time \nwrangling over nominees and partisan politics: the Healthy, Hunger-Free \nKids Act, a fully paid for, bipartisan bill that unanimously passed out \nof committee last March. This bill will make a tangible difference in \nthe lives of millions of children.\n  It is high time the Senate begin doing the people's business again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to address the need to \nmove quickly and to confirm several qualified judicial nominees--I \nwould say many qualified judicial nominees. You are going to hear about \na number of them today. I am going to talk specifically about the \nhighly qualified nominee for the District of Minnesota who was \nunanimously voted out of our Judiciary Committee more than a month ago.\n  Our failure to confirm Susan Richard Nelson quickly has consequences \nfor my State. The judge she has been nominated to replace took senior \nstatus as of last October and is stepping down from the Federal bench \naltogether in a couple of weeks. That means a smaller number of judges \nwill be doing the same heavy workload until she is confirmed, which is \nnot fair to my State or many of the States you will hear from today.\n  This nomination is important to our district. Our district's caseload \nhas increased significantly in recent years. In fact, as of June 2008, \nour district had the second highest number of case filings per \njudgeship in the entire country--the second highest in 2008 in the \nentire country. Yet, if she is not confirmed after coming through our \ncommittee unanimously, we will be down a judge even though we have this \nhigh caseload. Even as of December 2009, we were still in the top 10 \nmost overloaded districts in the country. From 2008 to 2009, the \ndistrict saw a 54-percent jump in the number of civil cases filed. That \nis over 5,000 civil cases currently pending and only 6 judges on a \nfull-time status to deal with these cases, not to mention the docket of \ncriminal cases on top of that. The district needs Judge Nelson to be \nconfirmed quickly. Delay is not an option.\n  It is worth noting that by this time in President Bush's \nadministration, we had confirmed 61 judicial nominees. By contrast, we \nhave only confirmed 36 of President Obama's.\n  When a vacancy arose on the Federal district court in Minnesota, I \nconvened a judicial selection committee to consider mainly highly \nqualified candidates. From this fine pool of applicants, I recommended \nSusan Richard Nelson to the President. President Obama formally \nnominated her for this position, and I appreciate the work of Senator \nLeahy and Senator Sessions, who is also here, in making sure she had a \nspeedy nomination hearing. However--this is a familiar story for \nseveral nominees--after Susan Richard Nelson received a unanimous vote \nin the committee, her nomination stalled on the Senate floor.\n  There is no reason to hold up this nomination. Susan Richard Nelson \nis exactly the kind of person you would like to see sitting in a \njudge's seat. She has been a magistrate judge for the District of \nMinnesota for the last 8 years, where she has earned the respect of \nlitigants, lawyers, and judicial colleagues alike. She has the judicial \ntemperament, personal integrity, and keen legal mind that are absolute \nprerequisites for this job. Throughout her tenure, she has gained a \nreputation as a fair but stern magistrate judge, one who is thorough \nand prepared. She has been described as a judge ``who favors neither \nplaintiff nor defendant, who listens carefully to both sides of every \nmatter she hears, and who can be relied upon to give articulate, well-\nreasoned explanations for her decisions.'' The ABA Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Judge Nelson their highest \nrating.\n  I believe she will make a fine Federal judge, and that is why I rise \nto speak today. But this is not just a Minnesota issue; this is a \nnational issue. As a\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nformer prosecutor, I know what happens when you have an overloaded \njudiciary, when you do not have the players in place, either the \nprosecutor, the public defender, or the judges. When you do not have \njudges available to hear cases, judges whose time is spread too thin, \ncases do not get heard, victims do not get justice, and litigants do \nnot get their problems solved. In other words, it slows down the wheels \nof justice when you do not have the people in place to actually hear \nthe cases.\n  It is my hope again that we can end this waiting game and confirm \nthese nominees. I truly appreciate the bipartisanship work on our \ncommittee to get these judges through to the floor. But now is the time \nto get the work done.\n  I know we will be asking for unanimous consent for a group of the \njudges whom we are addressing. I know Susan Richard Nelson's name will \nbe included at that time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to today in support of Louis \nButler's nomination to be District Court Judge for the Western District \nof Wisconsin. Justice Butler is an accomplished lawyer whose career has \nbeen distinguished across the board as an advocate, trial court judge, \nWisconsin Supreme Court justice, and professor. He is supported \nthroughout Wisconsin and I am confident that he will be an excellent \nFederal judge.\n  For 30 years, Justice Butler has dedicated himself to public service. \nHe began his career fighting for the rights of indigent defendants as a \npublic defender. He was the first public defender in Wisconsin history \nto argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As a trial court judge, he earned a reputation for being a tough but \nfair jurist and was recognized as a top Milwaukee judge. For more than \n10 years, Justice Butler has shared his expertise and knowledge by \ntraining judges as a faculty member of the National Judicial College.\n  Justice Butler served with distinction on the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nfor 4 years. There, he participated in hundreds of cases, many of, \nwhich were decided by a unanimous or near-unanimous court. During his 4 \nyears on the bench, he proved himself to be a hard-working, thoughtful \nand consensus building jurist.\n  Throughout his career, Justice Butler has been a judge who upholds \nthe rule of law in an impartial and deeply respectful manner. He \npossesses all the best qualities that we look for in a judge: \nintelligence, diligence, humility, and integrity. In addition to \nJustice Butler's impressive legal background and solid record as a \njudge, he is a fine man. He is deeply committed to his family, to his \ncommunity, and to public service.\n  Justice Butler's nomination proves once again that the process we use \nin Wisconsin to choose federal judges and U.S. attorneys ensures \nexcellence. The Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission has been used \nto select Federal judges and U.S. attorneys in Wisconsin for 30 years, \nthrough Republican and Democratic administrations and the tenure of \nSenators from both parties. Through a great deal of cooperation and \ncareful consideration, and by keeping politics to a minimum, we always \nfind highly qualified candidates like Justice Butler.\n  I along with Senator Feingold are confident that the people of \nWisconsin will be enormously proud of him and that he will serve them \nwell.\n  So, it is clear that this upstanding and well-qualified nominee \nshould be promptly considered by the Senate. Justice Butler has been \npending for far too long and a vote on his confirmation is overdue. \nSomeone like this deserves an up or down vote. I understand that some \nof my colleagues may oppose his nomination, and I accept that, but let \nus take an up or down vote as soon as possible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to support the efforts of \nmy colleagues to call attention to the refusal of Republicans in the \nSenate to allow confirmation votes on judicial nominees. We have all \nheard the numbers only 9 circuit and 27 district judges confirmed so \nfar in this Congress, 7 circuit and 14 district judges now awaiting \nfloor action, with 15 of those nominees having been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee before the end of May. This is an inexcusable \nblockade of justice in America for wholly political reasons, and it \nneeds to stop.\n  I am pleased also to join the senior Senator from my State, Mr. Kohl, \nin specifically seeking consent to debate and vote on Justice Louis \nButler's nomination to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin. Justice Butler, who was the first African \nAmerican to serve on Wisconsin's Supreme Court, was first reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee on December 3, 2009. He has essentially been \nwaiting for the full Senate to take up his nomination for more than 7 \nmonths.\n  Justice Butler is the product of a system for picking Federal judges \nand U.S. attorneys in our State that has been used since the late \n1970s. A nominating commission interviews and considers applicants and \npresents a slate of candidates to the Senators. We then send our \nrecommendations to the President drawn solely from the commission-\napproved slate. This process has yielded highly qualified nominees \nunder both Republican and Democratic presidents, and the nominees have \nhad the support of both Republican and Democratic Senators.\n  Justice Butler clearly has the experience and the qualifications \nneeded to serve with distinction as a U.S. District Court judge. First, \nhe has experience as a judge on both the trial court and appellate \ncourt levels in Wisconsin. He understands the difference between \nfollowing precedent and making precedent. Handling criminal trials is \nprobably the biggest job of a Federal trial judge, and Justice Butler \nhas a great deal of criminal experience both as a judge and as a public \ndefender in his early days as a practicing lawyer. He is well versed in \nWisconsin law, which as we know is often applied in diversity \njurisdiction cases in the Federal courts.\n  Justice Butler is widely admired for his intellect and his judicial \ntemperament. In 1997, Milwaukee Magazine named him the top municipal \njudge in the city. He has been a law professor. In short, he has a \ndepth of experience that is unusual for a nominee to the district \ncourt.\n  Justice Butler has been a trailblazer in our State. As I mentioned, \nhe was the first African American to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, and he would be the first African American to be a judge on the \nWestern District. He is a man of great distinction and achievement.\n  Justice Butler is a thoughtful and conscientious judge. I know I will \nnot agree with every decision he makes, just as I do not necessarily \nagree with everything he has said or done thus far. But I know he will \nbe conscious of the judicial role, and that he will make his decisions \nbased on the facts and the law and do his very best to carry out his \nresponsibilities with dignity and care, as he has done throughout his \ncareer.\n  Now I understand that Justice Butler's nomination is opposed by some \nMembers of the Senate and a number of outside organizations. The \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee voted against the nomination. \nThey have every right to do so, and I respect their positions. I \nbelieve the arguments against him are misguided and unfair. But I am \nprepared to have that debate on the Senate floor and live with the \nresult, if only the Republicans will allow the debate to take place.\n  It is time for the delay of Justice Butler's nomination and the other \nnominations that have been pending for months to end. Let's have a \ndebate and a vote. I thank Mr. Kohl and my other colleagues for shining \na spotlight on this issue, and I hope we can look forward to debating \nand voting on the pending judicial nominations soon. Such delay, \nparticularly for a district court nominee, is unprecedented. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider Justice Butler's nomination forthwith.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to join Rhode Island's senior \nSenator Jack Reed and other colleagues to call attention to the \nrecurring Republican roadblock of qualified nominees to circuit and \ndistrict courts. On the circuit courts, I spoke some time ago about \nAlbert Diaz and James Wynn to sit on the fourth circuit in North \nCarolina. I know the Presiding Officer has a\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nkeen interest in those two. These two were reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee on January 28, 2010, 6 months ago yesterday. Albert \nDiaz was voted out 19 to 0. James Wynn was voted out 18 to 1. That \nmeans a combined score of 37 to 1 for these two candidates whom the two \nSenators from North Carolina had agreed on, a Republican Senator and a \nDemocratic Senator. I came to the floor 3 months ago, given that \nbackground, on April 20 to ask unanimous consent for their \nconfirmation. Senator Kyl, who voted for both of these nominees in \ncommittee, objected on behalf of his colleagues. That is the \nenvironment we are in.\n  Unfortunately, that environment has filtered down to district judges. \nConsider the four district court nominees currently on the Executive \nCalendar, voted out of committee by a party-line vote, who are ahead of \nour Rhode Island nominee and who have to be cleared before we get to \nour Rhode Island judge. Lewis Butler is a former Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt justice. Ed Chen and Benita Pearson are long-serving and well-\nrespected Federal magistrate judges in San Francisco and Akron, OH. \nBill Martinez is a well-known and well-respected attorney in Colorado. \nEach nominee had the full support of both of their home State Senators. \nEach nominee would bring proper expertise, judicial temperament, and \ngreat diversity to the bench. Each nominee would be confirmed, if we \ncould simply get them voted on by the Senate. The way these nominees \nhave been treated stands in stark contrast to the way district court \nnominees were treated in the Bush administration. In 8 years, only one \ndistrict court nominee during the Bush administration was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. That nominee got a vote \nand was confirmed on this floor 51 to 46.\n  Why is it that nominees of President Obama are being held to a \ndifferent, new standard than applied to the nominees of President Bush? \nWhy have we departed from the longstanding tradition of respect to the \nviews of home State Senators who know the nominees best and who best \nunderstand their home districts? Is disregard for the views of home \nState Senators the standard Republicans want to live by during the next \nRepublican Presidency? Is that the new precedent we wish to set here in \nthe Senate? I ask this because we have a highly qualified nominee in \nRhode Island, Jack McConnell, who was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee on June 17. It was a bipartisan vote, 13 to 6, with the \nsupport of Senator Lindsey Graham. Jack McConnell is a pillar of the \nlegal community in Rhode Island. He is a pillar of the community \ngenerally in Rhode Island, serving with great generosity and \ndistinction on numerous boards that help communities in Rhode Island. \nThe Providence Chamber of Commerce has praised Jack McConnell as a \nwell-respected member of the local community. Political figures from \nacross our political spectrum have called for his confirmation, one of \nthem being my predecessor as Rhode Island attorney general, Republican \nJeffrey Pine. The Providence Journal, our hometown paper, has endorsed \nhis nomination by saying that Jack McConnell, in his legal work and \ncommunity leadership, has shown that he has the legal intelligence, \ncharacter, compassion, and independence to be a distinguished jurist.\n  Notwithstanding the support of Senator Reed and myself, the two \nSenators from Rhode Island, notwithstanding that this is a district \ncourt nomination, notwithstanding the powerful support across Rhode \nIsland from those who know Jack McConnell best, special interests from \noutside the State have interfered in his nomination. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, not the Rhode Island chapter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nhas attacked Jack for having the temerity to stand up to big business, \nto the asbestos industry, to the lead paint industry, to the tobacco \nindustry, and to have devoted his career to representing the rights of \nthe powerless. In doing so, the U.S. Chamber has created a cartoon \nimage of Jack McConnell that bears no relation to the man Senator Reed \nand I know as a great lawyer, as a great Rhode Islander, and somebody \nwho will be a great judge.\n  I ask my colleagues--I see the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee here on the floor with us today, the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama--do we want to let powerful out-of-State interests \ntrump the better informed views of home State Senators about district \ncourt nominees? That is not the tradition of this body. I again ask my \ncolleagues: Is this the tradition they want to set? If they open the \ndoor to out-of-State special interests trumping the considered judgment \nof home State Senators on district court nominees, will they ever get \nthat door closed again? I submit it is a mistake for this body to go \nthat road. I urge colleagues on the other side to reconsider what I \nthink is a terrible mistake, which is to allow out-of-State special \ninterests to prevail over the considered judgment of home State \nSenators when they agree on the best qualified nominee for district \ncourt in their home State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Rhode Island who, \nwith eloquence and passion, has clearly highlighted a disturbing \nphenomenon taking place in this Chamber. Well-qualified individuals who \nhave received the support of the Judiciary Committee--in many cases, \nunanimous support--are being denied a final confirmation vote by the \nfull Chamber. This is a break from our history. At the end of the first \nCongress, during President Reagan's first term, 88 Circuit and District \nCourt nominees were confirmed. At the end of the first Congress during \nPresident George H.W. Bush's term, 72 Circuit and District Court \nnominees were confirmed. At the end of the first Congress under \nPresident Clinton, 126 Circuit and District Court nominees were \nconfirmed. At the end of the first Congress during President George W. \nBush's first term, 100 Circuit and District Court nominees were \nconfirmed. As of now, if nothing else is done, President Obama, at the \nend of this Congress, will have only 36 Circuit and District Court \nnominees confirmed by the Senate, in contrast to 88 for President \nReagan, 72 for President George H.W. Bush, 126 for President Clinton, \nand 100 for George W. Bush.\n  Something is going on here. What is going on is a deliberate attempt \nby the minority to frustrate the traditions and precedents of the \nSenate where, as Senator Whitehouse suggested, there is a long-held \nview that Senators have more insight into the skills, ability, and \nintegrity of nominees from the Senators' home State than national \nspecial interest groups, whose major goal seems to be the generation of \ncontroversy for the purposes of contributions.\n  We in Rhode Island have an extraordinarily competent and capable \nindividual. As Senator Whitehouse indicated, Jack McConnell is an \naccomplished attorney. He is a plaintiff's lawyer. He takes cases of \nindividual Americans, who have been harmed, and he fights the good \nfight for them. He has been very successful doing it. He has received \nthe bipartisan support of members of the bar, judges of both political \nparties, and the Providence Journal, our major Statewide newspaper, \nwhich has a reputation of being very sensitive to the legitimate \nconcerns and needs of our business community. He is supported because \nhe is an outstanding attorney and because he is an outstanding \nindividual. He is someone who knows the law and knows the court. I am \nalways kind of interested when someone who has spent a long time as a \ncorporate counsel for a big corporation is suddenly--and in most \ncases--very quickly confirmed as a District Court Judge, even though \nthat individual may or may not have had a lot of experience in a trial \ncourt. Here, we have an individual who actually has spent his life in \ntrial court, both Federal and State courts.\n\n  Jack McConnell is a fair and good man, and he understands that a \njudge must hear the facts, apply the law, and indicate clearly to all \nplaintiffs and defendants who come before the court that there is no \nbias and that the case will be decided fairly on the merits within the \nbounds of the law. That is something all of my colleagues in Rhode \nIsland, Republicans and Democrats alike, recognize that Jack McConnell \nwill do.\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n  There is something else about this individual. He is an \nextraordinarily decent person. That counts for something too. There is \nno one in our State who is more generous, not only with his money, but \nwith his time. There is no one in our State who is more committed to \nhelping people, not to gain notoriety, but because it is the right \nthing to do. Those qualities are important. Ultimately, I believe one \nof the major criteria that should be met by a Judge is that when \nsomeone goes before the court, whether it is a big corporation or a \nperson who has been harmed, they know they will be treated fairly. \nFrankly, Jack McConnell passed that test with flying colors. As Senator \nWhitehouse pointed out, he passed the Judiciary Committee on a \nbipartisan vote. I thank Senator Lindsey Graham, who has used his \nexperience as a lawyer fighting for individuals as well as \ncorporations. He was able to recognize these talents, these skills, and \nthese qualities in Jack McConnell and support him. I appreciate that. \nBut we are here now in a situation where not only Jack McConnell, but \n21 other nominees are pending. We have to do more. We have to get them \nto a vote here in the Senate, and I will insist upon that vote as best \nI can.\n  Again, the numbers don't lie. They suggest there is something going \non here, something that was not at work during the Reagan \nadministration, the George H.W. Bush administration, the Clinton \nadministration, and the George W. Bush administration, regardless of \nwhich party was in the majority or the minority. Particularly, when it \ncame to District Court Judges, if they had cleared the Judiciary \nCommittee, if they had the support of the two Senators from the home \nState, there would be at least an opportunity, an obligation, to bring \ntheir nomination to a vote and let the Senate, as a whole, decide.\n  I urge that we return to what has been a dependable practice, one the \nSenate has embraced for good reasons, that we let these gentlemen and \nladies come to the floor for a vote, and that we vote.\n  That is all we ask. I think if that is agreed to, it will provide for \nnot only the disposition of these nominations, but it will continue a \ntradition of thoughtful, appropriate practice by this Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues who are expressing \nour frustration on the inability of the Senate to take up for \nconfirmation judges who have been approved by the Judiciary Committee. \nYou have heard our colleagues from Colorado, Minnesota and Rhode Island \nand there are many others who have come down and given similar \ncircumstances about their judges being held up from a final vote.\n  I know next week we will be considering the nomination of Elena Kagan \nto the Supreme Court of the United States and that will get a lot of \nattention and rightly so. It should get a lot of attention.\n  Let me point out the facts. The Supreme Court will issue less than \n100 opinions in a given year; whereas, our circuit courts of appeals \nwill issue many more opinions that will have a direct impact on the \nlives of the people of this Nation. Most Americans who have contact \nwith a court are going to have contact with the district court and the \ncircuit court, where the cases are heard, where the juries are convened \nin trials. So there is a great interest in making sure we have \nconfirmed judges for our intermediate appellate courts and our district \ncourts.\n  Here is the problem. The vacancies in these judgeships today are \nabout 11 percent of the court. More than 1 out of every 10 judicial \nspots is vacant currently in the United States. My colleagues have told \nyou about the backlog. So let me try to put it in, I hope, terms that \nthose listening to this debate will understand as to why we are so \nfrustrated by the obstructionist tactics being taken by our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Most nominees for judicial vacancies, once they have cleared the \nJudiciary Committee, are brought forward under unanimous consent; that \nis, if they have the support of their home State Senators, if there has \nnot been controversy in their nomination, if the Judiciary Committee \nhas approved them by a bipartisan vote, they will come to the floor of \nthe Senate by unanimous consent and will be handled that way.\n  Well, we are not able to do that because Republican Senators are \nobjecting to that process. So we go to the next level. We say: OK, if \nwe need to have debate on the floor, how much debate time do you need--\n1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours? Well, we cannot get consent to the number of \nhours in order to debate the nominee and then vote on the nominee in an \nup-or-down vote. The majority leader said we could have that time, but \nthey will not allow us to bring the nomination to the floor.\n  So then the only course the majority leader has will be to file a \ncloture motion. A cloture motion takes several days, and we have 100 \nvacancies on our district and appellate courts. Obviously, we do not \nhave enough time.\n  So let me give you an example on the Fourth Circuit: Judge Barbara \nKeenan. I chaired her confirmation hearing. I chaired that confirmation \nhearing on October 3 of last year. The Judiciary Committee reported her \nout by a voice vote on October 29. That was October 29 of last year. It \ntook us until March of this year to be able to get her nomination to \nthe floor, and then it was not by unanimous consent. It was not by a \nconsent as to the amount of time necessary to consider this nominee on \nthe floor and then a vote afterwards. It came to the floor through a \ncloture motion the majority leader had to file--a cloture motion--\nbecause we could not get consent to bring up her nomination almost 5 \nmonths after the committee acted on her nomination.\n  What happened with the cloture motion? It was approved 99 to 0 on the \nfloor of the Senate, and she was ultimately approved as an appellate \ncourt judge by a 99-to-0 vote.\n  My point is simple: These were dilatory actions in order to slow down \nthe process of the confirmation of judges which my friends on the \nRepublican side have used. That is why we had these huge numbers. As my \ncolleague from Rhode Island pointed out, the numbers tell the facts. \nThere were twice as many judges confirmed by this time when a \nRepublican controlled the White House than there are today. In other \nwords, we are working at less than one-half the pace than when the \ntables were turned. That is wrong.\n  My friend from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, talked about two \nvacancies we want to fill in the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit \nincludes the State of Maryland. The two vacancies we want to fill are \nthe North Carolinian spots, in which the two Senators--one a Democrat, \none a Republican--have recommended their confirmation: James Wynn and \nAlbert Diaz.\n  Well, we held that confirmation hearing--and I chaired that also--in \nDecember of last year. The committee reported them out in January of \n2010. In Mr. Wynn's case, the vote was 18 to 1; and in Mr. Diaz's case, \nit was 19 to 0. Both of these judicial candidates were considered \n``well qualified''--the highest rating by the American Bar \nAssociation--and they would add greatly to the diversity on the Fourth \nCircuit, a circuit that is not known for its diversity. James Wynn \nwould be the third African American to serve on the Fourth Circuit and \nAlbert Diaz would be the first Latino.\n  It is time--well past time--for these nominees to be confirmed by the \nSenate. I do not think anyone doubts, once this issue is taken up, both \nthese individuals will be confirmed. Look at the votes in committee.\n  For noncontroversial judicial nominations, it has taken, on average, \n2 months, after the Judiciary Committee has acted, for a district court \nnominee to be considered by the full Senate; and over 4 months for a \ncircuit court of appeals nominee. That is not doing the work the Senate \nshould do. There have been dilatory actions in order to slow down the \nprocess, and that is not what we should be doing as Members of the \nSenate.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as my friends who have taken the floor today \nhave done, let's get on with the process of confirming these \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees. Let's give the people what they \ndeserve; that is, a full complement of their judges. We should do \nbetter than we have done in the past. I urge us to put aside our \npartisan differences. This is not a tactic that should be used. It is \ntime we move forward on the confirmation process.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nUdall, and his staff for arranging this opportunity for us to speak on \nwhat is a far more important issue than I would have imagined, oh, 20 \nyears ago.\n  Before I came to the Senate, in 2001, I was privileged to serve as \nGovernor of my State for 8 years. I ran for that position in 1992, and \nmy opponent was a very good man named B. Gary Scott. During the course \nof our campaign for the Governorship of Delaware, we had something like \n30 or more joint appearances. All kinds of questions were raised by the \naudience members at those joint appearances, and we would respond to \nthe questions that were raised.\n  I do not recall one question in any of those joint appearances \nrelated to what kind of criteria we would use to consider nominees for \nthe judgeships in the State of Delaware. As it turns out, some of the \njudgeships in Delaware, some of the courts in Delaware, have national \nimportance, national prominence--the Court of Chancery, the Delaware \nState Supreme Court. That was an issue that never came up.\n  When I was fortunate enough to win, in 1993, I ended up, for the next \n8 years, actually spending a lot of time thinking about the qualities \nwe should look for in the candidates for judgeships I would nominate to \nall our courts and ask the Delaware State senate to confirm. I am \ngrateful to the State they confirmed them all.\n  I came to the Senate in 2001. I ran against a wonderful man, Bill \nRoth, who had been our Senator for a long time. During our campaign, no \none ever raised with us, to my recollection: What kind of qualities \nwould you look for if you were in a position, as senior Senator, to \nrecommend judges to the President of the United States for our courts, \neither for our district court or for the Third Circuit Court in which \nwe are a part?\n\n  But I had thought for years about the qualities I would look for, and \nthe qualities look something like this: I concluded that my job in \nnominating people as Governor and in recommending people to this \nPresident or other Presidents is that we ought to look for somebody who \nis bright, smart, who knows the law, somebody who also embraces what I \ncall the Golden Rule, treats other people the way he or she wants to be \ntreated; that when they come before the court, the judge will treat all \nsides the same; that they will not go into a hearing or a proceeding \nhaving made up their mind; that they will show no favoritism to either \nside.\n  I think it is important to nominate folks who have a strong work \nethic and who will work hard to find the right decision, that they will \nhave the ability to make a decision. Sometimes folks have a hard time \nmaking decisions. They should not be judges. We need judges who can \nmake a decision and often the right decision.\n  That is sort of the criteria I used in my last job, and it is the \ncriteria I have used in my current position as I have suggested \npeople--now twice--to this President to consider for filling vacancies \non the U.S. district court in my State.\n  We have four district court judges in our State at most times; we \nhave that many judgeships. For several years, we have been down to \nthree. As of tomorrow, we will be down to two, with the retirement of \nJudge Joe Farnan, who will step down for his well-earned retirement.\n  But last year, I was pleased to provide to our President the names of \nthree highly qualified Delawareans for him to consider for nomination \nto the U.S. District Court in Delaware. I said at the time--and I say \nhere today--the talent pool from which I selected those three names was \nthe strongest pool I have seen in my 8 years as Governor and during the \ntime I have been here as a Senator. At least a half dozen of the people \nwho applied for that judgeship to be a Federal judge would make us all \nproud. I could only select three and I selected three terrific \ncandidates and submitted those to the administration last year.\n  After careful deliberation, in March of this year, the President \nselected one name, and he sent to the Senate the nomination of U.S. \nmagistrate Len Stark for a seat on the Delaware District Court.\n  Following his nomination in March, I was honored to introduce Len at \nhis confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nApril. Ironically, the hearing was chaired by committee member Ted \nKaufman from Delaware. Judge Stark was well received by the committee \nat that hearing and was unanimously approved by the committee in May of \nthis year.\n  So far so good. But since that time, for the last almost 3 months \nnow, that nomination has basically been held up. We have not had an \nopportunity to debate it. We have not had an opportunity to vote on it, \nthrough no fault of Judge Stark.\n  I think the lack of a U.S. district court judge in almost any State, \nlarge or small, is a problem. When you happen to have a court with four \njudgeships, and you are down to three, the workload does not go away. \nThe workload is the same. The judges have to work harder. That is fine \nfor a while. We go out and we literally borrow district court judges \nfrom other States to come in and sit with our court in Delaware to try \nto deal with the workload. That works for a while, but it is sort of \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. They have work to do in their own States in \ntheir own courts.\n  When you go from three to two, and you have two judges trying to do \nthe work of four, it does not work. It is not fair, and it means we \ndelay, in too many cases, the justice that is needed. I do not recall \nwho it was who said--I want to say it was William Gladstone, a former \nBritish Prime Minister, who once said: Justice delayed is justice \ndenied. My fear is, if we find ourselves, next week, with two judges--\nwith two judges--in our district court, justice will be delayed and \njustice will be denied.\n  Not everybody in this Chamber has a real understanding of who Len \nStark is and what kind of person he is. I wish to take a few minutes to \nsort of introduce him to those who do not know him. Len Stark is a \nfellow University of Delaware graduate. Unlike most people who \ngraduate--they maybe get an undergraduate degree with one major--when \nhe graduated, in 1991, he earned an undergraduate degree in economics \nand an undergraduate degree in political science and he earned a \nmaster's degree in history, all at the same time. He was an \nextraordinary student at the University of Delaware. As a student there \nhe received a full scholarship as the Eugene du Pont Memorial \nDistinguished Scholarship. Following graduation, he was twice honored \nby his fellow students and alumni by serving as their commencement \nspeaker.\n\n  Immediately upon graduating from the University of Delaware, Len \nStark was elected a Rhodes Scholar. He studied at Oxford University. He \nhas authored numerous academic and scholarly publications, including a \nbook on British politics which he wrote--listen to this--in his spare \ntime during his studies at Oxford. After Oxford, Len then went on to \nearn his law degree at Yale Law School where he served as senior editor \nof the Yale Law Journal.\n  Len launched his legal career as a clerk for one of the most \ndistinguished judges to come out of Delaware in the last century--\nWalter Stapleton--on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and after that \nhe practiced as a corporate litigator for the law firm of Skadden Arps.\n  Len began his public service as an assistant U.S. attorney for \nDelaware, where from 2002 until 2007 he handled a wide variety of \nFederal, criminal, and civil matters. Currently, Len Stark serves the \nU.S. District Court of Delaware as a magistrate judge. In this position \nhe has already done much of the same work as a district court judge. \nHis docket consists of civil cases that are referred to him by the \nthree active district court judges--at least three active as of today, \nnot after tomorrow. On these referral cases, a great many of which are \npatent infringement actions, Judge Stark handles all types of pretrial \nmatters, and in certain cases even presides at trial, just as he would \nif he were confirmed as our new district court judge.\n  If I were half as accomplished as Len Stark is and half as smart as \nhe is, my colleagues wouldn't want to be in the same room with me. But \nLen Stark is as humble a person as I know. He is a dedicated public \nservant. He has a\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\ngreat family. He is a dedicated husband, father, and person of great \nintegrity and character. In every facet of his life he has performed \nwith distinction, earning the highest praise from his colleagues and \nmany of the most prestigious awards given to legal scholars and public \nservants.\n  I can sum this up by simply saying that Len Stark has the heart of a \nservant. He has a big heart. A little State, Delaware, but we have a \nguy with a heart as big as Texas. Judge Stark's position as magistrate \non the U.S. district court clearly provides him with the skills to be \nnot just an adequate district court judge, he will be an outstanding \ndistrict court judge.\n  Len's legal acumen, his tireless work ethic, and his experience as a \nFederal magistrate judge, as assistant U.S. attorney and litigator, \nhave prepared him well for this seat on the U.S. district court in \nDelaware.\n  I will be honest with you. It is hard to think of anybody who would \nbe a better candidate, a better choice to serve in this position. With \nthat having been said, we all know there are a bunch of good candidates \nlike Len Stark--Maybe not just like Len Stark, but people who are \nequally qualified who should be serving in vacancies around the \ncountry, and they ought to be confirmed.\n  I will close with this, before yielding to Senator Kaufman. I wish to \nclose with this: I have just come from a Bible study group. We meet \nevery Thursday for about a half an hour off the Senate floor with our \nSenate Chaplain. It is sort of like an adult Sunday school class. \nDemocrats, Republicans there, people of different faiths.\n  One of the things Chaplain Barry Black is always reminding us to do \nis to treat other people the way we want to be treated. He urges us to \nlive our faith. I don't care what faith we subscribe to, almost every \nfaith, that idea of treating other people the way we want to be treated \nis a fundamental, basic tenet. It should be a fundamental, basic tenet \nwith the way we behave in the Senate, whether the Democrats are in the \nmajority or the Republicans are in the majority; whether the President \nis a Democrat or the President is a Republican.\n  When we have somebody as good as this man is, Len Stark, and we have \nsuch a dire need for a district court judge in the district court in \nDelaware, I would just ask my Republican colleagues to put themselves \nin our shoes to see if they can't find it in their hearts to give us \nthe opportunity to vote up or down on this nomination.\n  Thank you very much. I am pleased to yield the floor for my colleague \nand friend from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to echo the comments of my \ncolleagues and object to the tactics being used by the minority in the \nCongress to block and delay confirmation votes for President Obama's \njudicial nominees.\n  I support this body's--I really do--I support this body's \nlongstanding tradition of respecting the rights of the minority. I \nthink it is one of the most important characteristics of the Senate. I \nam not one of those who wants to change the filibuster rule. I think it \nis important that we have a filibuster rule and that political \nminorities in the Senate are respected and that their rights are \nrespected.\n  However, I think this practice of indiscriminately blocking \nnominations serves no legitimate purpose. I don't see the time created \nby the delay being used to meet with the nominee, to check the \nnominee's credentials, or to review the nominee's scholarship, \nspeeches, or written opinion. This is delay for delay's sake.\n  Of the 27 district court nominees confirmed during this Congress, \nonly 1 has received a ``no'' vote so far, and even she was confirmed by \na vote of 96 to 1. Not a single member of the minority objected to 26 \nout of the 27 of these nominees. Yet someone forced them to wait for \nweeks or months for an up-or-down vote.\n  The minority may say this is simply the way things are done in the \nSenate, but that demonstrably is not the case. As this chart shows, \nduring the first Congress of the Bush administration, President Bush's \ndistrict court nominees waited for an average of 25 days to be \nconfirmed after being favorably reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. This pace was set when Democrats were in the majority party \nfor most of the 107th Congress and reflects a willingness to cooperate \nwith President Bush in a bipartisan manner.\n  In contrast, President Obama's district court nominees have been \npending for 74 days, on average, after being favorably reported out of \ncommittee. This wait only seems to be getting longer. Sharon Coleman of \nthe Northern District of Illinois, the only judicial nominee to be \nconfirmed so far this month, waited almost 3 months to be confirmed 86 \nto 0.\n  This is unacceptable. These nominees are good men and women who have \nagreed to put their lives on hold and submit to the scrutiny of the \nSenate in order to serve our Nation. This body owes more to these \nnominees for their sacrifices than to use them as instruments of delay \nand obstruction. As long as the minority continues to stall these \nnominees, then the American people will be deprived of the fair and \nefficient administration of justice. We now have nearly 100 judicial \nvacancies and more than 40 of them have been declared judicial \nemergencies. One of these emergencies is located in the district of \nDelaware.\n\n  After tomorrow, the district will be operating at half capacity with \nonly two out of four district judges confirmed to the bench. With this \nconcern in mind, I join with my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and urge my \ncolleagues to agree to consider the nomination of Leonard P. Stark to \nthe district court of the district of Delaware without delay.\n  Judge Stark was nominated on March 17 of this year. He received a \nnominations hearing on April 22, and the Judiciary Committee reported \nhim out by a unanimous vote on May 14. Ranking Member Sessions has \ncalled him ``a fine nominee'' whom he would support. As of today, no \nSenator has raised any public objection to his nomination. So I am \nconfident that Judge Stark will be confirmed by an overwhelming margin, \nperhaps unanimously, when he receives a final vote. However, he has \nremained on the Senate Executive Calendar for 2\\1/2\\ months now without \njustification or explanation.\n  Judge Stark has all the qualities required to be a successful \ndistrict judge. Since 2007, he has dutifully served the district of \nDelaware as a magistrate judge and previously spent 5 years serving in \nthe district as an assistant U.S. attorney. In his career, he has \nestablished himself as a talented, dedicated, and humble public servant \nwho possesses a strong work ethic and the highest integrity and \nintellect.\n  He also has stellar academic credentials. He is a summa cum laude \ngraduate of the University of Delaware, a Rhodes Scholar, and a \ngraduate of Yale Law School, where he was editor of the Law Journal.\n  Following law school, he clerked for Judge Walter K. Stapleton of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Through his experiences in \nprivate practice, as an assistant U.S. Attorney, and as a magistrate \njudge, Leonard Stark has developed the knowledge, skills, and \ntemperament to be an outstanding district court judge.\n  Therefore, I support the unanimous consent request about to be made \nby my colleague from Colorado to move to the consideration of several \nwell-qualified judges whose nominations have been delayed. I know Judge \nStark will be on that list.\n  I yield for the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I believe over the last hour \nand a half the Senate has heard from almost one-tenth of the body. Nine \nSenators have come to the floor to talk about a litany of great \nnominees for district court positions all over our country. The viewers \nhave heard and our colleagues have heard the importance of passing \nthese nominees through the process so we can deliver justice to our\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\ncitizens in all the ways that our courts operate. In that spirit, \ntherefore, I have a series of unanimous consent requests that I wish to \nmake at this time.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that \nat a time to be determined by the majority leader, following \nconsultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination on the Executive \nCalendar: Calendar No. 813, William Martinez, to be a U.S. district \ncourt judge for the district of Colorado; that the nomination be \ndebated for up to 3 hours with time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, I \nwish to express a few thoughts before my colleagues who are here and \nwho wish to speak on another subject. I wish to be heard on the \nnomination process and maybe I can be recognized after I make that \nobjection. Hoping to be so recognized, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, it is disappointing that we \ncan't get unanimous consent for an up-or-down vote on the Martinez \nvote. I wish to make clear to all the Coloradans who watched the \nproceedings today that I attempted to bring up this nomination for a \nvote, along with my colleague, Senator Bennet, but the minority party, \nas you have heard, has objected. It is a shame. I will not give up. I \nwill continue to work in every way possible with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to confirm this important and impressive list of \nnominees.\n  I shared Bill Martinez's story earlier with the full Senate. It is a \nquintessential American story, and Bill Martinez deserves to serve on \nour district court in Colorado.\n  Mr. President, let me move to this unanimous consent request: I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider en bloc the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: \nNo. 656, Albert Diaz, U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit, and \nNo. 657, James Wynn, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit; \nthat the nominations be confirmed en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that upon confirmation, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislation.\n  Before the Chair rules, let me indicate that the Diaz nomination was \nreported on a 19-to-0 vote. The Wynn nomination was reported with a \nvote of 18 to 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc the \nfollowing nominations on the Executive Calendar:\n  No. 696, Louis Butler, to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin; No. 697, Edward Chen, to be a U.S. District \nJudge for the Northern District of California; No. 703, Benita Pearson, \nto be a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio; No. 948, \nJohn J. McConnell, to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of \nRhode Island; that the nominations be debated concurrently for a total \nof 4 hours, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate then proceed to vote on confirmation \nof the nominations in the order listed; that upon confirmation, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSION. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I will continue to ask my \nfriend from Alabama to consider joining with me in approving these \nunanimous consent requests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nand consider en bloc the following nominations on the Executive \nCalendar:\n  No. 883, Michelle Childs, to be a U.S. District Judge, South \nCarolina; No. 884, Richard Gergel, to be a U.S. District Judge, South \nCarolina; No. 885, Catherine Eagles, to be a U.S. District Judge, \nMiddle District of North Carolina; No. 886, Kimberly Mueller, Eastern \nDistrict of California; No. 893, Leonard Stark, to be a U.S. District \nJudge, District of Delaware; No. 917, John Gibney, to be a U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia; No. 935, James \nBredar, to be a U.S. District Judge, District of Maryland; No. 936, \nEllen Hollander, to be a U.S. District Judge, District of Maryland; No. \n937, Susan Nelson, to be a U.S. District Judge, District of Minnesota; \nthat the nominations be confirmed en bloc and the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  Before the Chair entertains the request, let me indicate that all of \nthe above nominees were reported unanimously or on a voice vote in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Colorado \nraising these issues. The Senate does have a responsibility to treat \nnominees fairly. I have worked to do that as ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and they are entitled to be considered on the \nfloor.\n  But things don't always go as smoothly as you would like. I will make \na couple of points that are very important.\n  President Obama's nominees are moving considerably faster--to both \ncircuit and district courts--than President Bush's nominees, many of \nwhom were subjected to incredibly unjustified actions to obstruct their \nnominations. My good friend, the Senator from Delaware, says we should \nuse the Golden Rule. I would say that is always a good policy. I am \npleased that nominees are moving faster than President Bush's nominees \nwere moved. But if we ask for parity, consistency, and if we ask for \nfairness, based on what was done to President Bush's nominees, they \nwould be held considerably longer, and a lot of nominees would never \neven get a hearing, and they would wait for years.\n  I want to mention a few facts about these matters. President Obama's \ncircuit court nominees have waited for a hearing only 59 days, on \naverage. President Bush's nominees waited, on average, 176 days to even \nhave a hearing in the committee. Actually that was in his first \nCongress, and the Republicans had a majority at that time. But they had \nto wait 247 days to get a hearing for his entire Presidency. Whereas, \nwe are now having hearings in the Judiciary Committee in 59 days. We \nhad one yesterday, 14 days after the nomination of a district court \nnominee. That doesn't sound like a railroad to me. President Obama's \ndistrict court nominees have waited for hearings only 45 days, on \naverage, while President Bush's district court nominees waited 120 days \nfor hearings in the committee. So they come out of committee at an \nunprecedented rate. That is all right; we will deal with that. But \nsometimes we have to ask ourselves, how fast should you move a nominee \nto the floor? Should you have some time that the nominee lays over?\n  Let us talk about the time from nomination to confirmation. I guess \nthat is the ultimate test. How long do you wait between the time a \nperson is nominated until the time they are confirmed? President Bush's \ncircuit court\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nnominees, on average, waited 350 days from nomination to confirmation. \nBy contrast, President Obama's circuit court nominees, on average, are \nbeing confirmed almost twice as fast, in 208 days.\n  Similarly, President Bush's district court nominees, on average--\npeople have said somehow this is unusual, the way President Obama's \nnominees are being treated--waited 178 days from nomination to \nconfirmation. By contrast, President Obama's district court nominees, \non average, are being processed almost 2 months faster, about 130 days.\n  I think it is important to look at other processes that cause \ndisturbances in the Senate. It should not go unnoted that President \nObama bypassed the Senate and recess-appointed Donald Berwick as \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services less \nthan 3 months after his nomination, and without even a Senate Finance \nCommittee hearing taking place. He was very controversial.\n  The reasoning offered was that the Republicans are blocking this \nappointment and that he has to go forward. Without even having a \nhearing? That is particularly odd, since that position was vacant for \n16 months before we even had a nomination and hasn't had a confirmed \nAdministrator since 2006, and now they want to move it through with a \nrecess appointment, bypassing the confirmation process entirely, \nwithout even having a hearing in the Finance Committee.\n  I have to note that the President has been slow to nominate. There \nare now 100 vacancies in our courts--20 in the circuit courts and 80 in \nthe district courts--but only 48 nominations are before the Senate. So \nthe President has been a bit slow, perhaps, in making his nominations. \nBut he should take care; they don't have to be rushed. The Republic \nwon't collapse if there is a vacancy for a reasonable period of time. \nBut one reason the confirmations are as they are is because nominations \nare not being submitted in a rapid way.\n\n  Look at the fourth circuit. A lot of complaints have been made about \nthe fourth circuit. This is stunning to me. You know the old story \nabout the man who killed his parents and then complained that he was an \norphan. One Bush nominee--a highly qualified nominee--for the fourth \ncircuit waited 585 days and never got a hearing. He was rated by the \nAmerican Bar Association as ``unanimously well qualified.'' He was a \npresiding judge in the district court on which he served. He had served \nin the Department of Justice. He had been point guard on the Clemson \nbasketball team in the ACC. I always thought that clearly meant he knew \nhow to make decisions if he could be a point guard at Clemson and dish \nout the ball. He was also asked--out of the entire United States of \nAmerica--by Janet Reno to investigate President Clinton. She had so \nmuch confidence in him, she picked him. He didn't indict the President. \nYou would think they would be appreciative of that. No, they blocked \nhim. He never got a hearing.\n  When President Bush left office, there were five vacancies on the \nfourth circuit. What an outrage. They were systematically blocked by \nthe Senate and the Democrats, who are now complaining so piously, and \nsince that time, two have been filled. Now they are complaining that \nsome other vacancies haven't been filled. Give me a break.\n  Look, the nominations are moving rapidly out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. They are coming on the floor. When they get here, they get \ncaught up in all kinds of messes. The leaders on both sides have to \ntalk and they have to work out floor time. Some of these nominees are \ngoing to have some debate about them. You have heard a number of names \nmentioned. I point out to my friend from Colorado that Mr. Martinez had \na lot of ``no'' votes. He was a top lawyer with the ACLU in Colorado. \nHe doesn't seem to me to be the most mainstream nominee.\n  The American people are very tired of judges who get on the bench, \nwith lifetime appointments, and start advancing all kinds of agendas \nand legislate from the bench. They expect this Congress to make sure \nthat whoever gets nominated will show restraint and will follow the \nlaw, and follow their oath to serve under the Constitution and not \nabove it. So he is a controversial nomination.\n  Mr. Butler from Wisconsin--I know he is controversial. Mr. Butler has \ntwice run for the Supreme Court of Wisconsin and twice lost. He ran in \n2000 and lost by a 2 to 1 margin. He was appointed to a vacancy on that \ncourt in 2004, and then ran for election when term of the vacancy \nended. Those kinds of elections are normally won easily. He lost that, \nbecause his reputation was that of one of the most pro-plaintiff judges \nin the United States.\n  This is a serious concern when we appoint somebody on the bench with \na lifetime appointment and he can't be voted out of office. Others have \nproblems. Some of them are due to come up and be voted on for sure. It \njust takes time. I am not able to make the decisions that the leaders \nof our two parties make. They try to work out matters here. Some judges \ncome forward and some don't. I have kind of quit worrying about who \ngets picked and who doesn't. That is above my pay grade.\n  I will say that, at least with regard to any fair analysis of the \nnumbers, the Obama administration judges are moving faster than the \nBush administration judges moved. There is a growing concern about the \nphilosophy that President Obama has about judges. He said that when he \nlooks for a judge, he wants to know if they have empathy. Empathy for \nwho? Which party does he have empathy for? He wants a judge who will be \nwilling to help advance ``a broader vision for what America should \nbe.'' I am not aware that judges need to be promoting visions. Whose \nvision? My vision, or the judge's vision, or President Obama's vision? \nWhose vision is the judge going to promote? Who is he going to have \nempathy for? This party or that party?\n  The oath a judge takes is that they will do equal justice to the poor \nand the rich, and they will serve impartially. I believe Chief Justice \nRoberts' metaphor that a judge should be a neutral umpire is a simple \nand beautiful way to say what a judge should be. That doesn't mean he \ntakes sides in a lawsuit because he has more empathy for one party than \nthe other.\n  We have a serious problem. This is the definition of activism. It \npoliticizes the court. These kinds of empathies and other matters are \nnot law; they are politics. We do not need politics in the court.\n  Some of these nominations are controversial and are going to take \nsome time to move forward. We are not a rubberstamp over here. We do \nnot intend to stand by and have this court packed with nominees who are \nnot absolutely committed to following the law as written whether or not \nthey like it.\n  The Constitution says in its Preamble: ``We . . . do ordain and \nestablish this Constitution for the United States of America,'' not \nsome constitution a judge who got appointed last week thinks it ought \nto be but the one that actually was passed. Otherwise, we do not have \nlaw in this country.\n  We have a great heritage of law. We have a responsibility to move \nnominations. I made a commitment to the President, to Chairman Leahy, \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that to the extent I am \nable to do so, we are going to treat nominees fairly. We are not going \nto misrepresent their records. Certain nominees are going to be moved \nforward. I expect I will vote for over 90 percent of the nominees, \ngiving deference to President Obama. Some of them I may be worried \nabout, but I am not certain they are not going to be faithful to the \nlaw. I am going to give the President deference, and I am going to vote \nfor them. If I do have objections, I am going to raise those \nobjections. I believe the American people expect this Senate to \nscrutinize a nominee to make sure they will be faithful to the law and \nfollow it whether or not they like it.\n  My colleagues know a lot of these nominees. They care about them. It \ndoes seem like a long time. Perhaps we ought to get together, I say to \nSenator Udall, in a ``do unto others'' situation and see whether we can \nfigure a way to be more effective in moving nominations as a whole and \nnot have it change if Republicans were to elect a President next time.\n  How we really got into the controversy--and I will conclude with \nthis--was President Clinton had almost 95, 98 percent of his nominees \nconfirmed. When President Bush got elected, Democratic Senators--\nSenator\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nUdall was not here then--met in a retreat. This is according to a New \nYork Times article. Appearing at the retreat were Marcia Greenberger, \nLaurence Tribe, and Cass Sunstein--three very aggressive, liberal \nlawyers who believe that judges should be activists to promote the law, \nadvance the law in a certain way. The report was that agreement had \nbeen reached to change the ground rules of confirmations.\n  That is exactly what happened. President Bush nominated eight judges. \nHe nominated Roger Gregory, an African American who had been nominated \nby President Clinton but was not confirmed before President Clinton \nleft office, as a gesture of good faith. He nominated another Democrat, \nI think out of his 8 or 10, within a few months. Those were promptly \nconfirmed. The rest of them waited months and years. Some never got \nconfirmed. A filibuster took place that we had never seen before. We \neven had Justice Sam Alito filibustered by the Senate, one of the most \nfabulous nominees we have seen and who is doing a great job on the \nSupreme Court. All of this never happened before. It was quite a \nchange. We are having more difficulties now than we probably should \nhave.\n  I say to Senator Udall, I appreciate his commitment to the nominees \nhe knows and respects and would like to see confirmed. I am sorry they \nhave not been brought up as quickly as he would like. When they get out \nof committee, it basically becomes a leadership matter. They have a lot \nof issues on the agenda, and frequently good nominees can get tied up \nin them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I listened intently to my \nfriend from Alabama. I have had the opportunity when I have presided to \nlisten to him share his point of view with the Senate. As always, he is \narticulate and passionate.\n  Before I make two unanimous consent requests, I wish to make some \nbrief remarks. I see a number of colleagues on the Senate floor.\n  I heard the comments about the time in which the Judiciary Committee \nis considering these nominees. And there are numbers and there are \nnumbers, but the number that stands out to me, as I mentioned earlier, \nis we have 100 judicial vacancies, which the Senator from Alabama \nacknowledged. Forty-two of those are considered judicial emergencies by \nthe bodies that oversee and monitor the judiciary. The Senate has \nconfirmed 24 nominees so far this year and 36 total since President \nObama was elected. Those are historic lows. That is the fewest number \nof judges confirmed in 50 years. We may have accelerated the process by \nwhich nominees are considered, but we have not accelerated the process \nby which they are confirmed so they can serve on a circuit court or a \ndistrict court.\n  The Senator talked about a nominee who was in limbo for 8 years, and \nI heard the passion with which he thinks that was a wrong. But two \nwrongs do not make a right. We need to get our courts fully staffed \nwith jurists who want to serve.\n  I heard piety mentioned. The eight of my colleagues who came to talk \nabout filling the district and circuit courts--I did not hear a lot of \npiety; I heard a need and a desire to fill the courts so citizens' \nrights can be maintained and justice can be delivered, whether it is in \ncriminal or civil settings.\n  Finally, with all due respect to my friend from Alabama, I will wait \nuntil we hopefully have a debate on the floor about Bill Martinez to \ntell all the 99 Senators what a marvelous candidate he is and what a \nstrong member of the bench he would be. We will set that debate aside \nuntil I hope, I say to Senator Sessions, we actually can discuss the \nBill Martinez confirmation on the floor.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider en bloc the following nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar: No. 891, Goodwin Liu, to be a U.S. circuit judge \nfor the Ninth Circuit; and No. 933, Robert Chatigny, to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Second Circuit. I ask unanimous consent that \nthose nominations be debated concurrently for a total of 4 hours, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senators Leahy and \nSessions or their designees; that upon use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate then proceed to vote on the confirmation of the nominations \nin the order listed; that upon confirmation, the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I do say to my \ncolleague, perhaps we should, in the spirit of harmony, work together \nand see if we can get a commitment that will be binding, not just for \nthis Congress but perhaps one in the future, that would do a little \nbetter job than we have done in moving nominations. I do think there is \nroom for criticism and we could do better. And I feel a responsibility, \nI say to Senator Udall, to work with good people on the other side to \ntry to do that.\n  With regard to these two nominees, Mr. Chatigny is a controversial \nnominee. He stayed the execution of a serial murderer, and, among other \nthings he did, he found that sexual sadism was a mitigating factor that \nwould mitigate against him receiving the death penalty after he had \nbeen duly convicted and sentenced by a Connecticut jury.\n  Mr. Liu is probably the most controversial activist nominee before \nthe Senate. He has written that people have a constitutional right to \nwelfare. He would be very controversial.\n  I say with regard to those two, when they are brought up, Majority \nLeader Reid will have to be sure there is considerable time available \nso the debate can be effective.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The concerns of the Senator from Alabama are \nhis, and they are most likely shared by others. The point I am trying \nto make is, let's bring nominees to the floor, have that debate, fully \nconsider their records, and then have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, moving to my last unanimous consent request, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider en bloc the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: \nNo. 892, Raymond Lohier, to be U.S. circuit judge for the Second \nCircuit of New York; and No. 934, Scott Matheson, to be U.S. circuit \njudge for the Tenth Circuit; that the nominations be debated \nconcurrently for a total of 4 hours, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate then proceed to vote \non confirmation of the nominations in the order listed; that upon \nconfirmation, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I look forward to working with \nthe Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Vermont to move all of \nthese worthy nominations to the floor. I appreciate the conversation we \nhave had.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The small business bill is pending, H.R. 5297.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Ben Weingrod\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to make note of the fact that a young \nman who has worked with me for 3 years in this body and who is present \non the floor today will be leaving to go to graduate school.\n  I thank Ben Weingrod for his tremendous service to the Senate. Maybe \nthis will be his last opportunity to be a\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nstaff member in a floor proceeding. I express my gratitude to him for \nhis service to our country and as a member of our staff over the past 3 \nyears. I thank him very much.\n\n\n                         Free-Trade Agreements\n\n  I rise today to talk about the importance of our relationship with \nLatin America and the role that free trade plays in those \nrelationships. In particular, I wish to emphasize the need for action, \nin my view, by the Congress to implement free-trade agreements signed \nwith the nations of Colombia and Panama. President Obama described the \nimportance of these agreements in his State of the Union Address \nearlier this year. I know the President and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative are currently working on the remaining details, and it \nis my hope that the President will soon submit legislation to the \nCongress to implement these agreements.\n  While the recession has been a challenge to economies across the \nglobe, it also has given us the opportunity to soberly reevaluate our \nglobal relationships and look to build stronger partnerships in places \nwe may have overlooked in the past. The most logical place, in my view, \nto start that review is Latin America.\n  For too long, American policy has treated Latin America as our \nbackyard, and our policies toward the region have run the spectrum from \nshortsighted and unsophisticated to arrogant and paternalistic. The \nnarrative of our relationship has been based on the negative, often \nignoring and glossing over the important economic, political, and \nsocial advances that have been made in the region. The truth is that \nLatin America is not our backyard at all but part of our common \nneighborhood. We share far more than a hemisphere with our neighbors in \nthis region. We share a common history, common goals, common \nopportunities, and a common future.\n  From my time as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic to \nmy current chairmanship of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee in the \nSenate, I have had the opportunity to watch this region change \ndramatically over almost the last half century. Thinking back over the \npast three decades of my service in the Senate, the progress in many \nways has been astounding, and it is time our regional policies \nreflected these changes.\n  Embracing these free-trade agreements is an important first step to \nachieve these goals. They will help to cement our regional partnerships \nand make important strides in shifting the story of the United States \nand Latin America from conflict to engagement, from division to \nempowerment.\n  I had the opportunity to visit almost every one of these countries in \nthe region over the last 6 or 7 months and have seen these changes \nfirsthand. In my conversations with numerous leaders and citizens, I \nhave come to see not just problems and conflicts but, rather, \nremarkable, positive changes and opportunities.\n  Panama, for example, has been a critically important strategic and \ncommercial partner of the United States. The United States, in fact, \nhelped Panama gain its independence, and in 1914, the construction of \nthe Panama Canal, as my colleagues will certainly recall, was \ncompleted.\n  Since that time, Panama has developed into an advanced economy based \non professional-level services and is currently a destination of $4.4 \nbillion worth of American goods. Despite its small size--3.4 million \npeople, smaller than the population of my State of Connecticut--Panama \nrates in the top 50 of our trading partners globally.\n  Panama has also made important strides in building democratic \ninstitutions. Over the last 20 years, five civilian governments have \nbeen elected. With each new election, its commitment to human rights \nand respect for the rule of law has grown stronger. Challenges, \nobviously, still remain, particularly in the areas of human \ntrafficking, violence against women, and increasing transparency in the \nbanking and financial sectors. But Panama has made progress--great \nprogress--and I am confident that the Martinelli government is \ncommitted to continuing this trend and to implementing solutions.\n  Mr. President, Panama is focused on becoming a financial and economic \nhub in Latin America. Passing the Panama Free Trade Act would give \nAmerican businesses access to Panamanian markets. Today, tariffs and \nbarriers remain on all goods and services sold in that country. By \neliminating those barriers and tariffs on the overwhelming majority of \ngoods and services, we could increase tremendously the job \nopportunities not only in my State but others around the country, and \nit would allow us to take advantage of the economic dynamism occurring \nin that country.\n  It is estimated upon implementation of a free-trade agreement with \nPanama, nearly 88 percent of U.S. commercial and industrial exports to \nPanama would become duty free, and Panama would be required to phase \nout tariffs on over 60 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports. This \nwould lead to more U.S. exports to Panama and more jobs at home in the \nUnited States. This is good news for American workers, for farmers, and \nfor small businesses and consumers alike.\n  Yet strengthening our partnership with Panama is not the only \nopportunity for increasing our engagement in Latin America. Our pending \nagreement with Colombia presents, as well, a chance to move forward in \nour renewed commitment to engagement and empowerment in Latin America. \nI believe this will have significant positive benefits over time.\n  Colombia has weathered a civil war that has lasted longer than most \nColombians have been alive. Fueled by narcotrafficking, this war has \nclaimed the lives of thousands of innocent Colombians, from farmers and \nshopkeepers to judges, elected officials, candidates, and community \nleaders, and has left countless more homeless in that country.\n  In fact, there are nearly 3 million internally displaced persons \nliving within the country of Colombia today. Colombia still must \nimprove its human rights protections and strengthen its commitment to \nthe rule of law, but great changes have occurred on the positive side.\n  I understand why, of course, some may question moving forward with \nthis agreement. I firmly agree we must not ignore these very real \nchallenges in Colombia. But I also recognize that tremendous progress \nhas been made in Colombia. I recently spent time there, as I did in the \nneighboring Andean countries, and the common belief is that great steps \nhave been made in moving in the right direction. Mechanisms are in \nplace today that will strengthen the rule of law, protect human rights, \nand Colombia recently held, as we all know, its most free and open \nelection in decades.\n  In just 1 weeks' time, Colombia will mark a historic, dramatic \ntransition to power from President Uribe to President-elect Santos. \nThis peaceful democratic transition is an important marker in \nColombia's history, and the President-elect has committed himself to \nstrengthening Colombia's judicial system and working to reduce violence \nagainst labor leaders and others.\n  The Colombian people have pursued a fresh start, and we must \nrecognize this and be willing to do the same. By passing the Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement, we have a historic opportunity to do just that.\n  This agreement, with its strong commitment to labor standards, \nenvironmental protections, and human rights will help shape Colombia's \ncourse to encourage its move toward a more open and democratic system \nand to build a relationship based on common values and not common \nenemies. This is an important opportunity that continues on the heels \nof the nearly 10 years of U.S. support for Colombia, including billions \nof dollars in aid through Plan Colombia.\n  Allowing this agreement to continue to languish now poses a \nsignificant roadblock, in my view, to continued reform in Colombia \nbecause it calls into question our Nation's commitment to a sincere and \never more important partnership. We need to act now, in my view, to \naffirm our commitment to the Colombian people, to show them that we \nrecognize the hard work they have done and to signal that the United \nStates will be a strong partner in their continued improvement.\n  Over the course of my career in the Senate, we have considered a \nnumber of trade agreements. I have evaluated each one, as I know my \ncolleagues have, on its merits. Some I have supported strongly, and \nmany others I\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nhave opposed just as strongly, including ones for Latin America. A poor \nfree-trade agreement can undermine very important protections for \nworkers, human rights, and the environment. So I opposed the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement much to my pain and disappointment. But \nthat was a weak agreement which did not deserve the support of this \nbody.\n  These two agreements are different because since May 10 we have \nstrengthened those labor protections, environmental protections, and \nhuman rights protections. I believe this agreement is deserving of our \nsupport. In the case of these two agreements, they are a commitment to \nour allies, and a signal to our friends that we value our partnerships \nand will continue to work with them to promote our shared values of \ndemocracy, the rule of law, and economic opportunity. As such, what \nthey represent is much more significant than simply the exchange of \ngoods and services between nations.\n  Trade agreements such as the ones before us represent opportunities \nto build long-lasting partnerships as well. I believe that is the case \nwith the Panamanian and Colombian agreements before us. With the \ninclusion of the provisions of the bipartisan May 10 agreement on \nlabor, environmental, and human rights standards, I believe we have \naddressed some of the most significant concerns about these two trade \nagreements. I also believe that because these trade deals and \nagreements have languished for so long, they have turned some \nopportunities into roadblocks to the success of our bilateral and \nregional relationships. It simply makes no sense to continue the delay. \nIt is time to pass these two trade agreements in order to help move our \neconomy forward as well.\n  Passage of these agreements is not just a good foreign policy \ndecision; they also make strong economic sense as well. Currently, \ngoods from Colombia and Panama flow north largely unhindered. Yet \nAmerican businesses and American workers and the jobs, products, and \nservices we provide are subject to significant duties and tariffs when \nwe export goods to the nations of Panama and Colombia.\n  For example, while the vast majority of goods from Colombia enter the \nUnited States duty free, American goods exported to Colombia face \naverage duties of 12 percent and, in some cases, as high as 20 percent. \nThis is costing America jobs and American business. If we implement \nthis agreement, we would eliminate many--as I mentioned earlier, almost \n90 percent--of these duties and tariffs on these services and products \nnationwide, and U.S. exports to Colombia would increase, we are told, \nby a projected $1 billion annually.\n  In 2009, more than $14 billion worth of goods were exported by \nConnecticut firms to markets all over the world. According to the \nlatest available data from my State--the Department of Economic and \nCommunity Development--Connecticut firms exported about $91 million \nworth of goods to Colombia and roughly $15 million of goods to Panama. \nConnecticut businesses export a variety of products to these nations, \nparticularly chemical products, manufactured machinery, transportation \nequipment, computers, electronic products, and paper goods.\n  Under the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, 80 percent of all consumer \nand industrial goods, which include the categories I just listed, \nbecome duty free immediately. In addition, 88 percent would become \nimmediately duty free once the Panama agreement is ratified as well.\n  What can this mean for the future? Well, certainly jobs. The \nInternational Trade Administration calculates that nearly one-third of \nall manufacturing workers in my State depend on exports for their jobs, \nand more than 4,000 companies engage in exporting some kind of products \nto these nations. Of those firms, 89 percent were small or medium-sized \nbusinesses--precisely the firms that President Obama's Export \nInitiative targets--that will be well positioned to take advantage of \nthese agreements once they are ratified. This means expanded economic \nopportunities for workers in our own country and businesses in our \nvarious States across the Nation.\n  The Panama and Colombia Free Trade Agreements were established over 2 \nyears ago. They have been the subject of intense scrutiny and public \ndebate. They have benefitted by the input of the Congress, through the \nhistoric May 10 agreement, which I described earlier, that saw the \ninclusion of binding, enforceable, and meaningful labor, public health, \nand environmental standards. These discussions have allowed the \nCongress and the American people to critically examine the importance \nof these trade agreements and our partnerships with these key allies.\n  I urge support of these trade agreements before us not in spite of \nour current economic situation but because of it. This recession \ndemands bold moves and innovation. It requires us to strengthen our key \neconomic partnerships and to expand into new markets where we can. Now \nis not the time to close our borders to nations with whom we already \nhave strong ties. History shows that erecting barriers to trade has the \npotential for deepening the global recession. Conversely, these \nagreements mean more economic opportunities for American workers and \nour families.\n  It is time for us to change the way we relate to the world, \nparticularly in Latin America. For too long we have used our \ndifferences in this region with our allies as an excuse not to act, as \na reason to disengage. These agreements offer us a chance to refresh \nthat paradigm, to make the United States a proactive partner in \nfostering economic opportunity by bringing us closer together and \npromoting our shared values.\n  It is time, in my view, for the United States of America to lead a \nglobal economic recovery. A small but important step down that road is \nthe passage of the Panamanian and Colombian Free Trade Agreements, and \nI urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to support these \nagreements. I hope we can do so before we adjourn this session of \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                            Education Reform\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the President of the United States made \nan important speech this morning. He spoke to the National Urban League \nCentennial Conference on Education.\n  Every speech a President makes is important, but this speech is \nespecially important, and I commend the President for his courage, for \nhis vision, and for his willingness to undertake the hard work of \nhelping children across this country learn what they need to know and \nbe able to do, and the competence with which he is doing that.\n  Let me be specific about why I say that. No. 1, the President began \nwith teachers. He extolled teachers. He said he wanted to lift them up \nas high as he could, he wanted them to be on the front pages of \nmagazines, and for us to dignify them in every way we could. But he \ndidn't back away from tackling the most important and the most \ndifficult challenge that any of us who have dealt with education reform \nhave found; that is, how do we reward outstanding teachers. Especially, \nhow do we tie that reward to student achievement? In other words, what \ncan we do to help reward and encourage those outstanding men and women \nwho help our children learn, particularly our children who are having \nthe hardest time learning?\n  All of us know a great teacher makes a great difference. The \nPresident said that himself. Each of us in the Senate knows that. But \nany of us who have, over the last several years, spent time trying to \nfind ways to reward outstanding teaching knows how hard it is.\n  I worked on it in 1983 when Tennessee became the first State to \nreward outstanding teaching. Not one State at that time paid one \nteacher one penny more for being a good teacher. They could make more \nmoney for being around a long time. They could make more money for \ngetting a degree. But they didn't make more money at all if the \nchildren were succeeding.\n  For a while that worked because we were able to capture women. They \nhad very few options and they became saints in the classroom and they \nwere our teachers. But in the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, women \nhad many options, and they took them. In the companies where they went \nto work, they were paid more for excellence. They made good salaries. \nAs a result, it\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nbecame more difficult to attract and keep outstanding men and women in \nour classrooms.\n  Governor Graham, who was later a Senator, tried the same thing in \nFlorida. Governor Clinton--later a President--was trying many of the \nsame ideas in Arkansas. Those were the 1980s. Every education meeting I \ngo to comes down to the same point: After you get past the role of the \nparent, the teacher is the center of it. Whether a child is a gifted \nchild or whether a child comes from a home where he or she does not \nhave breakfast, or whether a child comes from a home where he or she \nhas never been read a book until they are 7, whether a child needs to \nbe in school 12 hours a day or 8, on Saturdays or not, the teacher at \nthe center of the education of that school is the indispensable product \nand the best and most important part of a child's ability to achieve \nand to learn.\n\n  What the President has done--through the Teacher Incentive Fund that \nhe has continued to encourage, and through his leadership on the \nsubject--deserves credit and support from all Americans. I for one am \nhere to offer him that.\n  Second, he talked about charter schools. He is not the first to do \nthat either. I remember as Education Secretary on my last week in \noffice, in 1993, I wrote a letter to all the superintendents in America \nto encourage them to try charter schools. At the time they were the \ninvention of a few Democratic liberal reformers in Minnesota. There \nwere maybe a dozen charter schools at that moment. But charter schools \nwere simply ``start over'' schools. It was simply saying to a faculty: \nLet's start over. What if we took off the rules and regulations and \ngave you the freedom to do with the children who are presented to you \nwhat they need, so if you need to start at 7 in the morning and finish \nat 7 in the night, do it. If you need 2-hour classes, do it. If you \nneed 200 days a year instead of 180 days at school, do that as well. If \nyou need to learn during Easter holidays, do that.\n  Who are the beneficiaries of the charter schools? When they work, the \nbeneficiaries are most often the children who come from the most \ndifficult circumstances.\n  I can point to a charter school in Memphis I visited 3 years ago \nwhere it was an Easter holiday. The children there were ninth or tenth \ngraders. Instead of being on Easter holiday, they were studying for \ntheir advanced placement course in biology at the freshman or sophomore \nlevel. There was not any other school in Tennessee where children that \nage were studying advanced placement biology, especially during the \nEaster week break.\n  President Obama has done what President Bush did, what President \nClinton did, what Vice President Gore did, what I have done, what many \nothers have done, which is to say: Let's have independent public \ncharter schools and give teachers the freedom to do what they know how \nto do. The first thing is rewarding outstanding teaching. As the late \nAlbert Shanker, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, used \nto say: If we can have master plumbers, we can have master teachers, \nand we can pay them accordingly, pay them very well, and let's have \ncharter schools and give teachers the freedom to do what they in their \nown good judgment know to do.\n  The third thing the President talked about was high standards. That \nis also not a new idea but he has advanced it down the road very well. \nHigher standards are an indispensable part of a good education in \nkindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  The way I used to help Tennesseans learn about that was to say look \nat all these big new auto plants that are coming into our State. To get \na job there, you have to know a lot more today than you did when your \nparents might have worked there, or your grandparents. You have to know \nalgebra and statistics. You have to know English well to be able to \ncommunicate. In other words, the standards are high if we are going to \ncompete in the world and keep our high standard of living.\n  While a lot of work has been done by the Governors of the country \nthrough ACHIEVE, the President has advanced the idea of common \nstandards very well in the last 18 months, and he has done it in the \nright way. He has not said: Okay, I am the President; we will write it \nfrom Washington. That would have killed it--or at least I hope it would \nhave killed it. He didn't say that. He said let's create an environment \nin which States can make a difference and make their own choices, and \nStates, in surprisingly large numbers, are beginning to do that, in \nterms of reading and math.\n  The fourth area the President spoke about, and this is his own \ninitiative, is the Race to The Top. This is infusing one of the hardest \nthings that is possible to infuse in public education and that is \nexcellence. We have a democratic society. We are usually interested in \nleveling things. If we have five things, one goes to each person.\n  What is hard for us to do in government, and that means public \neducation as well, is to say let's reward excellence. Let's say to \nthose school districts or to those States or those teachers or those \nothers who are making the A-pluses and the A's and doing the best job, \nwe want to incentivize you to do that. He has found a way to do that. \nIt is a fair way. He has kept politics out of it. He has put money into \nit and he deserves credit for it.\n  Finally, he has picked a very good Secretary of Education. I said \nwhen Arne Duncan was appointed that he might be the President's best \nappointment. I still think that. That is not because I agree with \neverything Arne Duncan has recommended. In fact, I think he was \ncompletely wrong about the student loan takeover. I think his proposal \non gainful employment, which is an obscure higher education thing and a \ndifferent subject, is, with all respect, a little wacky. But what I \nthink is he is an excellent leader for education, and he has a big \nheart and he has worked in a bipartisan way, and he has gotten results \nthat are as good as anybody could possibly have gotten on some of the \ntoughest subjects facing our country.\n  The President and Arne Duncan deserve our applause and support for \ntheir efforts. We will have differences of opinion about how much we \ncan spend and when we can spend it, but if the goal is to reward \noutstanding teaching, to create more charter schools, to help States \nraise standards in an environment where they are not told to do so by \nWashington, but create an environment to do it themselves; if the goal \nis to infuse excellence into public higher education by challenging \nStates to do better, then we should be for that and we should do it \ntogether.\n  I think President Obama has the opportunity in public education to do \nwhat President Nixon did in China. It may be easier for a Democratic \nPresident to make these changes or to lead the country in these changes \nthan it would be for a Republican President, just as it was easier for \na Republican President in the early 1970s to cause us to have an \nopening to China. That is a large claim to make but I think it is an \nequally important goal.\n  About the only thing I disagreed with today in the President's speech \nwas this. He said teachers were the most important part of a child's \neducation. I think a parent is and I think he does, too. I think he \nwould agree. I think parents and teachers are 90 percent of it and it \nstarts with the parent. The reason I think he would agree with that is \nbecause he had good parents and he is a good parent and a very good \nexample to the rest of the country.\n  Anyone who has read his biography, ``The Audacity of Hope,'' knows \nthe story of his mother getting him up at 4 o'clock in the morning in \nIndonesia and teaching him math and to read and telling him: Buster, \nit's not any fun for me so get busy and learn, and he learned very \nwell. His example as a good parent and good student is exactly the kind \nof example we need for students and parents across our country.\n  This is a time when we have differences of opinion on many issues. I \nwill have some differences of opinion with the President on education, \nas I mentioned. But I have no lack of enthusiasm for the importance of \nhis leadership on K-12 education, on rewarding outstanding teaching, on \ngiving teachers the freedom to create schools in which they can use \ntheir common sense, on creating high standards, on the Race to The Top, \non setting a good example as a good parent, and I thought it was \nimportant--perhaps especially for a Republican Senator who spent a \nnumber of years\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\nworking on these issues as Education Secretary and president of a \nuniversity and Governor--to come to the floor and say: Good work, Mr. \nPresident. An excellent address. And on those broad issues and themes, \nyou have my full support.\n  The President's remarks can be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/\nthe-pre\nss-office/remarks-president-education-reform-national-urban-league-\ncenten\nnial-conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I come for a few minutes on the floor. I \nam down here with Senator Wyden from Oregon, and I want to talk a \nlittle bit and probably in an informal way about a piece of \nlegislation, a bipartisan piece of legislation on tax fairness and \nsimplification.\n  There is one thing I hear a lot about when I go back home and when I \nwas running for office, when I was mayor, and serving in our city \ngovernment--how do you simplify the process of taxes, making them \nfairer for the middle class.\n  For all my time prior to serving in the Senate, I have thought about \nthese ideas and ways we can move forward. When I was mayor, we \nsimplified the business taxes for our small businesses, making it \neasier and simpler, lowering their tax burden, for our residents doing \nthe same thing.\n  Here I am in the Senate and I look at lots of legislation every day, \nas I know you do, Mr. President, and I know the Senator from Oregon \ndoes. We see all sorts of ideas created and put on the table, and one \nwhich intrigued me was the Wyden-Gregg bill, which is focused on \nsimplifying the tax paperwork mill, I call it, that we are subjected to \nevery single year as individuals; the mound of paper we have to fill \nout not only as an individual but as a small businessperson trying to \ngo through the rules and regulations and what is a reasonable amount of \ntaxation that we should pay; also, the complicated system in what is \nowed or hopefully refunded back to us because we overpaid the IRS.\n  As I looked at a lot of different ideas, I have to tell you this \nidea--as we debate here on the floor a small business plan, small \nbusiness ideas--sooner or later we will debate the Bush tax cuts and \nwhat we will do with those. To me, there is a simpler solution when it \ncomes to issues of taxation, what we are going to do lowering the tax \nburden on small business, lowering the tax burden on the middle class, \nand simplifying it. Today there are so many different things we have to \nworry about and focus on: multiple retirement accounts we are trying to \nbalance, trying to figure out who is a dependent, who is not, doing our \nreturns--how to simplify this so our life is less burdened by the IRS.\n  I want to first commend Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg for their \nwork in multiple years pushing this issue forward, trying to figure out \nhow we can help the middle class and the small business people of this \ncountry lower their tax burden; getting the IRS, as we would say back \nhome in Alaska, out of our pockets. They have done a good job.\n  If there is no objection from the Presiding Officer, if it is OK, I \nwill ask Senator Wyden to join me here with couple of questions. \nSometimes you look at these bills and you wonder are they too good to \nbe true. Here we have, if I am not mistaken, not only the Heritage \nFoundation and some of the more conservative groups as well as the more \nliberal groups, the Brookings Institution and others, commenting \npositively about this legislation. In my year and a half here I have \nnot seen that on anything.\n  We have Republicans and Democrats who are looking at it positively. \nWe have business groups that look at it positively because it lessens \ntheir burden and allows them to reinvest in their businesses, to grow \nthis economy. It reduces the deficit, which I know Senator Wyden, \nmyself, and others--like yourself, Mr. President--are concerned about--\nthe growing deficit and the burden it may lay onto future generations.\n  But it also has true tax reduction, tax relief for the middle class \nand businesses. When you see something such as that--and, by the way, \nyou can also do this in one page, a one-page return. When you hear \nthose kinds of things, those claims, you are wondering, What is the \ncatch? What does the small print say? What are you going to get hooked \ninto and pay a pretty good price for later? We have been going through \nit, I have been going through it. Actually when you first introduced it \nbefore I was a Senator, I looked at this legislation when I campaigned. \nHere I am now in the Senate with a chance to participate, to see what \nwe can do to accelerate this.\n  We are going to talk a lot about the tax extender bill and other tax \nissues in the future. But my view is it is time to reform the system. \nThe system is broken. The middle class is paying higher than they \nshould. Small businesses are burdened with incredible paperwork and \nincreased costs. It is time that we reform the system and do something \nthat is dramatic and makes a difference.\n  Today it is an honor to be down here. Senator Wyden, I hope doesn't \nmind; I have extracted off of every piece of his Web site every \ndocument related to this, the research to understand it, to make sure I \ndo not see that small print that later I might regret. So far what I \nhave seen is small print, big print, that I do not regret and that is \nwhy a few weeks ago I cosponsored the legislation to be one of those \nwho joined the team, to move us forward to real reform.\n  I know when I joined, Senator Bob Bennett from Utah also joined on--\nagain, focused on the same issues we are, again keeping it a \nbipartisan, fair, simplification of taxes.\n  No one likes to talk about taxes. No one loves to be around April 15. \nBut the fact is, it does occur. So how do we make the burden less on \nmiddle-class America?\n  How do we make the burden less on small businesses? This bill does \nit. So, again, I say to the Senator from Oregon, I wish to make sure I \nam saying the right stuff. So maybe the Senator could comment back to \nme. But it does have a positive impact. Correct me if I am wrong, but I \nthink the numbers, for example, on average for a small business, they \nare pretty much going to be guaranteed they are going to save at least \n$5,000 in taxes and more, depending on the size of their business.\n  For middle-class America, they are clearly going to save. Their rates \nwill be lower, which means their cash out of their pocket will be less \nto the IRS, meaning the IRS is not reaching in there, not only in your \nfront pocket but your back pocket. They will have less capacity to do \nthat.\n  Tell me, I hope I am right on this and I do not want to mislead--the \npublic is watching--but also make sure I am correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I especially appreciate his kind \nwords about a piece of legislation Senator Gregg and I sat for the \nbetter part of 2 years working on. I think everyone appreciates \ncolleagues supporting their legislation. I appreciate the Senator's \nkind words.\n  I think he is right with respect to the relief, and colleagues will \nsee that, whether it is the Heritage organization or the Brookings \nInstitution or the various analyses that have been done by other \ngroups. But I think it is especially important, even apart from our \npiece of legislation, that we get at the central question the Senator's \ntalking about, which is, the current tax system is broken. It is \nbroken, and we are not going to get the country where we need to go by \njust kind of tinkering here and tinkering there.\n  I wish to give a couple examples because I think the central question \nis, Are we going to make a break with a broken system and look forward \nor are we going to do what has been done year after year after year, \nwhich is to just to tinker with a broken system and cause more \nproblems?\n  Here is the heart of it. What we are seeing today is that every few \nyears there are thousands of changes in tax law. So that means all the \nsmall businesses--and you were a small business leader before you came \nto the Senate--all those small businesses, trying to compete in the \ntough global market, incredibly competitive markets, do not even have \nany certainty and predictability of what is ahead. They are not in a \nposition to be able to know what the Federal Government and \nparticularly the IRS is going do in terms of taxes, and that drains \nadditional chances for them to make changes in\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\ntheir production, in their workplace, productivity areas. It defies \ncommon sense. So the fact that there are these thousands of changes \nevery few years, in my view, is very antibusiness, and particularly \nantismall business.\n  Then, the second point that the Senator touched on deals with \nindividuals. The reality is, today, the current tax system is so \ncomplicated that most Americans do not even know when a tax break has \nbeen extended to them.\n  The Senator and I have talked about it. It seems to me Senator Begich \nmade the central point here. In the stimulus legislation, in the \nRecovery Act, there were $300 billion worth of tax cuts put into that \nlegislation--$300 billion worth of tax cuts. If we left today and \nwalked the streets in Anchorage or Portland or Gresham or wherever and \nasked people about the stimulus legislation, people would know \nvirtually nothing about any tax incentives.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I may interject.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Please.\n  Mr. BEGICH. That is actually right. One thing I thought, wow, $300 \nbillion tax relief, predominately for middle-class America. I thought \nmy phone would be ringing off the hook with people saying: Wow, what a \ngreat relief. If we got 1 e-mail on this out of the 1,000 or so e-mails \nand phone calls we get every single week, I would be surprised.\n  Because, as the Senator said, it is a complicated system we have, and \nwhen we do relief, no one will even notice it. That is why I was so \nattracted to Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg's proposal, because it is \nreform. It is changing the system for the better. It is ensuring that \nmiddle-class America, making sure small businesses benefit.\n  That is when I was shocked, actually. I know if I was back in the \nmayor's office when we did the small business relief, making sure 90-\nplus percent of our small businesses did not have to fill out the \npaperwork anymore and got relief, I heard from them because they were \nvery appreciative because they could reinvest it. But we made it real \nbecause we reformed it, not just tinkered with it as you talk about how \nthe past Congresses have done.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The other aspect of the Recovery Act, I think, that \nreaffirms this point with respect to the complexity is the Internal \nRevenue Service puts out what they call their annual ``oops'' list. \nThis is the list of the 10 most common mistakes made by taxpayers when \nfiling. The ``oops'' list released this past March included, for \nexample, one of the principal credits in the Recovery Act because \npeople simply were unable to figure out how to make it work on their \n1040EZ forms. So the fact is, the Tax Code today is anything but an \neasy system. It is quite the opposite.\n  To further support the point with respect to the complexity, this \nyear individuals and businesses are going to spend 10.6 billion hours \nto comply with the code. If the tax compliance sector were an industry, \nit would be one of the Nation's largest, requiring a full-time effort \nof 3.8 million people to get done that 7.6 billion hours.\n  The cost of compliance is jaw-dropping, $200 billion a year, 15 \npercent of all tax revenue the IRS collects each year. So the point of \nthis is, we are at a fork in the road. We can either look to the kind \nof approach that a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, and a number of \nDemocrats talked about one-quarter century ago and move in and drain \nthe swamp, Democrats and Republicans together, taking on these special \ninterest groups that have hijacked the Tax Code or the Congress can \ncontinue, as Senator Begich has said, to keep fiddling with one \nprovision or another, making the Tax Code even more complicated, \nrunning what amounts to a full employment program for tax preparers or \nwe can take steps that will make the code fairer and more progrowth.\n  I also think it is worth noting that in the last round of tinkering, \n2001 and 2003, for much of that period we had stagnant economic growth. \nSo we were not doing what the country needed in terms of fairness for \nthe middle class, nor was the country doing what was essential in terms \nof promoting more high-skill, high-wage jobs.\n  You and I know, for example, if you take away the tax breaks for \nshipping jobs overseas, you can use that money to lower the cost to \nmanufacture in this country. I see Senator Casey. He comes from the \nState of Pennsylvania. He has done terrific work because I have heard \nhim on the floor talking about the importance of manufacturing.\n  This is one of the issues relating to the question of tax reform. \nRight now there are tax breaks in the code that reward companies for \nclosing U.S. operations and moving them overseas. Why would not \nDemocrats and Republicans want to go to a more simple system, as \nSenator Begich is talking about? That would be in the interest of \nfairness for all but also one that is likely to create more good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and other parts of the country, by \ntaking away the tax break for shipping the jobs overseas and use those \ndollars to hold down costs for manufacturing red, white, and blue here \nin the United States. So I am very much appreciate Senator Begich \ntaking this time. He has been awfully kind with us. I appreciate the \nkind words about the bill and having him on it. But I especially \nappreciate him outlining what this problem is all about in terms of \nstarting--with getting beyond the tinkering and the complexity to real \nreform that works for all Americans.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BEGICH. To the Senator from Oregon, I will close and say thank \nyou very much. It is kind of like the Senator said, a fork in the road. \nIt is a moment. We can continue to do business as usual, tinker with it \na little bit here, a little bit there, have special interests kind of \nrun the show or we can turn it back to the American people by helping \nthem keep more money in their pockets, helping small business keep more \nmoney in their pockets. Let them invest in the economy, as the data \nthat I have seen around this can show, that over a 10-year spread, you \nwill add over $2 trillion to the GDP, based on small business \nreinvesting those dollars instead of the IRS grabbing them from them.\n\n  This is a positive step. I do think, I hope as our colleagues--a \ncouple of them are on the floor and we will stop in a second so they \ncan get their time to do their presentations. But I know and I hope \nother colleagues are watching and listening because this is a moment \nmaybe in this body that we can actually do some significant reform in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I do not sit on Banking. I do not sit on Finance. Some people have \nasked me: Well, if you are not on those committees, why are you \ninterested in this? Well, simply because it has a simplification of the \ntax return system. It lowers middle-class taxes and those on small \nbusiness. That is what drives this economy. That is what we should be \nfocused on.\n  So I credit these Senators for stepping up, kind of plowing the field \nin a way. I am a latecomer to this. But I am going to be one of those \nwho is taking that plow and putting a high-speed engine on it so we can \nkeep plowing more and getting more folks, hopefully, on board. So, at \nthe end of the day, the American people can look at this Congress, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and say: They did something that reformed \nthe system, made it simpler in our lives, saved the middle-class \ntaxpayer money and improved and lowered the taxes for small business.\n  Now the business economy is humming along and investing those dollars \nto grow this economy and keeping those jobs right here in the country.\n  So thank you for allowing us a few minutes to, hopefully, start to \nengage the Congress as we move into tinkering with the Tax Code, so we \ndo something different and we reform the Tax Code for the betterment of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Aviation Subsidization\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the discussion I was \nhearing. I would also like to draw attention to an issue that I think \nis about the most important to our Nation. We recently won a major \ntrade case against the European Union and their subsidization of \nAirbus.\n  This is an effort by the European Union, over a period of 30 years, \nto buy their way into the large commercial aviation marketplace. They \ndid so. They did so successfully. They drove out two major U.S. \ncompetitors, McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed-Martin, drove them out \ncompletely. They do not even make those big jet airliners\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nanymore, and they had Boeing on the ropes.\n  Airbus took more than half the market share globally in the large \nairliner business. The U.S. Trade Representative's office, over a \ncouple different administrations, pursued Airbus's subsidization. We \njust won this case, a multibillion dollar trade subsidy case that we \nwon against the Europeans and their subsidization of Airbus, taking \nmarket share in the large commercial airliner business in an illegal \nfashion, illegally subsidized.\n  Now we will go into the damage and remedy phase. But we won the case, \nand it is a massive case. The reason I am raising this to my \ncolleagues, my colleagues all know about, is a similar setting is \nstarting in the small aircraft market, general aviation market. It is \nstarting in the business jets, the small airplane business.\n  This is a U.S. homegrown business, it is centered in my State in \nKansas. It is a great business. It provides connection throughout this \ncountry and increasingly throughout the world. There are 5,000 airports \nin the United States; only 500 of them have commercial service.\n  So the other 4,500, I guess you ride a bike to if you do not have a \nbusiness jet or an airplane to get people there. Eighty-six percent of \nthe passengers on those business jets or airplanes are mid-level sales, \nengineers. They make connections in between their various properties as \nthe company operates. They make them much more efficient within that \nbusiness.\n  But what is taking place today is this homegrown general aviation \nbusiness in the United States that is a major exporter, recently cited \nby a major study by Brookings that this is a major export cluster, 40 \npercent export that we do in general aviation, the small business jet-\nairplane market is now under targeted attack by other countries to take \nthis business away from the United States, the same way Airbus, \nsubsidized by the European Union, took that market share away from the \nUnited States.\n  Instead of going after the big airliners, they are going after the \nsmall jets, the small airplanes. Several countries are lining up to do \nthis. This is one of the major challenges facing general aviation \ndomestically--foreign countries targeting this industry, which has \nhigh-wage, high-scale manufacturing sets of jobs. Various governments \naround the world are lining up and preparing programs with various \nmeans of support for their domestic aircraft industries, in research \nand development, sales and export financing, as well as certification \nof new aircraft, very similar to what took place in Airbus taking over \nthat market share that they did.\n  In that situation, you had large companies fighting against a \ngovernment operation, and they had, in some cases, deep enough \npocketbooks to last, such as Boeing did. Lockheed-Martin, McDonnell-\nDouglas did not and were driven out of the field. My great fear in this \ntargeting of general aviation, of the smaller business aircraft market, \nis that they are going to have countries behind them, companies in \nthose countries are going to push forward and they are going to take \nthe market share away and they are going to be aggressive and it is \ngoing to happen rapidly if we do not get out in front of it and stop \nthese other countries from doing this subsidization.\n  It is absolutely critical to engage this competition now, that we \nstop it now, that we start the investigation of foreign governments' \nillegal subsidization in the general aviation market now, and that we \nget on top of this now, before it goes on 10, 20 years, as it did with \nAirbus, and we drive U.S. businesses out of the field.\n  One country in particular I wish to draw attention to, and one \ncompany. The country in particular is Brazil. It has made a strong \ncommitment to expanding its presence in this market, the general \naviation market, through Embraer, one of Brazil's largest exporters and \nemployers. Embraer has made it a strategic focus and publicly stated \nits goal in 2005 to become ``a major player in the business aviation \nmarket by 2015.'' That was their statement in 2005, so they are 5 years \naway.\n  How have they done? After entering the business aviation market in \n2002, Embraer has been involved in a massive program to develop \naircraft for this market segment. They have experienced unbelievable \ngrowth and have rolled out a full product line of new jets, including \nthe Phenom 100 and 300, the Legacy 600 and 650, and the Lineage 1000. \nBeyond the staggering numbers of models Embraer has introduced since \n2002--in 8 years that number of product introduction--it is now \nresponsible for around 14 percent of all global sales of business \naircraft.\n  Again, this is a U.S. homegrown business. This business didn't exist \noutside of the United States before we started it many years ago. It is \nheadquartered in my State in Wichita, the air capital of the world. \nWhat they have done since 2002 is get 14 percent of the market share \nfrom a start position, a cold start position. This is quite an \nunbelievable feat for a company that has only been manufacturing \nbusiness aviation for a little over 7 years. That is phenomenal. It \nalso, I suspect, was done illegally and subsidized by the government. \nAt the same time, Embraer continues full speed ahead toward its goal of \nbeing a major player in the business aviation market.\n  U.S. manufacturers during this same period have had to delay or \ncancel new program starts due to challenging market conditions. I don't \nneed to remind Members what has happened since 2008. It has been a \nhorrific market condition. In my State, we have had huge job losses and \nsales in the business aviation field since 2008. We had a nice period \ngoing into 2007. We were up to 40 percent international sales. \nInternational sales helped us a lot because previously we sold 90, 95 \npercent of the market domestically, so that's a nice expansion in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Since that period, 2007 moving forward, this has been a downward \nmarket. In that period, Embraer has moved up to 14 percent and \nintroduced a whole new cross-section of planes. As someone who has seen \nsimilar signs in the past that were later proven to be the result of \nillegal subsidization of aircraft by the EU, this activity by Embraer \nand the Brazilian Government and growing market control does not seem \npossible without heavy and creative government support across the \nboard. It does not seem possible to have done that in this market \ncondition, in this atmosphere, in that short a period of time by a new \nstartup company that hasn't been making these aircraft for more than 7 \nyears. That was the similar sort of trajectory Airbus went on when it \nhad heavy and creative government subsidization to go into a \nmarketplace they had not been anywhere close to in the past. That's \nseven years, now 14 percent of the market share by Embraer, starting \nfrom a dead start. There is heavy illegal subsidization.\n  I urge the President to look into this matter through the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office, the International Trade Commission, to start \nan investigation into what I believe is illegal subsidization. Let's \nget the factual setting established.\n  We now see what they have accomplished in this period, I believe, \nthrough illegal subsidization. We need to get the International Trade \nCommission and the U.S. Trade Representative's Office focused on what \nneeds to take place; otherwise, what will happen is Embraer will \ncontinue to grow in its market presence, taking over more and more of \nthe global and U.S. domestic market. It will drive weaker incumbents \nout of the field in the United States, as happened in the large \naviation market. We will lose export share. It will encourage other \nentrants such as the Chinese to come into this marketplace, possibly \nthe Japanese as well in subsidized ways, illegal government \nsubsidization into this marketplace that has high-wage, high-skill \nmanufacturing jobs that we should be doing in the United States and not \nallow to be stolen by foreign treasuries to other places around the \nworld.\n  We have to do this and get in it before they do what Airbus and the \nEU did to the large market which is to drive Lockheed Martin and \nMcDonnell Douglas out of the business. While we were sitting here \nsaying: We think maybe there is a problem, there might be a problem, \nthere was a huge problem, a huge illegal subsidization by the \nEuropeans. But we didn't get on top of it until two major U.S. \ncompanies were completely driven out of the business. Let's not let \nthis be repeated.\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\n  As my colleague from Kentucky loves to say: There is no education in \nthe second kick of a mule. We have seen this play before. We have seen \ncountries go after key market segments in the United States. If we are \nnot aggressive in confronting it, it goes on until we do. I hope my \ncolleagues will look at this. There are two actions we can take near \nterm with the International Trade Commission, starting the \ninvestigation in this particular case with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office, starting to raise this issue, particularly \nwith the Brazilians but also other countries. Now is the time to do it, \nnot 5 years later after U.S. companies have been driven out of the \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Clean Energy Jobs\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \nprovision in the new Clean Energy Jobs and Oil Company Accountability \nAct just introduced by the majority leader which would require public \ndisclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals used in natural gas \ndrilling. The bill itself will have a number of important benefits \nwhich I will highlight before getting into the issue I rose to speak \nabout.\n  This legislation will create at least 150,000 jobs and save millions \nof consumers up to $500 annually. Second, it will hold BP accountable. \nA lot of Americans are waiting for that accountability. Third, it will \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil and create up to 550,000 jobs. \nNext, it will protect the environment by providing full funding for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund over the next 5 years. Finally, the \nbill will protect taxpayers from any future oilspills. That is the \noverall bill itself.\n  I wish to speak about a provision included in the bill as it stands \nnow. I thank the majority leader for his leadership on energy issues \nfor many years but especially, as our leader, for his work on efforts \nto combat global warming, pollution, and certainly for his leadership \nin putting together this new piece of legislation. I thank him for \nincluding important language in the bill as it relates to natural gas \ndrilling in places such as Pennsylvania.\n  The language in the bill amends the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-to-Know Act, which was designed to help local communities protect \nhealth, safety, and the environment from chemical hazards. It would \nrequire well operators to disclose to the State and the public a list \nof the chemicals used in each hydraulic fracturing process, including \nchemical constituents but not the proprietary chemical formulas the \ncompanies are so concerned about.\n\n  This bill also includes the chemical abstract service registry \nnumbers and material safety data sheets. If a State does not have a \ndisclosure program in effect, the disclosure would be made to the \npublic itself. This provision would also require disclosure of a \nproprietary formula or chemical constituents to a treating physician or \nnurse in an emergency situation. That is a narrow exception to the \ngeneral disclosure rule.\n  This is about something that is critically important to the people of \nPennsylvania and people across the country. In order to extract the gas \nfrom the Marcellus shale which lies beneath large portions of \nPennsylvania and several other States--of course, there is shale \nformations--the gas industry uses a process called hydraulic fracturing \nor, by the shorthand, fracking, as it is known colloquially, whereby \nabout \\1/2\\ million or more gallons of water, sand, and chemicals, in \ncombination, are injected at very high pressures into underground rock \nformations to blast them open and increase the efficiency of the wells.\n  Each well must be fracked multiple times, really hit with that \ncombination of sand, water and chemicals in order to release the \nnatural gas from the shale. Then, of course, the gas is captured and \ncan be used as an energy source.\n  The explosive growth of natural gas wells in Pennsylvania in many \nincidents involving some of these wells highlights the urgent need--I \nthink that is an understatement--for disclosure of the chemicals used \nin hydraulic fracturing. Pennsylvanians and people across the Nation \nhave a right to know what is being injected into the ground at \nthousands of sites throughout the country.\n  Fracking fluids are believed to contain toxic chemicals. These \ncompounds are kept secret from the public as proprietary information. \nHowever, even low concentrations of toxic chemicals can have adverse \nhealth and environmental consequences.\n  We all know the history of our Nation as it relates to the extraction \nof a natural resource. Pennsylvania has a history as well. We have \ndeveloped our natural resources to power the region and, indeed, the \nNation from the first commercial oil well, the Drake well near \nTitusville, PA, in the 1850s, to western Pennsylvania's production of \nnatural gas and, of course, most notably, Pennsylvania coal. We have \nused that coal and other sources of energy but especially coal to \nprovide electricity throughout the State and throughout many States in \nthe Nation. We have been a producer of a resource which has helped to \nlight and heat the country.\n  Pennsylvanians are proud of that contribution. We are also proud of \nthe way we have been able to balance the need for that resource and the \nbenefit with what happens to our environment and our quality of life. \nHowever, before our State did the right thing in striking that balance, \nwe did create a number of environmental legacies that we should not be \nproud of. Most were created in previous generations when Federal \nregulations that promoted responsible development did not exist. We \nknow that history. We know it all too well. We cannot make those \nmistakes again in Pennsylvania or anywhere around the country when it \ncomes to the benefit and the burden of having a resource under the \nground.\n  Natural gas has played and will continue to play an important role in \nour energy portfolio as we transition to a new energy future, and we \nare fortunate to have domestic sources to help us meet our growing \nneeds.\n  Pennsylvania will develop the natural gas in the Marcellus shale, and \nwe should. But we should also make sure we develop the Marcellus shale \nusing the best practices to protect our communities and our people. We \nhave to get this right. The good news is that we have a lot of \nknowledge and information and research and technology and good-old \nAmerican ingenuity and can-do spirit to get it right. Those old, false \nchoices we used to debate all the time years ago--about choosing jobs \nover the environment, about choosing economic prosperity or great \neconomic opportunity over quality of life and health and safety--are \nlargely part of our history. But we have to make sure we get this \nright.\n  It is not just underground sources of drinking water. That has been \nmy main concern when it comes to this issue. What happens to \ngroundwater or drinking water with all of this hydraulic fracturing \ngoing on? And the EPA, of course, is in the midst of a study. But it is \nnot just a concern I have about underground sources of water. There \nhave been cases where this fracking fluid--again, a combination of \nchemicals and sand and water and millions of gallons of it in one small \narea, in one geographic area--that those fracking fluids have, in fact, \nspilled on the ground.\n  The language in this legislation will require that the natural gas \nindustry provide complete disclosure of the chemical composition of \nhydraulic fracturing materials to ensure that if drinking water \nsupplies, surface waters, or human health is compromised, the public \nand first responders will know exactly--exactly--what they are dealing \nwith.\n  The intent is not to stop hydraulic fracturing, and this disclosure \nlanguage is not going to stop it, despite what we have heard in the \nlast couple of days here in Washington and around the country. I would \ncategorize some of that language, some of that hysteria from the \nindustry as a lot of hot air and not a lot of truth. The provision that \nis in this bill that relates to the fracturing process simply requires \nwell operators to disclose what chemicals they are releasing \nunderground in our environment. What is so problematic or troubling \nabout that? Let me read that again: requiring well operators to \ndisclose what chemicals they are releasing underground into our \nenvironment. That is what we are talking about.\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\n  We know companies, such as big soft drink companies, over many \nyears--Coke and Pepsi--have put their ingredients on their soda cans \nwithout revealing their so-called secret formula. This is a lot more \nserious. This is lot more serious business. So for the life of me, I \ncannot understand--I really cannot, try as I might--why would oil and \ngas companies oppose this? What are they afraid of? If the chemical \ncomposition--the chemicals that are used in the process are not harmful \nor cannot compromise health and safety or contaminate drinking water or \ncompromise groundwater or put the public at risk--if that is all OK, \nthen why can't we shine the light of disclosure on it? What are they \nopposing here or the better question is, I guess, why? Why would they \noppose this kind of disclosure?\n  This is very simple--not complicated, very simple. We do this in \nAmerica. When we are getting it right, we disclose information to give \nthe public the information they should have a right to expect about \nwhat is happening underneath the ground, underneath their own homes or \nin their communities. This is not a well every couple of miles. There \nare thousands of these--thousands--across Pennsylvania and a lot more \nacross the country. In the next year, there will be thousands more just \nin Pennsylvania.\n  So I think it is a simple matter of citizens having the right to \nknow. You have heard that expression before, that line, that commitment \nwe have made, that value of having information--the right to know about \nany risks in their communities.\n  We have had some good news lately. One major company has already \nannounced it will voluntarily disclose hydraulic fracturing chemicals \nused in each of its wells on a well-by-well basis. The chairman of the \ncompany, when they made the decision, said:\n\n       It's the right thing to do morally and ethically. . . .\n\n  Those are not my words; those are the words of the leader of Range \nResources. So if companies like that are willing to provide some \ndisclosure--now, we have to check and double-check that disclosure is \nequivalent to the disclosure we are talking about here, and we will do \nthat analysis--but if he is speaking in that way and using that \nlanguage, I do not know what the others are all worried about. There is \na lot of worry here by the industry.\n  If the development of the Marcellus shale and other shale formations \nis carried out in a manner that fully protects the environment and \nhuman health, then I believe the economic benefits for Pennsylvania and \na lot of other States can be achieved without environmental costs.\n  So I hope we can kind of lower the rhetoric and speak forthrightly on \nthis issue. But I will tell you, what I have heard over the last \ncouple, 2 days or so or over the last couple of hours is really \nhysteria, and I think we have to make sure we do everything possible to \nget this right--have the economic benefits from this, the job creation \npotential, but make sure that when we are creating jobs and enlarging a \nnew industry, we do not compromise the environment and we do not \nthreaten health and safety.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am going to speak for some time and \ntry and reengage this debate. We had an excellent debate this morning \nbetween 9:30 and 12:30 trying to find a way forward on a very important \nbill, the small business bill. This is the Main Street bill we have \nbeen working on. As you know, Madam President--you are a member of the \nSmall Business Committee--we have been working in good faith up until \nthe last few hours. It has been a good effort on both sides. I am \nhoping in potentially the next few hours we can work through this \nbecause we are extremely close on a very important bill for small \nbusinesses in America and for Main Street.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to clarify a few things. Many people \nare following this debate. They heard the minority leader say that he \nwas upset and some of the Republican Members were upset that they had \nnot quite gotten amendments on this bill. That is a charge that needs \nan answer.\n  I want to go over, again, this bill and point out how many amendments \nare already included in the underlying bill that were offered by the \nother side, by Republican Senators.\n  I had in the last few hours several of my Members on the Democratic \nside say to me: Gee, Mary, I didn't realize there was so much in the \nbill and how good the bill was, but I didn't understand how many \nRepublican provisions are in this bill.\n  I want to take a minute, because the minority leader has made a \ncharge that Democrats have been heavyhanded--it does not sit well with \nmany of us who have a fairly light glove here. I don't think anybody \nwatching this debate over the last couple of weeks, or even as it has \ngone through the iterations of the past year, can say we are trying to \nhave a heavy hand. We are trying to get a bill that is important to the \n27 million small businesses closed, finished, and delivered to them.\n  The fact is, the longer we stay here without coming to some terms, \nthe harder and harder that gets. As the 70 organizations that support \nthis bill most certainly understand, there is a risk because not every \nbill that every Member can think of is going to pass in this Congress, \nbut they are going to think this is a bill that has a lot of support, \nwhich it does, and they are going to think: This bill is going to get \npassed, so I am going to add my amendment, I am going to add my \namendment, I am going to add my amendment.\n  If we do not hurry up and get this done--you can kill a bill in a lot \nof ways. One way you can kill it is put too many amendments on it and \nit is too heavy to carry itself. The small businesses do not deserve \nthat. I said 100 times on this floor, they are already carrying a heavy \nload. They are carrying more regulations. They are carrying a weakened \neconomy. They are having to lay off employees, and in a small business, \nit is like laying off family because these businesses are having to say \ngoodbye and hand pink slips to people they literally know well and \nlove. It is hard to fire anyone but particularly upfront, close, and \npersonal, like this is happening.\n  I want to put up one chart--the lost business chart--to make this \npoint. I know that Members are clear, but this is according to the \nNational Employment Reports. This is jobs lost by firm size. Small \nbusinesses, which are defined by businesses 500 or less--that is the \nofficial definition: 81 percent of the job loss has been absorbed by \nsmall businesses. They have laid off people.\n  When people ask the question, How do we get this recovery engaged, \nhow do we make this recovery successful, how do we get jobs attached to \nthe recovery as opposed to just money--we know the big businesses have \nmoney. They are sitting on it. It has been widely reported. We know \nWall Street has money because they just paid $1.8 billion in bonuses to \ntop executives, the money we gave them. We know they have it. The \npeople who do not have the money are the small businesses.\n  That is what this bill is for, to help them in many different ways, \nvoluntarily lay out some things they can choose. This is not government \ntelling them what to do. They can choose. They can choose to take part \nof the $12 billion tax cuts we are providing them. They can file for \nthose tax cuts. If they want to, they can get the tax cuts. They can \napply for the lending program.\n  Eighty-one percent of the jobs are lost by small businesses. If we \nwant jobs, I suggest we focus on small business. That is what this bill \nis. For a year and a half, we have been pulling this bill together.\n  I want to go over how many Republican provisions are in this bill. I \ndo not want my Democratic colleagues to get upset. I am taking some \nrisk because they could come to me and say there are more Republican \nproposals in this bill than Democratic proposals. But we tried to be \nvery fair.\n  Again, the 7(a) loans, an increase to $5 million, was a Landrieu-\nSnowe provision; small business trade export was\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\na Snowe-Landrieu provision; small business contracting was Snowe and \nMerkley, Crapo and Risch; small business management counseling, Senator \nSnowe took the lead on that amendment; Senators Snowe and Pryor took \nthe lead on small business regulation relief; Senators Kerry, Snowe, \nand Menendez, the 100-percent exclusion. You pay no capital gains. \nPeople on that side are talking about reducing capital gains from 20 \npercent or 15 percent. They are arguing it should not go up to 20 \npercent. This is 100 percent, zero capital gains. If you invest in a \nsmall business in America, you will pay zero capital gains. Zero. This \nis a bipartisan amendment.\n  Merkley and Lamar Alexander, a leader on the Republican side, the \nincreased deduction for small business expenditures; another Republican \namendment, the Snowe amendment, extension of section 179; another \nbipartisan amendment, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Johanns, Senator Brownback. These are Republican Senators.\n  For the minority leader to say this bill has not had Republican \ninput, this is the red line. I put down all of the sponsors of the \namendment so that the press and the groups that are following this \ndebate can see.\n  This is probably the most bipartisan bill we have taken up on this \nfloor in the last Congress and maybe in a long time, maybe a decade.\n  The leader would come to the floor and say: That is in the underlying \nbill, Senator. What we are talking about is amendments on the floor. I \nwill go through a few Republican amendments that were put in on the \nfloor.\n  The first bill the majority leader laid down was a bill that included \nthe lending fund. Senator Snowe and others objected. A Republican \nobjection was laid against that bill, so the lending fund was taken \nout. That was a Republican amendment. They were against the lending \nfund. It was taken out. We had to fight to put it back in.\n  Then Senators Snowe, Grassley, Enzi, Isakson, and Collins filed \namendment No. 4483 which adds the SBA Recovery Act extenders to the \nbill. That was not in the bill. I think these are Republican Senators--\nRepublicans Snowe, Grassley, Enzi, and Isakson. The last time I \nchecked, they were Republicans. This is another amendment they got in \nthe bill.\n  Then Senators Thune, Johanns, Coburn, Inhofe, and  filed amendment \nNo. 4453 to strip out the Small Business Lending Fund. That was agreed \nto. We have been fighting over this Small Business Lending Fund. They \nwant to strip it out. We are putting it back in with support from two \nRepublicans, maybe more as this debate goes on. We have two now. We won \nthat.\n  Then comes the substitute, the second one, with the SBA extenders in \nit and the lending fund is out. That is at least two or three \namendments, in addition to the underlying amendments, that Republicans \nput in this bill, both in the Finance Committee and the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  I hope no one tries to tell a reporter, either in Washington or back \nhome--because reporters are smart. They need to be listening, and I \nthink they are. I hope no reporter takes the line: Oh, well, the \nDemocrats were heavyhanded. They offered us no amendments, so we could \nnot possibly vote for the small business bill.\n\n  We are clear that there are many Republican amendments in the \nunderlying bill. We have made clear in the Record that to get us to \nthis point, there have been any number of Republican amendments either \naccepted or voted in or voted out. I have not mentioned one Democratic \namendment yet.\n  I am thinking we are doing fine. We are not being heavyhanded. We are \ngoing right along. We have an open vote, 12-hour debate on the Small \nBusiness Lending Fund, and we win with 60 votes. It is back in the bill \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  I know some people are opposed to it, but we have 70 organizations, \nincluding the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, Small Business Majority, manufacturers, heating \nand air conditioning--all sorts of organizations. I submitted for the \nRecord several times this long and impressive list.\n  In addition, we have the Community Bankers Association of Alabama, \nthe community bankers of Georgia, the community bankers of Illinois, \nthe community bankers of Kansas, the community bankers of Ohio, the \ncommunity bankers of Iowa--I could go on and on; the Independent \nBankers of America, the International Automobile Dealers. I don't know \nhow many other groups we can have to step up and say: This is the right \nthing to do. The Travel Goods Association, the Tennessee Bankers \nAssociation, the Virginia Association of Community Banks, National RV \nRetailers Association, Nebraska Independent Community Bankers. They are \nfor this lending program. They have been sitting on the sidelines \nwatching us give money to big banks, bailing out Wall Street, bailing \nout big car manufacturers in Michigan. These small banks are sitting \nout there saying to us: Don't you know we are out here, 8,000 of us? We \nare ready to do our job, roll up our sleeves, be a partner with you, \nand go to work getting capital to small businesses so we can have a \njob-filled recovery instead of a jobless recovery. We want a job-filled \nrecovery.\n  This is not about this recovery making a few fat cats richer. This is \nabout making the middle class stronger. It is about creating jobs and \nhope and opportunity for the broad middle class. I do not want to be \npart of a recovery that does not include that. It is not worth it.\n  So we created a fund that works with our community bankers and we \nstill can't get the Republican side to step to the plate and say it is \ntime to close this debate.\n  We have had a year and a half to talk and to think, and that is what \nthe vote was this morning. Every Democrat, I am extremely proud to say, \nvoted to say yes to Main Street. They gave a green light to go forward. \nEvery single Republican in this Chamber voted no against Main Street \nthis morning, which is why I am here, to try to pull up the shades here \na little bit and shed some light, under the guise that they weren't \ngiven enough amendments.\n  If I give them any more amendments, I am going to get in trouble with \nthe Democrats because I am the Democratic chair of the committee. I \nhave given more amendments to the Republicans than I have given to my \nown side. After a while, it is hard to convince our side, and my \nDemocratic colleagues have been so good. I have 10 Democrats who are \ndying to offer amendments on this bill--and some of them are relevant \nto the underlying bill--but they know the more time that passes the \nless likely it is we will get this bill passed, and they know how \nimportant it is.\n  I wish to say another thing about this, and hopefully the last about \nthis amendment situation, unless the minority leader says something \nelse--and he might this afternoon about amendments. I have in front of \nme, and every reporter also has this, the unanimous consent agreement \nfrom last night. Senator Reid offered four amendments--Baucus, Murray, \nanother Baucus, and then another Reid amendment. Four. Senator \nMcConnell reserved his right to object and he did object and then he \noffered eight. So that is where we are. We offered four, they offered \neight.\n  You would think, in the next few hours, that somebody could figure \nout around here how to split this baby and do six and get it done. I am \nhoping that is what we can do. We are running out of options. If six is \ntoo many, maybe we could agree to have no amendments, because we \nalready have so many, and pass this good bill that is already right \nhere on the floor. I mean, we do have a good bill already that has \nRepublican and Democratic amendments in it.\n  So the Democrats have offered four, the Republicans have offered \neight. Some of them are directly germane and some are indirect. It gets \na little confusing sometimes about what is direct and indirect. I am \nnot confused about farmers, but the Senator from Kentucky said today he \ndoesn't think farmers are small businesses. I think there are a lot of \nSenators who disagree with that. They do think farmers work hard, and \nmany of them are small business owners and operate small operations. I \nthink most people understand that those disaster payments that go to \nfarmers don't stay in their pockets that long. They go to pay out all \nsorts of vendors--seed companies, to pay down their tractor or their \nequipment bill. I think people understand,\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\neven though it has the title ``disaster aid,'' it actually is a small \nbusiness issue.\n  I heard the majority leader say that if the Republican leader \nobjected so much to that, even though Senator Lincoln worked so hard to \nput it in, we would take that out of this bill and find another way to \ndo that. But that didn't seem to be enough either. So I am going to say \nagain that I am so proud of the Senators who have worked hard on this \nbill--Senator Merkley, Senator Cantwell, Senator Murray, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Schumer--and Senator Durbin has been down to the floor--both \nSenators from Florida. I am hoping Senator LeMieux will do his very \nbest and I know he is continuing to work through the afternoon to talk \nwith his leadership, to say: Look, there are dozens of amendments \nalready in the bill. The only amendments that have been offered on the \nbill to date have been Republican amendments, either Republican \namendments by Senator Snowe to take things out or put things in or an \namendment by Senator LeMieux to put the lending fund in, the only \namendments.\n  The amendment Senator Lincoln put in the bill, without a vote, we \noffered to take that out to try to move this forward. So I hope \nreporters here and around the country will not allow a Republican \nSenator to say they just couldn't get to the small business bill \nbecause Democrats would not let them have amendments. The question is, \nDo they want to get to a small business bill or do they want to just \ncontinue to support big business, big corporations, and Wall Street?\n  That is the question. Do they want to get to Main Street? Do they \nwant to help Main Street? They have to show that by their votes--not \njust by their words but by their votes. In this business it is not \nwords, it is actions that matter, and the only action we have is them \nvoting no. No. I am trying to help them say yes. I know they want to \nsay no. That is what they think they should say to America: No on this, \nno on that. I don't think Americans want to hear no when it comes to \nhelp for small business. I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. I \nthink they want to hear yes.\n  So let's find a way. I am asking my colleagues on the other side to \nlook at their list of amendments again and see if there is some way \nbetween the numbers of two and four and eight we can find a way to move \nforward to help Main Street businesses.\n  Just so people understand, again, this bill that is pending before \nthe Senate--and I see the Senator from Michigan is here. I am hoping he \nwants to speak a minute about the provision he has. I am thinking in a \nminute we may have some word--I know the leadership is talking, and \nperhaps sometime in the next hour or so we may have something that has \ncome together. But I hope the Members are focusing on the importance of \nthis bill for creating jobs in America today, and that is what people \nwant. That is what we should have been focused on.\n  We have tried, in many different ways, through many different bills, \nbut this bill has $10 billion in tax cuts to small businesses--not to \nthe big businesses, not to Wall Street but to small businesses. It has \nso many helpful provisions, through the Small Business Administration, \nto give small businesses the support they need.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, would my colleague yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, who has done such an outstanding job here, is it not true \nthat we have heard many different numbers and types of amendments that \nshould be offered?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, it is true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is it not true that many of the amendments the other \nside wanted to offer had nothing to do with small business whatsoever?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. They were not an attempt to improve, modify or help \nsmall business but were to simply get us off the subject?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Isn't it true that yesterday or a day or so ago, when we \ndid the Citizens United bill, the minority leader was complaining that \nthe leadership was getting off the subject of small business to go to \nsome other subject? It would seem now, at least, that the other side is \ndoing exactly that. Is that an unfair characterization?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is a fair characterization.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is it not true as well that as chair of the committee, \nyou have offered them every opportunity and all kinds of amendments and \nall kinds of compromises in the committee before we got to the floor \nand now on the floor?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is absolutely true.\n  I say to the Senator, in some ways I have some trepidation of \ncontinuing to read this because I have had any number of Democrats come \nto me and say: But there are more Republican provisions in this bill \nthan there are Democratic provisions in the underlying bill. That is a \ncredit to Senator Snowe, I have to say, who worked so hard and does \nsuch a good job. But to come to the floor, I say to the Senator from \nNew York, that there are no Republican provisions in this bill, it is \nlaughable.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So it wouldn't seem, to me at least--and I am wondering \nabout your opinion--to be an unfair conclusion that what is going on is \nnot a dispute about which amendments or how many amendments, even the \nsubjects of the amendments, but that they don't want to pass a small \nbusiness bill that will help create jobs, for whatever reason.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. For whatever reason, I don't know why. I think maybe \nthey think that is good politics. But I don't believe it is, and I \ndon't think most Americans, even Republicans, would think that is good \npolitics.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the Senator from Michigan, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder, through the Chair, if I could inquire of the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee--unless the majority leader is \nseeking the floor.\n  I am trying to figure out exactly why it is that the Republicans, who \nover and over say they understand that small business is the generator \nof at least two-thirds of jobs and maybe more--in fact, I use a figure \nthat all the new jobs in this country were created by small \nbusinesses--but at least two-thirds. The Republicans, I think, believe \nthat small businesses are the creators and generators of these jobs. As \nI understand it, organizations that represent small business have \nendorsed this bill. The Senator from Louisiana has done such a great \njob of putting those together.\n  But I am trying to figure out exactly how it is that in the situation \nwhere the small business organizations--or those purporting to \nrepresent small business--have supported this bill and where \nRepublicans say, and I think believe, that small businesses are the \ngreat generators of jobs, that we are now in a position where, despite \nthose things being true, the Republicans are not letting us proceed to \na bill supported by those organizations. Is that where we are?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That seems to be where we are. That is why I said I \nfeel like I am ``Alice in Wonderland,'' because it is topsy-turvy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would hope the organizations which purport to support \nsmall business--and, by the way, the greatest complaint I get when I go \nhome, just about, other than the general one of where are the jobs, is \nthat credit is not available to small businesses that are creditworthy \nand have proven it over and over--never missed a payment, have \ncontracts that provide services or goods--yet can't get credit.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. You are absolutely correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This bill has provisions for credit to flow. The community \nbankers, as I understand it, are supportive of this bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would just hope that between now and the time the \nmajority leader moves to reconsider that vote that we would hear loudly \nand clearly from those organizations representing community bankers, \nrepresenting small businesses. Maybe they just have to say more loudly \nand clearly that this filibuster is wrong--wrong for Main Street, wrong \nfor the organizations they represent, whether it is community banks or \nsmall businesses.\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nIf the NFIB has spoken on this already, and if community bankers have \nspoken on this, I would hope they would speak a lot more loudly and a \nlot more clearly and a lot more forcefully.\n  This is the big job creator where I come from. I would just hope we \nwould hear more clearly and forcefully from those organizations between \nnow and the time the majority leader offers a motion to reconsider.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, through the Chair, I thank the Senator from \nMichigan because he is absolutely right. This is the wrong bill to \nfilibuster. I mean, you may get political points by filibustering other \nissues, but to filibuster a small business bill, to filibuster a Main \nStreet bill is not the way forward.\n  Again, I cannot stand here and allow any Member of the other side to \nsay there haven't been Republican amendments that have been accepted, \noffered. We have done everything to the point where there are almost \nmore Republican provisions than there are Democratic provisions in the \nbill, which is completely paid for and provides a $12 billion tax cut \ntoday.\n  I see the majority leader, and I will yield the floor in just 30 \nseconds, but I wish to repeat one thing that is worth repeating. The \nSenator from Michigan was a cosponsor of this. For 10 years, \nindependent entrepreneurs, sole entrepreneurs--and there are 20 million \nof them in America--have begged and pleaded to be on the same parity \nwith big corporations so they could get a little bit of a break on \ntheir health insurance. This is a big issue for 20 million Americans. \nYou know where it is? In this bill. Two billion dollars will leave the \nFederal Treasury and go into the pockets of every independent \nentrepreneur in America, and that side is standing in the way of that. \nI hope the reporters are following this carefully because the details \nare important.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I see the majority leader on \nthe floor. I think he may have a word or two to say.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                          [Quorum No. 4 Leg.]\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet (CO)\n     Bennett (UT)\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Goodwin\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     LeMieux\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed (RI)\n     Reid (NV)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We have before us the small business bill we have worked on \nso hard. As I went through the bill today, virtually every provision in \nthis is bipartisan, except some are strictly Republicans with no \nDemocrats involved. It expands access to credit for small business all \nacross America, cuts taxes for small business, and expands domestic and \nforeign markets for small business. This has the potential of creating \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. The reason for that is that most jobs in \nAmerica are small business jobs. Two-thirds of the jobs lost in America \nhave been from small business.\n  As I indicated today, I was disappointed that my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have not been willing to work with us. It seems to me \nthe goalposts were moved often, but I have been here a while and I \nunderstand how things work.\n  Last week, they requested; that is, the Republicans, that we give \nthem votes on three amendments.\n  We all know what they are now. Grassley has an amendment dealing with \nbiodiesel. Hatch has an amendment dealing with research and \ndevelopment. Johanns has an amendment to repeal the corporate reporting \nrequirement.\n  Earlier today, I propounded a unanimous consent request where we took \nout of the bill the issue relating to agricultural disaster and that we \nwould have the three votes I mentioned and we would have Democratic \namendments that would be opposite those, three in number. There was an \nobjection. I cannot understand why they, my friends on the Republican \nside, cannot take yes for an answer. It tells me and I think the \nAmerican public that it is more about something than getting votes. It \nseems they think it is more important to say no to votes on Democratic \namendments than say yes to helping small business. But I understand \nwhere we are, and I am working very hard.\n  I have had a number of conversations with my friends on the other \nside of the aisle about a couple of amendments we have that we want to \nbe voted on in opposition to the amendments offered by my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. A number of Republicans do not want to \nvote on those amendments as it relates to small business. I think that \nis unreasonable, but that is me. I accept their view that it is not \nunreasonable.\n  As I have talked with the Republican leader and a number of other \npeople, I am going to try my utmost--and I think I figured a way to do \nthat--to get the two amendments my friends did not want to vote on as \nrelates to small business off this bill. I am going to do everything I \ncan to do that in the near, foreseeable future.\n  But I say to everyone here: Let's take a little time over the next \ncouple of days to kind of cool down. This is important. I know we have \nargued and scrapped, as my friend the Republican leader said, a lot of \nthe time during this year. But let's do this legislation. This is not a \nvictory, if we can get this done, for the Democrats. This is not a \ndefeat for the Republicans. It is a victory for Democrats and \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nand Independents and the people who supply most of the jobs in America \ntoday--small businesses. That is why, if one can imagine, the chamber \nof commerce supports this bill. They are in favor of the Johanns \namendment, and I accept that. When I was here this morning, 80 \norganizations supported this bill. We are now well over 100. This has \ngotten traction.\n  This is something we should do. This is good legislation. It would \nset a very good tone before we leave for the August recess to do this \nbill because by the time we come back in September, there would \nactually be some jobs created as a result.\n  I renew my request that I made this morning. I am not going to read \nthis again. My request this morning was that we will take out the \ndisaster relief, and they, the Republicans, can have their three \namendments. We will have our three amendments. That is my request. I \nrenew that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nthink we are making some real headway. I appreciate the majority leader \ntaking out basically the appropriations measures. One was in the \nunderlying bill and the others were going to be offered as amendments.\n  I had not originally intended to offer a counter UC, but in order to \nreassure everyone--I know there is support on our side of the aisle if \nwe can get it right--I offer a counter UC which I suppose will be \nobjected to, as I will object to the majority leader's, for the \nafternoon.\n  But I want to underscore what he said, which is I do think we are \ngetting closer to getting back to the original bill which started off \non a pretty strong bipartisan basis and then seemed to deteriorate over \nthe course of the last month. In fact, we turned to the bill on June 24 \nand left it six times between then and now.\n  Having said all that, I think we are heading back in the right \ndirection.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions \nwith respect to the small business substitute and the bill be vitiated. \nI further ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the \nonly amendments in order to the Reid substitute, and there are four: \nJohanns amendment No. 1099, repeal; Hatch, R Grassley, biodiesel; \nSessions, spending caps. I further ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for the majority to offer relevant side-by-sides limited to the \nsubject matter of the above-listed amendments. And, as I said last \nnight, we are prepared to enter into reasonable time agreements on each \nof these amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object to my friend's proposal, I \nhave to smile, even though I have not smiled a lot today. On the \nSessions amendment, how many times do we have to vote on it? How many \ntimes? One of my friends on the other side of the aisle said: How many \ntimes do we have to vote on what you propose to vote on? Not nearly as \nmany times as this Sessions amendment. There has been a general \nagreement between the Republican leader and myself that we are going to \nwind up there basically anyway. I understand he has people he has to \nsatisfy on his side of the aisle. I do my best to satisfy people over \nhere. But I have to respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has declined to accept the \nRepublican leader's modification of his request.\n  Is there objection to the majority leader's request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6498-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6498-S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FAA AIR TRANSPORTATION MODERNIZATION AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I opposed the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe small business lending bill for several reasons, with the foremost \nbeing that it had become a vehicle for petty partisanship rather than a \nserious effort to extend a much-needed helping hand to America's small \nbusinesses.\n  The manner in which this bill has been deliberated in the Senate has \nbeen both frustrating and disappinting to say the very least. The \nmajority leader has brought this bill up for consideration and then \nmoved off of it to consider other matters no less than six times since \nJune 24. Furthermore, he has offered at least three different \nsubstitute amendments--each time filling the amendment tree and filing \ncloture--effectively choking off debate and prohibiting my colleagues \nand me on this side of the aisle from offering amendments.\n  This should not be a partisan bill. In fact, as originally \nintroduced, this measure enjoyed broad bipartisan support. The original \nversion of this bill included many positive provisions. For example, it \nincluded a number of tax provisions that had been championed by both \nRepublican and Democrats which both sides believed would help small \nbusinesses create new jobs.\n  The $30 billion fund contained in this bill was supposedly designed \nto provide capital to community banks and give them incentives to make \nloans to small business owners. While this is a nice notion, I have \nheard from some of the smaller, community banks in my home State of \nArizona that the capital requirements were so stringent that they would \nnot even qualify for the program and, there are serious concerns as to \nwhether or not this would turn into another bank bailout program.\n  One of the provisions of this bill that I strongly opposed was a \ncarve-out of $1.5 billion for agriculture disaster assistance which was \nnot requested by the administration. While I support ensuring that our \nfarmers are protected from financial losses caused by natural \ndisasters, Congress must first find a way to pay for this increased \nspending just like many of the other handouts included in this bill. \nThat is why many of my colleagues had hoped to offer amendments, \nincluding an amendment to extend expiring tax breaks for small business \nowners, an amendment to eliminate the death tax, and an amendment to \nmake permanent the tax credit for research and development--just to \nname a few. Unfortunately, the majority prevented us from offering \nthose important amendments.\n  I had planned to offer an amendment on border security that would \nhave helped generate sales tax revenue for border towns. The amendment \nwould have added an additional 6,000 new Custom and Border Protection \nagents and officers to secure the border and to ensure that those \nseeking to cross our borders legally at our ports of entry are able to \ndo so without unnecessary wait times. There are frequent, often \nexcessive wait times in the northbound lanes at the DeConcini/Port of \nEntry in Nogales. The economy of Nogales, AZ, is heavily dependent on \ncross border traffic, with the majority of the city's sales tax revenue \ngenerated by shoppers from Mexico. The long wait times to cross the \nborder are having real, adverse effects on the economy of Nogales. \nSecuring our borders should be the top priority of CBP and that the \ndrug related violence that threatens our border communities must be \ncombated with all available resources. With that said, businesses and \nlaw abiding citizens should be able to cross the border in an efficient \nmanner.\n  Our economic recovery and the creation of new jobs are the most \nimportant issues facing our nation today. We have an unemployment rate \nof 9.5 percent and we need to do all that we can to help our small \nbusinesses thrive. It is my sincere hope that we can end the partisan \nbickering and reach an agreement that will give our small businesses \nthe tools necessary to create jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6499-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to the proceedings that \nhave just taken place this evening and try to put them in some context.\n  What we have had before this Chamber is a bill that is very important \nto putting the American economy back on track. Lots of folks have \nlooked at the various chokepoints in our economy, and so many have \nfound that one of the critical issues is the access to lending by small \nbusinesses. That is a key provision in the bill before us--the ability \nto capitalize healthy community banks so they can make funds available \nto small businesses so small businesses can seize opportunities and put \nAmericans back to work.\n  There are many other terrific provisions in this small business jobs \nbill. They include, for example, a capital gains tax holiday that will \nassist small businesses. It includes a whole number of provisions, in \nfact, that stack up to $12 billion in tax reductions for small \nbusinesses.\n  This bill came to this floor in a bipartisan way, with many \nprovisions that were Republican provisions, some that were Democratic \nprovisions, bipartisan support out of committee. It is before us now, \nand the question throughout this day has been this: Are the Republicans \nblocking this support for small businesses because they are opposed to \nhelping small businesses and want to drive this economy back into a \ndouble-dip recession or do they have a legitimate concern that they \nshould get a chance to offer amendments on the floor of the Senate?\n  To put that issue to rest, our majority leader made the following \nproposal: Our colleagues across the aisle would get three amendments. \nThe Democrats on this side of the aisle would get three amendments. \nBoth sides get to choose the amendments they want to bring forward. \nThat is a legitimate debate about small business. That gives everybody \na chance to weigh in. That certainly addresses any procedural issue. \nWhat was the response of the Republican leadership? The Republican \nleadership responded and said: No, we want four amendments, and we also \nwant to control what the Democratic amendments are. In other words, we \nwant to have the say on eight amendments while the Democrats choose \nnone.\n  Of course, it becomes very clear: The Republican intent is not to \nhave a debate about taking our Nation forward and getting out of \nrecession; it is to block bills that will help our small businesses and \nput this economy back on track.\n  I say to my colleagues across the aisle, there is too much at stake \nfor this sort of outrageous political competition. Put your November \nthoughts aside, I say to my friends, and focus on what is right for the \neconomy of this Nation, what is right for the small businesses of this \nNation. Let's have the three amendments on each side as each side would \nchoose. Let's get it done, and then let's go home and know we are \nworking together in a problem-solving, bipartisan fashion to make our\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\ncommunities stronger, to create employment opportunities for our \nworking families, and to strengthen our economy as a whole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators on the \nfloor who wish to speak. I see the Senator from Michigan, who has \nindicated she would like to speak for a minute on this bill. I will \ntalk for the next 5 minutes, and others are going to want to speak as \nwell.\n  I commend the Senator from Oregon, who has been down here day after \nday explaining the value of this extraordinary bill that was put \ntogether through hours and hours and days and weeks and months of \ndebate in the Finance Committee and in the Small Business Committee.\n  I was very pleased to hear the leadership--although we came to no \nfinal agreement in the last hour, I am feeling and hearing, as the \nSenator from Oregon alluded, that perhaps we are moving closer to that \nopportunity because this bill was built with good will, with hard work, \nwith some smart and innovative ideas.\n  Just to say how proud I am of the effort, this is just a list of \nheadlines today that have come out in support of this bill. Some of \nthese headlines are questioning, is someone blocking this bill? What is \nhappening? Why can't we get this small business bill done? It is a good \nquestion.\n  So it is Thursday night. We have some time to continue to work. The \nproblem with the four amendments that were offered by the minority is \nthat they are not exactly offering side-by-sides to that, but it is \nbetter than eight. So we are making some progress. So I am going to \nstay on the Senate floor tonight and talk about the fact that this bill \nhas, if you count it, actually probably more Republican provisions than \nDemocratic provisions in the bill. They are all good.\n  As the majority leader said, this will be a great victory, not for us \nbut for the small businesses we represent. This will be a great step \nforward to turn this recovery into a job-filled recovery rather than a \njobless recovery because the only entities that will be creating jobs, \nMr. President, as you know, because you were a former banker, are small \nbusinesses.\n  I want to show the chart about the jobs lost to just repeat this. The \njob loss in America has been from small businesses. If people want to \nknow what happened to the 15 million jobs, what happened to the 10 \nmillion jobs, I will tell you. They ran out the front and back doors \nand out the windows of small businesses all over this country. If we \ndon't do something, either tonight or tomorrow or next week, they are \ngoing to go through another whole month and maybe longer.\n  We have been debating this for a year and a half. It is bipartisan. I \nbelieve we are coming to some conclusion, and I am very proud I have \nhelped lead a part of this effort. But I see the Senator from Michigan \nand one of the members of the Small Business Committee here, and I say \nto them that I think we are just speaking in morning business. So under \nthe previous order they can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues to again \ntalk about why it is so important that we pass this small business jobs \nbill that is before us.\n  I so much appreciate the leadership of Senator Landrieu to try to get \nthis bill through. She has stated so eloquently why it is important for \nus to pass this legislation. It has been pointed out that this is a \nbill that has significant input from our Republican colleagues. It has \nbeen pointed out that this is a bill that will go a long way toward \naddressing the jobs we need to create if we are going to bring this \neconomy back. She has stated so eloquently why it is going to be there \nto help so many small businesses.\n  Everywhere I go in New Hampshire, what I hear from the small business \nowners I talk to is that their No. 1 challenge is adequate access to \ncredit. This bill addresses that. It sets up a fund to help community \nbanks so they can lend to small businesses. It sets up a fund to help \nStates so they can go through their programs to lend to small \nbusinesses. It expands the SBA loan programs, which have been so \nimportant to keep small businesses afloat. It helps with export \nassistance for our small businesses--something they have had trouble \ndoing because they do not have the resources to be able to access \ninternational markets on their own. It provides $12 billion in tax \nbreaks for small businesses.\n  Right now, the only thing standing in the way of this bill being \npassed to help the tens of thousands of small businesses across this \ncountry is our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is \nunconscionable that we can't get the votes to pass this bill and to do \nwhat we need to do to help small businesses grow and create the jobs \nthat are going to help lead us out of this recession.\n  So I congratulate Senator Landrieu and all of my colleagues who are \nhere or who have spoken on this bill and who have worked so hard to try \nto get it done, and the people on the other side of the aisle who have \nbeen courageous enough to support aspects of this bill and to provide \namendments to it. I hope over the weekend they will hear from their \nconstituents about why this is important to get done so that when we \ncome back next week we will see a change in the perspective and we will \nsee the 60 votes that we need in this body to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I also want to start by thanking the \nchair of the Small Business Committee, the Senator from Louisiana. She \nhas done a remarkable job. Her tenacity and passion and commitment for \nsmall business and for this legislation has gotten us to where we are \ntoday, and I am proud to be joining with her in this effort, along with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, who just spoke, and the Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell, who has been such a champion, and the Senator \nfrom Oregon--both Senators from Oregon--and the many Members who have \ncome to the floor and colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nhave joined in particular provisions of this bill.\n  As the leader and the chair of the Small Business Committee has said, \nthis is, in fact, a bill that has significant pieces, if not the \nmajority of pieces, that have been bipartisan or have come from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Yet what we are seeing is a strategy by \nthe Republican leadership to continue to block and block and block, and \nto filibuster, filibuster, filibuster even something that is important \nfor Main Street.\n  This is not about Wall Street. This is not about a bailout to Wall \nStreet hoping that they will lend to small businesses, which didn't \nhappen after the crisis when credit markets froze up and lending didn't \nhappen, certainly, in my State of Michigan or across the country. So we \nhave had to come back and try a different route for Main Street, and \nthis is what this is about--Main Street, the folks who are creating the \nmajority of jobs which are in small businesses.\n  We also have a lot of folks who have lost their jobs and who are now \nstarting a small business. I know lots of folks in their forties, \nfifties, and sixties who have never been out of work before in their \nlives who are now out of work and are turning to a small business. They \nare going out in the garage or the basement or maybe the spare \nbedroom--maybe they are starting up a business with someone else--and \nthey are starting something new. The problem is they can't get a loan \nto get started. They can't get the capital they need, and that is \nexactly what this bill is about.\n  This is about a new partnership with community banks and small \nbusinesses to create a lending facility to open the doors to capital. \nIt is also about expanding what the SBA is doing.\n  Another very important provision of this addresses what happens when \npeople's assets go down in value. People are seeing a decrease in the \nvalue of their own property, whether it is their home, their business, \ntheir equipment, their commercial buildings, so that their collateral \nhas lessened and the ability for them to go to the bank and say: I have \nX amount of collateral to put up against the loan--now they are finding \nthat the value of that property has been cut in half and they can't \ncontinue their line of credit or they are not able to get the loan.\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\n  There is also an important provision in here that addresses a program \nthat actually started in Michigan, Mr. President, and I am very proud \nof it. It is with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. This \nwill allow a partnership with the State economic development entity to \nbe able to back up the business, to be able to help them be able to \nfinance even though their collateral has decreased.\n  Before I talk more about that, I also want to mention that we are \ntalking about basically allowing investors and small businesses to take \na 100-percent exclusion from capital gains on small business \ninvestments made this year. So eliminating the capital gains provisions \nfor this year--100 percent.\n  We are focusing on other important provisions that relate to tax cuts \nfor small business and also trade and export promotion. We want to help \nour small businesses export their products, not their jobs. So there \nare many important provisions in here, and I believe we have some 80 \ndifferent business organizations supporting this legislation.\n  This is not Republican versus Democrat out in the real world. We have \nRepublican businesses, Democratic-owned businesses, tea party-owned \nbusinesses, all kinds of folks out there who can't get loans. This is \nnot a partisan issue, and it is extremely unfortunate that it has \nbecome a partisan issue.\n  I want to share a couple of stories. This is about a business called \nAmerican Gear in Michigan. It is a 25-year-old manufacturer of custom-\nmade machine parts. They sell parts to the automotive industry, to the \nU.S. Navy, the glass industry, and the steel industry.\n  In 2008, American Gear made a record profit. But then in 2009 they \nsaw a tremendous pullback from their customers and lost money for the \nfirst time in history. They were forced to cut staff, trim overhead, \nand tried to work with their bank to access additional cash to keep \ngoing. But they weren't able to secure access to enough of the capital \nthey needed to complete their existing orders--even the existing \nbusiness that they had.\n  They are trying to expand. They are trying to get new customers. They \nare profitable once again. But because their 27,000-square-foot \nbuilding has lost so much of its value, the bank has pulled their loan \nand they have been unable to get another lender.\n  They have just hired two new employees to help with new orders, but \nthey can't get credit. They might have to start cutting back again and \nturning away customers because they can't get access to capital.\n  This bill will help American Gear. It will help this company that has \nbeen dealt the double whammy of reduced cashflow and property, which is \nused as collateral, that has decreased in value because of the \nrecession. This is very important. This is something that has been \noverwhelmingly successful in Michigan. Michigan's program started in \n2009 and targets businesses with good credit risks but those who can't \nget the cash they need because their collateral or their cashflow is \nfalling short.\n  That is what this is all about. The business I am talking about, \nAmerican Gear, is a solid business. They are making a profit again. \nThis is a business with good credit, but they have lost the value on \ntheir buildings, and they are unable now to get a loan. This bill \naddresses that. This bill addresses that.\n  We also have another story from Michigan--and there are many stories \nfrom Michigan--about Michigan Ladder in Ypsilanti, MI. It is the oldest \nladder maker in the United States. They have been in business since \n1901. They are still in their original buildings with 20 employees in \nYpsilanti, MI. Nearly all the other makers of ladders have moved to \nAsia or South America.\n  Michigan Ladder sells primarily to commercial and industrial \ncontractor suppliers directly. They manufacture several sizes of wooden \nladders, distribute fiberglass and aluminum ladders which they have \nproduced for them as well. The company experienced difficulty due to \nthe poor commercial real estate market and the housing market. They \ntrimmed their staff, cut benefits, and worked hard to rightsize \nthemselves. They believe they can be competitive. They are aggressively \nworking to continue to produce in Michigan, but they can't get the \nfinancing they need to buy equipment to produce new products because of \nthe fact that their equipment, the collateral they have, has been \nreduced in value.\n  This is a story that I have heard repeated hundreds and hundreds of \ntimes, Mr. President. This bill addresses that. This bill fixes that.\n  Let me move now to process because substantively we have no reason \nnot to pass this bill. There is absolutely no reason, based on the \nsubstance, on the need for small businesses and the support from over \n80 different organizations across this country, not to pass this \nlegislation. So why do we have a filibuster going on?\n  I just want to speak about that for a moment because the reality is, \nwe need to vote.\n  The democratic process is to vote. When we run for reelection, if you \nget one more vote than the other person you win the election. We don't \nsay a supermajority. We say simple majority, one more than the other \nperson. That is a democracy. We are saying here, let's vote, give us a \nvote, an up-or-down vote. You can vote no or you can vote yes, but \ndon't keep using these efforts that block us and force a supermajority \nto block us from even having a vote. That is what is happening here. \nOver and over again we are being blocked from even having a vote.\n  Can you imagine in the election if there were a capacity to block an \nelection day from even actually having the vote? We have men and women \nserving us in this country around the world, putting their lives on the \nline, losing their lives for the democratic process based on the \nability to vote and majority rule. Yet here in the Senate the rules \nhave been totally perverted and twisted to throw sand in the gears and \nrequire a supermajority to even move a step forward on anything.\n  Let's review where we are right now. We have had 246 objections and \nfilibusters since we started 18 months ago--246. That is unheard of. \nNot all of those have actually gone to a cloture vote, a vote to stop a \nfilibuster, because we do not have 246 weeks. The leader cannot get us \nthrough that whole process that takes a week to stop a filibuster on \nevery single objection. Some of these have gone to an actual vote, a 60 \nvote, and on others there have been objections that have stopped us \nfrom voting. It is unheard of. We have never seen this before in the \nhistory of our country.\n  When our country started, there were two that year. Then some have \nbeen zero, some there have been maybe three or four or ten. Some \nsessions of Congress there have been no filibusters.\n  Here we are. In the last Congress we ended the year at 139 \nfilibusters, and we have topped that. This is what happened last time \nwhen this began to be used as a strategy by the Republican leadership. \nIt is way off the charts. Now it is so far off the charts we cannot put \nit on the chart. This is now used as the basic strategy for everything: \nStop everything, throw sand in the gears, and make sure nothing \nimproves, that nothing happens that will improve the lives of families \nin this country, improve the economy, create jobs. I find that to be \nextremely unfortunate.\n  We have a situation right now where we have the opportunity to do \nsomething for those on Main Street, the folks who have not caused any \nof the crises that have been facing our country. They did not make the \nreckless decisions on Wall Street that brought the financial crisis. \nThey were not the ones who didn't enforce our trade laws fairly so we \nlost jobs overseas. They are not the ones who made any of the \ndecisions. But they have been affected. Middle-class families, who may \nnot consider themselves middle class anymore, are just holding on.\n  Many of them own small businesses or work in small businesses or are \ntrying to start a small business. These are folks in every one of our \nStates, in every community that we represent--small businesses, mom-\nand-pop operations, small suppliers. Most of the people in the auto \nindustry are small businesses. They are small companies, small \nsuppliers such as the ones I mentioned, such as American Gear, a small \nsupplier. They find themselves now in a\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nsituation where they cannot operate; they can't expand; they cannot \nconduct business. They are having to lay people off because they cannot \nget credit.\n  We can fix that. We can fix that right here. All we have to do is one \nof two things: Have courageous colleagues on the other side of the \naisle join us to stop a filibuster or, all together, stop this thing \nand vote. That is vote, that is all we are asking for, an up-or-down \nvote, yes or no. But allow a vote to happen.\n  I hope we are close on an agreement. Unfortunately, our leader, who \nhas an incredible amount of patience, finds himself too often in a \nsituation where he is trying to negotiate but the numbers keep \nchanging, the circumstances keep changing, and we are never actually \nable to get an agreement in good faith. I hope that is not the case \nhere because we need to get this done.\n  People are watching us and wondering what in the world is going on in \nthe Senate. People understand what is happening in the real world, what \nis happening to small businesses. Every weekend when I go home--and I \ndo go home every weekend--every weekend when I go home I hear about \nsmall businesses not getting access to capital. They cannot get a loan, \nthey cannot continue their line of credit. Everywhere I go I hear about \nthat.\n  I understand my time is up. I again thank my colleague, the chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, for standing strong. I stand with her. \nThis is incredibly important and there is no reason whatsoever that we \ncannot get this done on behalf of small businesses across America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, \nfor her fight and vigor today, trying to break a logjam here on the \nSenate floor and to pass important small business legislation.\n  When you think of Louisiana and you think of the Saints, you think of \nthe people there who have such spirit. If there were a time in our \ncountry's history when small business ever needed a patron saint, it \nwas at the crisis of 2008. Senator Landrieu and the Small Business \nCommittee have become a leader and voice for small business in America. \nI thank her for that, for that same fight she put into making sure her \nconstituents received help and support in the post-Katrina catastrophe, \nthe same fight she displays now, making sure the gulf is addressed and \nthat there are resources put in for cleanup. She is putting up that \nsame fight for the millions of Americans who are trying to get access \nto capital for their small businesses.\n  We are only talking about three basic things in this bill, all to \nhelp small business. We are talking about tax credits to make sure that \nitems such as equipment and machinery get some little support so small \nbusinesses will make some more investments. We are talking about tried \nand true programs such as the 7(a) loan program and the 504 loan \nprogram and the enhancements of those programs to put more capital out \nonto the streets. We have already pointed out because we have allowed \nthis enhancement to expire that we have seen a 60-percent reduction in \nJune of the amount of money accessible for small businesses, below 2008 \nlevels.\n  Is that what we want to do, suppress capital to small business by 60 \npercent below 2008? In the month of August, if we do not get this \nlegislation passed, there will be $760 million less available for small \nbusiness.\n  I know some of my colleagues are saying let this keep going, \nRepublicans will keep voting against cloture and we will do business in \nSeptember. It is not acceptable to wait until September to help small \nbusinesses that need access to capital today. I wish people would \nlisten to the heartbreak in America of small businesses. When the \ncrisis happened in 2008--many of those people are resourceful people. \nThat is why they start small businesses. So what did they do when the \ncrisis happened? They buckled down; they tried to figure out how to \nmake adjustments in their businesses. They borrowed money from \nrelatives. They borrowed from their 401 programs. They did everything \nthey possibly could to hang on for a year.\n  Contrast that to Wall Street. Wall Street didn't even have to hang on \nfor 1 day before they got help from the Treasury. Not even what \nCongress did; the Treasury was over there helping people before they \neven asked for help. Nobody did that for small business in America. So \nthese people have waited over a year to get this help. They hung on \nwith their savings and their investments for 1 year.\n  In January they were ready to go with these programs and these \nsupport systems and wanted to see the access to capital, but they did \nnot see that. Not only did they not see these program enhancements like \nwe wanted, such as the recapitalization of community banks, instead, \nthey saw their community bankers tell them: We are canceling your \nperforming line of credit.\n  People did everything to hang on. They did everything they could to \nhang on. I could tell you stories that are heartbreaking about \nrestaurants, about small businesses that closed their doors after 30 \nyears of being in business--closed their doors because they could not \nhang on anymore.\n\n  The question for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is how \nmany more businesses are going to close? How many more people are going \nto lose their jobs if we do not address this issue and break this \ndeadlock and make sure we are voting on access to capital for small \nbusinesses on Main Street? Calculate it. They have already been holding \non. They cannot hold on much longer.\n  Every day that goes by that we do not reauthorize this advancement in \nthe 7(a) program, we are costing dollars, we are costing small business \naccess to capital they used to have. It is not even new capital in some \ncases; it is capital they used to have but it got canceled out from \nunder them because of what happened on Wall Street.\n  It is time for my colleagues to show the same level of urgency for \nsmall business, to show we understand that these individuals in America \nhave been hanging on. Listen, they are what makes America a great \ncountry because they are such entrepreneurs and they have done \neverything they can to weather this storm. But it is time to put down \nthe ``no'' votes on moving ahead and move to getting this product, the \nenhancement of 7(a) and the 504 and the capital and recapitalization of \ncommunity banks, off the Senate floor and get it signed before the \nHouse adjourns. That is what we need to do to create jobs now, in \nAugust. If you do not want to do that, you are going to be costing many \nmore Americans their livelihood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend from Washington State \nleaves the floor, I thank her as well. She has been an incredible \nleader on this issue and we are very fortunate to have someone who has \nbeen in business, a successful businesswoman who brings her knowledge \nof business and of finance into the Senate. Her passion and partnership \nwith Senator Landrieu have been very important in getting us to this \npoint. I want to say thank you to the Senator from Washington for her \nleadership as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my two outstanding \ncolleagues on the floor tonight to continue to talk about this \nextremely important bill. I follow up on what the Senator from Michigan \nsaid about the Senator from Washington State. There are only a handful \nof Senators in this Chamber who have actually built a business, a small \nbusiness--it was when it started--and then of course it was an \nextremely successful larger business in the State of Washington State, \nand then it went national. So she knows about what she speaks, the \ndetails of how a business needs to be built.\n  You cannot build it without access to affordable capital. Our \nbusinesses, some of them that are lucky enough to have something, are \npaying exorbitant interest rates on their credit cards. Some of them \nhave watched their lines of credit evaporate, so they have to scramble \nto go get high-cost--it is hard to run a small business if you are \npaying 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent or 50 percent on the money \nyou are borrowing to run your business.\n  You know you have to get affordable capital. That is what small \nbusinesses need. That is what they do not have. Members on the other \nside of the aisle\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\ncould not run fast enough to bail out big banks on Wall Street, but \nthey are walking at a snail's pace to get small business help on Main \nStreet, and it is a shame.\n  But these headlines today say it all: ``GOP Filibusters Small \nBusiness Bill After Criticising Dems For Delay,'' ``Senate Republicans \nBlock Small-Business Lending Measure,'' ``GOP blocks small business \nbill,'' ``Republicans block Senate vote on small business,'' \n``Republicans block small business lending bill.''\n  The New York Times article today is actually pretty devastating. I \nwould think if anybody bothered to read the top two paragraphs--I am \ngoing to ask my staff to get that to me in just a second, and I am \ngoing to read it into the Record. It goes on and on and on.\n  I think that this debate has shown that we actually brought a \nbipartisan bill to the floor, that has been worked on openly in public \nall year or longer, in two committees, Finance and Small Business. As I \nsaid earlier today, and I put the red-line chart up, which I will put \nup in just a minute, this chart that we sent out to many people today \nshowed every provision of the bill and who suggested that provision. As \nyou can see, there are many Republican names listed here--Senator \nSnowe, Senator Crapo, Senator Risch, Senator Snowe again. Senator \nGrassley is on here. Senator Hatch is on here--because this bill was \nbuilt with some of the best ideas from these committees over a long \nperiod of time.\n  This is not a little bill. It is not a technical bill. It is not a \nbill that you pass and nobody knows you passed it because it does not \ndo anything. This bill does some great things that we have needed to do \nfor a long time.\n  That is why we are fighting so hard. That is why we are not going to \ngive up, and we cannot wait much longer. As Senator Cantwell said, it \nis heartbreaking for small businesses that had nothing to do with the \nWall Street meltdown. They never owned a derivative. They never heard \nof the word ``derivative.'' They never heard of the word ``swap.'' All \nthey were doing was serving pancakes in their diner day after day. All \nthey were doing was selling hardware equipment so their neighbors could \nbuild or repair their houses. They never heard the word ``derivative.''\n  Then a couple things happened. They started seeing some very scary \nheadlines. All of a sudden, the entire world economy was at risk, and \nthey are standing there saying: Wait a minute, what did I do? I have \nbeen doing the same business. I am not a millionaire, but I am happy, I \ntake care of my employees, I am bringing home a nice paycheck, I am \nbuilding my business, and the floor fell out from underneath them \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  This Congress has scrambled and scrambled and could not run fast \nenough to go help the big businesses and the executives. Sometimes I \nread in the paper what they make and I sit there and I almost want to \ncry, not because I am jealous of what they make in that way, but I \nthink to myself, how does it feel to be struggling in a business and \nyou--I have had letters from people who said: Senator, I stopped paying \nmyself completely. That is what business owners are doing right now. \nThey have stopped paying themselves completely, and I have to wake \nevery morning and read about big company executives who are complaining \nbecause their take-home salary is $20 million a year or $200 million a \nyear.\n  I mean, think about that, $20 million, $200 million a year. We have \nbusiness owners, 27 million small business owners, and many of them \nright now--because as Senator Cantwell said, this catastrophe did not \nstart just 2 months ago--who have been holding on.\n  I think about them at night. I see them. I think they are holding on \nwith just their bare knuckles, by the remaining strength they have. \nThey are not making any money. So the article today says--and they have \ngotten it right. This is dozens of articles:\n\n       Senate Republicans on Thursday rejected a bill to aid small \n     business with expanded loan programs and tax breaks, a \n     procedural blockade that underscored how fiercly determined \n     the party's leaders are to deny Democrats any further \n     legislative accomplishments before November's midterm \n     elections.\n\n  This is a small business measure championed by myself and others and \nhas the backing of some of the Republican party's most reliable allies \nin the business world, including the United States Chamber of Commerce \nand the National Federation of Independent Business. Several Republican \nlawmakers, the article says, helped to write the bill. But Republican \nleaders filibustered.\n  As the Senator from Michigan said, this is unprecedented. I do not \nknow if the Senator from Michigan has that chart, but I would like to \nask her to show it again, if you could hold it up or let me take it \nhere because it is unprecedented in the number of noes and filibusters.\n  I think this is a no that might have been said, but we need to find a \nway to say yes. I know a no was said, but we have to find a way to say \nyes. So that is what we are going to be doing tonight, tomorrow, \nthrough the weekend. I wish to say how much I appreciate the 70, now \nover 100, organizations that are supporting this bill. I know the NFIB \nhas said, and I wish to be very clear, they want the bill. They also \nwould like a few amendments.\n  But they did not say they wanted 100 amendments. They did not say \nthey wanted 50 amendments. We are now sort of down somewhere between \none and four. That is better than 8 or 12 or 10. We are somewhere \nbetween one and four. If we can just keep narrowing it and try to be as \nfair as we can, we can deliver for the American people and share this \nwonderful victory, and I mean that. Share it. This is not a Democratic \nvictory. It will not be a Republican victory. It will be a victory for \nour constituents and for the 27 million small businesses in America \nthat are waiting for someone to stand and help them, cheer for them, \nand encourage them.\n  That is what we are trying to do. I appreciate the support the \nPresident himself has given. He has been leading. He has been saying, \nas he is trying to work our way out of this recession--and I have not \nagreed with every single thing, of course, and no Senator does with any \nPresident, but I think this President has said that he understands the \nrecession will be over when small businesses start to hire because big \nbusinesses are not going to.\n  They basically say that in their reports. They are holding their \ncapital. The big banks are holding their capital. It is going to be the \nsmall businesses that create the jobs. It is where the jobs were lost.\n  I am going to show this chart again. This is from the monthly \nNational Employment Report: Small business, 81 percent of the jobs lost \nwere lost by small businesses. So it makes common sense that if it was \nthe small businesses that lost the jobs in a recession, as I said, they \nwere not in the back when they were making the ``donuts,'' they were \nnot trading on derivatives. They did not have anything to do with that.\n  But they got caught up in a terrible financial collapse because of \ngreed and poor regulations and all sorts of shady dealings, and they \ndid not have anything to do with it. But they lost the jobs. So in \norder to get this recovery moving and get jobs in the recovery, so it \nis not a jobless recovery but a job-filled recovery, we have to focus \non small business.\n  My ranking member, Senator Snowe, has worked very hard on many \nprovisions of this bill. She has been a remarkable champion for small \nbusiness. Max Baucus, every time we have sent him a couple things we \nwant to do, you know what his job is? It is to find a way to pay for \nit. He has a thankless job around here. I want everyone to know. He has \nprobably the toughest job in this entire place because everything \neveryone wants to do, everything, we have to find a way to pay for it.\n\n  You know the guy who tries to find that is Max Baucus. I have given \nhim page after page, amendment after amendment. He has been so \ngracious. Every time we say: We need this amendment paid for, Max, can \nwe find a way to pay for it, he goes to work.\n  But we are getting exhausted through this process, but we are going \nto continue to fight. Senator Baucus has found amazing ways to pay for \nthese amendments because we are not going to add to the deficit \nanymore. Those days are over. We are going to pay for this bill. This \nbill has tremendous possibilities to actually make a lot of money. One \nprogram will actually earn $1.1 billion, it was so smartly\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nput together. Then we understand that if more people are hired, of \ncourse, they will pay taxes, and that money will come back to local \ngovernment and State government and that will be a big help to \neveryone, to try to get us out of our deficit situation.\n  I see one or two other Senators on the floor. I see the Senator from \nPennsylvania. My time has expired under the 10-minute morning business \norder. But I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania for their support. I am going to be working over the \nweekend with Members of both sides of the aisle.\n  I am going to be working with both sides of the aisle over the \nweekend, through tonight, tomorrow, be in touch with both leaders, and \ncontinue to work with Senator LeMieux and Senator Voinovich, who were \nthe two Republicans who gave us a vote on the lending program, and see \nwhat we can do to narrow it down from four to potentially one, have a \ngreat vote, and claim victory for the small businesses of America. We \nall share a great victory and can be proud of the work we have done \nover the last year and a half.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first of all, just in case our chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Landrieu has to leave, I wish to \nreiterate what a number of us have not only felt but have even spoken \nabout over the last couple days, in light of her work on this \nlegislation.\n  She has been, in a word, tireless and fearless, for one reason: \nBecause she, like so many of us, but I think in a very special way she \nunderstands what so many of these small business owners have told her \nand told a lot of us, that they need help and they need it now.\n  They do not want to hear about a political debate, they want action \nand they want us to pass this legislation. She has worked so hard on \nthe substance. She has worked so hard on the work that you have to do \nin the Senate to get an agreement, to get a bipartisan agreement, to \nmake this a bill that has no impact on the deficit.\n  So whether its fiscal responsibility, whether it is the substantive \nprovisions that help small businesses from Louisiana to California and \nback all across our country in places such as Pennsylvania that I \nrepresent, she has done that work. I think the people of this country \nknow that.\n  I think it is very important that even when we thanked her once, we \nneed to repeat ourselves because she has done great work. I think we \nshould follow her lead. We should not have the kind of political debate \nwe are having. She and others have worked out a very good agreement, \nand I think they are on their way to doing that again.\n  We are so grateful for her leadership and for her tireless efforts to \nget this passed because this is a bill that, in the end, is about not \njust the rhetoric, as we often have in Washington about small business, \nbut having substantive provisions that will cut taxes for small \nbusiness. It will enhance existing small business loan programs that \nwork. All the criticism we hear sometimes about programs that do not \nwork, there are loan programs that are working and just need another \nbump, just need a bit of help.\n  Finally, establishing a new Small Business Lending Fund and all this \nwithout adding to the deficit. Let me take them one at a time.\n  First of all, tax breaks: Over $12 billion in tax cuts going back to \ntaxpayers. Here are just a couple examples: To encourage investment in \nsmall businesses, the bill will increase the capital gains exclusion \nfrom 50 percent up to 100 percent of the gain through the sale of small \nbusiness stock. This provision will provide a greater incentive to \ninvest in small businesses and will spur job creation.\n  This is a bill that is about jobs, about creating lots of jobs in the \nnear term. The bill will encourage small businesses to invest in their \ncompanies, which is what a lot of owners tell us. They say: I want to \ncreate jobs. I want to expand. But they don't have the capital or the \nhelp to do so. It will do that by expanding a business's ability to \nwrite off the cost of certain real property that is purchased for the \nuse of the business. We know the section 179 program in the Tax Code \nhelps us do that. To further encourage Americans to start their own \nsmall businesses, the bill will double the deduction for startup \nexpenditures.\n  Let me move to another element: the need for capital for small \nbusinesses in a State such as Pennsylvania and around the country. We \nhave heard this over and over. Month after month, you walk up to \nsomeone and you say: How are we doing? Sometimes you get good news, \nsometimes bad news. One resounding and consistent message we have \nheard: We are glad you passed the Recovery Act; we are glad you passed \nthe HIRE Act; but I still don't see enough help for small business.\n  Finally, we have a piece of legislation which is targeted at the \nengine of the economy--small businesses and the people who are creating \nthe jobs: small business owners. These owners all across the country, \ntens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, have made that point to us \nover and over. They want to expand, but they don't have access to \ncapital to do it.\n  The changes in this bill, which is budget neutral, will increase \nsmall business lending by $5 billion in the next year. That will create \nor save over 200,000 jobs. In the end, it is a jobs bill. It is not \nonly a bill about programs, it is a bill that will create jobs.\n  First, the bill will increase the limits of the 7(a) loans from $2 \nmillion to $5 million. We have heard about that provision. Just to give \na sense of what that means for Pennsylvania, in the last roughly 18 \nmonths or less, from February of 2009 to June of this year, the SBA \nadministered over 1,700 7(a) loans in Pennsylvania. The changes in this \nbill should allow for many more. We have 67 counties in our State. You \ncan imagine the impact county by county when you have more than 1,700 \nloans on an existing program just in less than 18 months. If anything, \nthis bill will exponentially increase the number of those loans. So \nnext year or the year after, when we are reporting on this, if we \ncomplete work on this and get it passed, instead of 1,700 loans in \nPennsylvania to small business owners, maybe it will be 2,500 or 3,000 \nor much higher.\n  I come from a State which most people think of as big cities such as \nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh. But there are so many places in \nPennsylvania where we have a very small town or even a rural \npopulation. We don't have a lot of big buildings, a lot of big cities. \nWe have a lot of small business owners fighting every day to make ends \nmeet, to borrow a little bit more money to keep going, literally living \nweek to week and month to month. These kinds of loans can have a direct \nand positive impact, a disproportionately positive impact on those \nkinds of businesses in small towns and rural areas of Pennsylvania and \nacross the country.\n  The bill will also increase the loan limits of microlenders who \nprovide short-term working capital to small businesses from $35,000 to \n$50,000. That is a lot of money when you are really up against it as a \nsmall business owner and you are trying to get to the next month or the \nnext quarter in terms of your workforce or your payroll.\n  The bill will increase the limit of 504 loans from $1.5 million to \n$5.5 million. We know the purpose of the 504 Loan Program--to provide \nfinancing for acquisition and renovation of capital assets.\n  Let me give a personal example: Kate Berger of North Huntington in \nWestmoreland County, near Pittsburgh, a big county that has a lot of \nsmaller communities. The Presiding Officer knows counties such as that \nfrom his State of West Virginia. There are a lot of parallels in terms \nof the population and demographics.\n  Kate Berger received a 504 loan to help grow her business. She is a \nformer accountant and owner of JB's Bright Beginnings. She entered into \nthe childcare business when her own childcare needs for her two \nchildren were not being met. Here is someone who had a challenge in her \nown life, and she decided to deal with it by starting a small business. \nThe center she sent her children to was closing. She purchased \nequipment, hired staff, and went back to school for additional training \nin early childhood education. She was doing all the right things, \neverything anyone could ask of her to create a new business.\n  She began running her business out of a very small facility. When the \nopportunity to purchase a larger facility--a former elementary school--\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\narose, she jumped at it, as a very capable small business owner would. \nWith the help of the 504 Loan Program, Kate was able to purchase the \nspace, with room for expanded services and 8 acres of outdoor space for \nthe children, for her childcare center. Since moving to the new \nlocation, enrollment at JB's Bright Beginnings has increased from 66 to \n104 children. Kate has hired an additional 15 employees, bringing the \ntotal number of staff to 35.\n  That is a success story. We don't get a lot of those in the news. But \nfor Kate Berger, the 504 Loan Program is not some theory, some concept; \nthis is real life for her. She took a risk. She got more training and \nmore education. She borrowed money. She took some personal risk to do \nthis. She is now increasing the number of children served and hiring 15 \nmore people.\n  Finally, the bill will provide an opportunity to create the Small \nBusiness Lending Fund, a critical component of this bill, the creation \nof a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund. This will provide working \ncapital to small banks that have continued to lend during this \nfinancial crisis. Approximately 80 percent of commercial lending is \ndone through the smallest loans at these banks. We hear that over and \nover again. Small bankers say: We want to provide more lending. We \ncannot always do it. An increase in lending by the banks will amount to \na new lending and growth for small businesses.\n  We know that by providing this opportunity to have $30 billion of \nlending available, this lending fund will be able to unlock $300 \nbillion in capital for small businesses. The fund will spur lending and \nget credit flowing to small businesses, which is another reason to take \naction on this bill. An investment of $30 billion incentivizes the \ncreation of $300 billion in capital that is leveraged. We know that \nwhen we give the private sector a little help and a kick-start here and \nthere, they can provide a lot of extra money to increase exponentially \nwhat we can do to help small businesses.\n  We need to pass this legislation. We need to remove the politics from \nthis debate. We need to make sure our friends on the other side of the \naisle know that when they--some of them, not all but some of them--were \nlecturing us month after month, saying our side of the aisle was not \ndoing enough for small business, I would argue they were dead wrong \nwhen they made the assertion, but that was their argument. Now we have \nthe opportunity, this rare opportunity to have a single piece of \nlegislation that is focused on small businesses.\n  I urge colleagues to live up to the rhetoric they have been putting \nforth all these many months, to stand up and vote for this bill. A vote \nfor this bill is not a vote only for a piece of legislation. This, \nindeed, is a vote for small businesses. It is a vote for the people \nthey represent in their States. Small businesses are not Democratic or \nRepublican or Independent; they are American. It is about time people \nin this Chamber, who talk and talk about small business, do more than \ntalk. It is about time for them to stand up and vote, vote the right \nway to help small businesses of whatever political party that small \nbusiness owner happens to belong to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Goodwin). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend from Pennsylvania \nleaves, I thank him for his wonderful commitment to small business and \npassion and voice on this issue. We are lucky to have him and very much \nappreciate all of his wonderful work. Pennsylvania and Michigan have a \nlot in common. Our hard-working folks, a lot of them who have been \nlosing their jobs in one industry, are starting small businesses. They \nare looking to us to understand what it takes to start a small business \nand to keep a small business. That is what this bill is all about. I \necho what the Senator from Pennsylvania said about the importance of \nthis bill, and the chairman of the Small Business Committee, and wish \nto stress a couple provisions we haven't talked as much about.\n  First, of course, the major piece is about access to loans from SBA, \nincreasing the loan limits and the size of microloans. That will \nincrease lending through the SBA by about $5 billion next year. A lot \nof small businesses will buy new equipment, will be able to hire staff \nto expand or keep their business going.\n  The large lending facility we have all talked about that takes $30 \nbillion and partners with community banks and creates $300 billion \nworth of capital for small businesses--I can't imagine a better shot in \nthe arm than having that capital available.\n  There is something else that is also important. I am pleased to be a \npart of the President's Export Council. The President has set a goal of \ndoubling exports in the next 5 years. Many of the businesses we are \ntalking about interested in exporting are small businesses. We have \ninternational businesses in Michigan, and they have their own \noperations around the world. They are not in need of support through \nthe export operations in the Department of Commerce, but small \nbusinesses need that.\n  I think of one woman whom I know. Her sister-in-law is a dear friend \nof mine. I talked with her. She lives in northern Michigan on Leelanau \npeninsula, which is absolutely beautiful, north of Traverse City, MI, \nthe kind of place you would like to be today. It is absolutely \nbeautiful up there on the Great Lakes. It is certainly much less warm \nthan here. She is in an area where there are wonderful cherry growers \nand all kinds of fruit and vegetable growers. She has put together \nnutritional products from the power and nutrition of cherries and has \ncome up with a number of things that are very healthy to help people \nwith joint problems and other issues which cherries are actually very \nhelpful with, a very powerful commodity in nutritional assistance. She \nis interested in exporting. She started a small business up in northern \nMichigan, and she has now moved out to, the last time I talked to her, \n300 different places around Michigan and the country.\n  We have talked to her about what she could do to sell her product \noverseas as a nutritional product. There is a great deal of interest in \ndoing that, and I hope we can help her do that. But she needs \nassistance from the export expertise in the Department of Commerce.\n  In this bill, we have small business trade and export promotion \nefforts. The great Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, championed \nthis effort. It would improve the SBA's trade and export promotion \nprograms. It establishes a State export promotion grant program and \nstrengthens coordination. It would leverage more than $1 billion in \nexport capital for small businesses. That is estimated to create or \nsave about 50,000 jobs this year.\n  So there are new opportunities. With the wonders of the Internet, we \nare now in a global economy. We can communicate around the world with \nour cell phone or certainly with the Internet. We have the ability to \nhelp small businesses create jobs by connecting them to the world in \nterms of the markets they can access. Help for that is in this bill. So \nthat is another very important piece.\n  There is also an increase in Federal contracts for small businesses. \nJust increasing Federal contracts for small businesses by 1 percent is \nestimated to create 100,000 jobs. Now, we know in the bidding process, \nagain, larger businesses tend to participate, tend to have major \ncontracts from the Federal Government. Yet this is an opportunity for \nsmall business. If we can increase contracts by just 1 percent, we can \ncreate 100,000 jobs; 2 percent, 200,000 jobs, and so on. Provisions are \nin the bill to increase contracting opportunities, which are very \nimportant opportunities for small business.\n  We have talked about the tax cuts. I hear frequently as a member of \nthe Finance Committee from friends on the other side of the aisle \nconcerned about raising taxes on small business, and we certainly share \nthat concern. We certainly are not supportive of doing that. But here \nyou have an opportunity to cut taxes on small businesses, doing away \nwith the capital gains on small businesses this year, increasing the \ndeduction to start a new business, expanding the expensing provisions, \nbonus depreciation provisions for small businesses, and also something \nvery important that we, of course, have been working on in health care, \nand put in place in the structure that will help small businesses down \nthe road, in 2014, with the new insurance pool--a\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\ncompetitive way to price and purchase insurance. But until then we have \na lot of self-employed people who find themselves in a very difficult \nsituation, who cannot find affordable insurance, if they can find it at \nall.\n  This bill would allow them to deduct their health care costs for \npayroll tax purposes on their tax returns. This is another important \nmatter that people who own small businesses care about and worry about \nfor their families. That is a part of this bill.\n  When we go down through here and look at the huge effort around \ncapital available for small businesses, the efforts in partnering with \nStates to help small businesses that have lost the value of their \nproperty, their equipment--the collateral they would use normally to \nget a loan--there are provisions to address that, provisions to help \nsmall businesses afford health care by deducting their health care \ncosts, help for exports, expanding bonus depreciation and expensing, \neliminating capital gains, and giving small businesses more \nopportunities to contract with the Federal Government.\n  When you look at all of this, I am stunned. Why are we still having \nto have this debate? How long are we going to have to do this when \nevery day we have small businesses that are holding on trying to figure \nout what they are going to do to keep their doors open? We are at a \npoint now where we have to come to a conclusion and pass this bill. I \nhope anyone who says they care about small business will join with us \nand show they do--not just talk about it--but show they do by \nsupporting the small business bill, as the chairwoman said, that now \nhas over 100 different organizations, business organizations, \nsupporting it.\n  I hope they will do that. I hope they will stop the filibustering, \nstop blocking this bill, stop the strategy of throwing sand in the \ngears over and over, using the rules of the Senate to tie this place in \nknots. What we need--what we need--is to just vote. That is it. What we \nneed is to exercise the democratic process of just voting, do away with \nthe filibusters, do away with all the efforts to block, and just allow \nthe democratic process to work. People can vote ``yes.'' They can vote \n``no.'' But just allow us to have a vote.\n  We are looking for colleagues, just a couple of colleagues, joining \nwith us. We have colleagues who have worked across the aisle. We are \nurging them to stand with us to stop this filibuster and allow us to \nvote on behalf of small businesses in America, to give them the support \nthey need.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to follow up on what the \nSenator from Michigan has said because she has been one of the most \nforceful voices for trying to find a way to get the Senate to be able \nto move more quickly on so many important things. She is right. We have \nto stop saying no every day, and particularly on this day, and start \nsaying yes to small businesses. The sooner we can say yes to small \nbusiness, the sooner this recession will end, the sooner Americans can \nget back to work, and the sooner we can begin to put a real downpayment \non the deficit that has been caused by reckless policies of the past.\n  She is right. And every day matters. This bill has been debated \nliterally for a year and a half--not on the Senate floor but in \ncommittees and meetings and negotiations. As I held up a chart earlier \ntoday, most of the provisions in the bill--both from the Finance \nCommittee and the Small Business Committee--were Republican-generated \nideas or amendments. As I said, small business has many champions in \nthis Chamber, and we need to show them, not just say we are but \nactually show them that with our votes.\n  It is going to be a long weekend for some people. I am going to be \nworking all weekend. But it is going to be a long weekend for some who \nare concerned about image because I am going to submit for the Record, \njust today, in the last 24 hours, the list of headlines that are coming \nout around America from papers--conservative papers, liberal papers, \nindependent newspapers--and they are not good for my friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The Huffington Post, more liberal, of course: ``GOP Filibusters Small \nBusiness Bill After Criticizing Dems For Delay.''\n  But Bloomberg, not that liberal: ``Senate Republicans Block Small \nBusiness-Lending Measure.''\n  Politico, one of our papers here: ``GOP blocks small-businesses bill.\n  CQ: ``Republicans Block Senate Vote on Small-Business Bill.''\n  An AP article in the Boston Globe: ``Republicans Block Small Business \nLending Bill.''\n  This cannot be good news over the weekend for a group that claims \nthey are very probusiness.\n  A Las Vegas Sun editorial today: ``Helping Main Street--Senate Should \nApprove Legislation That Could Spark Small Businesses' Growth.''\n  The Washington Independent: ``Democrats Go Small. GOP Still Says \n`No.' ''\n  They have said no one too many times. We have to say yes. If we want \nthis recession to end--and I believe we do; I believe all of us do--we \nknow our constituents are counting on us to do good work. So it is \ngoing to be a long weekend for whoever's job it is--the staffers over \nthere--to try to get better headlines for their bosses. They are going \nto be working hard over the weekend. One of the ways we can do that is \nto get a small list of amendments, like one, two, three, four. The \nleader, our leader, offered three. It was rejected. We have been \ntalking somewhere now between one and four. I think over the weekend we \ncan figure that out, how to pay for these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of other headlines \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           List of Headlines\n\n       New York Times--``Small-Business Bill Falters On Senate \n     Partisanship''\n       Washington Post (Opinion)--``GOP blocks small business \n     bill. Who will get the blame?''\n       AFP--``Obama pleads with Republicans on small business \n     bill''\n       International Business News--``Small business aid bill \n     stalls in Senate''\n       Congress Daily--``GOP Blocks Small-Biz Measure''\n       Star Ledger Editorial Board--``Obama in Edison: President \n     seeks to aid small business, but Republicans resist''\n       Credit Union Times--``Small Business Bill Stalls Again''\n       American Banker--``Small Business Lending Fund Bill \n     Stalls--Again''\n       The Wall Street Journal--``Reid, McConnell in Talks Over \n     Small-Business Bill''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. But I want to answer again because these small business \ngroups--we have 80 of them and they are counting on us--keep calling \nand saying: Vote for the bill. Vote for the bill. And what they are \nhearing from the other side is: We can't vote for the bill until we get \namendments.\n  If we try to put too many amendments on this bill, even good ones, it \nwill bring this bill down. We have to find a way to come to an end of \nthe debate, give the small businesses of America a $12 billion tax cut, \nand strengthen the SBA programs that banks and credit unions use--the \nsmall business programs--and then get this special lending program, in \npartnership with community banks, for the banks that know their \ncommunity the best, the banks that know the businesses down the street.\n  The Taco Sisters Restaurant in Lafayette, LA--I have used Katy and \nMolly Richard before, and I would like to repeat some of the things \nthey said. This is in 2008, looking back now--not a great time, but \nMolly convinced her sister Katy to move back home from New Hampshire \nand they made their dream come true. They leased a small restaurant on \nJohnston Street in Lafayette and they opened in February of 2009. They \nsell wonderful Louisiana products. Molly goes on to say they have seven \nemployees but would like to open more locations. The problem has been \ngetting credit to grow. She says:\n\n       We have good credit, a good business plan, but have had \n     trouble finding capital to grow our business. I was surprised \n     that credit would be so tight for a business like ours--a \n     short success story but successful nonetheless. Our business \n     has seven employees and would like to keep growing, open more \n     locations.\n\n  This is the kicker line:\n\n       Small community banks know businesses in their towns and \n     can create jobs by getting more money out to them.\n\n  This bill is not about big banks on Wall Street. It is about entering \na partnership with banks on Main Street so\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\nthey can send capital to the businesses across the street.\n  It is a very simple bill, and we are going to work hard--hard--to \npass it.\n  On the issue of amendments, again, so we are clear, the minority \nleader came to the floor earlier today and said something like: The \nmajority leader keeps putting down substitutes, and we don't get to \nread the substitutes, and we don't know what the substitutes are.\n  Well, I have read the substitutes. I will tell him what they said. \nSenator Reid came down to the floor and offered the substitute first. \nHe introduced a new substitute because Senators Snowe, Grassley, Enzi, \nIsakson, and Collins wanted to put the SBA recovery provisions--those \nare the very popular loan provisions they had in the stimulus package--\nthe Republican Senators--I am going to repeat their names: Snowe, \nGrassley, Enzi, Isakson, and Collins--all five Republican Senators \nwanted to move that provision from a bill that is pending somewhere \nelse into this bill. So the Democratic leader said yes, and he did it. \nHe put that in the substitute, and then offered it as a substitute. \nThat was not good enough.\n  So then five other Republican Senators--I am going to get their names \nright here--Senators Thune, Johanns, Coburn, Inhofe, and Bond--filed an \namendment. The record will show it was amendment No. 4453. Their \namendment, led by Senator Thune, was to kill the Small Business Lending \nFund.\n  So this is where it really gets interesting. My leader comes to me \nand says there is a Republican amendment to kill the Small Business \nLending Fund, and so he has to accommodate them. I said: But that is \nthe heart of the bill. He says: We still have to accommodate them. So \nhe takes it out of the bill, really against my wishes, but I guess at \nthe time I did not think I had any alternative.\n  That was a Republican amendment. The leader not only accepted it, we \ndid not even have to vote on it. He just did it automatically.\n  Those are two amendments they got that we did not even vote on \nbecause the leader did it for them, against my wishes, and against a \nlot of people's wishes.\n  So we build up again and say: OK, you had to take it out, but we \nthink we have 60 votes to put it back in. And so we did. That is the \nprocess. We had 60 votes. We put the lending fund back in.\n  I see the Senator from Florida in the Chamber. He helped to do that. \nSenator Nelson from Florida helped to put that lending provision back \nin this bill.\n  Now we have come to sort of a standstill because of that, and maybe \nbecause of a few other things. I am figuring this out as we go along. \nBut one thing I have already figured out is, we have to find a way now \nto pass this bill.\n  The leader has had some very good discussions on the floor--just a \ncouple of hours ago. But I have to defend my leader because when the \nother side says that Harry Reid, the Senator from Nevada, will not give \nthem amendments, he does more than that. He puts their amendments in \nhis substitutes, which means they do not even have to offer them. He \ndoes it for them automatically.\n\n  So they deserve headlines like this. I hate to say it. They earned \nthem. They tagged themselves with these headlines.\n  Maybe other people around here would not call them out, but I think \nit is my job as the chairman of this committee because I said when I \ntook this chairmanship that this committee was going to be a champion \nfor small business and we were going to fight hard for them. I offered \nlots of amendments for them in other bills. Sometimes I was successful; \nsometimes I wasn't. But I said we would fight for them, and that is \nwhat we are going to do. If there was ever a time they needed us to \nstand up and fight for them, it is now.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post--and I will conclude in a \nminute. I see the Senator from Florida. This is what our people read. I \nknow not everybody reads the L.A. Times, and I think this came from the \nL.A. Times, but this was the headline I read and got upset about, and I \nwant to say why I did.\n  I think the small businesspeople in my State sit around and read \narticles such as this, and when their kids come to the breakfast table \nI think they fold the article at the breakfast table because they don't \nwant their children to see it because it is very upsetting. Lots of \nkids can't read; they are young. But a lot of teenagers can. This is \nwhat teenagers read.\n  This is by Kenneth Feinberg, who is doing some work in the gulf. He \njust released a list of firms that gave their top employees bonuses of \n$1.6 billion. The report found that bonuses and other payments to \nhighly paid executives at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup, \nWells Fargo, and 13 other financial forums were, he said, ill-advised. \nThe payments, more than $10 million in addition to generous annual \nsalaries for some, came as many of the 17 firms suffered huge losses. \nFeinberg says they were not good. The President says they were lavish \nbonuses. I don't know what to say about them because I can imagine a \nsmall business owner who has borrowed from everybody he knows to keep \nhis business open the last year and a half; he stopped paying himself 8 \nmonths ago, and his children are sitting at the table saying: So, Dad, \nwhy can't we go on vacation?\n  While they are asking that question, he is reading the headlines \nabout the same companies we gave money to on Wall Street gave bonuses \nof $10 million or $20 million or $30 million, and he doesn't have $200 \nto take his kids down the street to the amusement park.\n  Do my colleagues want to know why people in America are mad? I think \nthis might be one reason. They don't understand what Washington is all \nabout.\n  I am not on the committee that has to oversee bonuses. It makes me so \nmad I don't know what I would do if I were, but I am just pointing this \nout. While we are here diddling over small business, this is what small \nbusiness owners are reading, and they are wondering: Has the world \nturned completely upside down? The same firms that got our money to \nbail them out get bonuses, and I can't even pay myself or my wife who \nworks for the business or my child a salary for a month.\n  I am telling my colleagues, we better get moving on this bill, or I \nam not sure what is going to happen to either party when this election \ncomes up because we need to do what is right. We need to do it soon. We \nknow what is right, I think. I believe we do. We have worked hard to \nput a very smart, good bill together that doesn't increase the deficit \nby a penny; that provides $12 billion in tax cuts--tax cuts, $12 \nbillion. I know those people on the other side, our friends, say \nDemocrats are never for tax cuts. Well, we have $12 billion in tax cuts \npaid for in this bill for small business.\n  So to the sisters who started this restaurant in hopes they could \ndepend on us to do some right things for them, for all the small \nbusinesses struggling out there, I am saying to them: Just hang on. I \nknow it is hard, but just try to hang on a few more weeks, a few more \nmonths if you can, because this bill is going to have a major impact, \nwe hope. We don't know 100 percent for sure, but I can promise you \ndoing nothing is a disaster. This bill has a lot of things we are going \nto try. Nobody here has a magic wand. But we have loan programs. We \nhave some counseling programs. We have some small bank programs. We \nhave some credit union programs. We are going to just throw it out \nthere carefully, strategically, and hope it hits because if it doesn't, \nI am kind of running out of ideas because I am not giving any more \nmoney to Wall Street.\n  So these are our best ideas for Main Street. I am proud of the work \nwe have done. I see the Senator from Florida. I am going to yield the \nfloor. There may be other Senators who wish to come down and speak.\n  I wish to thank Senator Nelson from Florida who has been a champion. \nI wish to again thank Senator Merkley, Senator Snowe for her work \nearlier today. Although we disagree on one small aspect on this bill, \nwe will still work together over this weekend to see what agreement we \ncan come to. I wish to thank Senator Cantwell particularly, and Senator \nSchumer, Senator Klobuchar, and others who have been terrific--Senator \nBoxer, Senator Murray. We are going to continue to work over the \nweekend to see what we can do to say yes to small business in America \nsoon.\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Before the Senator yields the floor, would the \nSenator entertain a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. First of all, I don't want the Senator to be \nrushed because I came over here so that I could hear the Senator. The \nSenator from Louisiana is so articulate and so passionate. She has laid \nthe case out with the bare facts that if there is any embracing, as \nthere seems to be, of support for small business, including a lending \nfacility of $30 billion to try to get money through the community banks \ninto small businesses, which are desperate--and my State of Florida has \na lot of small business--if there is this unanimity of feeling, then \nwhy are we playing these parliamentary games of adding on, insisting on \nthe other side of the aisle's position that they want amendments that \nhave nothing to do with small business and, therefore, cluttering up, \nas the Senator from Louisiana says?\n  Is the world coming to an end? Is the Senate coming to an end where \nwe are in such perpetual gridlock that something that is so commonsense \nas this legislation to help small business--to help that family at the \nbreakfast table the Senator so eloquently described--are we at the \npoint that the Senate is incapable of functioning because one side says \nit has to have its way of having amendments that it wants that has \nnothing to do with small business? Have we come to the point of \ncomplete gridlock?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, I hope not. I wish to answer the question. I hope \nnot. But we are very close because this bill, as the Senator knows, \ncame to the floor because he helped to draft certain provisions of this \nfrom two committees with bipartisan support. Our leader, Senator Reid, \nhas bent over backwards.\n  When Republicans objected, he basically sort of took some things out \nof the bill to put on the floor in hopes--didn't even make anybody vote \non it, against my objections, and then we started a debate. Then it \njust sort of shut down after we got that lending program back on. We \nhave to open it again. We have to find a way forward because that \nlending program is extremely important.\n  The Senator was a cosponsor of that. We have to find a way forward. I \nthink I heard tonight on the Senate floor--I think I heard--that we are \nsomewhere between one and four amendments.\n  So as we work over the weekend, I am hoping we can find a way to say \nyes because the Senator knows, representing Florida, it is a whole \nState full of small businesses. The Senator knows more than any Senator \nhere how many businesses are hurting in Florida. Our whole gulf coast \nhas been under tremendous strain over many issues the last couple of \nyears. So I thank the Senator. I am just responding to his question to \nsay I hope we are not at the point of no return. But we are close.\n  If we can salvage this bill and move forward and do the right thing \nfor small business, I think we can all be proud of that work.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator would further \nyield, why do we have to mess up this bill with message amendments? \nThese are political message amendments. For example, there are some \namendments that on their own might be desirable amendments. There is an \namendment--the fourth amendment of the four the Senator from Louisiana \njust mentioned--is one having to do with spending caps. That might be a \ndesirable thing, but it is controversial. So why is the Republican side \ninsisting on an amendment that is going to be controversial which \nlessens the chance for us to get 60 votes to cut off debate?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, the Senator is exactly right, but a better \nquestion is why would the minority leader insist on voting on an \namendment we have already voted on three times. That is even a more \ninteresting question. We have already voted on the Sessions-McCaskill \namendment three times.\n  The Senator knows some people work for 10 years on amendments and \nnever get a vote on the floor of the Senate. That amendment has had \nthree chances--not one, not two, but three--and now we have to give \nthem a fourth vote on the floor of the Senate. That is not anything to \ndo with small business; that is a message.\n  It sends a terrible message. It says we are looking for bumper \nstickers and slogans as opposed to bills. I will say that again. Some \npeople work around here for 10 years and can't get their amendment one \nvote on the floor of the Senate, and the Sessions-McCaskill amendment, \nin this case, because the minority leader has thrown it out there, we \nhave voted this year three times already on that amendment. I don't \nthink we need to vote on it again. We surely don't need it for this \nbill. It has nothing to do with spending caps. It has to do with \nsending money to community banks because they know the businesses that \nmight be able to hire people, to create jobs, to lead us out of the \nrecession. That is all this bill is mainly about.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator will further \nyield--and I will be very brief because the Senator's patience has been \nextraordinary, and she has been at this going hard, full throttle all \nday--I would ask the Senator, in light of the extremely descriptive \nword picture that she painted of the family at the breakfast table and \nthe mom and the dad don't want the teenagers to see that folks on Wall \nStreet are getting all of these bonuses while they cannot even go down \nand have a weekend vacation because the money is not there, all of this \nis just exacerbated in the Senator's gulf coast State, as is my gulf \ncoast State, because of the loss of income, the loss of business as a \nresult of the gulf oilspill. Now we find that BP indeed wants to lessen \ntheir Federal tax liability by $10 billion by writing off all of the \nexpenses attendant to this gulf oilspill.\n  When you lessen your tax revenue, that means that you are asking for \nthe taxpayers to make up the difference. Is it any wonder the mom and \ndad at the breakfast table don't want their children to know what in \nreality is going on here?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Exactly. I mean, I don't know how you explain to \nteenagers. There really is no explanation.\n  I think it is shameful and we need to fix it. The Senator should know \nthat is what we are trying to do. Again, I don't know what we can do \nabout those bonuses. That is a subject for another committee. I am \nconcerned and the Senator is as well. Maybe we can find a way. The BP \nwriteoff--there will be a tremendous amount of criticism, and perhaps \nthere are some legal grounds for us not allowing them to do that. It is \ninexplicable to people who are trying to run a small business and they \nsee us having worked for a year and a half, and all that is going on \nand we still cannot seem to move this bill forward to the House for \nnegotiation and then to the President's desk as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will say this in conclusion, \nif the Senator will yield further, every one of us has small businesses \nin our States. The economic engine of Florida is small business. It is \nthose very people who have come forth in this recession and have said \nthey are having difficulty and, in many cases, cannot make financial \nends meet because they cannot get the banks to lend to them.\n  The big banks will lend to big customers. They are not fulfilling the \nobligation of lending to the entire community. The community banks wish \nto make those loans to small business and, yet, they say they are \nharassed by regulators. Here we have provided an avenue of money to \nflow through community banks to small business to help them make their \nfinancial ends meet. It is unconscionable that people in a \nparliamentary and partisan fashion would hold up this legislation.\n  That is what I wanted to say, in conclusion, to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Florida. I am going to speak \nanother 4 minutes. I know staff is tired and we are going to wrap up \nsoon. I wanted to end with a comment from another small business in \nMetairie, LA, which is right outside of New Orleans. This is a small \nbusiness owner, Patti Martinez, a lifelong resident of New Orleans, who \nopened her business in March 2009. I am sure she thinks about that \ndecision every day, thinking: Maybe I should have opened a couple of \nyears earlier or waited. But she didn't know all the derivatives on \nWall Street would blow up. She opened her business in March 2009. She \nhas three children, so the idea is she waited for 10 years--there are a \nlot of moms out there who\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nhave small kids at home. Frank and I have raised our children while I \nhave been in the Senate. He works, too. We know how difficult that is.\n  I know a lot of moms dream for a long time about what they would do \nif they had some time. Patti waited 10 years and then opened her \nbusiness--lucky her--in March 2009. She said: I have 15 employees; they \nare part time. Our little business has taken off beautifully. We host \nbirthday parties, holiday parties, and sock hops. I recently hosted a \n50th birthday party.\n  She is explaining that her business is going on. She said:\n\n       Everyone, once inside our facility, loves our business and \n     comes back again [even in these difficult times]. We ran one \n     commercial on Channel 4 for a week and our bookings \n     quadrupled.\n\n  One commercial on Channel 4, which is our big station, for a week and \nher bookings quadrupled.\n\n       If I had additional funds for advertising, video games, and \n     maybe one more employee, our business would really take off.\n\n  This is the story of the recovery. This is the story of the end of \nthis recession. If we don't have more business owners like Patti \nMartinez who will hire that one more person, this recovery is never \ngoing to happen. Don't take my word for that. Go look up all of the \njournals, the scientific journals, and all of the economic studies. You \ncan go to the fancy schools--Harvard, MIT--and look and they say that. \nIt is not just what I am saying. Big business isn't going to hire. \nSmall business is going to hire--the Patti Martinezes of the world. She \nran one commercial and her business quadrupled. Couldn't we give her a \nloan so she can run maybe two or three commercials? She is not paying \nherself any bonus, I can promise you that.\n  I am going to end with a letter we received today from the National \nRestaurant Association, representing 945,000 restaurants across the \nUnited States. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association.\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Restaurant Association, \n     representing 945,000 restaurant locations across the U.S., \n     supports H.R. 5297, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The \n     restaurant industry, which employs nearly 13 million \n     Americans and is expected to generate an overall economic \n     impact of $1.5 trillion this year, is comprised mainly of \n     small, independent businesses. In fact, more than 98% of \n     restaurants are classified as small businesses.\n       H.R. 5297 would provide our nation's small businesses with \n     tax relief and assistance in gaining access to capital that \n     is critical to economic and financial recovery. Importantly, \n     this legislation would increase the Section 179 expensing \n     limits and expand Section 179 to allow taxpayers to expense \n     up to $250,000 of the cost of qualified leasehold improvement \n     property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail \n     improvement property. In addition, the legislation would \n     extend bonus depreciation, which expired at the end of last \n     year. These provisions would encourage small businesses, \n     including those in the restaurant industry, to undertake \n     capital expenditures. Moreover, these capital expenditures \n     have a multiplier effect, spurring economic activity and job \n     growth in communities throughout the country.\n       An important part of the bill are the provisions to \n     modernize popular Small Business Administration (SBA) loan \n     programs and extend expiring loan guarantees and borrower fee \n     reductions. Specifically, the maximum size of SBA 7(a) and \n     504 loans would increase from $2 million to $5 million and \n     from $1.5 million to $5.5 million respectively. The fees on \n     such loans, which were eliminated through 2009, would \n     continue to be eliminated through 2010. In addition, \n     government guarantees of 90 percent on such loans would also \n     be extended through 2010. These provisions have the strong \n     support of Small Business Committee Chairman Landrieu and \n     Ranking Member Snowe. We also support the LeMieux-Landrieu \n     Amendment incorporated into the bill, which would establish a \n     $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund designed to assist \n     small banks to specifically lend money to small businesses. \n     As the nation's fragile economic recovery continues, \n     households are still holding back on spending and, as a \n     result, many restaurant operators are continuing to struggle. \n     Expanding access to capital will help restaurant operators \n     make necessary investments, hire and retain workers, and, in \n     certain cases, keep their doors open.\n       Additionally, we urge passage at some point this year of \n     two additional amendments that were filed but will not be \n     taken up at this time. First, we support an amendment filed \n     by Senator Bill Nelson that would provide some tax benefits \n     to small businesses and individuals impacted by the Gulf Oil \n     Spill. Where the Gulf Coast's beaches and wetlands attracted \n     millions of visitors in previous years and generated demand \n     for restaurants, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is now \n     having resounding negative economic consequences. As such, we \n     urge your support for the Gulf Coast recovery package \n     recently released by Senators Bill Nelson, Wicker, Landrieu, \n     Cochran, Vitter, and LeMieux. The package contains tax \n     incentives that would assist small businesses such as \n     restaurants as they grapple with the long-term challenges \n     resulting from the worst environmental disaster in U.S. \n     history. The tax incentives include tax deferral for \n     reinvested small business reimbursements, extension of the \n     net operating loss carryback period, an oil spill recovery \n     zone job creation tax credit, and enhanced small business \n     expensing in the oil spill recovery zone. Another \n     meritorious provision that should be considered is \n     allowing the deferral of SBA loan repayments for those \n     businesses located in the gulf region and impacted by the \n     oil spill.\n       Finally, we urge permanent resolution of the estate tax \n     issue. In this regard, we would like to take this opportunity \n     to note our support for the estate tax amendment offered by \n     Senators Kyl and Lincoln, which would provide hard-working \n     small business owners with certainty on this important issue.\n       We urge you to support H.R. 5297, which will go a long way \n     to help small business during this difficult economic \n     climate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Scott DeFife,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                      Policy & Government Affairs.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In part, it says:\n\n       We also support the LeMieux-Landrieu Amendment incorporated \n     into the bill, which would establish a $30 billion Small \n     Business Lending Fund. . . . As the nation's fragile economic \n     recovery continues, households are still holding back on \n     spending and, as a result, many restaurant operators are \n     continuing to struggle. Expanding access to capital will help \n     restaurant operators make necessary investments, hire and \n     retain workers, and, in certain cases, keep their doors open.\n\n  The restaurants in my State are having a particularly difficult time \nbecause they don't have capital. Now they don't have any seafood to \nsell. If we keep going much longer, they are not going to have any \ncustomers even if I could give them capital and seafood, because people \ndon't think they should come to the gulf now. That is a whole other \nsubject.\n  Tonight, we can loosen up some of this capital through bankers that \nthey know--they worship with them in church, they worship with them in \nsynagogues; they know them. The bankers know them. If we can help small \ncommunity banks, maybe--just maybe--and some of these credit unions--\nmaybe some of the money we shower on Wall Street--maybe we could give a \nlittle bit of rain out there to middle America and get this recession \nover.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6509-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6509-S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LOIS BAKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mrs. Lois \nBaker and the commitment she made to providing rural health care \nservices to thousands of Kentuckians. Beginning in 1971, Mrs. Baker was \nthe chief executive officer of Mountain Comprehensive Health \nCorporation, MCHC, which continues to provide the residents of eastern \nKentucky with quality, affordable health care. Since opening its first \nlocation, a trailer located on the line between Perry and Leslie \nCounties, MCHC has become a fixture in the region, operating locations \nin five eastern Kentucky counties. Now, with 250 employees, MCHC \nproudly serves over 27,000 patients each year.\n  Mrs. Baker's commitment to the Commonwealth extends well beyond her \naccomplishments at MCHC. A graduate of Fugazzi Business College and the \nUniversity of Michigan's School of Public Health, Mrs. Baker served as \npresident of Baker Coal & Land Company and as president of Letcher \nManufacturing Company prior to becoming CEO of MCHC. As a member of the \nadmissions committee for the University of Kentucky College of \nMedicine, Mrs. Baker proudly encouraged students from eastern Kentucky \nto pursue careers in the medical field and then to return home and \nutilize their skills to better the lives of their fellow Kentuckians.\n  Following her recent passing, the Booneville Sentinel published an \narticle commemorating the life and accomplishments of Mrs. Lois Baker, \nand I would like to share that tribute with my colleagues. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\n             [From the Booneville Sentinel, July 14, 2010]\n\n       Lois Baker leaves a long list of achievements.\n       Funeral services for the founder and past chief executive \n     officer of Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation (MCHC) \n     was held Wednesday, June 30, 2010 at the First Baptist Church \n     in Whitesburg.\n       Lois attended Stuart Robinson High School, Fugazzi Business \n     College in Lexington, KY and the University of Michigan \n     School of Public Health.\n       Before leading Mountain Comprehensive Health to become one \n     of the country's most successful rural health providers, she \n     worked in the coal business and operated a furniture plant. \n     She was president of Baker Coal & Land Company from 1959 to \n     1963, president of Letcher Manufacturing Company, Inc. in \n     1963 and became CEO of MCHC in 1971.\n       The first MCHC clinic was located in Wooten on the Perry/\n     Leslie county line, in a trailer. MCHC operates five clinics, \n     located in Letcher, Perry, Harlan and Owsley counties. MCHC's \n     team consists of 250 employees and provides services to more \n     than 27,000 patients each year. In looking back, Lois stated, \n     ``there was no way that at that time I could have imagined or \n     anyone else that was working at that time could imagine \n     Mountain Comp as it is today.''\n       In October 1983, Lois extended her commitment of providing \n     quality healthcare services to the residents of Owsley County \n     and surrounding counties by opening the Owsley County Medical \n     Clinic. Owsley Medical Clinic is now a medical practice \n     consisting of two primary care providers and 15 employees \n     whose mission is to utilize all available resources to \n     provide affordable health care to those persons residing in \n     its service area. The Owsley Medical Clinic is an asset to \n     the area as well as a source of pride for Owsley County. \n     Thank you Lois for thinking of us!\n       Lois served on many boards and committees. She was a member \n     of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Admissions \n     Committee. She said that if an eastern Kentucky student \n     applied to UK College of Medicine, they were accepted and \n     encouraged to come back to the mountains to practice \n     medicine. She was inducted into the Mountain Heritage Hall of \n     Fame, the National Association of Community Health Centers \n     Grassroots Advocacy Hall of Fame and the UK College of Public \n     Health Hall of Fame.\n       Lois always had a vision and she never lost that vision. \n     She was always a pioneer in everything and never afraid to \n     tackle anything. She had a presence that seemed larger than \n     life and felt it was purely about helping people by providing \n     excellent health care. Lois's great passion for her work, \n     compassion for her staff and patients, and friendliness even \n     under stress made her a role model for all of us. She will be \n     missed greatly by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6510-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6510-S6511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND OIL COMPANY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for \nintroducing the Clean Energy Jobs and Oil Company Accountability Act. \nThis bill, which I am proud to support, is a timely and targeted \nresponse to the continuing devastation in the Gulf of Mexico, a \ncatastrophe which began 100 days ago. The Senate must move quickly to \naddress one of the most immediate and pressing problems facing our \nNation and to find meaningful ways to prevent similar disasters in the \nfuture. The American people rightly expect that the lessons learned \nfrom this disaster will be heeded.\n  This legislation addresses several issues brought to light in the \nspill's aftermath. It will ensure the fair treatment of victims like \nthe families of the 11 Americans who were killed in the explosion on \nthe Deepwater Horizon oil rig. It will encourage responsible corporate \nbehavior and provide meaningful criminal penalties for environmental \ncrimes. It will ensure that British Petroleum and those responsible for \nthis disaster and any responsible party associated with an oilspill at \nan offshore facility in the future are held fully accountable and \nliable for all of the damages the oilspill causes and that the American \ntaxpayer is not left with the bill. It is a response that will help the \npeople of the gulf begin the long process of restoring what they have \nlost. And for those who cannot recover what they have lost, it will \nhelp them as they move forward. These matters, and others, have been \nthe subject of several recent hearings in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Senators from several committees, including the Judiciary Committee, \nhave made important contributions to this bill. I am pleased that the \nmajority leader asked for and listened to the calls of members of the \nJudiciary Committee to make sure that a significant part of this \nlegislative response was focused squarely on the needs of the victims \nof this disaster and that the Federal laws designed to provide justice \nfor wrongdoing are fair.\n  I thank the majority leader for including two pieces of legislation I \nhave introduced--the Survivor's Equality Act, and the Environmental \nCrimes Enforcement Act. I am confident that, when enacted, both of \nthese provisions will help victims and promote responsibility and \nsafety within the energy industry.\n  The Survivor's Equality Act would remedy profound unfairness in our \nmaritime tort laws. The enactment of this provision will end the \nunequal treatment under the law for those who are killed at sea. The \nDeath on the High Seas Act, which is one of the few remedies for these \nfamilies to seek justice, provides compensation only for pecuniary \nlosses associated with a wrongful death. This involves a cold \ncalculation of a victim's monetary worth to his or her family and \nnothing more. And if an individual who is killed has no dependents, he \nor she is entitled to very little, yet the loss to a parent or a \nsibling is no less tragic. The current Federal maritime law does not \nrecognize the profound losses associated with the death of a loved \none--the suffering of a widow who has lost her husband; a parent who \nhas lost a child; or a child who will no longer have a parent to guide \nthem through life. In modern America, it is simply unfair to have a \ndifferent standard of justice for those killed at sea than those killed \non land.\n  Another important provision in the pending bill is the Environmental \nCrimes Enforcement Act which would bolster the enforcement of \nenvironmental crimes. Often in the case of serious environmental \ncatastrophes the companies that caused the disaster may be guilty of \ncommitting environmental crimes. These wrongdoers must be held \naccountable for their criminal acts, and they, rather than American \ntaxpayers, should pay for the damage. The Environmental Crimes \nEnforcement Act is crafted to deter environmental crime, protect and \ncompensate its victims, and encourage accountability among corporate \nactors. This would deter schemes by big oil corporations and by others \nthat hurt hard-working Americans and their local economies and that \ndamage the environment by increasing sentences for environmental \ncrimes. All too often, corporations treat fines and monetary penalties \nas merely a cost of doing business, to be factored against profits. To \ndeter criminal behavior by corporations, it is important to have laws \nresulting in prison time, and this bill would appropriately raise \nsentences for environmental crimes so they are comparable with \nsentences for other serious crimes. Nothing gets the attention of \ncorporate decisionmakers like the prospect of serving time behind bars.\n  This provision would also help victims of environmental crime--the \npeople who lose their livelihoods, their communities, and even their \nloved ones--reclaim their natural and economic resources by making \nrestitution mandatory for criminal Clean Water Act violations.\n  Other members of the Judiciary Committee have made important \ncontributions to the majority leader's bill. Senator Whitehouse's \nlegislation to reverse the Supreme Court's decision in Exxon v. Baker \nis included in this package. When this provision is enacted, the \nSupreme Court's arbitrary cap on punitive damages in maritime cases \nwill be erased. Instead, with the appropriate measure of liability \nreturned to a jury to decide, corporations engaged in dangerous and \nenvironmentally risky work will think twice about endangering the \nsafety of their workers and the ecosystem.\n  Senator Schumer's legislation to repeal the antiquated Limitation of \nShipowners' Liability Act has also been included. This statute limits a \nvessel owner's total liability to the value of the vessel after an \naccident has occurred. Updating this arcane law will foreclose the type \nof conduct we witnessed in this case when Transocean, the owner of the \nDeepwater Horizon, claimed its liability should be limited to the value \nof the Deepwater Horizon as it sat on the bottom of the gulf. That \ndefies common sense and propriety. Congress cannot control a \ncorporation's desire to evade its responsibilities, but the American \npeople, through their Congress, need not allow a law that invites such \nbehavior to stand.\n  Another important provision in this legislative package is the \namendment\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\nto the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, Act of 1965 to provide \nfor full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This comes at \na time when the purposes of this program are keenly important to \ncommunities across the country that are facing escalating development \npressures, while striving to maintain their focus on improving the \nquality of life in their communities.\n  In my own home State of Vermont, LWCF has led to the conservation of \nmany valued areas--from the Green Mountain National Forest, which \nstretches over nearly two-thirds of the length of Vermont across a \ndiverse landscape, to our Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge near the \nCanadian border, to the Appalachian Trail that winds through the State, \nand to the stunning Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park \nin Woodstock, VT. In recent years, LWCF has also helped to fund the \nForest Legacy Program, which has permanently conserved more than 60,000 \nacres of forestland in Vermont and nearly 2 million acres nationwide. I \nam concerned, though, with how this new LWCF language has been drafted \nand worry that it could restrict our ability to allocate funds for the \nfederal purposes, such as the Forest Legacy Program and other land \nacquisition programs that assist in preserving, developing, and \nassuring accessibility to quality outdoor recreation resources and \nimportant natural resources. I hope that I can work with the majority \nleader and other supporters of these land conservation programs moving \nforward to ensure that LWCF meets the outdoor conservation and \nrecreation needs of the American people.\n  These investments not only protect crucial and delicate ecosystems \nand landscapes that are relied upon by countless communities and by \nindigenous wildlife; they also offer important recreation opportunities \nfor Vermonters and visitors from other States to enjoy these beautiful \nplaces for our campgrounds, hiking trails, skiing, snow shoeing, \nsnowmobiling, and fishing. It made good economic and environmental \nsense in 1965 and it remains good sense today to reinvest a small \nfraction of Federal leasing revenues in permanent natural resource \nprotection. A healthier environment and more recreational opportunities \nwill not only promote health and quality of life but also have a \npositive impact on our economy. More than 500 million people visit \nnational parks and monuments, wildlife refuges, and recreational sites \neach year, contributing to family paychecks and to local economies.\n  LWCF is a visionary and bipartisan program. Since its creation in \n1964, it has conserved more than 5 million acres of land and water \nacross the country. These are iconic American landscapes like the \nredwood forests, the Grand Canyon National Park, the Appalachian \nNational Scenic Trail, the Great Smoky Mountains, the Denali National \nPark and Preserve, the Everglades, and our own Green Mountain National \nForest in Vermont. This is a program that touches every American. Even \nthose who have not been able to visit a national park or forest likely \nhave enjoyed one of the many urban parks, picnic areas, playgrounds, \nopen trails, or open spaces that LWCF has been the key to providing and \nprotecting--places prized by everyday Americans across the land as \nplaces for recreation and so many other uses.\n  I am proud to have led the bipartisan efforts in the Senate to build \nsupport for the fund, whose budget is overseen by the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I have sought, with bipartisan support, \nincreased funding for both the Federal and State sides of the program \nand the Forest Legacy Program, another successful and popular \nconservation initiative that I was gratified to be able to launch when \nI chaired the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. \nRegrettably, securing adequate resources for LWCF has always been \ndifficult, and LWCF has only been fully funded once in its history.\n  I must also voice some additional concerns and reservations that I \nhave about the LWCF language in this bill regarding the role of the \nAppropriations Committee. I hope that we can ensure that Congress, \nthrough the direction of the Appropriations Committee, will still have \ncontrol in establishing how the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \nallocated among the State and Federal purposes and the various agencies \nwithin. I ask that the majority leader commit to working with the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee chairman to develop language that \nguarantees the role of the Congress in appropriating and directing \nthese funds rather than leaving all control in the administration. I \ntrust that we can find a way to fully fund LWCF and maintain the \ncongressional involvement through the appropriations process.\n  I applaud the majority leader for including this provision in the \nbill and appreciate both his support and that of the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bingaman, for leading \nthis effort to protect America's most treasured landscapes, to \nstrengthen our local economies, and to ensure the future of our \nnatural, cultural, and recreation heritage.\n  Now I would be remiss if I did not mention another program that has \nfaced the same difficulty receiving its full authorized amount. That \nwould be the Historic Preservation Fund, which also receives funding \nfrom the Outer Continental Shelf oil lease revenues but has rarely been \nappropriated more than half of the authorized level of $150 million. I \nhope that I can work with my colleagues to solve this issue for the \nHistoric Preservation Fund, just as we are trying to do for the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund.\n  This bill is also an important step forward for the Home Star \nProgram, a bipartisan home efficiency effort that Congressman Welch has \nhelped lead in the House, that will lower consumers' energy and water \ncosts while creating jobs. As Vermont has shown time and again, energy \nefficiency retrofits work. They not only create quality jobs and save \nhomeowners money on their energy and water bills, but they also reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil and cut down on harmful carbon emissions.\n  The Clean Energy Jobs and Oil Company Accountability Act would reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil by making investments in vehicles that \nrun on electricity and natural gas. The lack of fuel diversity in our \ntransportation sector makes our economy and American consumers \nparticularly vulnerable to increases in oil prices, and I am pleased \nthat this bill invests in other transportation alternatives that will \nalso bring down our carbon emissions.\n  I am sorely disappointed in Washington's inability so far to overcome \nthe entrenched power of special interests by acting on comprehensive \nclimate change remedies. This bill is not a substitute for that, but it \ndoes signifies several constructive steps forward.\n  I am proud to stand with Majority Leader Reid in support of the \nvictims of the greatest environmental disaster on American shores. But \nthe legislative package he has assembled will do more than just bring \njustice to these victims. It will save consumers and taxpayers money, \ncreate jobs throughout the country, and move our country toward a \nsafer, more responsible energy industry. It is a commonsense solution. \nI hope it will receive bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6511-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6511-S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      45TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, tomorrow our Nation celebrates the 45th \nanniversary of Medicare, a vital program that has provided health care \nfor millions of Americans through the years. During my career in the \nSenate, I have fought to ensure that our Arkansas seniors and all \nseniors receive the best health care possible. I have fought to protect \nMedicare benefits for our Arkansas seniors, so they can receive the \ncare they need, when they need it.\n  I believe in the promise our government made to working Americans \nthat if we work hard, Medicare will be there to help us in our golden \nyears. Medicare has made a healthy and secure retirement possible for \ntens of millions of Americans, including my own mother.\n  More than 500,000 Arkansans are enrolled in Medicare, and I am proud \nof my work on their behalf. In particular, our Arkansas seniors will \nsee significant new benefits because of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, which I played a major role in crafting.\n  The new health care law will enhance the life and well being of our \nseniors in\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nmany ways. For example, I fought successfully to reduce the Medicare \nPart D prescription drug coverage gap known as the doughnut hole, which \nwill save seniors money beginning this year. In addition, the \nlegislation will immediately extend Medicare payment protections for \nsmall rural hospitals and other health care providers that play vital \nroles in their communities.\n  I am proud that the Senate health care reform law explicitly states \nthat no reductions in guaranteed Medicare benefits will be made, and \nthat any savings generated for the Medicare program will extend \nMedicare solvency, reduce Medicare premiums and cost-sharing for \nbeneficiaries, improve or expand Medicare guaranteed benefits, and \npreserve access to Medicare health care providers.\n  In addition my Medicare Advantage lemon law included in the bill \ncreates a 45-day period--January 1through February 15--beginning in \n2011 during which beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage or \nprescription drug plans during the annual enrollment period can \ndisenroll and return to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. This \nproposal will help protect seniors from losing benefits or the ability \nto see their doctors if they have discovered they signed up for a \nMedicare Advantage plan that does not cover their doctors or does not \nmeet their health care needs, a problem we have experienced often in \nArkansas.\n  As we commemorate the 45th anniversary of Medicare, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to thank the entire Arkansas health care \ncommunity for their dedicated efforts to ensure that their fellow \nArkansans receive the best care possible. In particular, I commend our \nhealth care professionals for their participation in the Medicare \nprogram, providing comfort and care and making a healthy retirement \npossible for millions of Arkansans since the program's inception 45 \nyears ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6512-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6512-S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AFGHANISTAN REPORT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate Caucus on International \nNarcotics Control has been studying the evolving counternarcotics \nefforts in Afghanistan and has found that the Taliban has morphed into \na hybrid--it is one part terrorist organization, one part global drug \ntrafficking cartel.\n  The Taliban's terrorist operations are increasingly fueled by its \nsubstantial narcotics profits, with as much as $169 million coming from \na single heroin trafficker in a 10-month period.\n  In Afghanistan, the convergence of terrorism and international drug \ntrafficking is strikingly similar to what we have witnessed in \nColombia. There, profits from the cocaine trade has kept the Marxist \nterrorist group known as the FARC going for the past 46 years.\n  These hybrid organizations are the face of 21st century organized \ncrime.\n  In just one counternarcotics operation in October 2009, a major \nlaboratory in Kandahar province in Afghanistan was raided. Sixteen \nTaliban were killed.\n  Roughly 1.8 metric tons of opium and heroin were seized at the lab--\nalong with improvised explosive devices, IEDs, IED bomb-making \nmaterials, and Taliban training manuals.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, took down 25 heroin \nprocessing labs in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2009. All of them had \nties to the Taliban.\n  In December 2009, before the House Armed Services Committee Karl W. \nEikenberry, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan testified that:\n\n       The cultivation of poppy and the trafficking of opium \n     without a doubt has the most debilitating effect of Afghan \n     society, feeding corruption and undermining the legal \n     economy, while generating funds for the insurgency.\n\n  Systemic corruption at all levels of the Afghan government remains a \nproblem fueled by the drug trade.\n  The two largest income-generators in Afghanistan are estimated to be \ndrugs and bribes, accounting for $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion per \nyear, respectively, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime \nreport: ``Corruption in Afghanistan,'' January 2010.\n  Together, that is equal to about half of the country's legitimate \nGDP. This shocking figure clearly identifies the two biggest problems \nin Afghanistan: drugs and corruption.\n  Additional resources for the counternarcotics mission are now being \ndeveloped after it was determined that drug trafficking clearly \nsupports the insurgency.\n  However, experts agree that it may take many years to get the drug \ntrade in Afghanistan under control.\n  Meanwhile, as the U.S. military plans to scale back its presence \nstarting in summer 2011, civilian personnel will remain to continue to \nsupport Afghans.\n  So the question comes: Will the civilian counternarcotics forces in \nAfghanistan have enough personnel and equipment to continue meaningful \noperations without the U.S. military?\n  As part of the Drug Caucus review, I asked that we identify which \nprograms and tools work, and which ones don't.\n  This report makes several recommendations, including: Increasing the \ncapacity of the Afghan counternarcotics forces; continuing U.S. support \nfor alternative livelihood programs and evaluating new program \nproposals; clarifying U.S. policy on eradication; increasing dedicated \nassets for air support of counternarcotics missions prior to the U.S. \nmilitary drawdown; utilizing narcotics investigations as a tool to root \nout and prosecute corrupt Afghan officials; and suggesting policymakers \ndevelop a counternarcotics plan as soon as possible for when the \nmilitary-to-civilian ratio changes.\n  Let me highlight one of the report's nine findings and \nrecommendations. This finding involves narco-terrorism investigations.\n  In addition to hearing testimony, we have spoken to experts from the \nDepartments of Justice, State, and Defense, nonpartisan think tanks, \nand intelligence community officials.\n  All agreed that it is essential to remove the leadership of the \nAfghan narco-cartels from the deadly mix of drug money and terror.\n  However, the Afghan judicial system is not capable of prosecuting and \nincarcerating high-value narcotics kingpins.\n  The good news is that there is a legal vehicle for U.S. law \nenforcement to remove these high-value targets.\n  In March 2006, as part of the Patriot Reauthorization Act, the United \nStates enacted title 21 United States Code section 960a.\n  Known as the Federal narco-terrorism statute, this law gives DEA the \nauthority to pursue narcotics and terrorism crimes committed anywhere \nin the world--if a link can be established between a drug offense and a \nterrorist act or group.\n  This statute can be applied worldwide. It has been particularly \neffective in combating major drug violators in Afghanistan.\n  These are the violators who are providing weapons and other \nsubstantial resources to the Taliban for use against American and \ncoalition forces, and against the innocent civilian population of \nAfghanistan.\n  DEA currently has two 13-agent units--the Bilateral Investigations \nUnit and the Terrorism Investigations Unit--which address this type of \nnarco-terrorism.\n  The Bilateral Investigations Unit primarily pursues cases of drugs \nbeing exported to the United States, and has been responsible for \nsuccessfully investigating and convicting major Mexican and Colombian \ndrug traffickers.\n  The Terrorism Investigations Unit investigates international criminal \norganizations that use illicit drug proceeds to promote and finance \nforeign terrorist organizations and acts of terror, pursuant to title \n21 U.S.C. Sec.  960a, narco-terrorism.\n  Agents with the Terrorism Investigations Unit have produced \nimpressive case results, including: obtaining the first conviction \nunder the new narco-terrorism law, against Khan Mohammed. Captured by \nDEA and Afghan Counternarcotics Police in Nangarhar Province in October \n2006, Khan Mohammed was convicted in May 2008 in U.S. District Court in \nWashington, DC. He received two life sentences for selling narcotics \nand intending to use the proceeds to purchase rockets to attack the \nU.S. military base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.\n  Indicting Haji Juma Khan and coordinating his arrest and expulsion \nfrom Indonesia on October 23, 2008. He was placed into DEA custody and \ntransported to New York, where he awaits trial. He is one of the \nworld's most significant heroin and opium traffickers, who provided \ndirect support to\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nthe Taliban from his drug trafficking revenue.\n  The Terrorism Investigations Unit worked in Afghanistan to capture \nHaji Bashir Noorzai, who was the world's largest heroin trafficker and \none of the five original founding members of the Taliban Ruling Shura \nin Kabul. He was convicted in the Southern District of New York and is \nnow serving a life sentence.\n  In December 2009, a Terrorism Investigations Unit investigation \nconfirmed that al-Qaida is becoming increasingly involved with the drug \ntrade, when Federal prosecutors in New York charged three people with \nties to al-Qaida and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, AQIM, in Africa \nwith narco-terrorism for conspiring to transport 500 kilograms of \ncocaine belonging to the FARC across Africa and into Europe.\n  This case marks the first time that associates of al-Qaida have been \ncharged with narco-terrorism offenses, as well as the first prosecution \nof crimes related to drug trafficking in support of terrorism in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  Based on the success of these investigative units and the conditions \nin Afghanistan, I believe it is important to stand up a new team to \nfocus directly on Afghanistan.\n  By providing funding for an Afghanistan team, the existing Terrorism \nInvestigations Unit would be able to continue their work in Africa on \nal-Qaida-linked organizations.\n  An Afghanistan team would also expand the Terrorism Investigations \nUnit's operations--currently focused in the South and East--to \nthroughout the country.\n  The contacts and leads they discover have produced, and will produce, \ncollateral intelligence for American and coalition forces. I am \nconfident that a new unit will produce additional indictments and \nconvictions of Taliban members and others for narco-terrorism.\n  Our findings have clearly identified that this is a program that \nworks. Simply put: Narco-terrorism investigations have proven to be an \neffective tool in Afghanistan. So it should be a priority for funding \nand action.\n  There's another area that should be a priority--helicopters. \nHelicopters are essential to this fight here's why:\n  After all our efforts--after the recruiting and training of Afghan \npolice, after developing intelligence, after following leads--the times \ncomes to lawfully arrest traffickers and seize their narcotics.\n  This requires a large force of law-enforcement personnel, supported \nby troops, and the counternarcotics team must be transported to the \ntarget location by helicopter.\n  Afghanistan is unlike most countries in the world in this respect. It \nis a vast country, with a challenging geography, and little in the way \nof passable roads. So helicopters are essential.\n  Unfortunately, many times there are no helicopters available, so the \nmission has to be scrubbed.\n  The Drug Caucus looked into this. We found that it is critical to \nhave dedicated helicopters for counternarcotics operations in \nAfghanistan. For example, last October Michael Braun, former Chief of \nOperations for DEA, told the Drug Caucus that:\n\n       The DEA's counter narco-terrorism operations and vitally \n     important intelligence gathering missions are routinely \n     delayed, often for several days, because the DEA lacks its \n     own organic helicopter assets in Afghanistan.''\n\n  The Government Accountability Office reported to Congress in March of \nthis year that:\n\n       Defense and DEA officials stated that airlift requirements \n     have grown beyond what was originally envisaged for the Air \n     Interdiction Unit, and they also stated they expected these \n     requirements to grow further as DEA expands into forward \n     operating bases\n\n  Attorney General Eric Holder told me this when I asked him on March \n22, at the Judiciary Committee about the lack of air assets for \ncounternarcotics operations:\n\n       The most significant factor we face in Afghanistan is \n     helicopter lift. DEA must have adequate helicopter lift \n     capacity that is night capable and flown by veteran pilots.\n\n  Recently, the Drug Caucus learned the following:\n  There are funds available, allocated by Congress and provided to the \nState Department, for supporting other civilian agencies operating in \nAfghanistan. These funds can be used for to obtain dedicated \nhelicopters for counternarcotics missions.\n  There are retired Navy Sikorsky helicopters mothballed at Davis-\nMonthan Air Force Base and elsewhere available at no cost.\n  The State Department has a contract with Sikorsky to refurbish up to \n110 S-61 helicopters over the next 5 years.\n  It will take approximately 9 months to refurbish these helicopters \nand get them to Afghanistan.\n  When I learned that we have these helicopters, a signed contract with \nSikorsky, and funds for the retrofit the helicopters were all available \nto meet the needs of the counternarcotics mission I thought great, \n``When will they be in country?''\n  Unfortunately, I cannot get an answer to that question because there \nhas been a hold placed on the final decision regarding these \nhelicopters. A hold that has lasted several months. This is \nunacceptable. Time is of the essence. These funds must be used now to \nprepare these helicopters to get them to Afghanistan by next spring.\n  I ask for the President and the Secretary of State's full support on \nthis matter so, for the first time, there will be helicopters dedicated \nto U.S.-led counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan.\n  Drug trafficking in Afghanistan provides more than 90 percent of the \nworld's opium.\n  It fuels the insurgency, corrupts public officials, and undermines \npolitical stability and the rule of law.\n  If we are to protect coalition forces from an influx of weapons now, \nand leave Afghanistan on firm footing, we must put an end to this \nrelationship between terrorism and drugs.\n  In September 2009, the executive director of the United Nations \nOffice of Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa had this to say:\n\n       Like never before, the fates of counter-narcotics and \n     counter-insurgency are inextricably linked.\n\n  On March 16 of this year at the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhearing General David Petraeus testified that:\n\n       Another major component of our strategy is to disrupt \n     narcotics trafficking, which provides significant funding to \n     the Taliban insurgency. This drug money has been the `oxygen' \n     in the air that allows these groups to operate.\n\n  What we have learned is that heroin is a weapon for the insurgents \nand the terrorists.\n  It kills people. It ruins lives. It leads to criminal behavior.\n  And it corrupts governments, putting a terrible burden and strain on \nsociety.\n  When he learned that a large shipment of heroin was heading to \nAmerican cities, convicted Afghan narco-terrorist Khan Mohammed was \nrecorded on a surveillance tape saying:\n\n       Good, may God turn all the infidels into dead corpses . . . \n     whether it is by opium or by shooting, this is our common \n     goal.\n\n  There can be no question that the drug trade in Afghanistan is \ninextricably linked to terrorism. So, the drug trade there must be met \nwith the same robust response, the same level of resolve, as our \nefforts against the insurgency.\n  Bottom line: If we ignore the drug problem in Afghanistan we will \nfail in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, this report may be found at http://\ndrugcaucus.Senate.gov.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6513-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6513-S6514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SEC FOIA EXEMPTION\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision in the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, section \n929I, that is attracting a lot of attention today, and for good reason. \nThe SEC cited it yesterday in seeking to block a Freedom of Information \nAct, FOIA, action brought by Fox Business News.\n  Press freedom is a subject that is very important to me and many \nother Members of Congress, and one which our country is keen to stress \nas important around the world. It would be ironic if the Dodd-Frank \nbill substantially diminished our own press freedoms. This is \nparticularly the case in the aftermath of a devastating financial \ncrisis when we now hope that greater transparency into our financial \ninstitutions, markets and regulatory agencies will help ensure that \nsystemic risks do not emerge and grow undetected.\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\n  Section 929I deals with ``records of registered persons,'' that is, \ninformation received by the SEC in the course of its oversight duties \nwith respect to any person or entity registered under the Securities \nand Exchange Act and other applicable laws, such as the Investment \nCompany Act and Investment Advisers Act. I am concerned that this \nprovision has been written far too broadly. Indeed, it appears to have \nthe effect of exempting from FOIA requests virtually all information \nreceived by the Securities and Exchange Commission from ``registered \npersons.'' An overbroad exclusion from public disclosure undermines the \nstrong public interest in transparency. Narrowing or eliminating this \nnew exclusion should be at the top of the list for a bill designed to \namend the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  Section 929I reads in part:\n\n       The Commission shall not be compelled to disclose records \n     or information obtained pursuant to section 17(b), or records \n     or information based upon or derived from such records or \n     information, if such records or information have been \n     obtained by the Commission for use in furtherance of the \n     purposes of this title, including surveillance, risk \n     assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities.\n\n  Let me repeat: The Commission shall not be compelled to disclose \nrecords or information if such records or information have been \nobtained by the Commission for use in furtherance of the purposes of \nthis title, including surveillance, risk assessments or other \nregulatory and oversight activities.\n  This provision is overly broad. I understand how it could help the \nSEC obtain information from the firms they examine when those firms are \nreluctant to turn over proprietary information that might later be \nsubject to FOIA requests. But FOIA already has exemptions in it to deal \nwith such concerns. If those exemptions need to be broadened, we should \nhave done so with a scalpel.\n  For example, the provision fails to differentiate between proprietary \ninformation that might be turned over to the SEC during an examination, \nfinancial information a firm may simply prefer not to provide, and \nmarket data collected through standard surveillance activities by the \nCommission. It is not difficult to imagine why hedge funds and other \ntrading firms would be reluctant to turn over proprietary algorithms: \nQuite simply, those computer programs likely contain loads of \nhistorical data, analysis, pattern recognition code and other tools \nthat comprise a trading firm's ``special sauce.'' Just as Coca-Cola and \nHeinz 57 have strong motivations to keep their recipes a secret, and \nhave done so for generations, so too do proprietary traders have strong \nincentives to guard their carefully written algorithms.\n  But data collected by the SEC as part of everyday surveillance \nactivities, including the data set to be collected pending the \nCommission's approval of ``large trader'' tagging and a consolidated \naudit trail, should fall into an entirely different category.\n  And as the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and the Senate's \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations have learned, financial \ncompanies are often reluctant to turn over extensive financial records \nthat permit the public to better understand complex financial \ntransactions and accounting practices.\n  As written, the exemption throws a cloak over all information \nreceived by the Commission from the entities the SEC regulates. It is \ntoo broad; it does not serve the public interest; it is not consistent \nwith the general goal of greater transparency, as President Obama has \nemphasized both with respect to FOIA and financial regulatory issues, \nand it should be reevaluated by the SEC and Congress.\n  As I understand it, the SEC has a legitimate concern now that it must \nexamine thousands of additional entities, including private equity and \nhedge funds that must for the first time must register under the \nInvestment Advisers Act. In the course of those examinations, a hedge \nfund may be reluctant to turn over information of a proprietary nature \nbecause it is concerned that despite the existing exemptions written \ninto the FOIA statute, the hedge fund cannot be certain whether a judge \nwill uphold the exemption. And so the hedge fund will be reluctant to \nturn over the information, and the SEC examiner may be stymied from \nreceiving it unless he or she turns the matter into an enforcement \naction.\n  It may be that Congress needs to give the SEC some additional ability \nto compel documents in such a situation, or perhaps provide some \nnarrowly tailored clarification to a FOIA exemption for financial \ninformation of a particularly sensitive proprietary nature. But this \nprovision as signed into law drops a net over such information that is \nfar too wide.\n  Indeed, in writing such a broad provision, Congress may have \ninadvertently encouraged registered entities to seek even more FOIA \nprotection before cooperating with the SEC. That is because the logical \ncorollary of protecting confidential information is to insist on a \nwider scope of confidential information, which, in turn, further erodes \nboth our press freedoms and market transparency.\n  In addition, the SEC may be legitimately concerned that it could be \nrequired to turn over sensitive proprietary information in response to \na third-party subpoena issued in litigation to which the SEC is not \neven a party. Once again, however, Congress should carefully examine \nthe appropriate contours of third-party discovery requests to the SEC. \nIt should not categorically exclude information held by the SEC based \nonly upon its status as having been obtained from a ``registered \nperson.''\n  Over the last few years, the credibility of our markets has been \ndamaged. Only transparency can best restore that credibility; any \nexemptions to transparency should hence be narrowly crafted. Section \n929I needs a ``do-over.'' In the coming weeks, I hope to work with the \nSEC and other Senators to craft a more reasonable approach that \nsatisfies the legitimate concerns of the SEC without sacrificing the \ngoals of transparency and public accountability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6514-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6514-S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the National Urban League on celebrating 100 \nyears of enabling African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, \nparity, power, and civil rights.\n  The National Urban League is a historic civil rights organization \ndedicated to economic empowerment in order to elevate the standard of \nliving in historically underserved urban communities. Founded in 1910 \nand headquartered in New York City, the National Urban League \nspearheads the efforts of its local affiliates through the development \nof programs, public policy research, and advocacy. Today, there are \nmore than 100 local affiliates in 36 States and the District of \nColumbia, providing direct services that impact and improve the lives \nof more than 2 million people nationwide.\n  This week, some of the Nation's foremost power brokers, celebrities, \ncorporate leaders, and activists are convening at the Washington \nConvention Center in the Nation's Capital to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the National Urban League. The Centennial Conference \nmarks the completion of the first century of leadership and service and \nnow prepare for a new civil rights strategy to meet the new challenges \nto equal opportunity in America.\n  The National Urban League employs a five-point approach to provide \neconomic empowerment, educational opportunities, and the guarantee of \ncivil rights for African Americans: education and youth empowerment, \nwhich ensures the education of all children by providing access to \nearly childhood literacy, aftercare programs and college scholarships; \neconomic empowerment, which invests in the financial literacy and \nemployability of adults through job training, home ownership, and \nentrepreneurship; health and quality of life empowerment, which \npromotes community wellness through a focus on prevention, including \nfitness, healthy eating, and access to affordable healthcare; civic \nengagement and leadership empowerment, which encourages all people to \ntake an active role to improve quality of life through participation in \ncommunity service projects and public policy initiatives; and civil \nrights and racial justice empowerment, which guarantees equal \nparticipation in all facets of American society through proactive \npublic policies and community-based programs.\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the National Urban \nLeague on its 100th anniversary and in wishing them the best for years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6515-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THOMAS L. CHARLTON\n\n Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as a longtime public servant, I \nhave always had the utmost regard for individuals who dedicate \nthemselves to a greater cause.\n  Among these, educators stand out in my mind as especially worthy of \nthanks and recognition.\n  I often say that educators have an eternal impact on our country's \nyouth.\n  From primary school through graduate school, these dedicated men and \nwomen are charged with shaping the next generation of Americans.\n  They provide our Nation's young people with the inspiration to \nachieve, and the tools to succeed in a global marketplace.\n  So today, I honor one such educator, Professor Thomas L. Charlton--a \nbrilliant scholar, a remarkable advocate for the values of higher \nlearning, and an avid student of history in his own right.\n  Professor Charlton began his career in 1962, at San Antonio College, \nwhere he taught as many as five classes at one time.\n  He developed a passion for teaching that would guide him for the rest \nof his career. After he earned his Ph.D. in 1969 at the University of \nTexas at Austin, he became a professor of history at Baylor University.\n  At Baylor, he founded the Institute for Oral History. And over the \nnext quarter century, he presided over its ascension as one of the top \noral history research centers in the country.\n  He pushed for excellence at every turn, and he dedicated himself to \nthe preservation of our rich past.\n  In 1981, Dr. Charlton authored a landmark academic text on the oral \nhistory of Texas, entitled ``Oral History for Texans.''\n  The following year, he became founding president of the Texas Oral \nHistory Association and saw his national reputation grow by leaps and \nbounds.\n  But for all the acclaim and success that he enjoyed, those who know \nProfessor Charlton will be quick to point out that he is never happier \nthan when he is out in the field with a group of his graduate students.\n  He has never lost the passion for teaching that he discovered in the \nearly days of his career--a passion which has guided him to this day.\n  In the last two decades, Professor Charlton served the Baylor \ncommunity as vice provost for research, and later as director of the \nTexas Collection library.\n  And after nearly half a century of dedicated service at the college \nlevel, he announced his retirement earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, today I honor the tremendous contributions Thomas \nCharlton has made during his remarkable career.\n  I celebrate the achievements that have marked his tenure and the \nlives he touched at every step along the way.\n  But even as we wish him a happy retirement and recognize the \nindelible mark he has left on Baylor University, I cannot help but \nreflect that, among his students, his peers, and all who share his \ndedication, he will be sorely missed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6515-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.

Sulick, Director of the National Clandestine \nService of the Central Intelligence Agency, who will retire tomorrow, \nJuly 30, 2010. Mr. Sulick's career spans over 30 years in the CIA \nduring which he distinguished himself as a patriot, leader, and friend \nof the U.S. Senate. Mike Sulick also served as a marine in Vietnam from \n1968 to 1969.\n  It is a rare opportunity to pay tribute publicly to one of the men \nand women who serve beyond the front lines, working in secret to \nprotect and serve the Nation. Having ``come in from the cold,'' I am \npleased to be able to say a few words about Mike.\n  A New York native, Mr. Sulick graduated from Fordham University in \n1971 with a B.A. degree in Russian language/literature and continued at \nthe University to earn a M.A. in Russian language/literature in 1972. \nIn 1977, he received a doctorate in comparative literature from City \nUniversity of New York, NY.\n  During his career, Mike served more than 11 years abroad in Asia, \nLatin America, Poland, and Russia, where he was able to use his \nlanguage fluency of Spanish, Polish, and Russian. In headquarters \nassignments, he served as Chief of Liaison in the Office of \nCongressional Affairs, Chief of Central Eurasia Division, Chief of \nCounterintelligence, and as the Deputy Director and later as Director \nof the National Clandestine Service.\n  Mr. Sulick retired from the CIA as the Deputy Director of the \nNational Clandestine Service in 2004. In 2007, Mike heeded the call of \nservice when he was asked by the CIA Director, GEN Michael Hayden, and \nhis Deputy Director, Steve Kappes, to rejoin the Agency. He has been \nthe head of the clandestine service for the past 3 years.\n  In this capacity, he had frequent interaction with Senators and staff \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His professionalism, \nmature judgment, sage advice, and interpersonal skills earned him the \nrespect and confidence of the committee. His sound judgment, courage, \nand candor also directly contributed to his successful representation \nof the CIA's interests before the committee and Congress.\n  Throughout his career, Mike Sulick demonstrated a profound commitment \nto our Nation, a selfless service to the CIA, a deep concern for Agency \nofficers and their families, and a commitment to excellence. Mike is a \nconsummate professional whose performance, in over 30 years of service, \nhas personified those traits of courage, competency, and integrity that \nour Nation has come to expect and so desperately needs from its \nprofessional intelligence officers.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Mike \nSulick for his honorable service to the Central Intelligence Agency and \nthe people of the U.S. and also thanking Mike's wife Shirley for her \nsupport and understanding, as well as her sacrifices in allowing Mike \nto selflessly commit himself to protecting our Nation.\n  We wish Mike and Shirley Sulick all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6515-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SPRINGFIELD BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I honor in the Record \nSpringfield Baptist Church in Greensboro, GA.\n  On August 15, 2010, the Georgia Historical Society will place a \npermanent marker recognizing this historic church as the oldest \nAfrican-American church in Greene County. Established in 1864, \nSpringfield Baptist Church has been a place of faith, hope, and dreams \nfor its members for almost 150 years.\n  This isn't the first time that Springfield Baptist Church has been \nhonored for its important place in Greene County's history.

Mr. President, today I honor a true American \nhero, Mr. Pius Bannis.\n  Mr. Bannis is the field office director for U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services stationed in the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, \nHaiti. During the darkest moments of the devastating earthquake of \nJanuary 12, 2010, that destroyed Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Mr. Bannis \nbravely performed his duties.\n  As we know, children are the most vulnerable victims of any \ndisaster--let alone the tragic January 12, 2010, earthquake causing \ndevastation of monumental proportions in Haiti. In the immediate \naftermath of this tragedy, Mr. Bannis selflessly worked around the \nclock to ensure hundreds of orphaned Haitian children were removed from \nharm's way and placed in a\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\nsafe environment with loving American families. It was during these \nvery emotional moments Mr. Bannis heroically united families but never \nwavered from his sworn duty of upholding the law as a field office \ndirector for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. His heroic \nactions will afford countless orphaned children an opportunity to build \na better life in the wake of this tragedy.\n  Today I wish to recognize Mr. Bannis' extraordinary leadership. I \ncommend him and his colleagues of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices for their selfless sacrifices and service to protect the most \nvulnerable victims of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6516-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING REAR ADMIRAL LeROY COLLINS, JR.\n\n Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, today I wish to give special \nrecognition to the life and work of a friend and fellow Floridian, \nformer U.S. Navy RADM LeRoy Collins, Jr . I had the pleasure of working \nclosely with Admiral Collins during my time with the Governor's office \nand more recently on federal issues improving health care for veterans. \nHe was a fifth-generation Floridian who came from a long line of public \nservants and will always be remembered for his commitment to the \nmilitary community and our State.\n  A native of Tallahassee, FL, LeRoy Collins received his commission \nfrom the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1956 and began a long career with \nthe Navy. His first tour was aboard the amphibious transport USS \nCalvert, followed by a Submarine Officer's Basic Course in Groton, CT. \nLater, he served aboard the submarine USS Chivo. Through hard work, \ndedication and sacrifice, LeRoy earned the rank of rear admiral.\n  Admiral Collins served as an analyst for Naval Intelligence in \nWashington, DC and as a ballistic missile weapons officer aboard the \nnuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine USS James Madison. After a \nbrief tour working missile test operations at Naval Ordnance Training \nUnit in Cape Canaveral, he transferred to the Navy Reserve in 1966.\n  While a naval reservist, Admiral Collins served as commanding officer \nof the coastal minesweeper USS Thrush and later as commander of various \nNavy Reserve submarine units. During his time, he was the Navy's \nliaison to the Florida National Guard and also commanding officer of \nthe Navy liaison unit at U.S. Readiness Command, headquartered at \nMacDill Air Force Base, FL.\n  The admiral served as Commander, Naval Reserve Readiness Command, \nRegion 8 and later as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Reserve) for \nLogistics, Pentagon, until his retirement from the Navy Reserve as a \ntwo-star rear admiral in October, 1990.\n  Throughout his service in the Navy Reserve, Admiral Collins was also \na businessman. He spent time with the Florida Power & Light Company and \nIBM. He was the founding president of Financial Transaction Systems, \nInc., and president of Telecredit Service Center, Inc. In addition, he \nserved as president of Dynamic Realty of Tampa, Inc., was chairman of \nGateway Holdings, Inc., and served as president of the Armed Forces \nFinancial Network.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Admiral Collins, a \npillar of our great State, for his service to our Nation and his \ncommitment to helping Florida's veterans. His work for Florida's \nveterans, their families and survivors in improving their health and \nwell-being will be greatly missed.\n  Admiral Collins served his country diligently, with pride, and with \nhonor. On behalf of all Floridians, and specifically the nearly 1.8 \nmillion veterans who call Florida home, I thank him for his service and \nknow he will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6516-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE AUSTIN HAY\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate and honor George \nAustin Hay on his recent retirement as a multimedia specialist for the \nU.S. Department of Transportation, DOT. As a former resident of, and \noriginally from, Johnstown, PA, Mr. Hay's 37 years with the Federal \nHighway Administration capped an extraordinary career of 55 years of \npublic service with the Federal Government. He has distinguished \nhimself as a truly dedicated public servant.\n  Mr. Hay joined the Department of Defense in 1955 as a motion picture \nproducer and casting director at the Department's Army Pictorial Center \nin Astoria, New York--the most expansive government film facility and, \nat that time, the fourth largest studio and sound stage in the world. \nThere he produced Army training films, Government documentaries, and \nDefense Department short subjects. While employed at the Department of \nDefense, Mr. Hay had the privilege of working with some of Hollywood's \nbest, including Paul Newman, Edward R. Murrow, Ed Asner, Henry Fonda, \nGene Hackman, Dick Cavett, and Ronald Reagan, all of whom Mr. Hay hired \nfor military training films. He also developed a friendship with Walter \nCronkite.\n  In 1973, Mr. Hay was called to Washington to fill the shoes of the \nretiring chief of the Federal Highway Administration's photographic \nsection. While at the Federal Highway Administration, Mr. Hay produced \nhis crowning achievement in film: ``Highways of History.'' This film \nnarrative depicts the history of transportation in the United States. \nThe film has been shown on television and has been distributed to high \nschools and universities with an estimation of more than 1 million \nviewers over the last 30 years.\n  As a multimedia specialist, Mr. Hay was involved with an extensive \nphoto and illustration search program. He has researched information to \ndescribe hundreds of selected images showing excellence in highway \ndesign, outstanding bridge structures, and multimodal transportation. \nMr. Hay was also responsible for historical exhibits, and was widely \nknown for his wealth of knowledge about the Federal Highway \nAdministration's history, as well as the history of America's roadways. \nAs an integral part of the publishing and visual communications team, \nhe has written numerous fascinating articles that chronicle the \ndevelopment of our modern transportation system.\n  In his spare time, Mr. Hay has also appeared as an extra in more than \n100 movies. His film credits include walking beside Cary Grant in the \nAlfred Hitchcock masterpiece, ``North by Northwest.'' Today, Mr. Hay \ncontinues to act as an extra, averaging two films per year.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Hay's outstanding efforts have enhanced \nDOT's public image by bringing positive transportation messages to \ncitizens across the Nation. His multimedia products have depicted \nsignificant historical events and garnered widespread attention, as \nwell as notable commendations. His fascinating articles, films, and \nexhibits have chronicled the development of our modern transportation \nsystem. His work demonstrates an extraordinary ability to harness \nknowledge about DOT's history, as well as the history of America's \ntransportation system. Mr. Hay has provided an invaluable service for \nmany years, and his achievements will have a lasting legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6516-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GANN VALLEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to promote the strengthening of the private sector in \nPakistan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nlead to the establishment of the Pakistan-American Enterprise Fund on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kerry. The Pakistan-American Enterprise \nFund bill authorizes the Administration to allocate, from existing \nfunds granted under the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, \nsuch sums as required to create the Fund. The mission of the Fund will \nbe to help empower Pakistan's private sector to create jobs, which will \ncontribute towards achieving long-term social stability and economic \ngrowth.\n  The failed attack that occurred on May 1, 2010 in Times Square \nreinforces the need for our governments to work together to neutralize \nthe imminent threats posed by terrorist waiting to strike, while \nsimultaneously preventing the cancer of extremism from spreading and \ncorrupting local communities in both our countries.\n  It was to help undergird such cooperation that President Obama last \nyear signed the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan \nAct authorizing $7.5 billion over 5 years. This non-military aid \npackage is intended to help reverse Pakistan's converging crises of a \ngrowing al-Qaeda sanctuary, an expanding Taliban insurgency, a failing \neconomy and deteriorating human development indicators. These \nconditions were intensifying turmoil and violence in the country, \nhelping to incubate extremism and putting in question the security of \nPakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal, as well as our own domestic \nsecurity.\n  In order to directly address Pakistan's troubling economic \ntrajectory, the Pakistan-American Enterprise Fund will work with the \nprivate sector to catalyze indigenous job creation, which will empower \nthe people of Pakistan to help themselves. Entrepreneurial innovation \nis the engine that fuels sustainable economic growth and development. \nPakistan currently enjoys a vibrant private sector, especially among \nsmall and medium size enterprises, but more must be done to encourage \nbusiness formation and expansion.\n  According to the World Bank, small and medium size enterprises, SMEs, \nin\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\nPakistan account for nearly 90 percent of all businesses, 80 percent of \nall non-agricultural employees, and 40 percent of annual GDP. If the \ncountry is to emerge as a commercial partner and regional leader, SMEs \nmust receive a strong transfusion of investment capital so that gainful \nemployment exists as an alternative to the financial incentives offered \nby radical groups in Pakistan.\n  In addition to providing much needed capital to aspiring and \nestablished Pakistani entrepreneurs, the Fund will provide a vehicle \nthrough which we might also export the entrepreneurial instincts and \nexperience that are widely dispersed, but largely untapped, among US \nfinancial experts. Sustainable entrepreneurial activity requires a \ncombination of financial and intellectual capital. Delivering both of \nthese ingredients effectively is essential.\n  USAID has demonstrated a limited capacity to deliver this type of \nrelevant, usable assistance when needed. Currently under-resourced for \nand over-stretched by the task of rebuilding the infrastructures and \neconomies of Iraq, Afghanistan and now Haiti--while simultaneously \nrebuilding the agency itself--USAID's efforts would be enhanced by the \nexpertise the Fund could bring to bear.\n  The creation of a Fund for Pakistan, like many of its predecessors, \ncould couple financial and intellectual capital in a framework that is \nuniquely suited to addressing the financial and technical assistance \nneeds in distressed economies like Pakistan. Appointed by the \npresident, the Board of Directors, comprised of 4 private citizens of \nthe United States and 3 private citizens of Pakistan who serve without \ncompensation, will leverage their experience and expertise operating in \ninternational and emerging markets to oversee the Fund, which will be \nbased in Pakistan. In turn, the Board would hire and direct a group of \nAmerican and Pakistani bankers, who would be dispatched, using existing \nfunds granted under the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, \nto provide technical assistance and traditional financial products, \nlike working capital loans and 3 to 5 year cash flow term loans for \nexpansion capital, to the private sector.\n  While the enterprise fund model is not perfect, it is a tested \nmechanism for promoting economic growth and reinvigorating fledgling \neconomies. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Congress, through \nenactment of the Support for East European Development Act, SEED, and \nthe Freedom Support Act, FSA, authorized nearly $1.2 billion for USAID \nto establish ten new investment funds, collectively known as the \n``Enterprise Funds'', throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the \nFormer Soviet Union. These funds channeled funding into over 500 \nenterprises in 19 countries, leveraged an additional $5 billion in \nprivate investment capital from outside the U.S. Government, provided \nsubstantial development capital where supply was limited, created or \nsustained over 260,000 jobs through investment and development \nactivities, funded $74 million in technical assistance to strengthen \nthe private sector and is expected to recoup 137 percent of the \noriginal USAID funding.\n  Pakistan's economy has shown resilience in the face of many \nchallenges since the 1960s. However, today the country stands at a \ncrossroads. If Pakistan is to repress extremist voices and emerge as a \nmore reliable partner in the 21st century, we must empower the private \nsector to create jobs and contribute towards a sustainable future. The \ncreation of the Pakistan-American Enterprise Fund would help to achieve \nthis positive outcome. I ask for your support on passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3666. A bill to authorize certain Department of State personnel, \nwho are responsible for examining and processing United States passport \napplications, to be able to access certain Federal, State, and other \ndatabases, for the purpose of verifying the identity of a passport \napplicant, to reduce the incidence of fraud, to require the \nauthentication of identification documents submitted by passport \napplicants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on May 5, 2009, over 14 months ago, I \nchaired a Terrorism Subcommittee hearing entitled the Passport Issuance \nProcess: Closing the Door to Fraud. Today we are holding Part II of \nthat hearing. During the hearing last year, we learned about a \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, undercover investigation that \nhad been requested by Senators Kyl and Feinstein to test the \neffectiveness of the passport issuance process, and to determine \nwhether malicious individuals such as terrorists, spies, or other \ncriminals could use counterfeit documents to obtain a genuine U.S. \npassport. What we learned from GAO was that ``terrorists or criminals \ncould steal an American citizen's identity, use basic counterfeiting \nskills to create fraudulent documents for that identity, and obtain a \ngenuine U.S. passport.'' But that 2009 GAO report was not the first \ntime that problems with the passport issuance process were identified. \nIn 2005 and 2007, GAO also brought these issues to light.\n  Vulnerabilities in the passport issuance process are very serious \nbecause the U.S. passport is the gold standard for identification. A \nU.S. passport can be used for many purposes in this country, and it \ngives an individual the ability to travel internationally, which is an \nimportant tool for someone who wants to do us harm, including \nterrorists, spies, and other criminals. So the integrity and security \nof the passport issuance process is extremely important because it can \nhave a profound impact on the national security of the United States.\n  A new GAO undercover investigation that I requested, along with \nSenators Kyl, Feinstein, Lieberman and Collins, has revealed that while \nsome improvements have been made by the State Department, the passport \nissuance process is still susceptible to fraud.\n  As a result, today I am introducing, along with Senators Feinstein \nand Lieberman, the Passport Identity Verification Act. This legislation \nis a common-sense solution that will give the State Department the \nlegal authorities that it needs to access information contained in \nFederal, State, and other databases that can be used to verify the \nidentity of every passport applicant, and to detect passport fraud, \nwithout extending the time that the State Department takes to approve \npassports. The legislation also requires the State Department to \npromulgate regulations, procedures, and policies to limit access to \nthis information, and to ensure that personnel involved in the passport \nissuance process only access this information for authorized purposes. \nThese are very important privacy and security protections in this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of State to conduct a \nformal study examining whether biometric information and technology can \nbe used to enhance the ability to verify the identity of a passport \napplicant and to detect passport fraud.\n  I understand that the American people can become concerned when their \ntravel plans, whether for leisure or business, are linked to their \nability to obtain a passport in a timely fashion. But we have got to \nget this right, and it is not simply a question of process, techniques, \nand training. We need to make sure that the agencies that are \nresponsible for processing passport application documents are concerned \nabout national security as well as customer service, and we need to \nmake sure they have the legal authorities, the resources, and the \ntechnology they need to verify the identity of a passport applicant and \nto detect passport fraud.\n  We simply cannot issue U.S. passports in this country on the basis of \nfraudulent documents. There is too much at stake. We have the \ntechnology and the information to prevent such issuance. The Passport \nIdentity Verification Act will dramatically improve the State \nDepartment's ability to detect passport fraud.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Passport Identity \n     Verification Act''.\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A United States passport is an official government \n     document issued by the Department of State, which can be \n     obtained by United States nationals.\n       (2) A valid United States passport has many uses, \n     including--\n       (A) certifying an individual's identity and verifying that \n     a person is a United States national;\n       (B) allowing the passport holder to travel to foreign \n     countries with an internationally recognized travel document;\n       (C) facilitating international travel;\n       (D) obtaining further identification documents; and\n       (E) setting up bank accounts.\n       (3) A United States national may obtain a United States \n     passport for the first time by applying in person to a \n     passport acceptance facility with 2 passport photographs, \n     proof of United States nationality, and a valid form of photo \n     identification, such as a driver's license. Passport \n     acceptance facilities are located throughout the United \n     States.\n       (4) Because United States passports issued under a false \n     identity enable individuals to conceal their movements and \n     activities, passport fraud could facilitate--\n       (A) acts of terrorism;\n       (B) espionage; and\n       (C) other crimes, such as illegal immigration, money \n     laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and alien \n     smuggling.\n       (5) Since malicious individuals may seek to exploit \n     potential vulnerabilities in the passport issuance process, \n     it is important that personnel who are involved in the \n     granting, refusal, revocation, or adjudication of United \n     States passport applications have access to certain \n     information contained in Federal, State, and other databases \n     for the purpose of--\n       (A) verifying the identity of a passport applicant; or\n       (B) detecting passport fraud.\n       (6) In its final report, the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as \n     the ``9/11 Commission'') concluded that funding and \n     completing a ``biometric entry-exit screening system'' for \n     travelers to and from the United States is essential to our \n     national security.\n       (7) The use of biometrics and technology for foreign \n     nationals who are visiting the country helps to make travel \n     simple, easy, and convenient for legitimate visitors and \n     dramatically improves the ability to detect the activities of \n     those who wish to do harm or violate United States laws.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACCESS TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND OTHER DATABASES.\n\n       (a) Powers and Duties of the Secretary of State.--Section \n     104 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1104) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Law Enforcement Activities.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the powers, duties, and functions \n     conferred upon Department of State personnel relating to the \n     granting, refusal, revocation, or adjudication of passports \n     shall be considered law enforcement activities that involve \n     the administration of criminal justice (as defined in section \n     20.3 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations) when such \n     personnel seek to--\n       ``(1) verify the identity of a passport applicant; or\n       ``(2) detect passport fraud.''.\n       (b) Data Exchange.--Section 105 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1105) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) The Attorney General and the Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, after consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, shall promptly implement a system, \n     consistent with applicable security and training protocols \n     and requirements, that will enable Department of State \n     personnel designated by the Secretary of State, or by the \n     designee of the Secretary, who are responsible for the \n     granting, refusal, revocation, or adjudication of United \n     States passports, to have real-time access to the criminal \n     history information contained in the National Crime \n     Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-\n     III), including the corresponding automated criminal history \n     records, Wanted Person Files, and other files maintained by \n     the National Crime Information Center, for the purpose of \n     verifying the identity of the United States passport \n     applicant, or detecting passport fraud.\n       ``(6) The Secretary of State, or the designee of the \n     Secretary, shall designate Department of State personnel who, \n     in accordance with this Act shall be authorized to have real-\n     time access to the information contained in the files \n     described in paragraph (5), without any fee or charge, to \n     enable named-based and other searches to be conducted for the \n     purpose of verifying the identity of a passport applicant or \n     detecting passport fraud.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (d) and (e), respectively;\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Data Sharing.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the powers, duties, and functions conferred upon \n     Department of State personnel relating to the granting, \n     refusal, revocation, or adjudication of passports shall be \n     considered law enforcement activities that involve the \n     administration of criminal justice (as defined in section \n     20.3 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations) when such \n     personnel seek to verify the identity of a passport \n     applicant, or seek to detect passport fraud by accessing or \n     using information contained in databases maintained by any \n     Federal, State, tribal, territory, or local government \n     department or agency, or private entity or organization, that \n     contains--\n       ``(1) criminal history information or records;\n       ``(2) driver's license information or records;\n       ``(3) marriage, birth, or death information or records;\n       ``(4) naturalization and immigration records; or\n       ``(5) other information or records that can verify the \n     identity of the passport applicant or can detect passport \n     fraud.''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Data Sharing Regulations, Procedures, and Policies.--\n     Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this subsection, the Secretary of State shall promulgate \n     final regulations, procedures, and policies to govern the \n     access by Department of State personnel to the information \n     contained in databases described in subsection (c).

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to exclude child care from the determination of the 5-year limit on \nassistance under the temporary assistance to needy families program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our Nation has suffered through the worst \nrecession since the 1930s. As the economy begins to recover, the \navailability of affordable and safe child care is a necessary component \nof enabling parents to find and maintain employment to support their \nfamily.\n  The recession has caused States across the country to scale back \nfunding for child care. The waiting lists for subsidized child care in \nsome States are beginning to rise and a few states have stopped or are \nplanning to stop providing child care assistance to families who are \nnot receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, altogether. \nRestrictions of the availability of child care assistance make it \nharder for parents to afford child care and force some parents to leave \ntheir jobs and turn to welfare programs for support. That is wrong and \nwe can do better.\n  Child care consumes a large portion of family budgets, and can range \nfrom $4,560 to $15,895 annually for full-time care depending on where \nthe family lives, the type of care, and the age of the child. Child \ncare prices are higher than other household expenses and typically \nexceed the average amount families spend on food. In 39 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, the average annual price for child care for an \ninfant in a child care center was higher than a year's tuition at many \n4-year public colleges.\n  Without assistance, low-income families can find it impossible to \nsecure child care. For example, in 2005, the median monthly income of \nfamilies receiving child care assistance was just $15,396 a year. \nNearly half of, 49 percent, of families receiving child care assistance \nlive below the poverty line and 86 percent of these families were \nsingle parent households.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased mandatory child care \nfunding by $1 billion over 5 years, fiscal years 2006 to 2010. Without \nlegislative action this funding will expire on September 30, 2010.\n  The President's fiscal year 2011 budget calls for mandatory child \ncare to be reauthorized and provided an $800 million increase above the \npast 5 years. This increase is necessary because only about one in six \nchildren eligible for Federal child care assistance receives help.\n  Today I am introducing the Children First Act to address the growing \nunmet need for affordable and safe child care. I am pleased Senator \nLincoln is an original cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The Children First Act would help states meet the significant demand \nfor child care assistance by increasing funding for mandatory child \ncare by $800 million annually for fiscal year 2011 through 2015. This \nlegislation would also annually index mandatory child care funding to \ninflation beginning in fiscal year 2012. This increased funding would \nallow approximately 117,500 more children to have access to safe and \naffordable child care.\n  The Children First Act would exclude child care from the definition \nof TANF assistance so that unemployed families who receive child care \nassistance will not have it count towards the 5-year time limit for \nFederal TANF assistance. The legislation would also ensure that the \nminimum child care health and safety standards required for providers \nreceiving Child Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, funding also apply \nto providers who receive funding through TANF. In Massachusetts, all \nlicensed providers are required to the same health and safety standards \nregardless of subsidy type received.\n  This legislation would increase the availability of child care for \nparents who are required to work. States are currently prohibited from \nwithholding or reducing assistance to a single parent with children \nunder 6 who does not meet work requirements for reasons related to the \nunavailability or unsuitability of appropriate, affordable child care \narrangements. The Children First Act would prevent States from \nwithholding to reducing child care assistance to parents of a child \nwith children under age 13.\n  Enactment of this legislation is incredibly important for my home \nState of Massachusetts which currently has approximately 18,000 \nchildren on a waitlist for child care subsidies. Approximately half of \nthe parents with at least one preschool age child in the household have \nbeen on the waitlist for 13 months or more.\n  The high cost of child care is the most significant issue facing \nfamilies currently on the waitlist in Massachusetts. Massachusetts \nfamilies pay more on average than families in any other state for most \ntypes of child care; the average price of full time care in center \nbased settings is: $15,895 for an infant and $11,678 for a preschooler. \nThis means a single parent at the State median income in Massachusetts, \n$26,680, would have to spend nearly 44 percent of their income to pay \nfor the average full day pre-kindergarten program.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Children First Act and who have \nendorsed it today, including the American Federation of State, County, \nand Municipal Employees, AFSCME, the Children's Defense Fund, CLASP, \nthe First Focus Campaign for Children, the National Women's Law Center, \nthe Service Employees International Union, SEIU, and the YMCA of the \nUSA.\n  These reforms would significantly increase access to stable and \naffordable child care to low-income families and would make our \nnation's children more prepared for school and success later in life. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 3668. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish a demonstration program to award grants to, and enter into \ncontracts with, medical-legal partnerships to assist patients and their \nfamilies to navigate health-related programs and activities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bayh and Senator Bond \nto introduce the Medical-Legal Partnership for Health Act. This \nlegislation builds upon the great work that medical-legal partnerships \nare doing every day, all across the United States.\n  Medical-legal partnerships bring legal aid services into medical \nsettings, such as hospitals and community health centers, to provide \npatients with legal help to address conditions that lead to poor \nhealth, lengthy hospital stays, and repeated emergency room visits. \nImagine, for example, that your child develops chronic ear infections. \nYou repeatedly bring your sick child to the local emergency room, \nstruggling each time to pay the high costs of medical care and \nprescription antibiotics. Imagine further that you are the head of a \nlow-income family, you don't have health insurance or the money to pay \nfor the ER visits, and the hospital or community bears the brunt of the \ncosts.\n  Medical-legal partnerships can help break this expensive and \navoidable cycle. If the emergency room doctor is trained in screening \nfor families who could benefit from legal intervention, the doctor may \nlearn, for example, that the family's landlord refuses to turn on the \nheat in their apartment building. The frigid temperatures in their home \nhave made their child more susceptible to illness, which explains the \nchronic ear infections. By referring the patient to the hospital's \nmedical-legal partnership program, the family receives legal aid to go \nafter the slumlord and require the heat to be turned on, and the \nchildren's ear infections stop. As a consequence, the family is \nhealthier, their home is warm, and both they and the hospital save on \nhealth costs. All of this is possible because of a low-cost, common-\nsense intervention.\n  The first medical-legal partnership was started in Boston in 1993, \nand since\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nthen, 85 more have sprung up in 38 States. These centers can serve \nmultiple hospitals and clinics within a community. Currently, medical-\nlegal partnerships support more than 200 hospitals, clinics, and health \ncenters. They help vulnerable patients resolve social conditions that \nlead to poor health outcomes, such as getting a landlord to change air \nfilters to help minimize asthma and allergies, assisting victims of \ndomestic violence with preventing future abuse, and helping terminally \nill patients make custodial arrangements for their dependent children.\n  In many cases, patients aren't even aware that their health \nchallenges are caused by their living environment, or that their \nproblem can be addressed through the legal system.\n  After graduating from law school, I served as a Legal Services \nattorney in Iowa. I learned first-hand how crucial this assistance is \nto struggling families and individuals who have no place else to turn \nwhen they are taken advantage of or abused. I know the invaluable legal \nhelp provided to battered women trying to leave abusive relationships \nwhile fearing for their safety and the safety of their children. I know \nthat, without access to the legal system, the poor are often powerless \nagainst the injustices they suffer.\n  I am very proud to say that my home State of Iowa has a particularly \nsuccessful partnership. The Iowa Legal Aid Health and Law Project \nharnesses the talents of Iowa physicians and attorneys to improve the \nlives of vulnerable Iowans. Many times these situations involve \nsubstandard housing, discrimination, elder abuse, or problems accessing \ndisability, Social Security, health, or veteran's benefits. By \npartnering with 17 hospitals and health centers across my State, the \nIowa Legal Aid Health and Law Project is able to extend services from \nSioux City to Dubuque, and from Council Bluffs to Fort Dodge. Last \nyear, the program served 880 Iowans, and 94 percent of their cases had \na positive outcome. The Iowa Legal Aid Health and Law Project does a \nremarkable job. They are just one example of the great work going on \nacross the country.\n  You may be surprised to learn that when it comes to medical-legal \npartnerships, a little money can go a long way. Iowa's program was \nstarted with a Federal investment of less than $300,000. The program \nprevents hospital admissions and emergency room visits that cost \nhospitals and patients many thousands of dollars in health care costs \nand insurance premiums. A modest investment in these community programs \ncan help people achieve healthier, safer lives and prevent future \nhospitalizations and health care costs. That sounds like common sense \nto me. And that's why, today, I am proud to introduce the Medical-Legal \nPartnership for Health Act along with Senators Bayh and Bond: to give \nhealth care providers and lawyers across the country the opportunity to \nstart such programs.\n  The Act creates a Federal demonstration program to help create, \nstrengthen, and evaluate medical-legal partnerships. Overall, this \nlegislation will support 60 MLP sites in community health centers, the \nVeterans Administration, hospitals, and other health care settings.\n  In the spirit of compromise and bipartisanship, we have taken \ncontentious issues off the table. For example, the bill excludes \nFederal money from being used toward class action law suits, medical \nmalpractice cases, representation of undocumented individuals, and \nabortion or abortion-counseling services.\n  In addition to having bipartisan support, medical-legal partnerships \nhave been praised by prominent organizations representing physicians \nand attorneys. They have received endorsement from the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Bar Association, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Hospital Association, and the Accreditation \nCouncil of Graduate Medical Education, to name just a few.\n  Through this community-based, common-sense investment in addressing \nthe social effects of poverty, we will be able to help so many of our \nmost at-risk citizens to avoid illness and hospitalization.\n  I extend my sincere thanks to Senator Bayh and Senator Bond for their \nhard work and commitment to this bill. And I urge our colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this investment in medical-legal partnerships.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical-Legal Partnership \n     for Health Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Numerous studies and reports, including the annual \n     National Healthcare Disparities Report and Unequal Treatment, \n     the 2002 Institute of Medicine Report, document the \n     extensiveness to which vulnerable populations suffer from \n     health disparities across the country.\n       (2) These studies have found that, on average, racial and \n     ethnic minorities and low-income populations are \n     disproportionately afflicted with chronic and acute \n     conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension \n     and suffer worse health outcomes, worse health status, and \n     higher mortality rates.\n       (3) Several recent studies also show that health and \n     healthcare quality are a function of not only access to \n     healthcare, but also the social determinants of health, \n     including the environment, the physical structure of \n     communities, socio-economic status, nutrition, educational \n     attainment, employment, race, ethnicity, geography, and \n     language preference, that directly and indirectly affect the \n     health, healthcare, and wellness of individuals and \n     communities.\n       (4) Formally integrating medical and legal professionals in \n     the health setting can more effectively address the health \n     needs of vulnerable populations and ultimately reduce health \n     disparities.\n       (5) All over the United States, healthcare providers who \n     take care of low-income individuals and families are \n     partnering with legal professionals to assist them in \n     providing better quality of healthcare.\n       (6) Medical-legal partnerships integrate lawyers in a \n     health setting to help patients navigate the complex \n     government, legal, and service systems in addressing social \n     determinants of health, such as income supports for food \n     insecure families and mold removal from the home of \n     asthmatics.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) support and advance opportunity for medical-legal \n     partnerships to be more fully integrated in healthcare \n     settings nationwide;\n       (2) to improve the quality of care for vulnerable \n     populations by reducing health disparities among health \n     disparities populations and addressing the social \n     determinants of health; and\n       (3) identify and develop cost-effective strategies that \n     will improve patient outcomes and realize savings for \n     healthcare systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. MEDICAL-LEGAL PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall establish a nationwide demonstration project consisting \n     of--\n       (1) awarding grants to, and entering into contracts with, \n     medical-legal partnerships to assist patients and their \n     families to navigate programs and activities; and\n       (2) evaluating the effectiveness of such partnerships.\n       (b) Technical Assistance.--The Secretary may, directly or \n     through grants or contracts, provide technical assistance to \n     grantees under subsection (a)(1) to support the establishment \n     and sustainability of medical-legal partnerships.

A bill to increase criminal penalties for certain knowing \nviolations relating to food that is misbranded or adulterated; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Food \nSafety Enforcement Act, legislation that will hold criminals who poison \nour food supply accountable for their crimes. This common sense bill \nincreases the sentences that prosecutors can seek for people who \nknowingly violate our food safety laws. If it is passed, those who \nknowingly contaminate our food supply and endanger Americans could \nreceive up to 10 years in jail.\n  Last year, a mother from Vermont, Gabrielle Meunier, testified before \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee about her 7-year-old son, Christopher, \nwho became severely ill and was hospitalized for 6 days after he \ndeveloped salmonella poisoning from peanut crackers. Thankfully, \nChristopher recovered, and Mrs. Meunier was able to share her story, \nwhich highlighted for the Committee and for the Senate improvements \nthat are needed in our food safety system. No parent should have to go \nthrough what Mrs. Meunier experienced. The American people should be \nconfident that the food they buy for their families is safe.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who knowingly violate our food safety laws. The fines and recalls \nthat usually result from criminal violations under current law fall \nshort in protecting the public from harmful products. Too often, those \nwho are willing to endanger our children in pursuit of profits view \nsuch fines or recalls as just the cost of doing business. In order to \nprotect the public and effectively deter this unacceptable conduct, we \nneed to make sure that those who knowingly poison the food supply will \ngo to jail.\n  After hearing Mrs. Meunier's account, I called on the Department of \nJustice to conduct a criminal investigation into the outbreak of \nsalmonella that made Christopher and many others so sick. The outbreak \nwas traced to the Peanut Corporation of America. The president of that \ncompany, Stewart Parnell, came before Congress and invoked his right \nagainst self-incrimination, refusing to answer questions about his role \nin distributing contaminated peanut products. These products have been \nlinked to the deaths of nine people and have sickened more than 600 \nothers. It appears that Parnell knew that peanut products from his \ncompany had tested positive for deadly salmonella, but rather than \nimmediately disposing of the products, he sought ways to sell them \nanyway. The evidence suggests that he knowingly put profit above the \npublic's safety.\n  The bill I introduce today would increase sentences for people who \nput profits above safety by knowingly contaminating the food supply. It \nmakes such offenses felony violations and significantly increases the \nchances that those who commit them will face jail time, rather than a \nslap on the wrist, for their criminal conduct.\n  I hope Senators of both parties will act quickly to pass this bill. \nOn behalf of Mrs. Meunier and her son, Christopher, as well as many \nlike them across the country, we must repair our broken food safety \nsystem. The Justice Department must be given the tools it needs to \ninvestigate, prosecute, and truly deter crime involving food safety. \nThis bill will be an important step toward making our food supply \nsafer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Safety Enforcement Act \n     of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CRIMINAL PENALTIES.\n\n       Section 303(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 333(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Any'' and inserting \n     ``Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), any'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of paragraph (1) of this section, if'' and \n     inserting ``If''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Any person who knowingly violates subsection (a), \n     (b), (c), (k), or (v) of section 301 with respect to any food \n     that is misbranded or adulterated shall be fined under title \n     18, United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 10 \n     years, or both.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 3670. A bill to establish standards limiting the amounts of \narsenic and lead contained in glass beads used in pavement markings; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the Safe \nHighway Markings Act of 2010, a bill that would establish minimum \nstandards limiting the amounts of arsenic and\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nlead contained in glass beads for reflective pavement markings. This \nbill will help protect surface and ground water from contamination and \nprotect the health and safety of highway workers.\n  Each year, approximately 500 million pounds of glass beads are \napplied to create reflective markings on roads in the United States. \nThe source materials for the manufacturing of these glass beads can \nvary widely. While most engineered glass beads use environmentally-\nfriendly materials such as recycled flat glass, some of the glass beads \ncontain arsenic, lead and other heavy metals. As the glass degrades \nfrom the pounding of traffic, snow plows, trucks and weather, toxic \nmaterials can leach out of the glass and mix into the ground and \nsurface water. In addition, workers who apply the glass beads with high \nconcentrations of heavy metals are at risk for exposure.\n  In response to environmental and health issues, several states have \nadopted regulations that require the use of environmentally-friendly, \nnon-toxic glass materials. In particular, California, Iowa, Maine, New \nJersey, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming have established procurement \nstandards for the quality of glass beads used in highways markings in \ntheir States. Several other States are currently reviewing proposals. \nAdditionally, the European Union, China, Australia, and several \nCanadian provinces have also set standards limiting heavy metal \nconcentration.\n  It makes no sense to continue this piecemeal approach; it is time for \na national standard. This legislation establishes a minimum standard \nfor engineered glass beads used in reflective markings. The legislation \nensures that States receiving Federal funds adhere to the Environmental \nProtection Agency's methods and standards for engineered glass beads, \nspecifically that the beads may contain no more than 200 parts per \nmillion of arsenic.\n  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House and I look \nforward to advancing this important legislation in the Senate. As such, \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill that will help safeguard the \nlives of highway workers and help keep public roads free of high levels \nof arsenic and lead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Goodwin):\n  S. 3671. A bill to improve compliance with mine and occupational \nsafety and health law, empower workers to raise safety concerns, \nprevent future mine and other workplace tragedies, establish rights of \nfamilies of victims of workplace accidents, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce with my \ncolleague Senator Goodwin the Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety \nand Health Act of 2010. This legislation is a first step to making sure \nthat every miner in West Virginia can go to work each and every day \nwithout fearing for their safety. It also serves as a tribute to all \nminers who have lost their lives, and also to my dear friend and \ncolleague, the late Senator Byrd, who devoted his career to improving \nthe working condition of West Virginia's miners and worked diligently \nwith me to develop this bill.\n  It has been several months since the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, \nbut for many of us, it feels like only yesterday that we were anxiously \nwaiting to hear news about the missing miners. Shortly after that \nhorrible accident I came to this floor and said that ``No words are \nadequate to describe the grief.'' I know that for the families of those \n29 miners that remains the case.\n  Even as the investigation into the Upper Big Branch mine continues to \nmove forward, we owe it to the victims' families and to the miners that \nstill get up and go to work every day, to find real solutions to keep \nour miners safe.\n  The legislation Senator Goodwin and I are introducing today has been \na team effort--particularly with my colleague and friend Congressman \nNick Rahall, who has introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House \nof Representatives. I would like to acknowledge Senators Harkin and \nMurray for their effort and their commitment to addressing mine and \nworkplace safety.\n  It gives teeth to existing whistleblower protections so that miners \ncan come forward to report safety concerns. Miners should not fear for \ntheir jobs--their livelihoods--simply because they are trying to keep \nthemselves and their coworkers safe. We have a responsibility to give \nthem every protection necessary. Our bill gives miners up to 180 days \nto file a whistleblower retaliation complaint, it allows punitive \ndamages and criminal penalties for retaliating against a whistleblower, \nand it makes sure that miners do not lose pay if their mines are shut \ndown for safety reasons. It also allows miners to give private \ninterviews with MSHA and exclude the operator or union representative \nfrom the room. I know that the industry and unions do not like this, \nbut it is important for miners to be allowed to speak freely without \nintimidation or influence from anyone.\n  Our legislation also gives MSHA additional tools to keep miners safe, \nincluding the ability to order additional safety training at mines \nwhere it is needed, expanded authority to seek injunctions to stop \ndangerous practices, and the ability to subpoena documents and \ntestimony outside of the public hearing context. But this bill also \ntakes a hard look at MSHA to make sure they are doing their job by \ncreating an independent panel to investigate MSHA's role in serious \naccidents and it requires MSHA to conduct inspections during all hours \nand shifts so that every miner has the same level of protection.\n  Importantly, this bill also fixes the broken ``pattern of \nviolations'' process--which was meant to give MSHA authority to crack \ndown on mines that repeatedly violate our laws, but has never been \neffectively implemented. Rather than the punitive process that exists \nunder current law, our legislation focuses on rehabilitating unsafe \nmines so that miners can go to work confident that they will safely \nreturn home to their families at the end of the shift. Mines will have \nto implement safety plans, will be subject to additional inspections, \nand will be required to show substantial improvement in their safety \nrecords before being removed from pattern status.\n  Our bill contains additional protections that will apply to workers \nacross all industries under the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration. These include expanded whistleblower \nprotections for employees, the explicit right to refuse to perform \nunsafe work, greater rights for victims and their families to \nparticipate in the investigation process, updated civil and criminal \npenalties, and the requirement that hazardous conditions be abated \nimmediately so that litigation does not delay safety. Deadly accidents \noccur in mines and throughout every industry. Everyone deserves to be \nsafe on the job, and these provisions will go a long way toward \nachieving that goal.\n  But our bill also has additional provisions that are not included in \nthe House version. It requires an evaluation of whether MSHA has the \nexperts it needs to effectively enforce our laws. It requires the \nGovernment Accountability Office to conduct an independent evaluation \nof MSHA's new ``pattern of violations'' criteria to make sure it is \neffective in preventing repeated violations at our most unsafe mines. \nIt promotes greater coordination between the Department of Justice and \nDepartment of Labor in investigating criminal violations of our mine \nsafety laws. It requires MSHA to improve its online database so that \nthe public can more easily find out the full safety records of \noperators not just individual mines, and compare the safety records of \nvarious mines and operators. It requires MSHA to routinely develop \nlong-term safety goals and strategic plans to meet those goals. These \nprovisions will improve transparency, increase accountability, and set \nus on a path toward safety.\n  We can never change what happened at the Upper Big Branch mine, but \nwe can change the way we do business going forward. Americans deserve \nthe peace of mind that comes from safe working conditions. Following \nthe Upper Big Branch tragedy, this Senate chose to honor the fallen \nminers with a resolution--a gesture that Senator Byrd and I very much \nappreciated. I hope that my colleagues will work with Senator Goodwin \nand I to pass meaningful mine safety legislation in their honor as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "07", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/29/senate-section/article/S6528-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 601--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY OF SENATE EMPLOYEES IN A \n           GRAND JURY PROCEEDING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5874, received from the \nHouse and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5874) making supplemental appropriations for \n     the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr, President, I support H.R. 5874, the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010. This bill \ngives the Patent and Trademark Office additional funding to tackle the \npatent backlog, helping innovative businesses protect new ideas faster.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office is the central hub of an innovation \nfriendly Government. It protects intellectual property in the United \nStates and encourages invention, innovation, and investment. New \npatents boost America's competitiveness, increase productivity, bring \nnew products and services to market, support entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses, and, most importantly, help to create new jobs.\n  As chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee that funds the Patent and Trademark Office, I have been \ncritical of this agency's performance. The Patent and Trademark Office \nhas struggled for years to reduce patent pendency and tackle the \noverall patent backlog. I have heard from inventors and businesses \nabout how long it takes the Patent and Trademark Office to protect \ntheir ideas.\n  I have also heard from Patent employees about their unrealistic job \nperformance standards which have led to high turnover of patent \nexaminers. Numerous reviews conducted by the Government Accountability \nOffice showed that for every two examiners hired one leaves the agency.\n  But the good news is that Patent and Trademark Office has new \ndirection, and within the past year, the agency has made some very \npositive changes. Thanks to Director Kappos, employee management has \nbeen reformed, meaning more patent examiners are staying and working. \nThe Patent and Trademark Office has also created a better strategy for \napproving patents quicker and reducing the patent backlog. We are \nfinally seeing the Patent and Trademark Office make strides in the \nright direction, and I want to support this momentum.\n  This year, the Patent and Trademark Office will collect $129 million \nmore fees than originally expected. These extra funds mean that Patent \nand Trademark Office has the potential to further reduce the backlog \neven faster. H.R. 5874 allows the Patent and Trademark Office to spend \nthis additional revenue. This amendment is fully offset by rescinding \nunused funds from the 2010 census.\n  This bill has the same goals as an amendment I offered this week to \nH.R. 5297, the small business bill, because improving patent protection \nis critical to helping innovative small businesses grow. This bill also \nmirrors the President's request he sent Congress on July 12, 2010, \nasking for these exact funds for the Patent and Trademark Office, \noffset by the rescission from the Census.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5874, the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010. The Patent \nand Trademark Office needs to get back on track, and funding within \nthis bill ensures the Patent and Trademark Office has the resources it \nneeds to process applications in a reasonable time and keep critical \nexaminers on board to continue issuing patents. By supporting this\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\nbill, we can give American businesses and inventors a helping hand to \nstay innovative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has acted \nquickly and in a bipartisan way to ensure that fees collected by United \nStates Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, are not diverted for other \npurposes this fiscal year.\n  The Director of the USPTO has done a remarkable job in his short \ntenure dealing with a massive backload of patent applications and a \nserious budget shortfall. The action that Congress has taken today will \nat least provide short term financial help to the agency by ensuring \nthat the USPTO is not penalized for having done more work this fiscal \nyear than it had anticipated.\n  More needs to be done to modernize and improve our patent system, \nwhich is a crucial component of our economic recovery. Bipartisan \npatent reform legislation is ready for Senate action. This bill will \nprovide the legal structure we need to allow our inventors to flourish. \nIt will improve our economy and create jobs without adding a penny to \nthe deficit.\n  While I strongly support the action the Senate has taken today, we \ncannot fix our overburdened and outdated patent system simply through \nadditional appropriations. Congress must act on meaningful patent \nreform legislation this year.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
