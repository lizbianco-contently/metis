Madam President, today the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Secretary of State will appear before the Appropriations Committee \nto support the administration's request for funding to execute our \ncombat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. They will be explaining the \nneed to expend more than $80 billion in our efforts to defeat the \nTaliban, al-Qaida, and to preserve our security gains in Iraq.\n  The administration's request also includes $80 million to close the \nsecure detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Yet rather than appear \nbefore the Senate to explain why these funds are necessary, and what \nthe administration\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nplans to do with the terrorists housed at Guantanamo, Attorney General \nHolder chose to deliver a speech in Berlin yesterday in which he \nreiterated the administration's intent to close it.\n  During that speech, Attorney General Holder acknowledged once again \nthat Guantanamo is ``run in an efficient, professional manner.'' He \nsaid detainees there are treated humanely. Yet Guantanamo must be \nclosed, he said, because it represents, as he put it, a time and an \napproach that we want to put behind us. And keeping this so-called \nsymbol open ``makes America less safe'' and makes our friends, \nincluding Europeans, ``less secure.''\n   It is clear from these remarks that the administration is putting \nsymbolism ahead of safety. This becomes even more apparent from \nAttorney General Holder's admission that closing Guantanamo will be \n``one of the most daunting challenges'' he will face. He clearly \nrealizes what most Americans realize: closing Guantanamo is not a good \noption if no safe alternatives exist.\n  In an effort to circumvent this dilemma, Attorney General Holder says \nthe U.S. will not only transfer detainees but also release some of them \nand try others in Federal court. Nowhere did the Attorney General \nmention the use of the military commissions process that Congress \npassed on a bipartisan basis at the direction of the Supreme Court. The \nAttorney General's comments present a whole range of new problems and \npotential dangers that some of my colleagues will detail throughout the \nday.\n  Attorney General Holder also failed to address recent news reports \nthat the administration was considering releasing Guantanamo detainees \ninto American communities. On April 2, Senator Sessions sent the \nAttorney General a letter asking him what legal authority the \nadministration has to release detainees who have participated in \nterrorist-related activities into the United States. The Attorney \nGeneral still has not responded to Senator Sessions. But it is a \nquestion the American people want answered right away.\n  This weekend I will be attending the Kentucky Derby with well over \n100,000 Kentuckians and other Americans, and if I asked every one of \nthem if they thought sending terrorists to our neighborhoods was a good \nplan, I would get more than 100,000 resounding ``noes.''\n  Since the administration has not given any indication where it plans \nto put the 240 terrorists currently housed at Guantanamo, the Attorney \nGeneral was asked in Berlin if any of the detainees could be put up in \nhotels. According to the Associated Press report on the meeting, the \nAttorney General joked that ``hotels might be a possibility, it depends \non where the hotel is.''\n  The question of where the terrorists at Guantanamo will be sent is no \njoking matter--and the administration needs to tell the American people \nhow it will keep the terrorists at Guantanamo out of our neighborhoods \nand off of the battlefield. Its one thing not to have a plan. It is \nanother to joke about not having one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4908-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4908-S4909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        sergeant david k. cooper\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Nation and the Commonwealth of \nKentucky are poorer today for the loss of SGT David K. Cooper of \nWilliamsburg. On August 27, 2008, Sergeant Cooper was tragically killed \nwhen his dismounted patrol came under small-arms fire in Iraq. He was \n25 years old.\n  Sergeant Cooper was in his third tour in Iraq. For his bravery in \nuniform, he received several medals, awards and decorations, including \nthe Army Good Conduct Medal, the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star \nMedal.\n  Sergeant Cooper was laid to rest at Bowlin Cemetery in Jellico, TN, \nabout 10 miles south of Williamsburg. Ed Bailey, a friend who watched \nhim grow up, said of Sergeant Cooper, ``I don't know where our country \nkeeps getting these heroes.''\n  Ronald and Judy Cooper, David's parents, could tell you. They fondly \nremember David, who was born in Whitley County and raised in \nWilliamsburg, as a fun-loving kid who enjoyed football, track and \nplaying in the school band.\n  ``David seemed to go straight from being a little boy at 11 to being \na man at 12, full facial hair and all,'' says his mother, Judy. ``David \nplayed junior-high football. The coach had David and one other player \nlike him. Coach had to carry a copy of these two players' birth \ncertificates to prove they were not over age for junior-high \nfootball.''\n  David went on to play defensive end and tight end on his highschool \nfootball team, the Williamsburg Yellow Jackets. One friend who played \nwith him, Steven Moses, still remembers David as ``hard as heck to \nblock.''\n  David had many friends, who called him by the nickname ``Coop.'' As \nfor David's friends, they all seemed to have the same first name--``My \nBuddy.''\n  In a eulogy she wrote with David's sisters, Veronica and Vanessa, and \ngraciously shared with me, Judy recalls what David would call his \nfriends: ``My Buddy Matt, My Buddy Chapman, My Buddy Black.''\n  Once when David went out with his friends to cut down their own \nChristmas tree, he demonstrated that he barely knew his own strength. \nThe group borrowed a parent's truck, went out and cut down a big \nbeautiful cedar.\n  ``David was always a big, strong man, even in high school,'' says \nJudy. ``As they were loading the tree, one of the branches got stuck on \nthe tailgate. David and one of his friends got up into the truck, gave \na mighty heave, and pulled the tree up into the bed of the truck and \nstraight through the back window.''\n  David graduated from Williamsburg High School in 2001 and attended \nEastern Kentucky University. In May 2004, he enlisted in the Army.\n  Roddy Harrison, the mayor of Williamsburg and David's former teacher \nand high school football coach, remembers seeing David soon after he \nenlisted and telling him how proud he was of him. ``He was a smart \nkid,'' Mayor Harrison recalls. ``A good student, very likable. He had a \ngreat sense of humor. . . . We are going to miss him.''\n  David attended basic training at Fort Sill, OK, and advanced \nindividual training at Fort Sill and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. By \n2005, he was assigned to Golf Forward Support Company, 4th Battalion, \n42nd Field Artillery, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, \nbased out of Fort Hood, TX. He was soon deployed to Iraq and served as \na radar repair mechanic.\n  David's commanding officer in Iraq, CPT Christopher M. Guillory, \nwrote to Judy about her son. ``I usually called him Coop; [he] called \nme `sir' or `Captain G,' '' he wrote. ``Whether it was at Chapman's \nhouse while they were working on trucks, the drag strip, or at the \nmonster truck shows, he was always respectful to me while we had a \ngreat time. David was a great young man, who had shown a great deal of \nmaturity in the time I knew him.''\n  In Iraq, David served as a command team driver and company armorer. \nHe was selected to serve on his command sergeant major's personal \nsecurity detail for his tactical knowledge and record of performance.\n  When home on leave, David would tell his childhood friend Matt \nMountjoy about the excitement of serving in the Army. He knew the \ndangers but was unafraid to face them. ``He really was a brave \nperson,'' Matt says. ``I never, never heard him say he was ever \nscared.''\n  His mother Judy remembers that after David's death, a group of his \nfriends came to visit her and share stories about her son. The stories \nmostly began, ``You remember that time when me and you and Coop . . . \n'' Judy says. ``They were all funny, most of them dangerous. . . . Were \nthey funny at the time? No. Where do you think I got all of these gray \nhairs and wrinkles? But time does give us perspective.''\n  David's many friends and family members are in our thoughts as we \nremember him today. We are thinking of his wife, Amanda Fuston Cooper; \nhis parents, Ronald Cooper and Judy Parrot Cooper; his sisters, \nVeronica Cooper and Vanessa Cooper, and Vanessa's finance Dave Seeger; \nhis grandparents, Wanda and E.L. Cooper; his aunts, Jenny Begluitti, \nJanice Rutherford, and Joyce Dippel, and Joyce's husband Marty; his \nuncles, Steve Cooper and John Parrot, and John's wife Sonya; and many \nother beloved friends and family members.\n  All of those who knew him will remember a man of many fine qualities, \nincluding honesty. His mother Judy\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\nsays no one ever had to guess where they stood with David. ``David and \nI had a very close relationship,'' she says. ``He always said, `Mom, I \nknow there isn't any sense in me trying to lie to you. I know you're \njust going to find out the truth anyway.' ''\n  What is the truth now is that our Nation must never forget SGT David \nK. Cooper's service, nor can we ever forget the loss and pain caused to \nhis family by his enormous sacrifice. I hope they will remember that \nthis Senate is proud to honor SGT David K. Cooper for his bravery, his \npatriotism, and his love of country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, two weeks ago, the democratically \nelected leaders of the Western Hemisphere met for the Summit of the \nAmericas. The Castro regime in Cuba was not invited, because it has \nviolated the democratic charter of the Organization of American States \nfor the last 5 decades.\n  At the same time as that meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, Raul Castro \ngave a speech in Venezuela. He said he would be willing to negotiate \nwith the United States and put everything on the table. Many considered \nthis ``news.''\n  Well, let me tell you, those comments aren't news to anyone who has \nfollowed the rhetoric of the regime over the decades. The Castros have \nmade promise after promise and none of their promises have resulted in \nsubstantial change on the island, none of their promises have resulted \nin the release of the labor leaders, journalists or clergymen jailed \nfor no crime other than speaking their minds, the end of the network of \ngovernment spies on every block, or the granting of basic human rights \nthat we in the United States take for granted. None of their promises \nhave resulted in economic freedom for the millions of Cubans who try to \nget by on less than a dollar a day.\n  And so it was hardly news that not long after Raul Castro spoke, his \nolder brother Fidel made comments clarifying that nothing would change, \nand blaming all conditions in Cuba on the United States.\n  He said President Obama acted with ``autosuficiencia'' y \n``superficialidad'', he called him conceited and superficial.\n  I am surprised that Secretary Clinton, in her remarks, would jump so \nfast to consider that good news.\n  While Raul Castro spoke at a meeting in Venezuela, there was another \ngathering going on in Cuba. It was a gathering of state security agents \nand secret police, outside the home of Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, known \nas ``Antunez.''\n  With tremendous courage, Antunez began a hunger strike to protest the \noppressive Castro regime. In response, agents descended on the house \nlast March 17. According to Amnesty International, they have orders to \nuse force against and arrest anyone to prevent them from entering the \nhouse, including anyone who could provide medical treatment.\n  Antunez and three other Cubans have vowed to continue their protest \nuntil the torture of political prisoner Mario Alberto Perez Aguilera, \nheld at the Santa Clara Provincial Prison, ceases immediately.\n  They will continue their protest until he is taken out of a tiny \nsolitary confinement cell, until he is no longer beaten and forced to \nstarve, until the regime allows Antunez' sister Caridad Garcia Perez to \nrebuild her home destroyed by the hurricanes last year, which they have \nnot allowed, as further punishment to these activists.\n  From his house in Placetas, Cuba, Antunez wrote me a letter on April \n13.\n  Here's an excerpt, in Spanish:\n\n       Compatriotas a nombre de nuestro pueblo cubano persistan en \n     sus nobles y sinceros esfuerzos, sepan que para los cubanos \n     la libertad, la dignidad y el respeto a los derechos humanos \n     tiened mucho mas permanencia e importancia que las ventajas \n     economicas que puedan traer los viajes de turismo y las \n     llegadas de insumos que financiarin mas que al pueblo a la \n     cruel tirania que nos oprime.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Those who continue their noble and sincere efforts on \n     behalf of the Cuban people, please know, that for Cubans, \n     liberty, dignity and respect for human rights are much more \n     permanent and important than the economic advantages that \n     might come with visiting tourists and the arrival of \n     products, which will benefit the cruel tyranny that oppresses \n     us more than the Cuban people.\n\n  That is the kind of courage that can break a dictatorship. That is \nthe kind of courage we should support. And that is the kind of person \nwhose advice we should heed, the human rights activist, the Cuban who \nsacrifices day and night in a peaceful struggle for freedom, these are \nthe voices we should listen to when we are making our policy toward the \nCastro regime.\n  Some like to cling to a romantic notion of the Castros, but we cannot \nlose sight of these brutal facts. There is no indication that political \nprisoners are being released, free speech is being allowed or Cubans \nare being granted basic liberties that we take for granted.\n  For the Organization of American States to readmit a regime that \nengages in this type of systematic suppression of human rights, it \nwould have to rip up its Inter-American Democratic Charter as a farce. \nIt would have to ignore Article 78 of the declaration, reaffirming, \n``the legitimacy of electoral processes and full respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms.'' And it would be sending a clear \nsignal to other countries moving in the wrong direction, away from \ndemocracy, that it is perfectly OK to do so.\n  In respect to the very complicated choices we have on Cuba policy, \nPresident Obama has proven himself a man of action. I support his \nallowing Cuban-Americans more opportunities to travel to Cuba, because \nI think families should have the chance to be reunited.\n  On the other hand, and although I support finding ways to improve the \nfinancial situation of the Cuban people, I think allowing unlimited \nremittances was not the right move, when the Castro regime still takes \nfor itself up to 30 percent of all the money sent.\n  The administration also announced changes regarding \ntelecommunications policy. Let me be clear: in spite of the fact that \nthe regime has rejected such gestures in the past, I hope that it will \nnow allow U.S. telecommunications companies to increase the flow of \ninformation to and from the island. That said, we need to be sure to \nprevent a repeat of what happened in China, where U.S. \ntelecommunications firms helped the Chinese government monitor Internet \nusers and control content. U.S. companies cannot and should not censor \nInternet searches and block Web sites at the request of the regime.\n  But mainly what we have learned from these good-faith actions on the \npart of the United States is that they have not resulted in any change \nof behavior from the regime in Cuba.\n  We have traded concessions and gotten only rhetoric in return. We \nhave extended our hand, while the Cuban regime maintains its iron-\nhanded clenched fist.\n  We cannot allow ourselves to start down a slippery slope of relaxing \nrestrictions, that only winds up allowing the Castro regime to \nstrengthen the iron fist by which it rules.\n  The press is reporting that the State Department is looking to hold \ntalks on migration and counternarcotics with the Castro regime.\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\n  These are serious issues. But without seeing any progress whatsoever \non the part of the regime, it is hard to see why we should be looking \nfor more opportunities to make additional concessions. It is hard to \nsee why we should believe whatever promises the regime might make. And \nit is hard to see why we should cooperate on migration or \ncounternarcotics with a Cuban navy whose main mission is patrolling for \nand sinking ships carrying its own fleeing citizens.\n  If we open up discussions now, we are essentially giving the regime a \npass on progress and taking the focus off of where President Obama \nrightly put it, freedom on the island, freedom for political prisoners, \nfreedom from seizures of a huge percentage of remittances sent to the \nCuban people.\n  So, this is exactly the wrong time to start these conversations and \nstarting them would be in direct contradiction to the White House's own \nstatements, as recently as April 17, that put the burden where it \nshould be, on the Castro regime.\n  After 50 years of brutality, we need actions, not words, on the part \nof the Castro regime. Mere words won't erase the lack of dignity that \nAntunez is protesting with a hunger strike. Words won't stop people \nlike Oscar Elias Biscet, a renowned doctor, from being thrown into \nprison for refusing to give women a drug that caused abortions.\n  And words won't finally allow Oswaldo Paya to see the free elections \nhe's worked for and marched for and gone to jail for.\n  Last week I heard one of my distinguished colleagues speak about \nhuman rights abuses in China. I think the Senator was absolutely right \nto highlight those abuses. And I think we should be no less concerned \nwith prison camps in China than prison camps in Cuba, no less concerned \nwith Tiananmen Square than with the Primavera Negra crackdown, no less \nappalled at a child laborer in Beijing than in Havana.\n  And by now we should be convinced that economic interaction in the \nface of an authoritarian government will not end Cuba's human rights \nabuses, just as it has not ended abuses in China.\n  Another of my distinguished colleagues has pointed out the peaceful \nrevolutions that ended communism in Eastern Europe, including in his \nancestors' homeland of Lithuania. I share the Senator's deep respect \nfor those revolutions. And I think it is worth pointing out that when \nthey took place, there was international support and recognition not \nprimarily for the businesses who wanted to open those countries up for \nfinancial gain, but for the democracy activists within those countries \nwho risked their lives to bring change.\n  There is simply no excuse for the Cuban regime's behavior. Forgiving \nit and forgetting it is not the answer.\n  If we want to change the way we conduct our policy, there are many \nthings we can do to isolate and weaken the Castro regime, and hasten \nthe day when the Cuban people can be free.\n  Let's have the U.S. offer more visitor and student visas for eligible \nCubans to come to the U.S., to see and live our way of life. Having \nAmericans travel to Cuba could never be as powerful as having Cuban \nyouth see the greatness of our country, and its pluralistic, diverse, \nrepresentative democracy. That taste of freedom would be infectious.\n  In return we simply seek a commitment from Cuba to accept their \ncitizens' return, and to guarantee the issuance of exit permits for all \nqualified migrants.\n  Cuba is one of the few countries in the world that will not permit \nits citizens to travel even when they have a legitimate visa to do so. \nAnd, when they give them license to leave, they must pay to do so. I \nfind it ironic that when people mention the U.S. embargo, they fail to \nmention the Castros' blockade on their own people, a blockade that \nkeeps Cubans not only from leaving Cuba, but from moving freely within \ntheir own country.\n  If we want to facilitate the sales of food to Cuba, let us insist \nthat they be sold in open markets, available to all Cubans, without it \nbeing part of Castro's food rationing plan, a plan meant to further \ncontrol the Cuban people.\n  In exchange for cooperation with Cuba on narcotics trafficking, let \nthem hand over the 200 fugitives the FBI knows are in Cuba, including \nJoAnne Chesimard, the convicted killer of New Jersey State Trooper \nWerner Foerster.\n  And in exchange for freeing commerce, let the Castros free the \npolitical prisoners they hold and allow them to speak freely, organize \nfreely, elect their own leadership and freely practice their religion \non Cuban soil. I hope we are not so blinded by the color of money that \nwe forget how important it is for the Castros to close their dungeons \nand let the light of freedom shine down on everyone who calls the \nisland home.\n  President Obama, who saw repression in Indonesia when he was a child, \npromised us this: He said:\n\n       My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: Libertad. \n     And the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with \n     justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the rights of free \n     speech, a free press and freedom of assembly; and it must \n     lead to elections that are free and fair.\n\n  For 50 years, the regime has been a social, economic and moral \nfailure. It has succeeded merely at staying in power. Today, after the \nregime has offered few new words and fewer new actions, we can choose \nto change how we feel about the regime, or we can try to change the way \nit operates. That is our choice.\n  We can choose amnesia or we can choose justice. We can choose strong \nwords or we can choose strong actions. We can choose giving in to the \ncommercial interests of a few, or we can choose holding on to the moral \ninterests that unite us all.\n  That is what I hope we will do.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that \nis very close to my heart. I am a mom. I have two young boys at home. \nLike all parents, I have faith and confidence that the products I use \non my children--bath products, lotions, and soaps--are safe. But a new \nstudy was recently released by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics \nrevealing that widely used baby products, such as shampoos and baby \nlotions, contain probable carcinogens and other irritants, in \nparticular formaldehyde and dioxane 1,4.\n  Like many other moms in New York, when I read this list of \npotentially dangerous products, I immediately began to worry about my \nchildren. I have two boys--Henry who is 11 months old and Theodore who \nis 5 years old. When I read this list of products, I noticed many of \nthem are literally in my bathroom, and I have used them on my children \nsince they were born. I was immediately very concerned. I began to \nthink about what I could do to make a difference. The bottom line is, \nI, like all parents in America, need to know the facts about these \nproducts.\n  The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics commissioned an independent \nlaboratory study to test 48 products for 1,4-dioxane, and 28 of those \nproducts were also tested for formaldehyde. The lab found that 61 \npercent contained both of those chemicals. Eighty-two percent contained \nformaldehyde from a level of 54 to 610 parts per million, and 67 \npercent contained 1,4-dioxane at levels up to 35 parts per million. The \nreport says these chemicals are both probable carcinogens and irritants \nand have been known to cause cancer in animals.\n  The FDA, however, has not established a safe level for these \nchemicals in cosmetics, and these chemicals are currently not listed as \ningredients because they are byproducts of the processing and \nmanufacturing.\n  To me, this situation is unacceptable. Parents have the right to know \nwhether the products they use on their children are safe. While a \nsingle product may not be cause for concern, the reality is, babies may \nbe exposed to many products, several times a week. Children are \nparticularly susceptible. Their skin is much finer, much thinner, so \nthey can absorb contaminants more easily. They tend to breathe more \nquickly than adults, meaning their exposure to inhalation of some of \nthese chemicals can be more considerable. We need to make sure the \ncombination of these products is not causing harm to our youngest. \nParents need to know if there are any risks in the products they trust. \nParents have a right to know, and the government has a responsibility \nto make sure these products are safe.\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\n  That is why I rise to introduce legislation that will ensure these \nbaby products are safe and that parents have the information they \ndeserve. The Safe Baby Products Act will require the FDA to investigate \nthe safety of baby products, publicly report the findings, and \nestablish manufacturing practices that will reduce or eliminate any \nharmful chemicals. While there are no known cases of any disease \ndirectly linked to these products, what the legislation will do is \nrequire the FDA to test the safety and then report the findings so all \nof us can rest assured the products we use are safe. This commonsense \nlegislation will ensure that we have all the facts we need about \nlotions and soap products because parents deserve to know.\n  This legislation will ensure transparency and accountability in this \nall-important consumer products market. The United States has a great \nhistory of taking steps to safeguard our kids. There is an important \ntradition of child and product safety laws.\n  As a mother of two young sons, I understand there is no duty greater \nfor the Federal Government than to protect those who are most \nvulnerable among us. Other countries have taken leadership. The EU and \nCanada have banned dioxane in cosmetic products and have regulations \nfor formaldehyde. Japan and Sweden have banned formaldehyde. The \nIsraeli Health Ministry has banned the sales of U.S. baby products with \ncarcinogenic chemicals.\n  All parents want the best for their kids. Our Government must not \nfail to protect our youngest and those who need our protection the \nmost. This legislation will ensure that all of our parents have the \ninformation they need to keep our children safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, President Obama has set an arbitrary \ndeadline of January of 2010 to close our prison at Guantanamo Bay. \nThere is currently no plan on how to accomplish that. Nevertheless, the \nPresident has requested $80 million in a supplemental appropriations \nbill to accomplish it. The question is, before we approve $80 million \nfor this purpose, should we not know what the money is going to be used \nfor? We are not in the business of appropriating large sums of money \nwithout having any idea of what is going to happen to the money. There \nare a lot of questions, but there are virtually no answers.\n  This facility is virtually brand new. It is a $200 million state-of-\nthe-art prison. I have not heard that any of the money is going to \nactually go to shutter the facility. That would be very strange, \nindeed, since I gather even if all of the terrorists were removed from \nit, there would still be a reason to have that prison so that it could \nhouse others. So what is the money going to be used for?\n  We have not heard that any other country has agreed to take these \nprisoners. I think France was willing to take one. But presumably very \nlittle of this $80 million is going to be used to pay other countries \nto take these prisoners. So what is the money going to be used for?\n  Obviously, we will not release them into society. I heard one wag \ntalking about the possibility that they would be given some money and \nturned loose and directed to make the best of their new life. That, \nobviously, makes no sense. I haven't heard that any of the $80 million \nwould be used for that purpose.\n  What could it be used for? Well, I guess the only other option would \nbe these people would be transferred to other prisons, either State \nprisons or maybe a Federal or a military prison. I will go into why \nthat is not a good idea in a moment. But I suppose some of the money \ncould be used to pay a State prison, for example, or to provide funding \nfor a Federal prison, even though they are already funded, and I am not \nsure why they should need the additional money. But maybe they need \nadditional security, for example. Perhaps some of the money could be \nused for that.\n  Why the number $80 million? Where did that number come from? Is there \na plan, and we have not been told about it yet? There are a lot of \nquestions that have to be answered before I am willing to vote to spend \n$80 million--or not spend it but to authorize $80 million to be spent \nbut on what I do not know.\n  Let's understand that the reason these terrorists are at Guantanamo \nBay--there are two reasons. No. 1, these are the worst of the worst. \nThese are extraordinarily dangerous people who have all said that if \ngiven half a chance they will kill Americans or anybody else with whom \nthey disagree. The second reason is, this facility keeps them in a \nplace where they are safe but also we are safe from having the facility \nattacked in order to release them or to have the guards or the prison \nofficials put into jeopardy as a result of the proximity to terrorists \nwho could have access to them.\n  Guantanamo Bay is not a place where terrorists can easily get access. \nAs a result, it is the perfect place to keep these kinds of dangerous \ncriminals. We have already let a lot of the people at Guantanamo Bay \nfree because we judged they were not a danger any longer. \nUnfortunately, we were wrong about many of them. There are well over \n30--and I think the number may be over 50 by now--who we actually have \ninformation have returned to the battlefield. Some of them, we know, \nhave been killed, some have been captured again, and we know some have \ngone right back to committing terrorist atrocities. These are people \nwho we thought were rehabilitated or were not terrorists in the first \nplace.\n  Now we are talking about roughly 240 or 245 who we know are very \ndangerous if they were ever to be released. What can be done with them? \nWe cannot release them back to the battlefield. We cannot take them to \nsome country such as Switzerland and turn them loose and say: Well, go \nwherever you want to. Other countries do not want to take them. You \ncannot turn them over to countries that we believe will obviously \nmistreat them or will turn them loose.\n  The only other option I can see is they would be put in some American \nprison. Think for a moment about that. One reason the prison guards at \nGuantanamo do not wear any identification is because they do not want \nthese terrorists to know who they are. If they did, it would be \npossible to locate their families back in the States and to threaten \nthem or actually do harm to them. This is not hard.\n  If they are transferred to the State prison in Arizona, let's say, \nwhat would have to be done there? Well, everybody knows who the warden \nof the State prison is in Arizona. Is that person and the family going \nto be jeopardized as a result of the fact that person is in charge of \nthe Arizona prisons? Obviously, all the guards would have to have the \nsame kind of training that our very capable people at Guantanamo have \nreceived. This would cost extra money. They could not be identified in \nany way to these individuals. The facilities would probably have to be \nhardened in order to ensure there could be no escape.\n  But as we found in both Afghanistan and Iraq, when terrorists are \naware--and I believe this may have happened in Pakistan, though I could \nbe corrected--when terrorists are aware their colleagues are being held \nin a facility, they make plans to try to spring them and they attack \nthe facility and they try to hold hostages so they can trade for their \ncolleagues who are in the prison.\n  Is that what we are going to expose Americans to in our communities? \nThese are the kinds of things that have not been thought through and, \nobviously, have to be thought through. When somebody says to me: Will \nyou vote for $80 million to close the prison at Guantanamo? I am going \nto say: Tell me what the $80 million is going to be used for. Tell me \nwhat the plan is and then I will think about it.\n  Let me mention--I said before these are the worst of the worst. They \ninclude 27 al-Qaida leaders, including the\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nmastermind of the September 11 attacks, key al-Qaida operatives, and \nOsama bin Laden lieutenants, as well as the orchestrator of the attack \non the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. In total, I believe \nthere are 241 terrorists who remain under military guard at \nGuantanamo--those who have been identified as too dangerous to be \nreleased.\n  The Attorney General, about a month ago, said about these detainees--\nand I am quoting now--for ``people who can be released, there are a \nvariety of options that we have and among them is the possibility that \nwe would release them into this country.''\n  ``Release them into this country''? I cannot imagine the American \npeople being willing to do that.\n  Senator McConnell asked a question of the Attorney General. He said: \nWhat is the legal basis for bringing these terrorist-trained detainees \nto the United States, given that Federal law specifically forbids the \nentry of anyone who endorses or espouses terrorism, has received \nterrorist training or belongs to a terrorist group?\n  It would be against U.S. law, as well as extraordinarily foolish, to \nrelease these people into this country, as the Attorney General \nintimated. As I said before, transferring them to facilities within our \nborders would create new terrorist targets.\n  The Senate has already spoken to this issue. In July of 2007, the \nSenate voted 94 to 3 that Guantanamo detainees should not be \ntransferred stateside into facilities in American communities and \nneighborhoods.\n  So I repeat the question: Where will they go? European nations have \nsaid they will not take any of the terrorists because they cannot be \nintegrated into their societies. Well, that is an understatement, to \nsay the least.\n  Obviously, repatriating them to their native country has proven to be \nextraordinarily difficult too. That was obviously plan A. But these \ncountries either, A, do not want them; B, could not take care of them; \nor, C, we believe would mistreat them.\n  We learned a lesson on repatriation in the case of Said Ali al-\nShihri, who was returned home to Saudi Arabia after his release from \nGuantanamo. He promptly fled to Yemen. He is now a top leader of al-\nQaida's Yemeni organization. Yemenis, interestingly, make up the \nlargest population of Guantanamo prisoners. But Yemen has been the \nhardest country to engage on this issue. Even if it agreed to U.S. \ndemands, it might not be capable of honoring them.\n  In fact, there are many areas of Yemen today that are very poorly \ngoverned. Its borders are porous. I do not think there is any \nconfidence that if prisoners were released to Yemen, they would not \nimmediately go back to the battlefield and we would be facing them \nagain.\n  We should also keep in mind the conditions at Guantanamo are very \ngood. Everyone who has visited there, I think, has agreed that the \ndetainees are well treated, that they are exercised regularly, fed \nculturally and religiously appropriate meals, get medical and dental \nbenefits--most far superior to any they had received before that in \ntheir life. They have access to mail, a library, are free to practice \ntheir religion. The International Committee of the Red Cross has \nunfettered access to monitor detainees.\n  It is not as if, in this particular facility, they are being \nmistreated. In fact, in this particular facility, they probably could \nbe treated better than being returned stateside to some existing prison \nthat would have to be modified in order to provide this kind of \ntreatment for them.\n  I know of no better alternative than their current incarceration at \nGuantanamo. They are dangerous people who were picked up on the \nbattlefield or in situations where we have very good reason to believe \nthey are terrorists, that they would engage in terrorism or support \nterrorism if they were released.\n  We, obviously, are committed to moving forward because of the \nPresident's commitment. I believe the Congress will be willing to work \nwith the President on this very difficult situation. But if the \nPresident is going to ask the Congress for money, then the President \nhas to be able to share with us what his plan is, and we will try to \nhelp. What I do not think we will do is agree, as the Attorney General \nsuggested, to release them into the United States.\n\n  I think it will be extraordinarily difficult to house them in some \nprison in one of our communities. We clearly have not been able to talk \nour allies into taking them. It is very difficult to return them to \nother countries because of the potential they would either be \nmistreated or immediately go back to the battlefield.\n  The President has committed to doing something, in my opinion, \nwithout thinking through carefully the consequences of the decision and \nthe difficulty of implementing the decision.\n  To the extent he needs help from Congress, he needs to bring us into \nthe discussion and share with us what he intends to do. Because we are \nnot--as the vote before the Senate clearly indicated--we are not going \nto endorse a blank check on this and say: Fine, Mr. President, whatever \nyou want to do, even though it could have an adverse impact on our \ncommunities or on our country.\n  That is why, despite the fact there are very good reasons to support \nother aspects of the supplemental appropriations bill that has been \nproffered to the Congress, this particular piece has to be modified. \nEither the President has to make clear what he intends to do with the \n$80 million, explain to the American people how he intends to move \nforward on this, or he should defer.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill, after all, is merely an \nemergency amount of money that may be needed in a place such as Iraq, \nPakistan or Afghanistan, prior to the regular appropriations process \ntaking place. If the President can suggest to us there is some \nemergency need for this money, then, obviously, we can consider that. \nBut absent that, there is no reason to put it in the supplemental \nappropriations bill--a bill we need to pass because of the emergencies \nthat do exist in places such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n  But short of explaining to us what he wants to do with the $80 \nmillion, I do not think this is something the Congress is going to be \nwilling to include in the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I would say this to the political operatives who sometimes get \ninvolved in these issues: Do not think that you can blackmail the \nSenate into supporting something such as this because of the urgency of \ngetting the rest of the funds out into the field. Yes, those funds are \nimportant. But I think every one of our constituents would rightly be \nextraordinarily critical of any Senator who simply agreed carte blanche \nto appropriate $80 million if that meant these prisoners could be \nreleased into their communities or even be put behind bars in their \ncommunities. We have already spoken out against that, so that should \nnot be part of the plan.\n  I think it is very important the President understands the Senate \ncannot approve a bill that has this kind of appropriation in it without \nbringing us into the process, getting our counsel as to how to deal \nwith the problem, and then ask for our support for the funding to \nexecute that particular plan.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this Sunday, individuals around the \nworld will mark World Press Freedom Day by recognizing the plight of \njournalists in nations where their rights are not accorded under the \nlaw.\n  Sadly, this includes many living in our own hemisphere.\n  In Cuba, the repressive regime has gone to great lengths to \nextinguish freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and independent \nthought.\n  Many have had their homes invaded, their families blacklisted, and \ntheir lives ruined for merely reporting the facts about the reality of \nCuba under the Castro brothers' dictatorship.\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\n  Six years ago, in a massive crackdown on independent civil society \nactivists, more than 100 people were detained, with 75 suffering \nprosecution and then later imprisonment. Of the 75 targeted by the \nregime for imprisonment, 35 were writers, journalists or independent \nlibrarians.\n  Because in Cuba the repression has been such that people are not \nallowed to even go to a library and read books that might be banned by \nthe regime, individuals began to have home libraries where people could \ncome and check out a book or read a book that might otherwise not be \npermitted by the Government. These people were imprisoned along with \nothers who, in a fledgling kind of way, attempted to report conditions \nin Cuba.\n  Today, 22 of these courageous individuals remain imprisoned. In the \nintervening 6 years, they have been joined by others who dared to \nexpress independent thought.\n  Among those arrested during the 2003 ``Black Spring'' crackdown was \nJose Luis Garcia Paneque, a doctor who became a journalist with the \nindependent news agency Libertad--or ``freedom''--in Las Tunas \nProvince. In 2003, Cuban state security searched his home and seized \nhis personal possessions. He was prosecuted and convicted under Cuba's \nOrwellian penal code for acting ``against the independence or the \nterritorial integrity of the state.''\n\n  He was sentenced to 24 years in prison--imagine, 24 years in prison--\nfor a crime of being ``against the independence or the territorial \nintegrity of the state.'' In fact, he was just a free journalist. He \nwas sentenced to 24 years. He is limited to one family visit every 45 \ndays. His health, understandably, has deteriorated and there is genuine \nconcern for his well-being. For advocating on his behalf, the regime \naccused his wife of espionage and conspired to organize mobs outside \ntheir home. These government-inspired mobs threatened to burn the house \nwhile the family feared for their lives and were still inside the home. \nHis wife and children were forced to flee the country, all because he \ndared to speak the truth.\n  Another independent journalist jailed by the regime is Normando \nHernandez Gonzalez from Camaguey Province. Hernandez Gonzalez was \narrested by the regime for reporting on the conditions of state-run \nservices in Cuba and for criticizing the government's management of \nissues such as tourism, agriculture, fishing, and cultural affairs. He \ntoo was convicted for acting against ``the independence or the \nterritorial integrity of the state.''\n  Following his arrest and 25-year sentence, Hernandez Gonzalez was \nplaced in solitary confinement, allowed only 4 hours of sunlight per \nweek, and limited communication with his family. Prison authorities \nencouraged inmates to harass Hernandez Gonzalez, according, to his wife \nYarai Reyes Marin. It is no surprise his health has declined during his \nimprisonment.\n  As technology makes incremental advances in Cuba, the regime \ncontinues to clamp down on those using it to speak freely. Around the \nworld, bloggers share information as fast as they receive it, but Cuban \nbloggers are lucky to have their messages penetrate the regime's \nrepressive Internet restrictions.\n  One blogger who has found a way to report on the struggles of Cuban \nsociety is a woman named Yoani Sanchez. Sanchez is able to blog, but \nshe does so at great risk of regime retribution at any moment. By e-\nmailing her observations on daily life in Cuba to friends outside the \ncountry, who then post them on line, she faces potential prosecution \nand imprisonment. Despite the risks, Sanchez eloquently expresses her \nsupport for freedom of expression. In one post she said:\n\n       State control over the media remains intact, even though \n     technological developments have helped people find parallel \n     paths to keep themselves informed. Illegal satellite dishes, \n     the controlled Internet, and books and manuals brought in by \n     tourists have shaken the government's monopoly on providing \n     news.\n\n  Like many other supposed ``freedoms'' in Cuba, the Cuban constitution \nactually provides for speech as long as it ``conforms to the aims of \nsocialist society.''\n  According to the State Department's 2008 report on Cuba's human \nrights, anyone engaged in:\n\n     disseminating ``enemy propaganda''\n\n  --is how they label it--\n\n     which includes expressing opinions at odds with those of the \n     government, is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.\n\n  Imagine 14 years in prison for disseminating ``enemy propaganda,'' as \nthey determine it.\n  We here in the United States, with our traditions of freedom of \nexpression and freedom of the press, often take our freedoms for \ngranted. As we near the 3rd of May--a day in honor of free press around \nthe world--I urge my colleagues to consider all those who are suffering \nfor exercising their inalienable right to free speech.\n  I have a list here I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord. It lists all of those who are presently in prison in Cuba as a \nresult of their desire to express themselves freely in violation of the \ndictates of the regime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ricardo Severino Gonzalez Alfonso, Normando Hernandez \n     Gonzalez, Hector Fernando Maseda Gutierrez, Pedro Arguelles \n     Moran, Victor Rolando Arroyo Carmona, Mijail Bargaza Lugo, \n     Juan Adolfo Fernandez Sainz, Miguel Galvan Gutierrez, Julia \n     Cesar Galvez Rodriguez, Jose Luis Garcia Paneque, Lester Luis \n     Gonzalez Penton, Ivan Hernandez Carrillo.\n       Juan Carlos Herrera Acosta, Regis Iglesias Ramirez, Jose \n     Ubaldo Izquierdo Hernandez, Jose Miguel Martinez Hernandez, \n     Pablo Pacheco Avila, Fabio Prieto Llorente, Alfredo Manuel \n     Pulido Lopez, Blas Giraldo Reyes Rodriguez, Omar Rodriguez \n     Saludes, Omar Moises Ruiz Hernandez, Raymundo Perdigon Brito, \n     Oscar Sanchez Madan, and Ramon Velazquez Toranso.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, today I will be introducing a \nresolution on World Freedom Day, if I may have another second to \nfinish, and as I do, I hope many of my colleagues will join in this \nresolution. There may be some of us in this body who might differ on \nthe best approach to bring freedom to Cuba. There ought to be no \ndissent on the issue that we all stand on the side of those who seek to \nfreely express themselves in the midst of a very oppressive regime. So \nI hope we will have a lot of support for this resolution which I will \nbe presenting later today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time is left, or would we \nbe able to secure 20 minutes for Senator Graham and myself?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority controls 7 minutes, \nand the majority controls 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to have 20 minutes for \nSenator Graham and myself. If there is something else that is \nscheduled, I am happy to scale that back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4913-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4913-S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to be notified at 10 minutes \nso I can assure that Senator Graham of South Carolina can also speak.\n  We are speaking today on a very important subject. We are urging \nPresident Obama today to reconsider the decision to close Guantanamo \nBay until he can reassure the American people that there is a viable \nalternative for detaining terrorist combatants.\n  Let there be no mistake. We are fighting a war on terror. This is a \nwar that is just as important as any we have ever fought. Every war \nthat we have fought for almost two centuries in this country has been a \nfight for freedom, and this is a fight for freedom too.\n  When President Obama announced by Executive order that he would close \nGuantanamo Bay, my initial reaction was, What are we going to do with \nthese prisoners? What is the plan? We have not seen a plan, yet we have \nan order that says we are going to execute a closing of Guantanamo Bay \nwith no plan for what we do with them.\n  I have been to Guantanamo Bay. I have visited that prison. I can tell \nmy colleagues that in my observation and everything that we have \nlearned since, the prisoners are being treated with respect. They are \nbeing well fed. They get health care coverage they have never had in \ntheir lives. Yet President Obama is saying we are going to close it \neven though we don't know what we are going to do with those prisoners.\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\n  What kind of precautions would be necessary to transfer these \nsuspected terrorists? Well, we know that American prisons are simply \nnot experienced in handling this unique and unprecedented brand of \nprisoner. In the United States, even petty and unsophisticated \ncriminals find ways to plot behind prison walls.\n  For example, there was a recent news release about prisoners \nsmuggling cell phones behind bars. The problem is so widespread that I \nhave introduced, along with Congressman Kevin Brady on the House side, \nlegislation to prevent prison inmates from using smuggled cell phones. \nIn Texas, authorities say a death row inmate, Richard Tabler, used a \nsmuggled cell phone to make threatening calls to a State Senator. \nTabler's phone was found in the ceiling above a shower, and when they \nfound it, they also found 11 more phones belonging to other death row \ninmates while they were looking for Mr. Tabler's. Do we want to take \nthe risk that key al-Qaida terrorists, including Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed, the confessed mastermind of the attacks on 9/11, won't be \nable to do what Richard Tabler and so many other prisoners have done--\nget a cell phone and plot attacks or escapes?\n  I think many of my colleagues understand the stakes here. On July 19 \nof 2007, the Senate voted 94 to 3 that detainees housed at Guantanamo \nBay should not be released into American society, nor should they be \ntransferred stateside into facilities in American communities and \nneighborhoods. So what is the alternative? There is another \nalternative. We could let them go. We could release them back to their \nhome country or to some other foreign country, but let's look at the \nrisks of that.\n  We now know that as many as 61 detainees previously released from \nGuantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield, many of whom are now \nwaging war against Americans. The prisoners already released were \nbelieved to be the least dangerous and yet many have returned to the \nbattlefield. The ones remaining are considered the most dangerous and \nthe most likely to kill again or plot to kill again.\n  Earlier this year, we learned that one former Guantanamo Bay \ndetainee, Said Ali al-Shihri, is currently serving as the deputy leader \nof al-Qaida in Yemen. Those terrorists are directly responsible for the \n2008 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Yemen in which 10 people were \nmurdered. Even though Al-Shihri was transferred from Guantanamo Bay to \nSaudi Arabia for a period of rehabilitation, he rejoined al-Qaida and \nassumed a leadership role in the planning and execution of terrorist \nacts. With this knowledge, can we be serious that we would abandon the \nsecurity of Guantanamo Bay for an alternative of foreign transfers that \ncould pose harm to ourselves and our allies, and especially to our \nyoung men and women serving right now in the military in the Middle \nEast?\n  Without a viable option--and I do not consider it viable to let them \ngo, because we have a history of what happened with that, nor do I \nthink it is a viable option to transfer them to a prison in the United \nStates until we know how we are going to secure that prison from any \nvisitors, any capability of getting cell phones or, worse yet, weapons, \nso that we can assure there will not be plots from an American prison \nto kill Americans who are innocent anywhere in our country. Unless we \nhave a viable option, I urge the President not to set a deadline for \nclosing Guantanamo Bay until the American people are assured that there \nis a safe place for them to go. I believe the safest place for them is \nright where they are. Guantanamo Bay is secure. There have been no \nescapes from Guantanamo Bay, and they are getting treated very well. I \nhave witnessed that, and many others of my colleagues who have taken \nthe time to visit know they are being treated well. In many cases they \nare getting better care than they have had in their lifetimes.\n  I implore the President to change this order. Let's have a plan \nbefore we release these people out into the world to plot against \nAmericans or bring them onto our soil before we know that we have a \nsafe, secure environment, and where communities are willing, able, and \nencouraging that they be there in their midst.\n  Madam President, thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I appreciate what the Senator from Texas \nhas been saying. This issue of what to do with the Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees is a central issue for the Nation and the overall war on \nterror, because the President is looking for partners. He keeps saying \nthat. I stand ready to be a partner. The best-run jail in the world \nwhere they are now is Guantanamo Bay. I have been there many times. The \nmen and women who are working in that prison are doing an outstanding \njob. They follow the rules. It is a model military prison. It is tough \nduty. What they go through every day you probably don't realize, and we \ncan't tell you at all, but it is tough duty. Anyone serving down there \nis doing the country a great service.\n  Having said that, I understand the need to change the image of the \ncountry. I have been one of the Republicans--a military lawyer for 25 \nyears--who understands the way we conduct this war determines whether \nwe will win it. The high ground in military operations is usually a \nphysical location. When you are in a battle or a war, you try to get \nthe high ground, because that is the best place to fight the enemy \nfrom. In this war, it is an ideological struggle, so the high ground is \nthe moral high ground. It does matter what we do.\n  My goal for America is to be the best we can be. Our enemies--al-\nQaida and other groups--are some of the most barbaric people in the \nhistory of the world. But here is what it comes down to. When we \ncapture one of them, it becomes about us. They will cut people's heads \noff in the most brutal fashion, abuse and humiliate people. They don't \ngive trials. They are not reasoned. They are barbarians. The fact that \nwe choose a different way is not a weakness, it is a strength. Trust \nme, if we are going to lead the world to a better way, we need to show \nthe world a better way. And there is a better way.\n\n  In World War II, we had thousands--350,000, I think--of German and \nJapanese prisoners housed in the United States, Nazis and Japanese \nprisoners committed to our destruction. We held them here under our \nvalue system, under the Geneva Conventions, in communities all over \nAmerica. The Nazis and the Japanese were a tough crowd. When those \nprisoners were released, those who were released, they went back to \ntheir country with a view of America that helped us form the modern \nJapan and Germany.\n  Some of the people we are talking about at Guantanamo Bay are subject \nto war crimes trials. So I am urging the President to leave on the \ntable the military commission option. We can reform it, but let's not \ncriminalize this war. They are not accused of robbing a liquor store. \nThese are not common criminals.\n  Under domestic criminal law, you cannot hold someone forever without \na trial, nor should you. But under the law of armed conflict, if you \ncatch a member of the enemy force, you can keep them off the \nbattlefield as long as they present a danger. That has been military \nlaw forever.\n  I believe we would be better off if we look at the people who are \nmembers of al-Qaida at Guantanamo Bay as enemy combatants, part of an \nunorganized militia, military organization bent on our destruction, and \nthey are a part of the enemy force, not some common criminal. We can \nkeep them off the battlefield as long as necessary, but we have to do \nit within our value system.\n  I am urging the President that if someone at Guantanamo Bay is \nsubject to a war crimes trial, let's don't go to Federal court, as we \ndid with the blind sheik trial in the nineties, which was a disaster. \nLet's put them in a military tribunal and give them justice through the \nmilitary legal system of which I have been a part for 25 years.\n  I can tell America one thing: The judges, the lawyers, and the jurors \nwho wear the uniform of the United States are the best among us. These \nare the same people who administer justice to our own troops. It is a \ngreat place to conduct a trial because we can do things for national \nsecurity in a military setting that we cannot do in Federal court. But \nI can assure you, justice will be rendered and people will be treated \nfairly. The courts-martial we have had, the commission trials we have \nhad at Guantanamo Bay, we have seen sentences that make sense.\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  I have been a part of the military all my adult life. The jurors take \ntheir responsibilities extremely seriously. They hold the Government to \ntheir burden of proof. And the judges and the lawyers are outstanding.\n  There will be a group of people who will not be subject to war crimes \ntrials because of the nature of the evidence, because of the unique \nrelationship we may have between the evidence and an ally, that we are \nnot going to subject that evidence to a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard, but we know with certainty, beyond a preponderance of the \nevidence, that this person is a member of a terrorist organization and \nis engaged in dangerous activities and likely to do that in the future.\n  What I am arguing to the administration, proposing to them, is those \npeople we think are too dangerous to let go, let's create a national \nsecurity court made up of Federal judges, somebody out of the military, \nwho will look over the military shoulder and see if the evidence \nwarrants an enemy combatant designation. That way, we will have an \nindependent judiciary validating the fact that the person in custody is \npart of an enemy force, a danger to this country, and then have a \nperiodic review of that person's status so they are not left in legal \nlimbo. They will have a chance every year to make their case anew.\n  We have to realize that we have released more people from Guantanamo \nBay than we have in detention and we have put people in Guantanamo Bay \nwho were there by mistake. That is a fact. We threw the net too large. \nThat happened.\n  Let me tell you what else has happened. Mr. President, 1 in 10 we let \ngo has gone back to the fight. The No. 2 al-Qaida operative in Somalia \nwas a detainee at Guantanamo Bay. We had a suicide bomber in Iraq blow \nhimself up who was at Guantanamo Bay. We are going to make mistakes, \nbut I want a process to limit those mistakes as much as possible.\n  I end with this thought. How we do this is important. We can close \nGuantanamo Bay and repair our image, but we have to have a legal system \nthat has robust due process, that is transparent, that is independent, \nbut recognizes we are at war. And that takes us to the Uyghurs.\n  There is a group of people in our custody whom we caught in \nAfghanistan who are part of a separatist movement in China. They are \nMuslims. They were training in Afghanistan to go back to China to take \non the Chinese Government. They have been determined to no longer be \nenemy combatants in terms of a threat from the al-Qaida perspective, \nbut what to do with the Uyghurs.\n  One thing I suggest to the President is that you cannot change \nimmigration law. Our laws prevent a known terrorist from being released \nin our country. These people have engaged in terrorist activities. \nTheir goal was to go back to China, not to come here. But there are \npress reports that one of the Uyghurs was allowed to look at TV and saw \na woman not properly clothed and destroyed the television. We have to \nmake sure that, one, we follow our own laws, and the fact they were \ngoing to go back to China does not mean they are safe to release here \nbecause they have been radicalized.\n  We have to make some hard decisions as a nation. I stand ready with \nthe President and my Democratic colleagues to close Guantanamo Bay, but \nwe do need a plan. We need a legal system of which we can be proud that \nwill protect us.\n  The final comment is that the idea of releasing more photos showing \ndetainee abuse is not in our national interest. We have men and women \nserving overseas. It will inflame the populations. It will be used by \nour enemies. I urge the administration to take that case all the way to \nthe Supreme Court and protect our troops in the field.\n  I understand the President's dilemma and challenge. Harsh \ninterrogation techniques have hurt this country more than they have \nhelped. We can be a nation that abides by the Geneva Conventions, rule \nof law--we have been that way for a long time--and still defend \nourselves. I agree with the President there. But I do believe we need a \ndetainee policy that understands that the people we are talking about \nare not run-of-the-mill criminals. They are committed terrorists, and I \ndon't say that lightly. The only way that label should stick under the \nsystem I am proposing is if an independent judiciary validates that \ndecision. That is the best we can do.\n  This decision we are going to make as a nation is important. I tried \nto speak my mind and be balanced. There is a way for us to work \ntogether to get this right. I look forward to working with the \nadministration to make some of the most difficult decisions in American \nhistory. I am confident we can do it if we work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4915-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1014.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, America is facing a crisis, and this is \nwhat it looks like: Two buildings next to one another, one a well-kept \nhome; next door, a foreclosed property, boarded up, vacant, vandalized. \nSadly, this is a crisis which is affecting every community in America. \nI have seen it in the streets of Chicago. I have seen it in suburban \ntowns. I have seen it in my downstate communities.\n  Madam President, 8.1 million homes are facing foreclosure in America \ntoday. That isn't my estimate, it is the estimate of Moody's. They are \nsupposed to be good predictors of our economy. What does 8.1 million \nforeclosed homes represent? One out of every six home mortgages in \nAmerica in foreclosure--one out of every six. It is a reality. It is a \nreality that affects the five out of six, our homes where we continue \nto make our mortgage payments and wonder what the problem is. Why is \nthe value of my home going down? I am making the payments. It is going \ndown because, sadly, somewhere on your block is another home in \nforeclosure, boarded up, an eyesore at best, a haven for criminal \nactivity at worst--a reality that continues to grow.\n  Two years ago, before we even started in on this crisis as we know \nit, I proposed a change in the bankruptcy law, a change which I think \ncould have forestalled this crisis we know today. Along the way, there \nhas been resistance to this change. By whom? The banks that brought us \nthis crisis in America have resisted this change to do something about \nmortgage foreclosure. That is a fact.\n  Last year, I offered this amendment to change the bankruptcy law, and \nthe banking community said: Totally unnecessary; we don't need this \nkind of a change. This mortgage foreclosure is not going to be all that \nbad.\n  In fact, the estimates were of only 2 million homes in foreclosure \nlast year from our friends in the banking community, the so-called \nexperts. Here we are a year later. The estimate is now up to 8 million \nhomes in foreclosure.\n  Who are these people facing foreclosure? Were they speculators and \ninvestors who were buying up properties and they thought that maybe \nthey would double in value and they could quickly sell them? There may \nbe a handful of those folks out there. By and large, they are \nfamilies--families who are trying to keep it together,\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\nunder a roof, the most important asset they own, their home, trying to \nmake payments when they discovered that the mortgage that was peddled \nto them by the same banking industry and mortgage banking industry \nturned out to be a fraud on its face.\n  We remember the heyday of all this activity. They would tell people: \nCome on in. Call this 800 number. We can let you finance and refinance. \nWe have a deal for you.\n  People would show up at these mortgage brokers, and they would say: \nHow much money do you make?\n  The guy would say: So many thousand dollars.\n  They would say: Oh, you are perfect. We have just the mortgage that \nwill put you in this home, keep you in this home, or let you borrow \nmoney on this home.\n  The person would say: Do you need some proof? Do you need some \ndocumentation?\n  No, no, no, your word is good enough. No-doc mortgages.\n  In no time at all, they would be sitting at a closing. I have been to \nquite a few of them myself as a lawyer and buying a few properties in \nmy own life. They give them a stack of papers--you know what I am \ntalking about, a stack of papers--and they would turn the corners and \nsay: Just keep signing it. Sign it.\n  What is it?\n  Oh, government forms, standard boilerplate. I could read it to you, \nbut we want to get out of here in the next half hour. Keep signing, you \nkeep signing.\n  At the end of the day, they say: In 60 days, first payment. You are \ngoing to love this place.\n  Out the door, and in comes another couple. That is what it was all \nabout.\n  Then what happened 12 months later, 2 years later? That mystery \nmortgage kind of exploded in their face. All of a sudden, they were \nfacing terms in that mortgage that were absolutely incomprehensible and \nunsustainable. They could not make the payments on it. The interest \nrates were going up too high. They called them subprime mortgages. That \nwas the initial onslaught of this housing crisis in America. But then \nit grew into a lot of other mortgages too.\n  I told the story before--and it is worth repeating--of the flight \nattendant I met on a United flight flying from Washington to Chicago. \nAfter she did her chores on the plane and there was a quiet moment, she \ncame and knelt down in the aisle next to me.\n  Senator, I have a problem. I am a single mom with three kids. I live \nout in the suburbs. I have worked for this airline for 20 years. I have \nbeen a good employee, always show up for work. I take it seriously. I \nhave my little home out there, but I have a problem. My interest rate \non my mortgage is too high. I need to take advantage of lower interest \nrates that are now available. If I can get down to a lower interest \nrate, a lower monthly payment, I can keep my home. But if I don't, I am \ngoing to lose it. I can't make ends meet. I can't keep it together. \nWhat am I supposed to do? They say I am underwater?\n  Do you know what that means? The value of your home is less than the \nmortgage principal today. It has happened to a lot of people.\n  Do you know what I told her: Sadly, I don't have an answer for you. \nIf that bank will not bring you in, sit you down at a desk, and \nrenegotiate the terms of that mortgage, you are about to go through the \nmost painful, torturous path in your life. You are forced into default \non your mortgage, you cannot make the payments, you become delinquent, \nreceive the notice of foreclosure, and then it just goes from bad to \nworse.\n  Madam President, 8 million American stories, 8 million foreclosures. \nWhat we are offering today is the only proposal before the Senate which \ngives us a chance to do something about this crisis. It is the only \nthing that can change the dynamic which continues to eat at the heart \nof our economy which adds foreclosure upon foreclosure and completely \nparalyzes the housing industry in America. That is at the heart of this \nrecession. That was the canary in the coal mine. That is what triggered \nwhere we are today, and it is still there and getting worse.\n  I sat down 2 years ago with the banking industry and said to them: We \nhave to do something.\n  I can recall conversations with Henry Paulson from Wall Street, \nSecretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush, where I said \nto Mr. Paulson: I know you wanted to save the banks, but how about \nsaving the homeowners? What are we going to do about the mortgage \nforeclosure? Well, we will get to that later; or, it is not a problem. \nHe kept putting me off and putting me off. He put me off, but he didn't \nput off the crisis.\n\n  Why is it in this country, in America, that we can find hundreds of \nbillions of taxpayers' dollars from hard-working people all over the \nUnited States to come to the rescue of bad banking decisions, rotten \ninvestments, mortgages that were fraudulent on their face, but can't \nsummon the political will to do something about 8 million families in \nAmerica who are going to face foreclosure? That is where we are.\n  When I sat down with the banks, I said: I will work with you. Let us \nfind a reasonable way so we can bring people to the table--such as that \nflight attendant--and find a way to work it through. Because at the end \nof the day, a foreclosure isn't good for anyone. A family loses their \nhome, a neighborhood is ravaged by vacant property, the people next \ndoor lose the value of their home, the bank spends $50,000, at a \nminimum, for expenses in a foreclosure, and then 99 percent of these \nboarded-up buildings, these foreclosed homes, are the property of a \nbank. How much time is that bank spending on that property? How much \nworry do they have about the value of the neighbor's home? The answer \nis none. Banks aren't in the business of putting in windows and \nestablishing security and cutting the grass and making the property \nlook good. They move money around. But now they are becoming property \nowners of the most blighted properties in America.\n  Some banks are walking away from it, incidentally. The banks are \nwalking away from the foreclosed property. I sat down with them and \nsaid: How can this be good for a bank? How can this be good for a \nfamily? How can this be good for the Nation? Let's sit down and work \ntogether. But I come today to the floor to tell you that despite months \nand months of heroic effort by my staff--Brad McConnell, who is here \nand who has worked tirelessly on this issue--and my own efforts to \nreach out to the banking community, only one bank is supporting this \namendment to do something about foreclosure in America--one bank: \nCitigroup.\n  I can't tell you how many of these bankers have walked away. The \nAmerican Bankers Association has been terrible--terrible. They will not \neven participate in a negotiation on dealing with this foreclosure \ncrisis. The Community Bankers of America, a group I have respected over \nthe years because they are closer to the people; they are the hometown \nbanks--have walked away as well. They are not interested in this \nconversation, they say. The credit unions? Well, I will give them some \ncredit. They did try. But in the end, they walked away as well. The big \nbanks--JPMorgan Chase, you see them all over the United States--they \nwere at the table until last week and then decided: No, we are going to \nwalk away too. We are not interested in this conversation. Wells Fargo, \nBank of America, and the list goes on and on.\n  If any of these names sound familiar, it is because they are \nsurviving today due to taxpayer dollars. And you know what they say \nabout these poor people who have lost their homes? It was a bad \nbusiness judgment and people have to pay for their bad business \njudgments. Really? How many of these bankers paid for their bad \nbusiness judgments, with their multimillion dollar bonuses, with the \nrescues we have provided from American taxpayers--hard-earned tax \ndollars sent their way? The fact is we have been kind to these bankers \nwho have brought us into this crisis. Yet they are literally shunning \nand stiff-arming the people who are facing foreclosure. These banks \nthat are too big to fail say that 8 million Americans facing \nforeclosure are too little to count in our political process, and they \nhave walked out the door.\n  Well, I want to tell you, this amendment I am offering can save the \nhomes of 1.7 million families. I wish we could save more, but the fact \nis we have this opportunity before us, and I think it is something we \nshouldn't ignore and we\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nshould support. Some Members of the Senate voted against my amendment a \nyear ago. I understand that. I heard them. They said: You have to sit \nwith the banks and see if you can work something out. Well, we did, \nuntil they walked away.\n  What we offer today is significantly different than what we offered a \nyear ago. We literally give to the banks control over whether a family \nin foreclosure can go into bankruptcy. We say that anybody facing \nforeclosure--who is delinquent for at least 60 days on a home that is \nvalued at no more than $729,000, with a mortgage that was written no \nlater than 2008--has to show up at the bank at least 45 days before \nthey file bankruptcy and present all the economic information, all the \nfinancial documents the bank would need for a mortgage--proof of \nincome, indication of net worth. If the bank at that point offers them \na renegotiated mortgage--a mortgage which will basically allow them to \nstay in the home, that reduces the borrower's mortgage debt-to-income \nratio to 31 percent, which is the standard the administration is \ntalking about, or offers hope for home refinancing--another program--\nand the person facing foreclosure does not take that offer, then that \nsame family in foreclosure cannot use the bankruptcy court to rewrite \nthe mortgage. So in other words, the banks ultimately have the key to \nthe courthouse. If they make the offer and it is turned down, that is \nthe end of the story.\n  What happens if they do not make the offer? Under this law, we would \nchange the Bankruptcy Code as follows: Under the current bankruptcy \nlaw, if you are deep in debt and facing foreclosure, and you own \nseveral pieces of real estate--your home, a vacation condo in Florida, \na vacation condo in Aspen, CO, and you are facing foreclosure on all \nthree properties because of economic problems--you can walk into that \nbankruptcy court and the judge can say we will renegotiate the terms of \nthe mortgage on the Aspen, CO, property--we will reduce the principal \nof the mortgage to the fair market value, the interest rate will be the \ncurrent interest rate, we will add a little to it, and so forth and so \non. The bankruptcy judge has that power for the Florida property and \nfor the Colorado property. But the law prohibits the bankruptcy court \nfrom rewriting the terms of the mortgage of a person's home. Why? Why \ndoes that make any sense? If the bankruptcy court can rewrite the \nmortgage on your vacation condos, your farm, or your ranch, why can't \nthey do it for your home? That is what this bill does. It gives the \nbankruptcy court that power. And in creating that power, it says to the \nbankers: Get serious.\n  The voluntary plans we have had for refinancing mortgages in \nforeclosure across America have been an abject failure. We have to have \nan opportunity here for the bankruptcy court to step in and make a \ndifference, and that is what we are trying to achieve with this.\n  I know my colleague, the Senator from California, is here on the \nfloor, and I will yield to her in a moment. I have to leave the Chamber \nmyself. But that is what we are proposing today. It is an amendment \nwhich we have worked on long and hard. It is an amendment which I think \nshould be looked at in honest terms. My goal is not to put more people \nin bankruptcy court. My goal is to avoid it. Put them at the table with \nthe banker at least 45 days in advance, avoid the bankruptcy court, \navoid the foreclosure, avoid the boarded-up and burned-out building \nthat happens to be right next door to the home you have worked so hard \nto keep and to maintain.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association has claimed, in front of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, that this is going to add cost to everybody's \nmortgage if in fact some people can turn to bankruptcy court. Let me \nfirst say that future borrowers aren't even eligible for this \nbankruptcy assistance. It ends as of January 1, 2009. Future mortgages, \nfuture foreclosures aren't even affected by it. It has an ending date.\n  We also have a quote--and I don't have time to read in detail here--\nfrom Adam Levitin, who has analyzed this and says the argument that \ninterest rates will go up because of this provision is plain wrong.\n  Secondly, they argue that changing the Bankruptcy Code will cause \nuncertainty in the market. The American Bankers Association says it \nwill add risk. I will tell you this: If you want uncertainty in the \nmarket, keep the foreclosures coming, one after another. Let them hit \nyour neighborhood. Uncertainty about your home and its value and \nwhether you can sell it is the reality of what they will face.\n\n  They say bankruptcy judges shouldn't be allowed to break the sanctity \nof the contract. Before we argue about the sanctity of a no-doc \nmortgage, before we argue about some of the predatory lending practices \nthat led to this mess, let me tell you that the bankruptcy court takes \non contracts every single day. That is the nature of the bankruptcy \ncourt. To me, that is an argument which goes nowhere.\n  They argue that allowing borrowers to modify mortgages in bankruptcy \nwould shield them from the consequences of poor decisions. They call it \nthe ``moral hazard.'' In other words, take your medicine, America. You \nmade a bad mortgage, you pay the price. That didn't apply when it came \nto bailing out these banks when we were asked for $700 billion to make \nup for the mistakes of these banks. Where is the moral hazard there, as \nthey run off with their parachutes and their bonuses? I don't buy that \nargument whatsoever.\n  Finally, they argue that restricting this amendment to subprime and \nexotic loans is a better way to do it. Well, I can tell you, we know \nthat isn't going to work. There are too many mortgages now in peril, \nway beyond the original subprime mortgages. And how do we explain to \nour constituents that we are providing special assistance to borrowers \nwho took out a risky loan, such as a subprime, and ignoring those who \nhave been trapped in other mortgages that create a disaster?\n  I am going to yield the floor to my colleague from California, and \nthank her for coming, and I want to tell you something: Her State has \nbeen hit harder than any other State. You ought to see what has \nhappened in portions of California. She knows this issue personally, \nand I thank her, and I yield the floor to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair, and before my colleague leaves the \nfloor--and I have only 10 minutes, because of all the responsibilities \nwe all have. I have to be somewhere in 15 minutes--I am here to stand \nwith you, Senator Durbin, in your courageous effort to stop thousands \nand thousands of homes from foreclosure and, frankly, to get to the \nbottom of this economic recession.\n  We know, because economists have told us, that the problems we are \nfacing all start with the fact that we have had a collapse in the \nhousing market. And, my friend, what you have done is you have taken on \nthe special interests in a way that is very clear. I can only say that \nI hope when the votes are counted, the people who serve in the Senate \ndo the right thing and support the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I stood on the floor of the Senate when we debated the \nForeclosure Prevention Act a year ago--a year ago--and I described how \nhard the foreclosure crisis was hitting this Nation, in particular my \nState of California, the largest State in the Union. And as we know, \nwhat happens in California, good and bad, spreads throughout the \ncountry. They say when California sneezes, everybody else gets a cold. \nThe truth is we are having great problems in California, starting with \nthe housing crisis.\n  I am sorry to say that a year later, after I stood here and said this \nis a crisis we must address and must address in a far-reaching way, the \nsituation is bad and, frankly, it could well get worse. If we turn our \nback on the Durbin amendment, it will surely get worse. Foreclosure \nfilings were higher in 2007 than they were in 2006. They were higher \nstill in 2008. And they are at a pace that is going to have them go \neven higher in 2009. One year ago, when I stood on this floor, we were \nexpecting then 2 million homes to be lost to foreclosure over the \ncourse of the crisis. Now that number is expected to be over 8 million \nhomes. If we turn our back on the Durbin amendment, what we are \nessentially saying is: Oh, the status quo is fine. It is all working \nout.\n  The Durbin amendment is a very moderate amendment. It basically says\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nif a bank and a borrower don't sit down and try to renegotiate a \nmortgage and reach an agreement on how they can restructure that \nmortgage so the borrower can stay in the home--and the restructuring is \nvery clear; it should be about 31 percent of income--if that effort is \nnot undertaken and the borrower files for bankruptcy, the judge can \nlook at how to restructure that mortgage. I do not understand how \nanyone could vote no on this, except if they are dancing to the tune of \nthe banks.\n  Let me say this: I work with the banks in my State. I respect them, \nwhen they are doing the right thing, when they are acting in the public \ninterest, when they are lending to people who deserve to have those \nloans, when they are not redlining, when they are being fair. I support \nthem wholeheartedly. Oftentimes they are very good neighbors and they \ndonate to charities in the counties, in the communities, in the State \nof California. But when they are wrong, they are wrong. For them to not \nwork with Senator Durbin and to walk out of the room when he has \nmodified his proposal in such a way that it is so reasonable? As \nSenator Durbin has said: When someone goes into bankruptcy the judge \ncan look at everything, all of their assets--their second homes, their \nfurniture, their cars. But they are prohibited from looking at that \nfirst and, by the way, most important asset--the home residence. Why? \nBecause banks over the years have said we do not want our books to look \nworse, we don't want to take any losses, and we are not willing to \nbudge.\n\n  This is a crisis. All of the fallout in the financial sector comes \ndown to the fact that there were entire new instruments created around \nthe value of a home: derivatives, all kinds of paper, all kinds of \ninsurance--all on top of a home. So when the home goes, it goes. The \nhouse of cards falls. That is what has happened and one of the reasons \nis these foreclosures. We can stop a lot of these foreclosures if we \nadopt the Durbin amendment.\n  My State is having a very hard time. We can see the number of \nseriously delinquent homes in my State going up here on this chart. \nThis is 2008. All the way up here is over 8 percent and the actual \nforeclosures at over 4 percent. This is, in many ways, a virus that is \nspreading. What happens when a home is abandoned and no one cares about \nit because many times the banks let it go? Frankly, the mortgage is \nheld by so many people that nobody makes sure the home is kept up, that \nthe pool doesn't become a hazard in the community. We have pictures I \nshowed the last time of a vacant pool being used by kids as a \nskateboard park. That was probably one of the better things that was \nhappening in the neighborhood. Homes are being looted. The value of the \nnext-door home goes down and the crisis continues to spread.\n  Look at what is happening in my State. One out of every 24 homes in \nMerced has filed for foreclosure. In Stockton, 1 out of 27. Riverside-\nSan Bernardino, 1 out of 28. Modesto, 1 out of 29 homes.\n  When you go to these beautiful areas of my State, 1 out of 27 homes \nin Stockton has filed for foreclosure. In Bakersfield, 1 out of 37; \nVallejo, 1 out of 37; Sacramento, 1 out of 47. It goes on and on and it \nis getting worse, and the Durbin amendment will help us. Why? These are \njust numbers. There are families in these homes, obviously. If they \nhave a chance to restructure their mortgage, then they might well want \nto use the opportunity to do so in a bankruptcy court.\n  We all know that our home--those of us who have been fortunate enough \nto buy a home--in many cases is our biggest asset. When that home goes \ndown in value, that is bad enough. But when we are in a mortgage that \nsuddenly ticks up and we cannot afford to stay in our home and we \nsuddenly lose our job and have to take a job that is a lower paying \njob, because of the ramifications that this is having on the economy, \nwe are in trouble and our families are in trouble.\n  At the end of March, Californians experienced 363,891 foreclosures \nsince 2007. Think about it, more than 300,000 of our families have \nexperienced foreclosure since 2007. We had 6 of the top 10 and 13 of \nthe top 20 metro areas with the worst foreclosure rates. Today we have \nanother opportunity to help stem this crisis. If we miss this \nopportunity, it is our fault and we should be judged on this vote. That \nis how strongly I feel.\n  The bill before us makes changes to the HOPE for Homeowners Program, \nsuch as reducing fees and administrative requirements to make the \nprogram more attractive to lenders and borrowers. It provides a safe \nharbor against lawsuits to protect servicers who participate in the \nmortgage modification program. That is all good and it is helpful. But \nthe one piece that is missing is the Durbin amendment, which would \nallow borrowers at risk of foreclosure to receive assistance from the \nbankruptcy court in restructuring their loans so they can keep their \nfamilies in their homes.\n  I have met children who have said they cry themselves to sleep every \nnight because they think they are going to lose their home, and their \nhome is their castle.\n  For us to turn our back on the Durbin amendment for some rationale \nthat, when stripped away, comes down to ``because the banks don't like \nit,'' would be a travesty of justice for these children.\n  I believe had Senator Durbin's proposal been passed last year we \nwould have saved hundreds of thousands of homes nationwide. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  We are saving vacation homes. We are saving automobiles. We are \nsaving all these other assets which a bankruptcy judge can in fact \nrestructure. But the main thing we should be saving, the residential \nhome, is not allowed to be brought up in bankruptcy unless we agree to \nthe Durbin amendment.\n  I have to say, Senator Durbin is a great negotiator. I have served \nwith him in Congress since the 1980s and I know he listened to the \nbankers. I know he changed and modified his amendment consistent with \nwhat they said and consistent with President Obama's housing \naffordability plan. Again, the borrower cannot seek a modification \nthrough bankruptcy unless the borrower has gone to the lender and said \nlet's negotiate. If that doesn't bear fruit, then they can bring it \ninto the bankruptcy court.\n  President Obama's housing plan gives great incentives to lenders to \nmake loan modifications. But his plan also included the contingency \nthat a borrower could seek relief through bankruptcy if all else fails. \nThis is a critical additional incentive to ensure that lenders and, \nfrankly, borrowers do the right thing. It says a borrower and a lender \nmust sit down and try to resolve the mortgage problem before the \nborrower can go to court. We believe, even with the changes that \nSenator Durbin made, 1.7 million homeowners could have their homes \nsaved.\n  Let's think about it--1.7 million homeowners. Almost 2 million \nhomeowners. That is larger than the populations of some of our States. \nWe can help 1.7 million homeowners.\n  We have allocated trillions of dollars to reduce the threat to the \nfinancial system posed by toxic assets. That was the hardest vote I had \nto make in my lifetime. It was hard. I lost sleep over that vote. But I \nwas told by Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson that the whole financial \nsystem could collapse around us, we would lose capitalism, we would \nlose our free market system, we would be in panic, and I voted yes to \ntrillions of dollars, because I am very worried. I shouldn't say \ntrillions--hundreds of billions.\n  How do we look ourselves in the mirror if we have voted billions, \nhundreds of billions of dollars to save the banks, even though we know \nsome of them have taken advantage of that, and companies such as AIG \nhave taken advantage of it, and they have given these huge bonuses to \npeople who do not deserve them? We know what a nightmare that is. But \nhow do we do that in the name of saving the financial system and turn \nour backs on homeowners, middle-class people who are suffering because \nof the fallout of these bad financial decisions?\n  If we bow to the banks on this amendment, I personally think it is a \nstain on this Senate, a stain that cannot be rubbed out. This is an \namendment that is fair. This is an amendment that is modest. This is an \namendment that has been negotiated. Senator Durbin has done everything \nin his power to reach agreement. What remains is a very modest \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\n  I will close by again explaining it. The Durbin amendment basically \nsays that when homeowners are in trouble and at risk of losing their \nhome and going into bankruptcy, if those homeowners reach out to the \nlender and they sit down and try to renegotiate a package on those \nmortgage payments, if they do it in good faith but it doesn't work out, \nthen and only then can a homeowner go to bankruptcy court and ask the \njudge to please help and restructure their mortgage.\n  That passes every test of fairness. That passes every test that you \nwould say an amendment should pass: fairness, justice, pragmatic, \nlistening to both sides.\n  I am here filled with hope that we can send a message today to the \nAmerican people that we stand on the side of our families. Yes, we will \nwork with the banks and try to get them to do the right thing. Dick \nDurbin has done so. But if they are stubborn and they will not agree, \nand because they are stubborn and they will not agree, it means this \nhousing crisis will continue to deteriorate, I have to say I am going \nto be very sad if this Durbin amendment does not pass.\n  This is the time to act. I said it a year ago. I predicted worse \nthings would happen. I didn't do it out of whole cloth. We have the \neconomists in our office, in our State, who see this. We need to act \nnow or we will be back here in a year with the Durbin amendment. It \nwill fly through here and people will say, and I predict: Gee, I was \nwrong.\n  Let's not go there. Let's do this. It is the right thing to do. It \nmakes this bill strong and it does what the President intended when he \noriginally sent us his housing rescue plan.\n  Mr. President, I want to say, although he is not on the floor, to our \nleader on this, Dick Durbin, how much I respect him and admire him. I \nknow the courage it takes to stand up to the special interests. He has \ndone it in behalf of the families of Illinois and this great Nation. I \nhope he will prevail on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent the time be equally divided on \nthe quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I now suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbankruptcy lifeline being offered by the senior Senator from Illinois. \nThis bankruptcy lifeline is at the core of the housing bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives and now under debate today in the Senate.\n  In the last few years, millions of families were led into \nunsustainable home mortgages that pushed our country into an \nunprecedented economic crisis. With the collapse of the housing market, \nmany are trapped in mortgages with unbearable interest rates and \nprincipal significantly higher than market values.\n  No one wants to walk away from the home they purchased, with \nneighbors they like, a school their children are doing well in, a town \nthey feel comfortable in, but many cannot afford to pay under the terms \nof the mortgage they currently hold.\n  I have already spoken on this floor about the need to ban deceptive \npractices in mortgage brokering, practices that steer unknowing \ncustomers into complicated and expensive mortgages. A ban on steering \npayments and prepayment penalties would go a long way toward ensuring \nthat we do not get into this situation again.\n  But right now we are confronted with what to do about those who \nalready put their life savings on the line to attain a slice of the \nAmerican dream and who are on the verge of seeing that dream shattered.\n  Unfortunately, we are now in the midst of a recession--there is \nlittle prospect of housing prices returning to their bubble levels for \nmany years, and almost 50,000 Americans are losing their homes every \nweek to foreclosure. This is a sad and destructive phenomenon. \nForeclosure tears apart neighborhoods and destroys family savings. It \nalso has proven to have a devastating effect on our financial system.\n  In fact, subprime foreclosures are, as we all know, the primary \nreason our banks have been hemorrhaging money. The billions in write-\ndowns our banks have taken and the billions of taxpayer monies our \ngovernment has placed into them is due to the collapse of the housing \nmarket and the decline in the value of subprime--and now prime--\nresidential mortgage-backed securities. All the TARP money in the world \nwill do little for the banks unless and until we stabilize housing.\n  Fortunately, we have begun to get on the right path with housing. The \nObama administration's Making Home Affordable plan takes a commonsense \napproach of lower a borrower's monthly payments. Similarly, the Hope \nfor Homeowners Act, with a few fixes, has great potential to help. But \nneither plan has the ability to take on the major problem still \noutstanding in the housing market--underwater mortgages. Senator \nDurbin's amendment before us today tackles the problem head-on.\n  What does this amendment do? In practice, its main use will be to \nforce loan servicers to sit down and genuinely negotiate a reasonable \nmortgage adjustment. My office gets calls every day from constituents \nin Oregon who can't get a response from their lender or loan servicer. \nOne constituent called her bank 13 times and never was able to talk to \nthe right person. Sadly, she, like so many others, ultimately lost her \nhome.\n  The Obama plan will improve the situation by offering a number of \ncarrots to lenders and servicers. But we also need to hold out the \npossibility, when servicers don't respond, of providing a lifeline \nopportunity.\n  My colleagues are all familiar with the program ``Who Wants to be a \nMillionaire?'' When there is no ability to answer the question, there \nis a lifeline. In this case, when there is no ability to connect with \nthe servicer to have a conversation about a win-win solution--a \nsolution that is right for the homeowner because they are able to stay \nin their home, a solution that is right for the mortgage owner because \nthe mortgage continues to be paid, albeit at somewhat lower rates--it \nis still right because the mortgage owner doesn't benefit from \nforeclosure if they only get 50 cents on the dollar. This is a win-win \nwin because investors affected by the Federal financial circumstances \nfind an improved situation when fewer homes go into foreclosure. It is \na win for the community because we don't have an empty house on the \nblock driving prices down further. We have an opportunity that is right \nfor the community and for the mortgage owner and for the homeowner and \nfor the economy. That opportunity is before us today in this amendment.\n  Certainly, even with adoption of this amendment, some families will \nneed to enter bankruptcy, which is not an outcome we desire for any \nfamily but one that some may have to consider. Remember that this \nbankruptcy power is not extraordinary. A Federal bankruptcy judge \nalready has the power to modify debt on a vacation home, an investment \nproperty, a credit card, a car loan, even a yacht. Why can't the court \nmake any modification to a family's primary assets, the important piece \nof the American dream known as home ownership? I can think of no good \nreason.\n  Some have argued that allowing judicial modification to mortgages on \na primary residence could increase interest rates on future home loans, \nperhaps by as much as 2 percent. But does this stand up to examination? \nAfter the current bankruptcy court system was set up in the 1970s, some \ncourts interpreted the Bankruptcy Code to give them authority over \nmortgages on primary residences. This divergence of practice went on \nuntil the early 1990s.\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\nThus, we have a living test case. Studies have been done examining the \ninterest rates in both types of districts--those that allowed \nbankruptcy modification and those that did not--and found no difference \nin the interest rates. Even if they had, the amendment before us today \nwould not present this problem because, in the course of conversation, \nin the course of working out an agreement, only loans originated before \nJanuary 1, 2009, are eligible for bankruptcy modification, only \nexisting loans, not loans going forward. This primary concern that has \nbeen raised has no merit.\n  Let me emphasize, again, that reductions in principal negotiated in \nbankruptcy court will be good for the banking system. Credit Suisse \nestimates that 9 million families may lose their homes in the next 4 \nyears. Foreclosure is a disaster for the family. Large numbers of \nforeclosures destroy home values across neighborhoods. But from the \nlender's standpoint, foreclosure means they are likely to net only 50 \nor so cents on the dollar. In the case of any homeowner with a reliable \nincome--and chapter 13 bankruptcy is only for people with a continuing \nsource of income--it is much better for the lender if the homeowner \nremains in their home and makes a monthly payment, even if it is at a \nsomewhat reduced rate, rather than turning the keys and putting the \nproperty into foreclosure.\n  A couple of additional points: This proposal will not cost the \ntaxpayer one dollar, nor will it overwhelm the Federal bankruptcy \ncourts. The same claims were made in 2005 prior to passage of the \nBankruptcy Reform Act. But in fact, the courts have handled the \nincrease in caseload quite successfully. My office has talked with \nbankruptcy judges, attorneys, academics across the country. All are \nconfident that the court system can handle any increase in caseload \nthat would result from this legislation.\n  This legislation is important to Oregon. It is important to the \ncitizens in my State. According to data compiled by Moody's Economy and \nthe Center for Responsible Lending, without this bankruptcy lifeline, \nover 15,000 families will lose their homes to foreclosure. I imagine \nthe situation is quite similar in every State. The cost of these \nforeclosures has been magnified several times over, costing those \ncitizens whose homes neighbor the foreclosed sites nearly $1.5 billion \nin equity. That is in Oregon alone. Will those neighbors then be \nunderwater with their homes worth less than what they owe on their \nhouse, and how long will this cycle continue?\n  The bankruptcy lifeline amendment offers us a win-win solution. \nForcing real mortgage modifications will keep Americans in their home, \narrest the decline in property prices, and stabilize the balance sheets \nof banks.\n  I urge colleagues, in the strongest possible terms, to provide this \nwin-win opportunity. We have done so much to help Wall Street. It is \ntime to help working families across America, keeping them in their \nhomes and stabilizing the financial system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Oregon on \nsome excellent remarks. I thank him for being so steadfast in working \ntoward this issue. He has spoken up many times at meetings and caucuses \nabout it.\n  I rise in support of this amendment that would alter the Bankruptcy \nCode to allow bankruptcy judges to modify primary home mortgages. By \nnow we are all familiar with the problems. Too many people borrowed too \nmuch money from too many banks that were too willing to lend. There is \nplenty of blame to go around. Now millions of American families are \nfacing foreclosure over the next few years as a result of exotic \nmortgage products such as 2-28s, pay-option ARMs, and interest-only \nloans that disguise the full cost of home ownership. We have been \npushing banks to do loan modifications for more than 2 years now and, \nfrankly, we don't have much to show for it.\n  While I am optimistic the administration's plan will produce a \nsignificant improvement in modification efforts, it is also certain \nthere will be intransigent servicers and investors who will try to \nblock the process, to squeeze every last cent out of a home, even if \nthat means it is costly for their family, their community, and the \ncountry at large.\n  We have offered lenders and servicers plenty of carrots, but it is \nunfortunately clear we also need a stick. The reason the programs in \nthe past have largely not worked is it was just carrots and no stick. \nWe need both. That is what the legislation gives us, leverage to push \nservicers, lenders, and investors to act in the best interests of the \neconomy as a whole.\n  This amendment to the bankruptcy law is so important because of the \nchanges the mortgage industry has undergone in the past few decades. It \nused to be that when one wanted a mortgage, they would go to their \nlocal bank where they would lend the money and collect payments for 30 \nyears. That meant if one ran into trouble, they had a familiar friendly \nface to turn to, someone who knew them and their family and who had an \ninterest in helping work out the mortgage payments so they could stay \nin the home. It also meant the bank had an interest; one entity had an \ninterest in the whole mortgage. It wasn't chopped up in so many pieces. \nThat is what has happened.\n  Over the past two decades, with the growth of securitization, it has \nall changed because the mortgage has been divided into pieces, sold off \nto investors around the world. They are often difficult to identify and \nimpossible to contact. Their primary concern is squeezing every last \ncent out of the mortgage loan, whatever the impact on families, on \nhomeowners. That means if the best outcome for even one of those \ninvestors is foreclosure, a homeowner is not likely to get the help he \nor she needs to stay in their home.\n  One other point that is vital: It may be that there are 40 investors \nwho each have a piece of the mortgage. It may be that 39 of them have \nan interest in a loan modification. But if that one intransigent \ninvestor, who probably got the highest rate of interest because he or \nshe took the most risk, says no, the whole process comes to a halt--not \nonly bad for the poor homeowner but bad for the other 39 investors. It \nis bad, most of all, for the economy as a whole. It is not that one \nintransigent investor might say: Look, I will lose all my money if \nthere is a loan modification. If I sit and wait for 5 years, then maybe \nhousing prices will come up to where they should be and I will get my \nmoney back. In the meanwhile, the economy goes down the drain for \neveryone, because the more foreclosures there are, the lower housing \nprices get. The lower housing prices get, the less likely banks are to \nlend. The less likely banks are to lend, the less money is in the \neconomy. The recession gets worse and worse and worse.\n  It is not only a problem for the homeowner when there is an \nintransigent bondholder who will not yield; it is a problem for the \nother investors who will lose money in foreclosure.\n  It is a problem for the neighbors of the homeowner whose property \nvalues are going to decline and for the country as a whole since our \nhousing markets are already inundated by a glut of unsold homes, \ndriving down home prices and destabilizing the financial sector.\n  How do you get that intransigent bondholder to the table? Well, there \nis a contract. We cannot break a contract by law. But the one place in \nthe U.S. Constitution where a contract can be modified is bankruptcy \ncourt. Bankruptcy courts are the only constitutional way to overcome \nthe securitization contracts and restore some power to the homeowner \nhimself or herself.\n  Moody's Economy.com estimates without this amendment 1.7 million loan \nmodifications that would have happened will not occur. These figures \nshow that 1.25 million homeowners whose servicers are unwilling or \nunable to help them will not have the protection of the bankruptcy \ncourts, and almost half a million homeowners who would have gotten \nmodification offers will not because servicers or investors will \ncalculate that a foreclosure is worth more to them than a modification.\n  The proposal is the result of weeks and weeks of talks that never \nyielded compromise that we hoped for. I see my colleague from the State \nof Illinois, Senator Durbin, in the Chamber, who worked so long and so \nhard on this\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\nissue and deserves all of our thanks. He was in the middle of trying to \nget this done. Senator Dodd and myself tried to help but to no avail. \nIt is clear that parts of the mortgage industry were never interested \nin meeting us halfway. As the negotiations went forward, they moved the \ngoalposts back and back and back. And when concessions were made that \nwere well beyond what anyone thought, they walked away because they \nnever wanted to deal.\n  Hindsight is wonderful. It is unclear if those who entered the \ndiscussion--at least some of them--ever entered in good faith. But the \nindustry stakeholders, who obviously have the most to lose, ought not \nhold total sway. Just because they walked away from the table does not \nmean we cannot vote our conscience on a proposal that would help \npreserve the American dream for millions of families and get our \neconomy going again.\n  What makes me so eager for this proposal to pass, and why I worked \nlong and hard, is that as much as I want to help individual \nhomeowners--and, believe me, I do--our economy is at risk. Millions who \nmight rent or have paid their mortgage could lose their jobs, and it \nall comes down to this proposal. Because if we decrease foreclosures, \nwe will find a floor to the home market, which will then allow banks to \nlend, which will then get our economy going. It is like the knee bone; \nto the thigh bone; to the hip bone. Foreclosures are connected to the \nhousing market; the housing market is connected to the health of banks; \nthe health of banks is connected to the economy.\n  So when President Obama announced his foreclosure prevention plan, it \nincluded lots of lucrative incentives to lure banks to participate, but \nit called for some tough medicine: this bankruptcy proposal. And both \nare needed. We need carrots and sticks. The President's housing plan \nwill not be as effective if parts of it are sacrificed for political \nexpediency. Loan servicers should not get to accept the parts of the \nPresident's plan they like and reject others. That was never the deal.\n  To reject this proposal is to provide only sweeteners and no stick to \nget banks, servicers, and investors to modify troubled loans. The \nbottom line is fewer homes will be saved for American families. The \ndefeat of this amendment would be a sad day for homeowners, for the \nhousing market, for financial institutions, and for the overall \neconomy. Allowing that to happen is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. We have an opportunity \nto make a major dent in the housing crisis and prevent further declines \nin home prices.\n  Let's understand, once again, the housing crisis remains at the core \nof our economic problems. As long as home prices continue to decline--\nand without this legislation they are far more likely to--our economy \nremains at grave risk of further contraction. We cannot let this \nopportunity slip by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise today because I \nbelieve the Durbin amendment we are considering today is more than a \ntool for solving America's current economic problems, it is the right \nthing to do for millions of American homeowners.\n  Like many of you, I had the opportunity recently to spend 2 weeks \nwith my constituents talking with people at townhalls and community \nget-togethers around New Mexico. I heard one message over and over. My \nconstituents feel that too often America has one set of rules for the \nrich and powerful and a different set for working families.\n  Wall Street can fail and still make millions. On Main Street, even \npeople who work hard get dragged down. Irresponsible lenders thrive \nwhile credulous borrowers lose their homes. Everywhere you look, you \nsee middle-class Americans paying for other people's mistakes. It does \nnot seem fair.\n  Of course, the law rarely contains an explicit double standard. But \ntoday we are dealing with a situation in which it does.\n  If a real estate speculator borrows millions to buy a city block and \nthen finds himself unable to pay, he can walk into court and ask the \njudge to reduce the principal on his loan.\n  If a working mother borrows $30,000 to buy that first home for her \nchildren, she is stuck with that loan. If she has lost her job, she is \nstuck with that loan. If the value of her house has plummeted, she is \nstuck with that loan. If she was the victim of predatory lending, she \nis stuck with that loan.\n  I have yet to hear a good reason why that working American should not \nhave the same rights as every real estate speculator and vacation \nhomeowner in this country. My constituents do not think that is fair. \nAnd you know they are right.\n  Sometimes you hear people defend unfair rules because they are good \nfor the overall economy. They say that efficiency should be prized over \nequity. But that argument does not work here. By limiting judges' \nability to reduce the principal on home loans, we are delaying the \nresolution of this country's mortgage crisis. Homeowners continue to \nstruggle with loans they cannot pay, and the toxic assets based on \nthose loans remain on the balance sheets of America's financial \ninstitutions.\n  Elizabeth Warren, the head of TARP'S Congressional Oversight Panel, \nhas made the point very clearly. She says:\n\n       The law recognizes everywhere the importance, in a \n     financial crisis, of recognizing losses, taking the hit and \n     moving on.\n\n  That is why she supports the mortgage modification provision we are \nconsidering today. When judges have the power to provide a fair \nresolution for banks and borrowers, we will be one step closer to \nrecognizing those losses in our housing sector, taking the hit, and \nmoving on. In other words, the Durbin amendment puts us one step closer \nto fixing the financial system. For this proposal's benefits will not \nbe felt primarily on Wall Street. Credit Suisse estimates that as many \nas one in six mortgages in America will be lost to foreclosure in the \nnext 4 years. Homeowners know what happens when a neighbor goes into \nforeclosure. The whole neighborhood takes a hit. Property values drop. \nLocal governments face another drain on their resources. In some cases, \nthe foreclosed property becomes a magnet for crime and an embarrassment \nto the community.\n\n  For most Americans, their home is their largest investment. The best \nway to protect this investment is to stop unnecessary foreclosures. In \nmy home State of New Mexico, the Durbin amendment would protect an \nestimated 6,665 homes and almost $376 million in equity. Without \nspending a dime in Federal money, this Congress can make a significant \ncontribution to stabilizing my State's housing market and keeping \nthousands of families in their homes. This is not a tough choice.\n  Opponents of this provision make two related arguments. First, they \nclaim a mortgage modification provision will raise the cost of home \nloans. Congress has heard testimony about this issue, and the evidence \nsuggests otherwise. I will not go too deeply into this right now, but I \nencourage you to look at the testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee of Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center. \nProfessor Levitin is one of a chorus of academics who has poked holes \nin the arguments against mortgage modification.\n  Opponents of mortgage modification also argue that loan restructuring \nshould be handled by bankers and borrowers--not judges. I could not \nagree more. Unfortunately, banks have so far been very reluctant to \nvoluntarily restructure home loans despite a host of Federal \nincentives. A considerable body of evidence suggests that banks would \nactually do better if they were more willing to restructure loans. \nForeclosure is bad for everybody, and bankruptcy is even worse.\n  Congress and the President have worked hard to encourage banks to \nmodify home loans. We have handed out carrots like a farmer's market, \nand yet we still have a foreclosure crisis. It is time to give the \nhomeowners a stick.\n  The Durbin amendment does not let every homeowner march into court \nand demand a principal reduction. Banks have the opportunity to work \nwith homeowners on a reasonable compromise. As long as banks are \nwilling to negotiate, they will not face a court-ordered principal \nreduction.\n  All this legislation says is that banks cannot ignore their \nborrowers. They cannot stand around while working families struggle \nwith unpayable loans. That sounds fair to me.\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\n  The debate on this issue can get extremely complicated. But the final \nanalysis is simple: The current system is unfair. It is bad for working \nfamilies, and it is devastating for the American economy. The Durbin \namendment is a step in the right direction. I hope you will join me in \nsupporting it today.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senators from Oregon and New \nMexico, as well as the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nConnecticut, for speaking on behalf of my amendment.\n  I would like to make a unanimous consent request that has been \ncleared by the other side: that of the 4 hours that have been set aside \nfor this debate, the last 30 minutes be preserved and equally divided \nbetween the two sides, with 15 minutes to a side; under the custom of \nthe Senate, if we go into quorum calls, time is taken equally from both \nsides. We have actively spoken on this amendment on our side, and no \none has appeared yet, though I think they will soon, on the other side.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the usual tradition \nof quorum calls taking the remaining time, dividing it by half, that \nthe last 30 minutes be insulated and protected from that, and it be \nallocated 15 minutes to a side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me, first of all, thank our colleague \nfrom Illinois for his tireless work on behalf of this idea. I joined \nhim, along with Senator Schumer, early on in recommending a proposal \nlike this.\n  History is always a good source to go to. Back in the spring of \n1933--which is about as close an example we could probably find over \nthe last 100 years that compares to the days we are in today. Of \ncourse, that was the height--or the beginning--of the Great Depression. \nIn 1929, certainly, it all began.\n  After the election of 1932--during that now often repeated ``first \n100 days'' of each administration--and that was the first 100 days ever \ntalked about. It was the Roosevelt administration. The inauguration was \nin March of 1933. Inaugurations occurred in March in those days, not in \nJanuary. So that 100 days ran from March until June. One of the first \nthings the new administration did in the face of significant \nforeclosures across the country--and there were significant ones. They \nwere major. Those days were, in many ways, far more difficult than the \nones we are in.\n  These are bad days, obviously, with 10,000 homes a day going into \nforeclosure, with 20,000 people a day on average losing their jobs. \nRetirement accounts are evaporating. We have all heard about, read \nabout, and know people that has occurred to.\n  But one of the things the new administration did in those days was to \ngo out and actually purchase the home mortgages. The Federal Government \nactually did that. In order to stem the tide of foreclosures, the U.S. \nGovernment decided in those days that it would take over that \nresponsibility. They did other things as well: put capital into banks \nto stop the runs that were occurring across the country--major steps. \nBut in home foreclosures, they took the unprecedented step of trying to \nstem that tide, knowing how much damage foreclosures could cause, not \nonly to families and neighborhoods and communities but also to the \nfinancial system.\n\n  Senator Durbin is not advocating anything quite as revolutionary as \nthe Government acquiring the mortgages of every home. While some have \nmade that suggestion, he is not doing so. What he is suggesting is \nmodifying the bankruptcy laws of our country for a limited amount of \ntime, in a very narrow set of circumstances, to say: Where your primary \nresidence is concerned--and for those who have not followed the debate, \nlet me explain.\n  There is no restriction in a bankruptcy court for a bankruptcy judge \nto modify--or at least to negotiate--the modification of your mortgage \nif you have a vacation home or if you have a pleasure boat and have a \nmortgage on that. The bankruptcy judge can modify the mortgage on that \nbeach house, that mountain cabin, that yacht you may have. That is \nperfectly legitimate under bankruptcy laws. What you are not allowed to \ndo, if you are a bankruptcy judge, is to modify the mortgage on a \nprincipal residence.\n  I don't know if statistically what I am about to say is accurate. I \nsuspect that most Americans who have a principal residence don't have \nvacation homes. I know some do, and that is perfectly legitimate. I am \nnot arguing that you shouldn't have one. But explain to me, if someone \nwill, the distinction on why a vacation home, a yacht, a mountain \ncabin--as nice as it is to have one--ought to be able to be subjected \nto a workout with the mortgage involved, and yet, for the person who \nonly owns one home, as most do--you own one house--a bankruptcy judge \nis prohibited from engaging in a workout between the lender and the \nborrower on that principal place of residence. For the life of me, over \nthe last number of months we have been involved in this debate and \ndiscussion, I have failed to hear an adequate explanation of why there \nis a distinction on a principal place of residence where a mortgage is \ninvolved and there is no hesitation, no restriction whatsoever, on \nwhatever other number of homes you may have. Some have a lot more than \ntwo; some have three, four, and five. All of those can be subject to a \nworkout, but not a principal place of residence. That is all we are \ntrying to do here. Not forever, not looking back, not looking forward \nforever--Senator Durbin's amendment says for a limited amount of time, \nunder limited circumstances--under the total control of the lender, by \nthe way, because if you turn down a workout as a borrower, then \nbasically you lose the option of working it out.\n  It is so narrowly drawn under these circumstances that, for the life \nof me, I don't understand the objection. It is one of those moments \nwhere I try--when preparing for debate, we all ask: What is the other \nside going to argue? So I thought last night, I have to get ready for \nthe other side. I tried thinking through what is the argument I would \nmake if I believed this would somehow cause great harm to the economy, \nwas going to flood our courts or was going to require hundreds more \nbankruptcy judges to deal with it. What is the argument I would make to \nmy constituents and to the American people that we ought not allow a \nbankruptcy judge to sit down between the borrower and the lender and \nwork out a financial arrangement that allows the borrower to stay in \ntheir home, the lender to be paid--at least getting something back--\nturning that property into a foreclosed, vacant property, contaminating \nthe value of every other home in that neighborhood. What is the logic? \nFor the life of me, I can't come up with that, and I have tried.\n  So I would urge my colleagues, as you are thinking about this and \nlistening to these debates, why can't we do what the Senator from \nIllinois has suggested: For a limited amount of time, try this. It is \nnot forever. It just might do what the authors have suggested, and I am \nproud to be one of them. It might just do what we failed to be able to \nachieve despite the efforts of all of my colleagues here.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, we have come up with all sorts \nof very complicated proposals to try to assist homeowners, and I regret \nto report that while I think these ideas have great merit and we have \nall tried hard, they have not been terribly successful, despite the \ngood intentions of everyone to work it out. This is the one idea we \nhave not yet tried to make a difference in the foreclosure crisis.\n  Before the Sun sets tonight, 10,000 families are going to potentially \nlose their homes, and that will be true tomorrow and the next day and \nthe day after that. Just think about that. As we all go home tonight to \nour respective dwelling places here, 10,000 of our fellow citizens in \nthis country will end up losing their homes. They have to come back and \nface their families. Imagine, if you will, if you were in that \nposition, walking into that house tonight and facing your children and \nfacing your family and saying: We can't make this happen financially. \nWe are being pushed out of this house.\n  This body cannot, for a limited amount of time, under limited \ncircumstances, try something that might make a difference in that \nfamily's condition? I hope, in these very difficult\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\ndays--if almost 100 years ago, 90 years ago, another body sitting here \nin the wake of economic circumstances that were as trying as they were \ncould do something as unprecedented as the Government actually \npurchasing the mortgages, can we not now ask the Federal bankruptcy \ncourts to sit down and try, for a limited amount of time, to make it \npossible for that family to stay in their home?\n  It may not work in every case. The Senator from Illinois has pointed \nout that of the potentially 8 million foreclosures, his bill may only \naffect 1.7 million of the 8 million, and for a lot of people, this \nwon't even work, regretfully. But for 1.7 million, it might just make a \ndifference to those families. The value of that--how do I put an \neconomic value on that? What does it say to a family who can stay in a \nhome they have bought, they watched the value decline--the mortgage \nprobably exceeds the value of the home in many cases--but that sense of \noptimism and confidence, that family staying together during very \ndifficult times?\n  If you are the next-door neighbor, you live down the block, what \nhappens to the value of your home? We know what happens. In fact, that \nvery day, the value of that home that is not in foreclosure and there \nis no threat of it, but your neighbor's home now declines by as much as \n$5,000, then, of course, that property and those other properties could \nfall into a similar situation. All of a sudden, what was otherwise a \nhealthy neighborhood--people meeting their obligations, equity in their \nhomes--all of a sudden, you watch a neighborhood begin to decline. Just \nimagine, if you would, you are in the market to buy a home and you are \nriding down that street and you see a couple of places you might be \ninterested in buying but you see foreclosure notices up on two or \nthree. How willing are you going to be to buy a home in a neighborhood \nwhere there are foreclosures? So there is a contagion effect, a ripple \neffect, beyond just the plight of that family, which ought to be enough \nmotivation to try to make a difference, but if you are not impressed by \nthat, think about that neighborhood and community.\n  In the city of Bridgeport, CT, in my State, there are over 5,000 \nhomes in that city that are subprime mortgages in danger of going to \nforeclosure--5,000 homes in 1 city. I don't need to tell anyone in this \nbody what that will mean to that community. The tax base gets lost, but \nfar beyond the financial implications is what it does to the heart of a \ncommunity, what it does to the heart of a neighborhood, what it does to \nthe heart of a family.\n  So all we are asking for with the Durbin amendment is let's try this \nfor a limited amount of time to see whether it will make a difference. \nMaybe it won't achieve the results we authors claim it will, but is it \nnot worth a try to see if we can't bring that lender and that borrower \ntogether, to work something out so they can stay in that home? The \nlender gets paid. It seems to me that has to help.\n\n  I agree completely with my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, \nwho made the case, and did so simply. There is a direct connection \nhere. If we are unable to get our housing situation stabilized, all of \nthese other efforts we are making to get the financial system working \nare not going to succeed. At the root cause of this issue is the \nresidential mortgage market. The failure of us to reach that bottom--to \nbegin to see these values improve and people out purchasing homes will \nalso be not only indicative of the direction we are heading in but also \nessential if we are going to recover.\n  Beyond the issue of housing and what happens to families, the very \nheart of the economic crisis, its roots, began in the housing market. I \nbelieve very strongly, as others do who are far more knowledgeable \nabout macroeconomics than I will ever be, that our inability or \nunwillingness or failure to address the residential mortgage market \nwill make it almost impossible for us to get the kind of recovery we \nare all seeking on the larger economic issues.\n  So I wish to commend my colleague from Illinois. He has worked \ntirelessly. He has brought together the financial institutions. I know \nmany of them mean the very best. There is no ill will involved in this, \nI presume. I think there is a culture that goes back a long time which \nsays that if a house is in foreclosure or about to go into it, get the \nfamily out, put it on the market, sell it to someone else, because the \nlikelihood of that family redefaulting is pretty high. That may be true \nstatistically, but it seems to me that in these circumstances, we are \ndealing with something very different, far more pernicious, far more \nwidespread, with far greater implications. So even the best argument \none might make that historically you do better in getting an economy \nback on its feet by allowing these properties to go into foreclosure, I \nthink all of us recognize, with the numbers we are talking about here, \nthat accepting that kind of conclusion could be disastrous, as it has \nproven to be.\n  I recall January and February of 2007. I became chairman of the \nBanking Committee for the first time in January of 2007. We had a \ncouple of hearings on currency manipulation, I believe it was, in those \ndays in January, but the first hearings I held in February of 2007 were \non this issue. In the 110th Congress, I think we had 80, 82 hearings, \nand a third and a half were on this subject matter as we tried over and \nover again to get the industry to step up, to come up with various \nideas that would mitigate the foreclosure problem.\n  I recall at the very first hearing we had a witness who was very \nknowledgeable about housing issues, and he testified that he thought \nthere might be somewhere between 1.5 million and 2 million \nforeclosures. He was sort of ridiculed because these numbers were \nhyperbolic; this was an exaggeration of what would happen. In fact, the \ncritics were correct. It was. He was wrong. It wasn't 1.5 million or 2 \nmillion; it has now become 8 million. So those dire predictions in \nFebruary 2007 have proven to be painfully off the mark because, in \nfact, the problem is a lot worse.\n  I believe very strongly that had we in 2007 been able to convince the \nprevious administration to step up and engage this issue in 2007, and \neven a good part of 2008, we could have avoided what we went through \nlast fall and are going through today as we try to get this economy \nback on its feet again. But there was tremendous resistance to doing \nanything despite countless meetings we had, including with the \nfinancial institutions, where commitments were made in March and April \nof 2007 to actually sit down and engage in a workout with borrowers and \nlenders. None of that ever really happened at all. The numbers are \nembarrassingly small where workouts occurred, despite the efforts to \nachieve this without going through a legislative proposal.\n  Of course, the idea of modifying the bankruptcy laws was one that \nSenator Durbin raised early on. We were unable to get it done. Today, \nwe are trying one more time, in a far more constricted and narrow \nconstruct of this proposal, over a limited period of time, to affect as \nmany people as possible.\n  This amendment would also preserve some $800 billion in home equity \nfor neighbors, we are projecting. The list I have of just the \nproperties that could be affected--in my own State, some 15,000 homes \ncould be saved by the Durbin amendment. Looking down the list, the \nnumbers are stunning. In California, I think the numbers I saw are \n385,000 homes could be saved by the Durbin amendment. I see my friend \nfrom New Mexico is here, and there we are talking about over 6,000 \nhomes would be affected in New Mexico. In the State of Oregon, it is \nlike Connecticut.

I thank the Chair.\n  Again, I can't speak with absolute certainty. Maybe the numbers are a \nbit lower or higher. What if in my State it wasn't 15,000; what if it \nwas 10,000? Frankly, 10,000 homes would be a lot, a lot of families in \na lot of neighborhoods in an economy that would be vastly improved if \n10,000 homes in my State could be saved from the terrible conclusion of \nforeclosure.\n  So we will consider this amendment in a couple of hours. We will vote \nup or down on it. Then we will go about our business on the housing \nbill that is before us. But as Senators think about how they are going \nto vote on this matter in a couple of hours, think about what it would \nmean tonight at 6 or 7 o'clock when another 10,000 of our fellow \ncitizens find themselves in the serious condition of losing their \nhomes.\n  What do you say to your children, your family, what it does to your \nneighborhood. Can we not take a chance and try an idea that colleagues \nhave worked on for weeks now, not overnight--this is not a quickly \ndrawn amendment; it does not consider the concerns of the lenders in \nthe country--to bring this together and give this an effort, as we did \nlast summer with the HOPE for Homeowners and last spring as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this an opportunity to work. In my \noffice, we get about 30 or 40 letters every day from constituents \nwaiting to know whether they can keep their homes. I suspect I am not \nterribly different in that regard from my colleagues--or the e-mails \nthat arrive in our office in Hartford on a daily basis. In many cases, \nthe answer is--and we hear this over and over. Ed Mann has been with me \n30 years. Ed Mann does not engage in hyperbole. He is a quiet, serious \nman. What he hears day after day in our office is: I have tried to \nreach my lender. I have called and called and I can't get hold of \nanyone. Can I get any help? That is repeated over and over.\n  I say this respectfully, but I believe in this proposal, which I \nthink will cause lenders and borrowers to get together to try and work \nthese matters out, the lender controls everything under the Durbin \namendment. They have total control of the process. It is not in the \nhands of the borrower; it is in the hands of the lender and, obviously, \nthe proposal of a bankruptcy judge being able to engage.\n  I met with my Federal judges--district court judges, appeals and \nbankruptcy court judges. To a person, every one of them said: You ought \nto pass this.\n  These are people who work on this every day. These are serious \nappointees in the Bush administration, as well as the Clinton \nadministration. Some go back further, in fact, to the Reagan \nadministration. To a person, all of them said: Get this done. This \nmakes sense. These are bankruptcy judges. They are not frightened of \nthe caseload. They are not afraid of trying to bring people together to \nsave home ownership. Our bankruptcy judges believe this is right.\n  The civil rights groups of this country believe this is right. A long \nlist of people worked on this. But our principal debt of gratitude goes \nto the Senator from Illinois who has been tirelessly championing this \nconcept and idea. Senator Schumer has worked very hard as well on this \nissue.\n  My hope is, in the next couple of hours, we might surprise the \ncountry and actually do something to keep people in their homes. What a \ngreat message tonight that would be, instead of walking through the \ndoor saying: I think we lost our home, saying: There is a chance we can \nkeep our home, keep our family together, weather this storm, and come \nout of it stronger and better because the Government is not going to \njust sit back and allow nature to take its course and subject me and my \nfamily and my neighborhood to the vagaries of the foreclosure process. \nPeople are on my side fighting for me. We can do that today in a \nunited, bipartisan fashion by allowing this simple idea to have a \nchance to succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Durbin's amendment would allow \nbankruptcy judges to modify home mortgages in bankruptcy court by \nlowering the principal and interest rate on the loan or extending the \nterm of the loan. The concept in the trade is known as cram-down. It \nwould apply, in his amendment, to all borrowers who are 60 days or more \ndelinquent on payments for loans that originated before January 1, \n2009, and would set the maximum value of loans that qualify at \n$729,000. It is broader than the bill that was tabled in the Senate \nseveral months ago.\n  Senator Durbin sincerely believes his amendment would help save \nhomeowners who are at risk of losing their homes in foreclosure, and I \nrespect that. But many experts believe the cram-down provision would \nhave pernicious, unintended consequences on the mortgage market.\n  First, it would result in higher interest rates for all home \nmortgages, exactly what we do not want while we are trying to entice \npeople back into the market. Interest rates on home loans are \nsubstantially lower now than other types of consumer loans because of \nthe guarantees current law provides to lenders. If all else fails, the \nlender always has the right to take back the house for which it lent \nthe money. If we eliminate this security for lenders and increase the \nrisk inherent in making a home loan, then lenders will have to charge \nhigher rates on interest for home loans to cover the risk. The net \nresult of the amendment, in other words, will be higher interest rates \nfor home loans and fewer Americans who will be able to afford to buy a \nhouse--not what we need to end the housing crisis.\n  While attempting to solve a specific problem for a particular group \nof people, we could end up exacerbating this situation for all the \npeople who would want to refinance or to take out loans in the future.\n  As I said, experts agree and studies show cram-down will result in \nhigher interest rates. That is why it is opposed by virtually all in \nthe industry.\n  The Congressional Budget Office warned in January 2008 that cram-down \ncould result in ``higher mortgage interest rates'' because lenders are \nforced to compensate for potential losses that will be levied upon them \nin bankruptcy court.\n  In hearings some years ago before the Senate Finance Committee, in \n1999, Senator Grassley asked Lawrence Summers, who now serves as \nPresident Obama's head of the National Economic Council, if `` . . . \ndebt discharged in bankruptcy results in higher prices for goods and \nservices as businesses have to offset the losses?'' Mr. Summers \nresponded as follows:\n\n       The answer is--it's a complicated question, but certainly \n     there's a strong tendency in\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\n     that direction and also towards higher interest rates for \n     other borrowers who are going to pay back their debts.\n\n  In November 1986, Congress implemented a mortgage cram-down provision \nfor family farmers under chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Act--obviously, \nthe same well-intended purpose here. According to a 1997 study, farmers \nfaced a 25- to 100-basis point increase in the cost of farm real estate \nloans, as well as increased difficulty in obtaining financing as a \nresult of the cram-down application. The current median value of a new \nhome in the United States is $206,000. A 25- to 100-basis point \nincrease for the $206,000 would increase the cost of the mortgage by \nover $47,000.\n  We are talking about substantial impacts as a result of this well-\nmeaning provision that would, in fact, over the entire market be very \nbad.\n  Proponents of the bill argue it should be allowed because, after all, \nbankruptcy law already allows a version of this for vacation homes. Big \ndifference. What proponents do not mention is that to qualify for cram-\ndown on a vacation home mortgage, the debtor is required to pay off the \nentire amount of the secured claim within the 5-year length of the \nchapter 13 plan. The Durbin amendment, of course, does not include the \nrequirement that the debtor must pay off the security claim within 5 \nyears. He does not purport to treat cram-down on primary homes the same \nway the Bankruptcy Code treats them on secondary homes.\n  There is a third point with respect to this particular amendment. As \nI said, it is different from what we tabled before. It is a much \nbroader amendment. It is not the sort of narrow, targeted approach to \nthe problem some people like to characterize it as.\n  Unlike prior proposals, this bill is not limited to the high-risk or \nsubprime loans or other nontraditional loans but allows cram-down for \nall loans. Let me repeat that. Unlike what we dealt with before in \nprior proposals, this cram-down amendment is not limited to high-risk \nor subprime loans or other nontraditional loans. It would allow cram-\ndown for all loans. The only limitation, as I said, is that the loan \nhad to originate before January 1, 2009, and the maximum amount--not \nmuch of a limitation--is $729,000, and the borrowers would have had to \napply for relief under the Loan Modification Program. Other than that, \nthere is no limitation, and as I said, it would apply to any kind of \nmortgage. This would, obviously, allow millions of borrowers to enter \ninto bankruptcy and simply walk away from the debt owed on their homes.\n\n  I don't take this position lightly because my State is arguably the \nhardest, certainly one of the hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. \nPeople in my State face this every day. I wish to help Arizonans stay \nin their homes. Every time I go home, which is virtually every weekend, \nI talk with people who are, in one way or another, related to the \nproblem because so much of the business in Arizona has to do with home \nbuilding and development and construction. So many people have had \nproblems with their mortgages. As I said, many are being foreclosed. \nAll the others, the foreclosures, of course, represent a relatively \nsmall percentage of the total of 100 percent of loans. Most of the \npeople I talked with are upset because the value of their homes has \ndeclined so much, among other things, because of their homes being \nforeclosed upon. They wonder: When is the market going to hit bottom; \nwhen am I going to be able to sell my home for something similar to the \nequity I have in it.\n  Values from assessors have shown that values have decreased by some \n50 percent in amount. It is in our best interest to see this mortgage \nmarket bounce back, to see people be able to buy homes again and, \nfrankly, to sell homes at somewhere near a realistic price related to \ntheir real value. This is a good time to enter into the home market if \nyou have the money to do it because prices are so low and interests are \nso low. But the problem with this bill is it will make the interest \nrates higher and, therefore, will make it more difficult for people to \nafford to get into a home, the net result being the recovery will be \nextended far beyond what it otherwise would be under normal \ncircumstances.\n  In my home State of Arizona, people are wondering: Will it be 6 \nmonths, 1 year, 18 months? I guarantee whatever that amount is, it will \nbe longer if this bill passes. It will be longer because interest rates \nwill increase, people will not be able to sell their homes and, \ntherefore, we will continue to have the problem we currently have.\n  There are other programs available. I mentioned one. There is the \nHOPE NOW Program, the HOPE for Homeowners Program, and the President's \nnew $75 billion program that helps borrowers who are facing foreclosure \nto modify their loans and allow the so-called underwater borrowers to \nrefinance into lower rate mortgages. These are the people whose home \nvalue is less than the amount owed on their mortgage.\n  There are programs available. All of us are talking to banks about \nworking out loans with the people who face foreclosure. But a solution \nthat may be well meaning but would have the unintended consequences \nthis particular amendment has is not the answer. We should not simply \ngrab onto something because it promises to provide some relief to some \npeople, when the reality is that I think all the experts agree the \ninterest rates would be increased, making it much more difficult for \nthe 95 percent or so--I am not sure of the exact percentage--of the \nother people who would like to see this home mortgage crisis come to an \nend.\n  Bottom line: cram-down will not fix the recent downturn in the \nhousing market but only prolong the recovery by increasing interest \nrates. Instead of encouraging homeowners at risk of foreclosure to file \nfor bankruptcy, the Federal Government should continue to encourage \nlenders to work with owners to modify loans where it is economically \nviable for homeowners to remain in their homes. Obviously, not all \nhomeowners are going to be eligible for loan modification. But the \nanswer is not to incentivize bankruptcy by making it as the only means \nto save one's home.\n  I hope that when it comes time to vote against the Durbin amendment, \nwe will recognize we have already tabled an amendment which was much \nmore narrowly written and that this is an amendment which deserves to \nbe defeated.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we face a grave economic crisis, and \nit is our responsibility, our duty as representatives of the American \npeople, to give them every tool they need to weather this economic \nstorm.\n  There is much we have already done to help. Working with President \nObama, we cut taxes for middle-class families--because in times like \nthis, every little bit helps. We gave an extra $250 payment to seniors \non Social Security and disabled veterans to help them make ends meet \nwhen their household budgets are stretched to the breaking point. \nPreserving jobs means preserving our families' livelihoods, so we are \ninvesting billions of dollars in new infrastructure to create and \nsupport jobs all across America.\n  Today, Madam President, we want to take on one piece of America's \nunfinished economic business. Many families in this country--too many--\nhave found that making ends meet is impossible, and they are in the \nprocess of filing for bankruptcy. Four years ago, when Congress \noverhauled the Bankruptcy Code, our Republican colleagues suggested \nthat those who file for bankruptcy had carelessly lived beyond their \nmeans and were trying to game the system--at best, irresponsible; at \nworst, engaged in fraud. But in the years since, we have seen that was \nnot true.\n  Families don't enter bankruptcy casually to save a few dollars. \nBankruptcy is a last resort for individuals and families on the brink \nof financial collapse. The vast majority of those who seek bankruptcy \nare struggling, working families. With the economy in its weakest \ncondition in decades, bankruptcy filings are soaring. Tragically, the \nmost common reason for bankruptcy has been health care costs--\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\ncompounding the heartbreak of illness or injury with the strain of \nfinancial distress--but a lost job or ruined pension can be just as \ndevastating. And many families file for bankruptcy because the \nmortgages on their homes have gone through the roof and they simply \ncan't afford them any longer.\n  Too many homeowners were coaxed into bad mortgages--with the promise \nthat values would keep going up and up and up--in many cases, without \neven understanding the hazards built into the small print of the \nmortgages they assumed. Well, the bubble has burst, and now these \nhomeowners are stuck with mortgages that are larger than the home \nitself is worth.\n  Ordinarily in a bankruptcy, judges can modify the terms of debts or \nobligations, including loans on vacation homes and on family farms. \nThese modifications help prevent foreclosure and permit people to keep \nmaking payments on their reset loans. That is good because when a house \nis foreclosed, neighboring property values decline, tax collections \ndecrease, and schools and communities suffer. Helping prevent \nforeclosures, as this amendment would do, will help rescue falling home \nprices and get the housing market back on track--and that will help all \nhomeowners, not just those who are facing bankruptcy.\n  Under current law, Americans looking to bankruptcy to escape \nunbearable financial strains cannot modify the terms of the very \ncontract most dear to any family facing bankruptcy--their principal \nresidence, the place they call home, where they raise their children, \nwhere they know their neighbors, where they live their lives. They can \nface foreclosure, even homelessness. The neighborhood erodes, and a \ncascade of dire consequences ensues.\n  To remedy this, the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Senator \nDurbin of Illinois, has offered an amendment that would temporarily, \nand with conditions, give primary residence mortgages the same \ntreatment in bankruptcy as other types of secured debts. Like any \nsecured creditor, the mortgage holder would be entitled to adequate \nprotection of his or her property interest during the bankruptcy. The \nmodification of the mortgage would be limited to a market rate and a \nterm of no longer than 30 years.\n  Given the cost of foreclosures, which average $60,000 per incidence--\nsetting aside the harm to the family of losing their home, or the \nneighborhood of having another shuttered, plywood-covered building on \nthe block--it would seem that this amendment to the code would \nultimately benefit all of the parties to the mortgage. But on this \nquestion, the big banks seem to be inured to suffering and deaf to \ncommon sense.\n  Despite requirements protecting banks that families give their lender \n45 days' notice before filing for bankruptcy--that allow lenders to \nprevent forced modifications if they offer voluntary modifications as \npart of President Obama's Housing Affordability and Stability Plan; \nthat sunsets the program at the end of 2012--the big banks are still \nopposed. They gorge on taxpayer funds and support, but they will not \nhelp these customers.\n  I would note this is not a problem with the small banks, the \ncommunity banks that held their loans and work with their distressed \ncustomers in their community every day. This is a problem with the big \nbanks that sold families' mortgages off in strips to investors far \naway, leaving the homeowner no one to talk to, no one who can make a \ndecision about modifying the mortgage.\n  What is the homeowner supposed to do? Call an investor in \nSwitzerland, in Japan? Ring up the hedge fund in New York that owns a \nstrip of their mortgage and get them to all come together and agree on \na workout? It is impossible.\n  When we allowed mortgage securitization, we created this hole, and we \nare obliged to fill it. Only a judge can cut through the nightmare of \nbureaucracy that a homeowner faces trying to sort through this mess. \nSecuritized mortgages caused it, and there is only one practical way to \nclear it up, and that is the Durbin amendment.\n  I am very proud to have cosponsored this amendment, as well as the \nHelping Families Save their Homes in Bankruptcy Act, the bill on which \nthis amendment is based. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his \npassionate and tireless work on this legislation. I share his belief \nthat this is the most direct and effective way to mitigate the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  I also share Senator Durbin's frustration that although he and \nothers--Senator Schumer in particular--have worked tirelessly to \nnegotiate in the interest of all parties, this powerful banking lobby \nhas been greedy, stubborn, and unreasonable. It refuses to recognize \nthe human problem that poor homeowners have when they have to try to \nreassemble a mortgage that got sold in strips around the world and try \nto get those people together to reach an agreement. It is asking \nridiculous things of that family to expect them to handle that problem, \nand they have no other mechanism, except a court, which can settle it \nonce, and quickly, for all.\n  I have been here only a short time, Madam President, but this is one \nof the most extreme examples I have seen of a special interest wielding \nits power for the special interest of a few against the general benefit \nof millions of homeowners and thousands of communities now being \ndevastated by foreclosure.\n  Bear in mind that the big banks opposing this legislation can reset \ntheir own obligations in a receivership or bankruptcy, but what's fine \nfor them is obviously too good for their long-suffering customers, \nwho--uniquely--don't get the same rights for their home mortgage.\n  The scale of this is immense. Senator Durbin's commonsense measure \nwould help as many as 1.7 million American families stay in their homes \nand preserve $300 billion--nearly one-third of a trillion dollars--in \nhome equity for the neighboring homeowners whose home values get \nknocked down when a bank will not negotiate with an owner and comes in \nand forecloses, hammers up the plywood over the windows, lets the lawn \ngrow out, and often lets the property be looted. In my home State of \nRhode Island alone, 6,600 homes and over $1.4 billion in home equity \ncould be preserved.\n  Homeowners are up against an impossible situation. It was one that \nwas created by the big banks and the investment world when they \nsecuritized these mortgages and spread them to the four winds. This is \ntheir only hope to redeem it, their only hope to have somebody sensible \nto talk to, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise with some reluctance today to \noppose the amendment before us. The amendment is being offered to what \nI think is a very good bill. The provisions of the underlying bill are \nworthy of our full support. The notion that we are going to expand the \nability of FHA and Rural Housing to modify loans is something I \ncertainly support and I believe others should. The idea in the \nunderlying legislation is that we should expand access to the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program, we should provide a safe harbor for servicers who \notherwise would modify a loan. We have a situation, as the President \nmay know, where we tried to encourage the modification of loans to help \npeople who are in a bind to avoid foreclosure. We find out that among \nthe parties who have to agree to the loan modification are the \nservicers, the people to whom we send mortgage payments. They have not \nbeen anxious to participate in modifying the mortgages because, first, \nthey get no financial incentive upfront for doing the work and, second, \nif they do the work to modify the mortgage, they end up being sued by \nthe investors who own these mortgage-backed securities around the \nworld. That is not much incentive and, as a result, servicers have not \ndone the work they need to do to help modifications take place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time count against the \nRepublican time. I understand it has been cleared with our Republican \nfriends.\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. In any event, the underlying legislation addresses in a \nvery satisfactory way an approach so that servicers will be more likely \nto participate in mortgage modifications.\n  Finally, the underlying legislation creates more enforcement tools \nfor FHA to use to go after bad actors, bad lenders. That is all good \nstuff and we ought to support it, and I certainly do.\n  I am sorry to say I cannot support in its current form the so-called \nbankruptcy cram-down legislation offered by our friend from Illinois. A \nyear or so ago we visited this issue. We had a vote on the floor about \nwhether to bring a provision similar to this to the floor for debate. I \ndid not vote to bring it to the floor for debate at that time. I was \nnot sure if the issue was ripe and I didn't know that we were ready to \ndo it.\n  My view has changed. I think it is an appropriate time and place for \nus to negotiate--to debate the issue of cram-down. I think it is \nunfortunate that we cannot offer an amendment, a second-degree \namendment or perfecting amendments to the provision that has come to \nthe floor. I understand things have been worked out by others here, \nmaybe in our leadership, to bring the amendment to the floor without \nthe opportunity to perfect it further. I think that is unfortunate, but \nit is what it is.\n  About a month or two ago I hosted, back in Delaware, a forum that was \ndesigned to introduce to the people of my State the most recent \ninitiatives launched by the Obama administration to encourage the \nmodification of home mortgages, to help people who are in danger of \nbecoming in default and facing foreclosure of their homes. The \nadministration has given us a couple of very good proposals. I think \nour earlier HOPE for Homeowners proposal that we adopted when I served \non the Banking Committee last year was a very good proposal, but the \nproblem was we couldn't get the servicers to cooperate and be part of \nit. I think we figured that out in the underlying bill today.\n  When I hosted my forum back in Delaware earlier this year, some of \nthe participants were fearful of losing their homes, some were \napproaching foreclosure. They wanted to learn more about foreclosure. \nWe had housing counselors there. It was a helpful forum for a lot of \npeople.\n  One of the things I learned there was from one of the people who \nparticipated, a woman who is a bankruptcy lawyer. She came up to me and \nshe said: You know, we are having a hard time in some cases getting \nfinancial institutions, the lenders, to take seriously the opportunity \nto modify mortgages. She said: I think they would take that opportunity \nmore seriously if they knew at the end of the day, if they were not \nserious, they would face in a bankruptcy court the possibility that a \nbankruptcy judge will come in, lower interest rates, reduce principal \nand stretch out the time for repayment of these mortgages.\n  I thought she made a compelling case. I since then decided that maybe \nthis is an issue we ought to bring to the floor. It does have value. \nThis is the appropriate time. A lot of people are facing foreclosure, a \nlot of people are in foreclosures, and this could be a tool--not \nsomething that would be a first choice but maybe a last option. It \ncould be the last option after whoever is the homeowner facing \ndifficulty had gone through all the programs that are offered by the \nnew administration and would then take advantage of whatever programs \nare offered by lenders--Countrywide and others.\n  The legislation before us today is an improvement over some earlier \nversions. There are a couple of problems I have with it. I want to \nmention those, if I could. One of the problems occurs when you have a \nsituation where a person has asked a lender to modify a mortgage and \nthe lender has agreed to do that and then in the next year or two the \nhomeowner, who has actually gotten out of bankruptcy a better deal, \nturns around and sells their home at a profit. I believe the lender, \nhaving gone through the bankruptcy and the mark-down, if you will--that \nlender should be able to participate more fully than is envisioned in \nthis underlying bill.\n  The House takes it a little differently. This amendment says the \nlender would appreciate, I think, maybe to the tune of 50 percent, 50-\n50 with respect to an appreciation in value following the bankruptcy. \nIn the House they have a different approach. The first year the lender \nwould get 90 percent of any appreciation, the second year 70 percent, \nthird year 50 percent, and eventually phase out. I think that is a \nbetter approach.\n  I would like to have seen and encouraged that we consider more \ntightly constraining the period of years that would be covered; that \nis, from which mortgages would have been originated the number of years \nthat might fall into this approach.\n  In the legislation before us, you can go all of the way back in time, \nwhenever. There is no beginning date. The ending date is January of \nthis year. And I think, whether it would happen to be a subprime \nmortgage, an Alt-A, almost any kind of mortgage would still be able to \nparticipate in a bankruptcy. That is a bit broad. At the very least, I \nwould hope we would be able to come up with something that would say, \nwe would end the period of eligibility maybe from 2002, 2003, to the \nend of 2007. That seems reasonable to me. We do not have that kind of \nconstraint in this amendment.\n  If we could have fixed that provision, maybe moved the eligibility \nback from January 1 of this year to January 1 of a year ago, that would \nhave certainly helped make it easier for me to support the amendment. \nThe idea of giving the lender a better opportunity to participate in \nappreciation of the home that later on comes out of bankruptcy, a \nperson comes out of bankruptcy and sells their home for a profit, I \nthink the lender ought to be able to participate more fully than is \nenvisioned here in this amendment.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we do not have a chance to perfect it \nfurther. I do not know that we will see this issue again. My hope is \nwhat the administration--the programs the administration has launched \nwill have great effect, a lot of people will take advantage of them, \nthat the mortgage modifications of the individual companies, the \nindividual lenders will be more effective and be better utilized.\n  I hope the fixes we are providing for the HOPE for Homeowners \nProgram, addressing some of the problems I have mentioned, I hope that \nhelps too. If it does not, and we realize later on that there still \nneeds to be this threat of a bankruptcy cram down at the end of the \nday, then let's revisit this issue. But I hope those of us who have \nmaybe somewhat different views will have them be debated on the floor, \nand have an opportunity, if we are not fully comfortable with what \ncomes to the floor, have an opportunity to amend and hopefully perfect \nit and make it better.\n  I am going to have to reluctantly oppose the amendment. I appreciate \nour friends from the other side yielding time on this issue for me.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Education Policy\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about \neducation, a subject that is important to virtually all of us.\n  When figuring out what to do about education, my suggestion to those \nin my party is that Republicans should ask, ``What would Lincoln do?''\n  During the first 16 months of his Presidency, Abraham Lincoln helped \nenact three of the most important and successful pieces of legislation \nin American history: the Homestead Act, the Morrill Acts that created \nthe land-grant colleges and universities, and the Pacific Railroad Act.\n  What made these laws successful, according to Harvard Professor Bill \nStuntz, in an April 6 article in The Weekly Standard, was that they \n``did not depend on the complex judgments made by members of congress \nor government regulators. [They] were meant to confer opportunities, \nnot to solve problems . . . the necessary elbow grease was supplied by \nthe private citizens whose prospects Lincoln improved.''\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\n  These three laws helped American farmers create the world's most \nproductive farmland and American universities produce the most educated \nworkforce. The transcontinental railroad knitted together this \nsprawling Nation.\n  A later version of this same thinking produced the GI bill \nscholarships which followed veterans to the colleges of their choice at \nthe end of World War II. Then came Pell grants and student loans which \ntoday follow two out of three students to the colleges of their choice.\n  Similarly $31 billion of Federal research money is handed out each \nyear to universities. Almost all of it is peer reviewed and \ncompetitively granted, and not parceled out by legislators and \nregulators. All of this might be called the Lincoln approach to Federal \nGovernment involvement in education. Conferring opportunities.\n  Now, compare it to the command-and-control Rooseveltian model best \nexemplified by our kindergarten through the 12th grade system of \neducation. In that system, students do not choose--they are told--where \nto go to school. Government money goes directly to institutions, not to \nstudents. Government and unions write rules handcuffing teachers and \nprincipals and other student leaders. And virtually no teacher is paid \nmore for teaching well.\n  There is yet another approach. No Federal involvement at all. Some \nbelieve that. Leave education to the States or communities.\n  I suppose that over the last 30 years I have embraced all three of \nthese points of view. Some may call that unprincipled, but I prefer to \nalign myself with former Senator Everett Dirksen, who once said: ``I am \na principled man, and flexibility is one of my principles.''\n  During my second year as Governor in 1980, I asked President Reagan \nto support what I called a grand swap, give the States all of \nkindergarten through the 12th grade, and the Federal Government would \ntake all of Medicaid.\n  The President liked that. I liked it. But it did not go very far.\n  In 1984, I helped make Tennessee the first State to pay teachers more \nfor teaching well. I encouraged school choice and created centers and \nchairs of excellence at universities. Despite this aggressive State \naction, I concluded at the end of my 8 years as Governor that K-12 \neducation depended entirely upon parents, teachers, school leaders, and \ncommunity. So I traveled to all 132 school districts in Tennessee, \ncreating Better Schools Task Forces, and challenging them to create \nbetter schools.\n  As Education Secretary, I proposed America 2000, again emphasizing \ncommunity responsibility for education, higher standards for States, \nand support for what we called then ``break the mold'' charter schools, \nand more choices for parents of low-income children.\n  Later on, I said we can do without a Department of Education--the \nDepartment I used to head--meaning that I thought an agency handing out \nscholarships to K-12 students, as well as college students, plus some \neffective advocacy was all we needed at the Federal level.\n  As a Senator, I reluctantly embraced No Child Left Behind, because it \nforces reporting on children who are indeed left behind, but have \nintroduced legislation to empower States to try to do that reporting in \ntheir own way.\n  Putting it all together, I may not have been quite as inconsistent as \nI have accused myself of being.\n  No. 1, I believe the Federal Government should be involved in \neducation, but I am for the Lincoln empowering model as opposed to the \nRooseveltian command-and-control model.\n  No. 2, I believe that 95 percent of making K-12 education better \ndepends on parents and teachers and school leaders. And, finally, while \nI believe it is virtually impossible for regulators and politicians in \nWashington to make schools better, I believe it is sometimes possible \nfor Washington to help parents, teachers, school leaders, and \ncommunities make schools better.\n  So following that Lincolnian set of principles--conferring \nopportunities instead of making decisions--what exactly should the \nFederal Government do to empower parents and help them be better \nparents?\n  One, a Pell grant for kids. Give every middle- and low-income child \n$500 to spend after school at any State-approved education program. \nThis would help fund music and art lessons, English lessons, other \ncatchup and get-ahead lessons. It would pour billions into poorer \nschool districts, programs encouraging public schools in those \ndistricts to get busy and attract students by offering the afterschool \nprograms themselves.\n  A second thing would be a Federal tax system favoring parents with \nchildren. We had this during the 1950s in America. President George W. \nBush did more to support this idea than most realize.\n  Next, perinatal care. Make sure that pregnant mothers receive care \nand find a medical home, a team of medical professionals that is \nresponsible for coordinating all of the new baby's health care needs \nfrom before the pregnancy until 6 weeks after. That would be the real \nHead Start.\n  Nurses in homes. We could encourage nurses to visit homes to make \nsure every newly born child has a medical home. Remember, now, I am \ntaking about what could the Federal Government be doing to help parents \nbe better parents.\n\n  Home schooling. Our policy should be never to hinder home schooling, \nand to look for ways to help. Why should we punish parents who are \ndoing their job well?\n  Professor Coleman at the University of Chicago used to say: School is \nfor the purpose of helping parents do what the parents do not do as \nwell.\n  We could help adults learn English. There are lines of new Americans \noutside federally funded programs in Tennessee to help adults learn \nEnglish. Senator Kennedy has told me the same is true in Massachusetts. \nEncouraging our common language is a Federal role, and if parents speak \nEnglish better, the child is more likely to speak English better.\n  Finally in this list of ideas: worksite day care. With so many \nparents working outside the home, there is less time for the child. One \nsolution is worksite day care near the place where the parent works. \nTake the child to work. This is usually a private sector solution, but \nas assistance for low-income parents could make sense.\n  To help teachers and school leaders be better, what could the Federal \nGovernment do? One thing would be to help fund higher standards and \ndata collection. Those should be set by States or groups of States, not \nby those of us in Congress. But they should be set so teachers, \nparents, and students know what to expect.\n  Probably nothing is more important than paying good teachers more for \nteaching well. I especially admire the work the new Secretary of \nEducation has done in this area in Chicago. I know the new Senator from \nColorado and the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, in their hometowns \nhave done this.\n  Every child benefits from exceptional teaching. Now that we know how \nto relate student achievement to the skills of the teacher or the \ngroups of teachers, we should pay teachers for their superior skills. \nThat means expanding the Teacher's Incentive Fund, which already \nexists, to help local school districts reward outstanding teaching in \nmany different ways.\n  As the late Albert Shanker, president of the large American \nFederation for Teachers, used to say, ``If you can have master \nplumbers, why not master teachers?''\n  We should encourage charter schools. That helps teachers because it \nliberates the teachers and school leaders to use their own good \njudgment to help the children assigned to them. I am encouraged that \nthe new Secretary of Education has encouraged charter schools.\n  Teach for America helps to supply new raw talent to the classroom, \nand I think, even more important, forms an alumni corps of support for \nexcellence in the public schools, once those young teachers go on to \nwhatever else they plan to do.\n  Teachers' colleges. They need to be improved. One way to do it would \nbe to award peer-reviewed, competitive research grants on the agendas \nmost of them will not touch: how to give parents more choices, how to \nreward outstanding teaching, how to make charter schools successful, \nand how to help newly arrived children learn English.\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n  UTeach is another idea formed at the University of Texas-Austin. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act that we passed in a bipartisan way in 2007 carries \nthat nationally. It funds scholarships at universities where good \nstudents in math and science will switch to teaching.\n  Summer academies. Senators Reid and Kennedy, a whole group of us, \nhave helped to create summer academies for outstanding teachers of U.S. \nhistory, as well as the sciences. These are inexpensive and enriching \nand they do not intrude very much into State and local responsibility.\n  School leaders. The biggest bang for the buck that we can do from \nhere, or that States could do, or that school districts could do, is \ntraining school leaders. Generally, our role could be to expand the \nTeacher Incentive Fund and the New Leaders for New Schools Program.\n  Our higher education system is molded upon the Lincolnian principles. \nIt is also the best in the world. Our K-12 system is smothered by \ncommands and controls from Government and the unions. It is a source of \nconstant concern. Republicans should create proposals and policies that \nconfer opportunities for parents, teachers, students, school leaders, \nand researchers, and stay away from programs that create command-and-\ncontrol orders from politicians and regulators.\n  That is a lesson from our founder, Abraham Lincoln.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that the time not be charged to the Durbin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING THE FALL OF SOUTH VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I have a resolution I have left at the desk \nwhich would honor the Vietnamese refugees who came to this country \nafter the fall of South Vietnam. I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the importance of this day, April 30.\n  Today is a day that, for Vietnamese around the world, is as \nsignificant as the distinctions that are often made in other cultures \nbetween B.C. and A.D. Thirty-four years ago, on April 30, 1975, the \nCommunist forces from North Vietnam finished their conquest of the \nsouth, and the struggling, war-torn country of South Vietnam ceased to \nexist. Many who fought on the Communist side and others who supported \nthem believe that the motivation for pursuing this war was the \nunification of the country and independence from outside influence, and \nin many ways the position that they took, and the loss of 1.4 million \nCommunist soldiers on the battlefield in pursuit of that position, is \nunderstandable. But it is just as understandable to recognize and honor \nthe aspirations of the overwhelming majority of the people of South \nVietnam who fought long and hard at a cost of 245,000 battlefield \ndeaths for a government that, like our own here in the United States, \nallows true political and individual freedom.\n  Those aspirations fell to the wayside as North Vietnamese tanks \nentered Saigon in blatant violation of the 1973 Paris Peace accord and \ninstituted a harsh, Stalinist system of government that was marked at \nthe outset by cruel recriminations toward those who had resisted its \ntakeover. And thus, for millions of Vietnamese around the world, April \n30 is a reminder of the loss of everything, including their homes, \ntheir way of life, and their hopes for a prosperous and open future for \nthe country that they loved.\n  Americans in general tend to avoid or ignore this day and the \nsignificance it has not only on the Vietnamese but also on our own \nhistory. But it is important for us to look back on that day and on the \nwar itself, not in anger but in fairness, in a way that gives credit \nwhere credit is due. And it is also important, for all of the reasons \nthat led many of us to support that war endeavor, that we commit \nourselves to working together to build the right kind of dialogue with \nthe present Government of Vietnam in order to help bring a better \nfuture for the Vietnamese people and a more stable strategic \nenvironment in east Asia as a whole.\n  Frankly, I believe this war still divides Americans in a way that \nthey still feel but no longer openly discuss. I am not sure we can even \nagree on the facts, much less the rightness or wrongness of our \npolicies, that caused us to commit our military to that battlefield, \nwith the eventual loss of 58,000 dead and another 300,000 wounded. Was \nit right to go into Vietnam? Was it important? If you ask those in \nacademia, the predictable answer, growing ever more predictable as the \nyears cause us to summarize the war ever more briefly, is that it was a \nmistake. And yet here is a piece of data that should still cause all of \nus to think again. In August, 1972, 8 years after the Gulf of Tonkin \nincident that brought us full-bore into Vietnam, even at a time when \nthe Nation had grown weary of bad strategies, after tens of thousands \nof combat deaths, and years of massive antiwar protests, a Harris \nSurvey showed that 72 percent of Americans still believed that it was \nimportant that South Vietnam not fall into the hands of the Communists, \nwith only 11 percent disagreeing.\n  Over the years, we have lost the reality of those concerns. Too often \nin today's discussions that examine the Vietnam war, we are overwhelmed \nby mythology. I hear it said quite often that this was a war between \nthe United States and Vietnam. Nothing could be further from the truth, \nand nothing could be more offensive to the millions upon millions of \nVietnamese who supported the South Vietnamese Government and its long-\nterm goal of a stable democracy. Our attempt to help that government \nwas no different than the manner in which we assisted South Korea when \nit was attacked after being divided from North Korea, or the motivation \nthat caused us to support West Germany when the demarcation line at the \nend of World War II divided Germany between the Communist east and the \nfree society in the West. We were not successful in that endeavor in \nVietnam for a number of reasons. But it would be wrong to assume that \nthis was an action by our country against the country of Vietnam, or \nthat it was motivated by lesser ideals.\n\n  We hear a lot of dismissive talk about the domino theory and the \nsupposedly unjustified warnings about what was going on in the rest of \nthe region with respect to efforts that were backed by the Soviet Union \nand Communist China in the runup to our involvement. But these were \nvalid concerns at the time. The region had seen a great deal of turmoil \nduring and after World War II. Most of the European colonial powers had \nreceded throughout Southeast Asia, largely because of the enormous \ncosts of that war, leaving poverty, war damage and unstable governments \nbehind. Japan had withdrawn from the territories it had invaded and \noccupied. Governmental systems throughout the region were in \ntransition, many in chaos. The Communists had moved into power in \nChina. Within a year North Korea invaded South Korea, and were joined \non the battlefield by the Chinese. Indonesia endured an attempted coup, \nsponsored by the Chinese.\n  In fact, Lee Kuan Yew, the brilliant leader who created modern \nSingapore, has said many times that the American effort in Vietnam was \na key contribution in slowing down communism's advance throughout the \nregion, and allowing the other countries in the region to stabilize and \nprosper. The point, simply made, is that there was a great deal of \nstrategic justification for what we attempted to do.\n  This brings us to April 1975. A North Vietnamese offensive had begun \nin the aftermath of a vote in this Congress to cut off supplemental \nfunding to the Government of South Vietnam. This was combined with a \nmassive refurbishment of the North Vietnamese army, with the assistance \nof China and the Soviet Union, that allowed the offensive to kick off \nat a time when our South Vietnamese allies were attempting to \nreorganize their positions in order to adapt to the reality that they \nwere going to get markedly less funding in terms of vital supplies such \nas ammunition and parts for their American-made weapon systems, as well \nas medical supplies.\n  The events following the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, have never \nreally been given the proper attention, probably because proper \nattention would embarrass so many people who had\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\ndownplayed the dangers of a Communist takeover. A gruesome holocaust \ntook place in Cambodia, the likes of which had not been seen since \nWorld War II. Two million Vietnamese fled their country--usually by \nboat--with untold thousands losing their lives in the process, and with \nhundreds of thousands of others following in later years. This was the \nfirst such Diaspora in Vietnam's long and frequently tragic history. \nInside Vietnam a million of the South's best young leaders were sent to \nreeducation camps, where 240,000 stayed for longer than four years. \nMore than 50,000 perished while imprisoned, and others remained \ncaptives for as long as 18 years. An apartheid system was put into \nplace that punished those who had been loyal to the U.S., as well as \ntheir families, in matters of education, employment and housing. The \nSoviet Union made Vietnam a client state until its own demise, pumping \nbillions of dollars into the country and keeping extensive naval and \nair bases at Cam Ranh Bay.\n  As a consequence of that bitter day in April, 1975 there are now more \nthan 2 million Americans of Vietnamese descent. We are better off as a \nnation for their contributions to our society, at every level. It was \nnot always easy for these refugees when they arrived during the late \n1970s, to a country that had been so torn apart by the war itself. But \nthey won the rest of us over with their perseverance, their reverence \nfor education, and their dedication to their families. Our gain, at \nleast in the short term, was Vietnam's loss.\n  It is important that Americans understand this journey, because those \nwho lived it deserve a fair place at the table as we continue to work \ntoward better relations in the Vietnam of today. Not to undertake a new \nround of recriminations; not to relive the bitterness of the past; but \nto build a proper bridge between our country and Vietnam, for the good \nof both countries, for the health East Asia, and for the benefit of all \nthe people inside today's Vietnam.\n\n  With respect to the region, Vietnam remains one of the most important \ncountries in terms of the manner in which the United States should be \npreserving all of its legitimate interests on the East Asian mainland. \nWith the steady accretion of Chinese influence to the north, the \nexpansion of India to the southwest, and the evolution of Muslim \ninfluence in Southeast Asia in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia \nand the southern reaches of the Philippines, Vietnam, along with \nThailand and Singapore, are absolutely vital to our posture as an Asian \nnation.\n  With respect to the Hanoi Government, with which I have had a long \nand not always pleasant relationship since 1991 when I first returned \nto Vietnam, I have a great appreciation for the very significant \nstrides they have made since those early days. The relationships that \nare now evolving between Vietnam and the United States are healthy. In \nthe long term, I believe they are going to be successful. And even \nthough I remain proud of my Marine Corps service in that war so many \nyears ago, I welcome them. When I first returned to Vietnam in 1991 I \nwent to Easter Mass at the Hanoi cathedral. There were perhaps 20 \npeople in the church, all of them elderly. Last Christmas I attended \nChristmas Mass and there were at least 2,000 people in the church, \noverflowing into the courtyard. People can argue around the edges--we \ncan have our political debates--but this is progress. We need to reward \nthose strides with reciprocal behavior, even if we remain at odds on \nother issues. There is a lot to be proud of in terms of the \ntransformations that have been going on in Vietnam. Vietnam is growing. \nIt is growing economically. It is growing politically. It is reaching \nout to the rest of the world. It is acting responsibly in the \ninternational arena. We have much to do with that success, and we have \nmuch work to do. We have much work to do in terms of encouraging more \nopenness and greater political freedom. But we are on a pathway where, \nwith the right kind of continued dialogue, I believe all of that is \ngoing to occur.\n  And so I would like to reemphasize that the best legacy for those of \nus who care deeply about this issue, and who remember all the tragedies \nof the war, will be for us to see Vietnam, the Vietnam of today, as a \nstrategic and commercial partner and also as a vibrant, open society \nwhose government reflects the strength of the culture itself, a \nstrength that has been demonstrated over and over again by the \nVietnamese who have come to this country and who, I am proud to say, \nare now Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes on the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Durbin's \namendment. It will facilitate and promote negotiation and restructuring \nof mortgage debt on primary residences, which is a sensible and \npreferable alternative to foreclosure and all the negative consequences \nthat process involves. I cosponsored earlier versions of this measure \nintroduced in the last Congress by Senator Durbin as well as this one. \nI am proud to cosponsor the current amendment.\n  Including this provision in the housing bill is absolutely critical \nto helping an estimated 1.7 million homeowners facing foreclosure to \nobtain modifications of their loans so they can return to making \npayments and stay in their homes. This, in turn, would contribute \npowerfully to stabilizing the housing market and the entire financial \nsector, allowing our economy to recover.\n  For nearly 2 years now we have seen a devastating wave of home \nmortgage foreclosures all across America. Foreclosure exacts a painful \ntoll on borrowers who cannot keep up with their payments. Let's not \navoid the harsh realities: foreclosure means families--many oftentimes \nwith young children--are forced out of their homes. It is a wrenching \nand emotionally devastating process.\n  But we also need to appreciate that the broader economic consequences \nof all of these foreclosures are overwhelmingly negative. The lender \nstill loses money. The value of houses in the surrounding neighborhoods \ndeclines further. So-called toxic assets held by financial institutions \nand investors become even more toxic. The financial system and the \nbroader economy suffer further damage. This is totally \ncounterproductive, as we have seen vividly over the last year. It \nsimply makes no sense to continue down this failed path of massive home \nmortgage foreclosures.\n  The Durbin amendment offers a far more promising and productive \napproach. Keep in mind that ``foreclosure'' is a legal shorthand for a \nprocess that cuts off or extinguishes the ability of a borrower to pay \ndebt and remain in the home. It literally, as the word is used, \nforecloses any other options. The Durbin amendment, by contrast, \nencourages debtors and creditors to seek and negotiate sensible, \nworkable, and economically feasible options or alternatives. What \nSenator Durbin is proposing very faithfully applies the hard lessons \nlearned as borrowers, lenders, and our Nation worked their way out of \nthe agricultural credit crisis of the 1980s.\n  There are a lot of similarities between the farm crisis in the 1980s \nand the home mortgage and foreclosure crisis of today. In both \ninstances, the value of the underlying assets--farmland in one case, \nhouses in another--rose very steeply. In both cases, debts secured by \nthose underlying assets rose very rapidly also. In both situations \nincome available to pay off debt fell--in the farm crisis because of \nlower commodity prices, in the housing crisis because of unemployment \nand lower wages and salaries. In both instances the asset bubble burst. \nIt was not only a matter of being unable to make payments; the asset \nvalues could no longer support the loan. With many farms, as now with \nmany houses, the borrower owes much more than the real estate is \nmortgaged for.\n  So for a while in the farm crisis, both borrowers and lenders tried \nto ignore and deny what was totally an unsustainable situation. \nEventually,\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nsome lenders relented and started working out new loan terms that would \nreschedule payments, modify interest rates, and, in some cases, write \ndown the debt a little bit. However, not all lenders would engage in \nthat type of negotiation. For whatever reason, they did not want to \nrecognize the economic reality: that not all of the debt could be \nrepaid and that there was not enough collateral value left to pay off \nthe loan, even if they went through foreclosure.\n  So what happened is, Congress had to step in and bring a dose of \nreality to resolving the farm debt. It did so by enacting chapter 12 to \nthe Bankruptcy Code in 1986. I was here, a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee at that time, working very diligently in trying to get \nthrough this farm credit crisis. But when we did that, Congress gave to \nfamily farms and ranches the debt restructuring remedy that had been \navailable to other business enterprises. Chapter 12 bankruptcy permits \nthe courts--permits the court--to modify loans to family farmers, \nincluding those secured by a principal residence.\n  Professor Neil Harl of Iowa State University, one of the most \nrespected agricultural economists in the Nation, conducted \nauthoritative studies of the impacts of chapter 12 bankruptcy. One of \nthe more significant findings by Professor Harl was that some 84 \npercent of the original filers for chapter 12 bankruptcy were still \nfarming or owning agricultural land 7 years later. So this was an \nastonishingly successful outcome, exceeding the expectations of even \nthe most enthusiastic supporters of chapter 12 bankruptcy legislation. \nProfessor Harl also concluded that chapter 12 provisions did not--did \nnot--have a significant effect on interest rates. Again, this was \ncontrary to the dire predictions by many lenders at that time--the same \ndire predictions that we are hearing from lenders today.\n  As Professor Harl pointed out, both in the 1980s during the \nagricultural sector, and in the 2007-2008 housing sector, the losses \nhave already occurred because the borrowers who received relief would \notherwise have been unable to repay their loan. So, again, we heard all \nof these dire predictions of why we can't let the bankruptcy court come \nin and do something other than foreclosure--to modify, to write down \nthe debt a little bit, stretch out the payment times. What we did for \nmany farmers at that time--they may have had high-interest loans for 7 \nyears, 10 years. What we did, the courts came in, reduced the interest \nrates and strung out the payments for 20 years, 30 years. That is why \nso many years later farmers were still farming because they knew the \nunderlying asset was still valuable. It was still productive. They just \nhad to get through a bad rough spot. So there are a lot of farmers \ntoday still very much engaged in agriculture or ranching. That would \nnot be so today had we not enacted that chapter 12 for agriculture in \nthe mid-1980s.\n  So the provisions of the Durbin amendment give powerful incentives to \nfinancial institutions to work constructively with those in financial \ndifficulty. Indeed, by giving the bankruptcy judge authority to force \nmodification to mortgages on primary residences, as is the case with \nother assets, there is a real incentive to come to terms. I have never \nunderstood why a bankruptcy judge can force modifications to other \nassets but not on the primary residence. Well, we had the same \nsituation in the 1980s, and we extended it to farms and, as I said, as \nProfessor Harl showed, the rest is history. It succeeded beyond \nanyone's wildest expectations.\n  By giving this authority, again, to the bankruptcy judges, as I said, \nthere is an incentive for both the financial institution and the \nborrower to come to some terms. This is very helpful for a person in \ndifficulty, and it is very often in the interests of the owner of the \nmortgage, though it admittedly is not always in the interests of the \nmortgage servicer. We want to give relief to homeowners facing \nforeclosure not just for their benefit but for our benefit--the benefit \nof our economy.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment. Again, as we \nsaw during the chapter 12 bankruptcy proceedings during the farm crisis \nin the 1980s, these provisions will allow many people to retain their \nhomes and to weather this terrible economic downturn. Generally \nspeaking, lenders will not lose any money they would not already stand \nto lose if they were to force foreclosure.\n  As I said, I believe there is a very correct and almost similar \nparallel to what we did in the 1980s with farms. People who are in \nfinancial difficulty today because of the downturn in the economy are \ngoing to be productive workers in the future. Why force them out of \ntheir homes when a modification such as stretching out payments, \nreduction of interest rates, could keep them in their homes, keep up \nthe value of the surrounding property around them so they don't get in \nthis downward spiral in their communities. To me, this makes eminently \ngood sense.\n  Also, the positive consequences for our economy would be profound. An \nestimated 1.7 million families would be able to avoid foreclosure and \nkeep their homes. The housing crisis, as I said, would receive much \nneeded support. The housing market would be able to stabilize. All of \nthis would be a much needed tonic for our economy.\n  So I commend Senator Durbin for always being on the leading edge, as \nhe has been in the past. This is an amendment that I don't know why it \nisn't just accepted. It should be adopted overwhelmingly. As I said, we \nhave a precedent for it. We know what happened in the past, and we know \nthe same thing applies today.\n  So I urge my colleagues to wholeheartedly support the Durbin \namendment for individual homeowners, for communities, but for our \noverall economy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Iowa for \nhis kind and supportive statement about this pending amendment.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I have spoken to the Republican \ncloakroom. I believe this has been cleared, and if it hasn't, I will \nsubject it to further modification. We have some 30 minutes remaining \nin the debate on this amendment that is pending, and it is to be evenly \ndivided, 15 minutes to each side. So for the information of my \ncolleagues, we expect the vote to be in the neighborhood, in the range \nof 2:45, if they want to make their plans accordingly, unless the \nRepublican side yields back the 15 minutes they have remaining, which \nis their right, but they are certainly not compelled to do it. So I am \nnot asking for a consent. I hope I am just explaining what the current \nconsent order will lead us to.\n  Mr. President, I wish to show America what this debate is all about. \nIt is about this: This picture was taken on Capitol Hill. Two adjoining \nhomes on Capitol Hill, No. 822 on Capitol Hill, a neatly kept home--\nflower box, some work with some shrubbery here, nicely painted, \nobviously a lot of pride of ownership. Look next door. What do we find? \nA foreclosed property on Capitol Hill. This person is making his \nmortgage payment every month faithfully. This person is foreclosed on. \nThe property is in the hands of a bank. This property is deteriorating. \nAs it deteriorates, so does the value of the good-looking home right \nnext door.\n\n  That is not an unusual story. It is a story that will be repeated 8 \nmillion times over the next several years because that is what Moody's \nestimates will be the number of mortgages foreclosed upon in America if \nwe do nothing--8 million mortgage foreclosures. Out of all the home \nmortgages in America, it means that one out of six will be foreclosed \nupon.\n  This is an American tragedy coming to your neighborhood, coming to \nyour home, coming to what may be the most important asset you have on \nEarth. It does not have to happen. We can do things now to make a \ndifference. We have waited patiently for the banking industry to show \nleadership on this issue for years. They have failed. There has been \none excuse after another why they cannot step in and help people \nrenegotiate their mortgages.\n  Foreclosure is not a day at the beach for a bank. It costs them up to \n$50,000, sometimes more. They end up owning property, which is not what \nmost bankers go to business school to learn how to do, and the property \ndeteriorates, the value deteriorates, and they are stuck with it.\n  We have said to them: Let's find a way out of this that is \nreasonable.\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nLet's give to those facing mortgage foreclosure a last chance in \nbankruptcy court to have the judge try to adjust the value of the \nprincipal of the mortgage no lower than the fair market value of the \nhome--that is the best that any bank could ever hope for, if they could \never sell this property--no lower than the fair market value of the \nhome and an interest rate that is competitive with market rates. If the \nperson in bankruptcy has enough income to make the payment, give them \nthat second chance. The banks say: No, never, even though that kind of \na power in bankruptcy court is available for every other piece of real \nestate you own--the farms Senator Harkin of Iowa spoke to, ranches, \nvacation condos. It does not apply to a person's home. Why? Why \nwouldn't we apply it to a person's home? That is what the Durbin \namendment does.\n  We said to our friends in the banking community: We are going to give \nyou the last word, and here is what we are going to tell you: Anybody \nwho wants to go to bankruptcy court to have their mortgage rewritten by \nthe bankruptcy court first has to go back to the bank where they have \ntheir mortgage at least 45 days in advance of filing bankruptcy and put \nall of their documentation on the table as to their income and their \nnet worth. If the bank then makes them an offer of a mortgage that has \na mortgage-to-income ratio of 31 percent, which is the standard we are \nusing now, if the bank makes that offer, whether the borrower takes it \nor not, the bank is protected, the person can't go to bankruptcy court. \nThe bank has the last word in terms of whether anyone can even raise \nthis issue in bankruptcy.\n  I have been working on this for 2 years. By Senate standards, that is \na heartbeat. In this place, you better get ready to hunker down and \nfight for months and years at a time if it is an important issue, and I \nstill am. But for 2 years, we have been working with the banks trying \nto come up with a reasonable way to avoid this tragedy in neighborhoods \nacross America. They are the ones who came up with the 45 days before \nfiling for bankruptcy. They wanted us to restrict it so it is not in \nthe future, it only applies to existing mortgages. We said OK. They \nwanted to put a limitation on the value of the home, $729,000; that is \nthe most you can consider to refinance. We said OK. They wanted to make \nsure a person had been delinquent at least 60 days before they could \neven consider bankruptcy. We said OK. We did all of these things \nbecause the banking industry said that way people will not be doing \nirresponsible things and taking advantage. We did them all. We made all \nthese concessions. I do not agree with some of them, but that is the \nnature of compromise, that is the nature of the legislative process.\n  What happened at the end of the day after we made all these \nconcessions? I will tell you what happened. The bankers got up and \nwalked out. That is right. The American Banking Association, the \ncommunity bankers, the major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells \nFargo, Bank of America, and the credit unions walked out. They want \nnothing. They want no change. Only Citigroup said: We will stick with \nyou; we think it is reasonable. They are the only ones.\n  If you ask them why they are opposing this effort to try to \nrenegotiate a mortgage to keep a family in their home to avoid this \nmess, they say: Senator, you don't understand. It is about the sanctity \nof the mortgage contract.\n  Really? We know how some of these mortgages came to be. They came to \nbe as a result of at least misleading the borrowers, if not outright \nfraud.\n  They used to call these mortgages no-doc mortgages. Do you know what \nthat means? It means they were giving mortgages to people without any \nproof of income or net worth. If you dialed that 800 number on the \ntelevision screen, a fellow would show up, set up your closing in 48 \nhours, and get it done. Just keep signing those papers, incidentally, \nuntil you get to the bottom of the pile and everything is taken care \nof. Six months, 1 year, 2 years later, that mortgage exploded in the \nfaces of these homeowners.\n  Then there were others. They didn't get suckered into these subprime \nmortgages; they were folks just making their payments, everything was \nfine. Then the bottom fell out of the real estate market.\n  What is your home worth today? I can tell you what it is in \nSpringfield, IL, my home I have been in for 30 years. The value of my \nhome is down at least 20 percent. Did I miss a mortgage payment? No, \nbut it is the state of the real estate market. Lucky for me and my \nwife, we paid down enough on our mortgage so it is no big problem. For \nsome people, they went underwater. The value of the home is lower than \nthe principal of the mortgage they were paying off. So their credit \nrating disintegrated as a result of that. The value of the home here, \nwell kept and well painted, goes down because of a foreclosed home next \ndoor, and the credit rating of this homeowner deteriorates and \ndisintegrates to the point where they cannot refinance their home. That \nis the reality. That is the catch-22.\n  The banks are arguing the sanctity of the mortgage contract. I have \nnews for them. The bankruptcy court is all about looking at contracts. \nThat is what they do anyway. When we reformed the Bankruptcy Code a few \nyears ago, I didn't hear any argument about the sanctity of the \ncontract when we changed the rules of the game. In that case, the \nfinancial institutions liked changing the rules, liked changing the \ncontract. Now they are for the sanctity of the contract.\n  One other argument I think takes the cake: Senator, you don't \nunderstand the moral hazard here. People have to be held responsible \nfor their wrongdoing. If you make a mistake, darn it, you have to pay \nthe price. That is what America is all about.\n  Really, Mr. Banker on Wall Street, that is what America is all about? \nWhat price did Wall Street pay for their miserable decisions creating \nrotten portfolios, destroying the credit of America and its businesses? \nOh, they paid a pretty heavy price--hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money sent to them to bail them out, to put them back in \nbusiness, even to fund executive bonuses for those guilty of \nmismanagement. Moral hazard? How can they argue that with a straight \nface? They do.\n  Let me show you what this means in some of the States across the \nUnited States if the Durbin amendment would pass.\n  Take a look at the State of Florida. This State is really hard hit; \n206,000 homes would be saved from foreclosure with the Durbin \namendment--206,000 in the State of Florida. For the rest of the \nhomeowners in the State, $36 billion in value in their homes would be \nprotected because we saved these homes.\n  Take a look at the State of Ohio. Almost 44,000 homes will be saved \nby the Durbin amendment; $1.5 billion in real estate values saved for \nthe people who live next door and on the same block.\n  The State of Pennsylvania: 37,000 homes saved; $3.3 billion in real \nestate value protected.\n  The State of Maine, a small State but almost 5,000 homeowners would \nnot face foreclosure because of the Durbin amendment, and $104 million \nin value would be protected for homeowners across the State of Maine.\n\n  In the State of Missouri, 22,000 homes saved; $993 million in value.\n  I want to show a chart from the city of Chicago, which I am proud to \nrepresent. It looks as if it has the measles, doesn't it? This chart \nshows the foreclosures in 2008, the filings in the city of Chicago. \nHave you ever flown into Midway Airport and looked down at the little \nhouses, the little blond, brick bungalows? They have been around at \nleast since World War II. Good, hard-working families are in those \nhomes, starter homes for some, above-ground pools in the backyard, nice \nlittle flowers planted in the front yard, no trash out in the streets. \nThese people are, by and large, ethnic folks, immigrant folks. They \nvalue that home. It is the best thing they have going for them. In that \nZIP Code right around Midway Airport, there is not a single block in \nthat ZIP Code that does not have a foreclosed home. Not one. And you \ntell me what that means to the folks living next door. I know what it \nmeans. It means that the value of their home just went down, and if the \nforeclosed home is not watched carefully, even worse things can occur.\n  Here is what it comes down to. This is our chance to stand up for the \nfolks across America who send us here to be their voice. They are not \nlucky enough\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nto have the American Bankers Association as their lobby. They are not \nlucky enough to have the community bankers as their lobby. They are not \nlucky enough to have the credit unions as their lobby. What we are \ntalking about here are people who do not have any paid lobbyists. What \nthey are counting on is Senators in this Chamber who will stand up for \nthem.\n  The bankers don't want this. They hate the Durbin amendment like the \ndevil hates holy water. That was an old saying, which I particularly \nlike, from Dale Bumpers, who served from the State of Arkansas. They \nhate this amendment so much, so they negotiated for weeks and at the \nend of it pulled the plug--we are going to walk away. We are going to \ntell all of our friends, all of our loyal friends to vote no.\n  I hope the homeowners across America have more friends here than the \nAmerican Bankers Association. We are going to get a test vote in a few \nminutes to find out. I need 60 votes to win. That is not easy, I know \nit. I don't know how many, if any, votes will come from the other side \nof the aisle. I have spoken to a few over there, even some on this side \nof the aisle, one who has spoken out against this proposal, and that is \nhis right to do. To me, at the end of the day, this is a real test as \nto where we are going in this country.\n  Next up after mortgages is credit cards. Next week, the bankers can \ncome in and see how much might and power they have in the Senate when \nit comes to credit card reform.\n  The question we are going to face is whether this Senate is going to \nlisten to the families facing foreclosure, the families facing job loss \nand bills they cannot pay or whether they are going to listen to the \nAmerican Bankers Association, which has folded its arms and walked out \nof the room. I hope we have the courage to stand up to them. I hope \nthis is the beginning of a new day in the Senate, a new dialog in the \nSenate that says to bankers across America: Your business-as-usual has \nput us in a terrible mess, and we are not going to allow that to \ncontinue. We want America to be strong, but if it is going to be \nstrong, you should be respectful, Mr. Banker, of the people who live in \nthe communities where your banks are located. You should be respectful \nof those hard-working families who are doing their best to make ends \nmeet in the toughest economic recession they have ever seen. You should \nbe respectful of the people you want to sign up for checking and \nsavings accounts and make sure they have decent neighborhoods to live \nin. Show a little bit of loyalty to this great Nation instead of just \nto your bottom line when it comes to profitability. Take a little bit \nof consideration of what it takes to make America strong because when \nthis country is strong, when families can stay in their homes, take \npride in their homes, and our communities are better, guess what. You \nare going to do better as a banker. That is what will happen at the end \nof the day.\n  When I offered this amendment last year, they said: Not a big \nproblem; there are only 2 million foreclosures coming up. They were \nwrong. It turned out to be 8 million. And if the bankers prevail today \nand we cannot get something through conference committee to deal with \nthis issue, I will be back. I am not going to quit on this issue. \nSadly, the next time I get up to speak, whenever that might be, if we \nare not successful today, it may not be 8 million, it may be 10 million \nor 12 million.\n  At some point, the Senators in this Chamber will decide that the \nbankers should not write the agenda for the Senate. At some point, the \npeople in this Chamber will decide that the people we represent are not \nthe folks working in the big banks but the folks struggling to make a \nliving and struggling to keep a decent home. That is the test.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in adopting the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to Durbin amendment No. 1014 and \nthat any provisions of a previous order relating to this amendment \nremain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 1.7 million is the number of families that \nwe will either help stay in their homes or allow to lose their homes \nand be thrown on to the street.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will have the opportunity to vote for an \namendment to the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act that would \nenable 1.7 million families to avoid foreclosure.\n  My amendment would make a small change to the bankruptcy code to give \nthese families a little bit of leverage as they work with their lenders \nto create a modified mortgage that they can afford.\n  When we can avoid foreclosures and families can stay in their homes, \neveryone wins--the families, their neighbors, their lenders, and the \ngovernment. We can save 1.7 million homes with one vote.\n  I have come to the floor each day this week to talk about the scale \nof the problem and what we believe we should do about it, in very \ngeneral terms.\n  Now I would like to get specific.\n  Let me be clear: this is a very different amendment to the bankruptcy \ncode than my colleagues have seen before.\n  This amendment would integrate assistance in bankruptcy to the two \nprimary foreclosure prevention efforts already underway: the Obama \nadministration's Homeowner Assistance and Stability Plan and the \ncongressionally created Hope for Homeowners refinancing program which \nthe other title of this bill will greatly improve.\n  Our objective is to keep as many families in their homes as we can. \nIdeally none of these families would have to go through the painful \nprocess of a chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n  So this amendment would help only troubled homeowners who could not \nfind other assistance outside of bankruptcy first.\n  Let me put it another way: mortgage servicers would be given full \nveto power over which of their borrowers could go to bankruptcy--they \nwould be given the keys to the courthouse door.\n  All a servicer would have to do to block a borrower from going to \nbankruptcy for a mortgage modification would be to offer the borrower a \nmodification that conforms to the standards of the Homeowner \nAffordability and Stability Plan or Hope for Homeowners--regardless of \nwhether the borrower accepts the offer or not.\n  For banks and credit unions that aggressively offer modifications to \nborrowers who are in trouble, the total number of their borrowers who \nwill be eligible for bankruptcy assistance will be exactly zero.\n  Specifically if a servicer offers a loan modification that reduces \nthe borrower's mortgage debt-to-income ratio to 31 percent--the same as \nthe Housing Affordability and Stability Plan--or if a servicer offers \nHope for Homeowners refinancing, then that borrower could not run to a \njudge looking for a better deal through a cramdown. For those borrowers \nthat the servicer chooses not to modify voluntarily and that must file \nfor bankruptcy, half of any cramdown would be returned to the servicer \nif the borrower resells the home while still in bankruptcy.\n  For these borrowers that the servicer chooses not to help, the courts \nwould be constrained as follows: The judge could only reduce the loan \nprincipal to fair market value, which is much more than the lender \nwould collect if the home were to be sold in foreclosure. The judge \ncould only reduce the interest rate to the conventional rate plus a \nreasonable premium for risk, which at the moment would equal around 6.5 \npercent to 7 percent.\n  And the judge could only lengthen the term to the longer of 40 years, \nreduced by the period for which the mortgage has been outstanding or \nthe remaining term of the mortgage.\n  There are many further restrictions. Loans originated after 2008 are \nnot eligible for bankruptcy assistance.\n  Loans that are larger than the largest conforming loan limit are not \neligible for bankruptcy assistance. Loans that are not 60 days \ndelinquent are not eligible for bankruptcy assistance. Loans that are \nnot in foreclosure are not eligible for bankruptcy. And the whole \namendment would sunset at the end of 2012 when the Housing \nAffordability and Stability Plan expires.\n  The banks hold the keys to the courthouse. And, even those borrowers \nthe banks refuse to help can only receive assistance that still makes \nthe banks far more money than the only other alternative: foreclosure.\n  Yet even with all of these restrictions, Mark Zandi from Moody's \nEconomy.com estimates that this change\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nwould save 1.7 million families from foreclosure. Why? Because for most \nlenders, the Obama administration's foreclosure prevention plan is \nvoluntary. This change to the bankruptcy code would encourage lenders \nto participate, because offering these modifications allows lenders to \neffectively veto a modification in bankruptcy. That is a large part of \nwhy the President supports this provision, and why he included it as a \nkey element in his plan.\n  This amendment would prevent foreclosures, which would help us find \nthe bottom in the housing market, which would help the housing markets \nturn around more quickly, which would help the entire economy start \nmoving again. Perhaps best of all, this amendment wouldn't cost the \ntaxpayers a penny.\n  Even though this new proposal is airtight in protecting lenders \ninterests, the ideologues in the mortgage industry--outfits like the \nMortgage Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the \nAmerican Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers \nAssociation, and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions--\nstill oppose providing this help to troubled homeowners and the economy \nat large.\n  They continue to regurgitate the same tired talking points that have \nbeen refuted over and again by the facts.\n  They seem to repeat the same six myths. Myth No. 1: Allowing troubled \nhomeowners to receive mortgage assistance in bankruptcy will lead to \nhigher borrowing costs for future borrowers. Reality: Although the \nMortgage Bankers Association has claimed in front of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that ``if this legislation goes through, we will be \nputting a permanent tax on everybody that buys a house going forward of \n$295 per month,'' there are several reasons why this argument makes no \nsense.\n  First, future borrowers aren't eligible for this bankruptcy \nassistance, so there is no reason why future borrowers should have to \npay more to compensate lenders for a risk that doesn't exist.\n  Second, only borrowers for which foreclosure is the only other \nalternative are eligible for this bankruptcy assistance. Foreclosures \nalmost always cost banks more than loan modifications that keep \nfamilies paying each month. No extra costs are being borne by the banks \nthat they could justify passing on to other borrowers.\n  Third, a study by Adam Levitin of the Georgetown Law School proves \ndefinitively that the availability of bankruptcy assistance to some \nborrowers in the past led to no increase in borrowing costs for others.\n  There is no reason to think that the same logic wouldn't apply in \ntoday's market that supports record low interest rates.\n  Myth No. 2: Changing the bankruptcy code will cause uncertainty in \nthe market. Reality: Although the American Bankers Association asserts \nthat ``mortgage cramdowns would add significant risk and uncertainty to \nmortgage lending,'' it is in fact the rapidly rising foreclosure rate \nthat is adding risk and uncertainty to mortgage lending.\n  If potential homeowners think housing prices will continue to fall \nthey will be unlikely to buy a home.\n  Aggressively preventing foreclosures will keep unnecessary supply off \nof the market, which will stabilize prices and encourage buyers to \nreturn to the market.\n  Since changing the bankruptcy code would save 1.7 million homes from \nforeclosure, the Durbin amendment would return a sense certainty to \nmortgage lending, not undermine it.\n  Some of the loudest opponents of my amendment were the chief \ncontributors to the most uncertainty in the credit markets since the \nGreat Depression. They have no credibility to tell us what the markets \nmay or may not judge to create uncertainty.\n  Myth No. 3: Bankruptcy judges shouldn't be able to break the sanctity \nof the contract. Reality: The Chamber of Commerce argues that ``Cram \ndown provisions would improperly expand the bankruptcy code by granting \nnew powers to bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of existing, \nlegitimate mortgage contracts.''\n  Legitimate mortgage contracts? What is so legitimate about no-doc, \ninterest only, negative amortizing loans that had almost no chance to \nsucceed from the day they are underwritten?\n  The concept of bankruptcy is enshrined in the Constitution, and \nbankruptcy has always been a venue in which contracts are restructured.\n  The Chamber and the banking industry had no problem with applying the \nsweeping 2005 bankruptcy code changes to all contracts past, present, \nand future when those changes benefitted businesses. They have no \nstanding to now argue that because of the sanctity of the contract the \nbankruptcy laws should not be changed.\n  Myth No. 4: Allowing borrowers to modify mortgages in bankruptcy \nwould shield borrowers from the consequences of their poor decisions to \nbuy houses they could not afford, thereby creating a moral hazard. \nReality: The industry that claims we should worry about moral hazard \nfor borrowers is the same industry that helped create the greatest \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  Bankruptcy is a painful process for the borrower, not one that is \ntaken lightly. The intent of the legislation is to create the necessary \nincentives for more modifications to take place outside of bankruptcy.\n  And what about the families who have done everything right but have \nthe misfortune of living next door to a foreclosure? If we save \nfamilies from foreclosure we help their neighbors too. There's no moral \nhazard in that.\n  My amendment would save the neighbors of prevented foreclosures over \n$300 billion in preserved home equity. I will talk much more about that \nwhen I return to the floor tomorrow.\n  Finally, for many borrowers the problem isn't the home itself, but \nrather the high cost loan they are trapped in. Making the mortgage more \naffordable will make the home affordable for many families.\n  Myth No. 5: Restricting this amendment to only subprime and exotic \nloans is better policy than providing this option to borrowers with all \ntypes of loans. Reality: Although the National Association of Federal \nCredit Unions--which is the smaller of the two credit union \nassociations--continues to argue that we should allow ``bankruptcy \nmodification [to] apply to only to subprime or Alt-A (or \nnontraditional) mortgage loans,'' I disagree.\n  Last year I thought that this might be a reasonable compromise. But \nthe foreclosure crisis has expanded far beyond subprime loans. The \nfastest-growing foreclosure rate by loan type is the traditional prime \nloan--once considered safe.\n  We are no longer just trying to solve for bad mortgage underwriting. \nWe're trying to turn around the entire economy, and to do that we have \nto stabilize the housing markets.\n  Finally, how would we explain to our constituents that we're \nproviding special assistance to borrowers who took out a riskier type \nof loan, but the families with a standard, conservative loan who may \nneed a bit of help are out of luck?\n  Myth No. 6: Because community banks didn't create this crisis, it \nwould be better policy to carve out their borrowers from having the \noption of bankruptcy assistance. Reality: Look at this picture again. \nIf a community bank really cares about the community it serves, why \nshould this foreclosure be allowed to take place just because the \nborrower took out a loan with a community bank rather than a big \nnational bank?\n  Does that matter to the family who lost their home? Does that matter \nto the family living next door?\n  These banking associations have generated many myths of terror and \ndestruction that this amendment would create, but the legislative \nlanguage speaks for itself. And it refutes each of these myths.\n  Mr. President, 1.7 million families can be saved from foreclosure.\n  This is the Senate's chance to finally address the heart of our \neconomic crisis, with no bailout money involved.\n  We may not have a better chance to help turn this crisis around.\n  Today the Senate will vote on my amendment to the housing bill that \nwould give 1.7 million families a chance to save their homes.\n  I spoke earlier this week on the floor about the crushing impact to \nthe broader economy that the foreclosure crisis has had.\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\n  Mortgages were bundled into mortgage-backed securities, which were \nsliced and diced into ``synthetic collateralized debt obligations'' and \nsimilar products, which were then sold to unsuspecting investors all \nover the world.\n  For a while there, they sold as if they were gold. Well, they are \npretty tarnished now. They are now known as ``toxic assets.''\n  But I urge my colleagues not to forget that underlying these exotic \n``toxic assets'' are things that we understand far more personally.\n  At the root of the crisis is the home. Mr. President, 8.1 million of \nthem may be lost, according to Credit Suisse. My amendment will help \nsave 1.7 million of them.\n  Also at the root of this crisis is the damage to the homeowners who \nlive around these foreclosures, the neighbors who have made every \nmortgage payment on time. They stand to lose over $300 billion more, \nunless we pass my amendment.\n  I want to emphasize this point for a moment. There are millions of \nfamilies all over America that have done everything right--they bought \nonly as much house as they could afford, and they have made every \nmortgage payment on time.\n  Look at this picture. This house is well-kept, and appears to be the \ncherished home of a family that has acted responsibly. But this house \nnext door, you can see what this house looks like.\n  Clearly, the well-kept home is worth much less than it would be if it \nwere next to another well-kept home instead of this boarded-up eyesore.\n  Situations like this can be seen in each and every state that my \ncolleagues and I represent. Families are in trouble, and their \nneighbors are suffering along with them.\n  By voting for my amendment we can save 1.7 million of these troubled \nfamilies from foreclosure and can save their neighbors over $300 \nbillion in home equity that would otherwise be lost.\n  In Florida, for example, we estimate that over 200,000 more families \nwill lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass my \namendment.\n  Families like Derek and Kellyanne Baehr. As reported in local papers, \nDerek has been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder that will \neventually require him to use a wheelchair.\n  The couple has lived in their modest, single-story stucco home for \nfour years, and they are now struggling to pay their mortgage.\n  After months of trying to work with their lender, they finally \nreceived a slight reduction in their interest rate, but ``it was like \nputting a Band-Aid on cancer,'' Derek said.\n  ``We can't continue to go on this way,'' said Kellyanne. ``I cry \nabout every day.''\n  If my amendment were to become law, this family's lender probably \nwould have offered more than a ``Band-Aid on cancer.'' The lender \nlikely would have offered a modification that would have kept the \nBaehrs in their home and paying their mortgage.\n  And, certainly, avoiding foreclosure would be a better result for \nboth the Baehr's and the lender.\n  The neighbors who live around families who are kicked out on to the \nstreet--like the Baehrs may soon be--typically see the value of their \nhomes--their most valuable asset--take a nosedive.\n  In Florida, neighbors of families that lose their homes will watch \nmore than $36 billion of their assets evaporate unless we pass my \namendment.\n  In Ohio, we estimate that nearly 44,000 more families will lose their \nhomes in the next few years if we don't pass my amendment.\n  Some time ago I met the Glickens, a husband and wife from Ohio who \nwere persuaded by a mortgage broker to commit to a mortgage that seemed \nfine at the start.\n  Then, the adjustable interest rates kicked in. They soon were being \nasked to pay 60 percent more than the original payments, and they just \ncouldn't keep up.\n  Families like the Glickens are supposed to reach out to their lender \nto figure out how to modify the mortgage so that it is more affordable \nand so that foreclosure can be avoided.\n  Avoiding foreclosure is better for the homeowner and the bank, right?\n  Get this: the Glickens' lender charged them $425 to apply for a loan \nmodification . . . and then turned them down anyway.\n  The Glickens needed a bit more leverage to negotiate with their \nlender, leverage that the threat of bankruptcy assistance would \nprovide.\n  In Ohio, neighbors of families that lose their homes will lose more \nthan $1.5 billion of their assets unless the Senate passes my \namendment.\n  In Pennsylvania, over 37,000 additional families will lose their \nhomes in the next few years if we don't pass the Durbin amendment.\n  As one example of many, a divorced father of twin boys in Levittown \nrefinanced his mortgage after his divorce in an attempt to keep a \nstable home environment for his boys.\n  The refinance placed him in an interest-only mortgage with American \nHome Mortgage, which itself went into bankruptcy.\n  He ended up in chapter 13 trying to make the payments on all of his \ndebts.\n  But, the bankruptcy court could not help him restructure his mortgage \nunder current law, even though the court has restructured each of his \nother debts to help him make his payments.\n  Prior to filing for bankruptcy, he tried to reach an agreement with \nhis lender, but he couldn't find anyone to talk to consistently about \nthe situation and he was given no viable options to catch up on his \npayments.\n  This single dad would have benefited from my amendment. So would his \nneighbors.\n  In Pennsylvania, neighbors of families that lose their homes will \nwatch more than $3.3 billion of their assets evaporate unless we pass \nmy amendment.\n  In Maine, nearly 5,000 additional families will lose their homes in \nthe next few years if we don't pass this bankruptcy provision. If you \nare watching at home in California or New York that may not sound like \na lot of families, but people who live in Maine know just how \ndevastating those losses would be.\n  For instance, a woman from Woolwich was barely making ends meet when \nshe received a notice that the interest rate on her mortgage was going \nto increase by 3 percentage points.\n  She immediately contacted the mortgage company and indicated that she \ncould not handle the additional expense.\n  The lender told her that they were not going to be able to work with \nher and there was nothing that they could do for her.\n  I am confident this woman's lender would have tried a little harder \nto help if the threat of assistance in bankruptcy loomed.\n  In Maine, neighbors of families that lose their homes will lose more \nthan $100 million of their assets unless we pass my amendment.\n  In Missouri, we estimate that 22,000 additional families will lose \ntheir homes in the next few years if we don't pass this amendment.\n  We are talking about people like a Ford retiree in Kansas City who \nhad fallen behind on his mortgage payments due to a high interest rate \non the loan. He passed away, and his widow was unable to keep up with \nthe payments.\n  The home was worth far less than the outstanding mortgage balance, \nand she started to receive foreclosure notices. Her loan servicer was \nnot receptive to a discussion regarding a loan modification.\n  Her monthly income left her with about $700 after she made this \nmortgage payment. And her monthly heating bills that winter were $600.\n  Again, I have to believe the availability of bankruptcy assistance \nwould have encouraged her lender to work with her.\n  In Missouri, neighbors of families that lose their homes will watch \nalmost $1 billion of their assets disappear unless we pass my \namendment.\n  In my home State of Illinois, last year in Chicago alone nearly \n20,000 homes were in some stage of foreclosure.\n  The red dots represent these 20,000 homes. They are everywhere. And \nthe problem is getting worse.\n  Statewide, my amendment would help 60,000 families avoid foreclosure. \nTheir neighbors would preserve nearly $20 billion if my amendment \nbecomes law.\n  How could I not fight for this?\n  Maybe I shouldn't take this amendment so personally. Perhaps I should\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\njust argue dispassionately about the merits of the proposal, since the \nmerits really do speak for themselves.\n  But when a family loses its home, that is personal.\n  The home is where parents tuck their kids in at night. It's where \nfamilies share their daily stories over meals at the dining room table. \nIt's where secrets are shared, where dreams are born, and where bonds \nare formed.\n  Every foreclosure is a tragedy. Every foreclosure is deeply personal \nfor the parents who have to explain to their kids why they can't sleep \nin their bedrooms anymore. Every foreclosure that can be prevented, \nshould be prevented.\n  The Senate can stop 1.7 million of them with one vote. The Senate can \nsave their neighbors--our constituents--over $300 billion in the \npreservation of home equity with one vote. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support attached to this \nstatement be submitted for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nHelp 1.7 Million Families Stay in Their Homes! Support the Foreclosure \n                     Amendment to the Housing Bill\n\n                                                   April 29, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned consumer, civil rights, \n     labor, faith-based, housing, financial, and community \n     organizations representing tens of millions of Americans \n     strongly urge you to vote for the foreclosure prevention \n     amendment that will be offered by Senator Durbin when the \n     full Senate takes up the House-passed housing bill (``Helping \n     Families Save Their Homes Act'') later this week. Our \n     organizations long have supported legislation to empower \n     bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences \n     so as to provide the ``stick'' financially strapped \n     homeowners desperately need to get their lenders to work with \n     them to prevent avoidable foreclosures. Absent this stick, \n     all the voluntary programs that have been put in place during \n     the last 18 months have failed to produce the modifications \n     necessary to save American families and repair the faltering \n     housing market.\n       The amendment that will be offered on the Senate floor \n     substantially narrows previous versions by enabling the \n     servicer to prevent the borrower from obtaining a mortgage \n     modification in bankruptcy simply by offering the borrower an \n     affordable modification. Any such offer would bar judicial \n     modification of the borrower's mortgage forever. And, with \n     this ``stick'' in place, the new voluntary modification \n     programs have a substantially greater chance of succeeding, \n     which would help stop foreclosures and stabilize the economy.\n       Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com projects that up to 1.7 \n     million families will be able to save their home from \n     foreclosure if this amendment is approved. At a time when an \n     estimated 6,600 families are losing their home to foreclosure \n     each and every day, there is no time for delay. We urge the \n     Senate to support the amendment to lift the ban on judicial \n     modification of primary residence mortgages in extremely \n     narrowly drawn circumstances. Passage of this legislation is \n     the most important thing Congress can do right now to help \n     arrest the financial crisis and the terrible toll that it is \n     taking on American families.\n           Sincerely,\n       AARP.\n       AFL-CIO.\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME).\n       Americans for Fairness in Lending.\n       Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \n     (ACORN).\n       Calvert Asset Management Company.\n       Center for Responsible Lending.\n       Central Illinois Organizing Project.\n       Change to Win.\n       Consumer Action.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       DEMOS.\n       International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers.\n       International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).\n       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n       NAACP.\n       National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. \n     National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n       National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n     clients).\n       National Fair Housing Alliance.\n       National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions.\n       National NeighborWorks Association.\n       National People's Action.\n       National Policy and Advocacy Council on Homelessness.\n       North Carolina State Employees Credit Union.\n       Opportunity Finance Network.\n       PaxWorld Mutual Funds.\n       PICO National Network.\n       Rural Advancement Foundation International--USA.\n       Service Employees International Union.\n       United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\n       U.S. PIRG.\n       ACORN-NC.\n       Affiliated Congregations to Improve our Neighborhoods, \n     Gainesville, FL.\n       Baldwin County ACT II, Baldwin County, AL.\n       Bayou Interfaith Together.\n       Berkeley Organizing Congregations for Action, Berkeley, CA.\n       Beyond Housing, MO.\n       Birmingham Area Interfaith Sponsoring Committee, \n     Birmingham, AL.\n       Brockton Interfaith Community, Brockton, MA.\n       Brooklyn Congregations United, Brooklyn, NY.\n       Camden Churches Organized for People, Camden, NJ.\n       Communities Creating Opportunity--Kansas, Kansas City, KS.\n       Congregations and Schools Empowered, Glenwood Springs, CA.\n       Congregations Building Community, Modesto, CA.\n       Congregations for Community Action, Melbourne, FL.\n       Congregations Organizing for Renewal, South Alameda County, \n     CA.\n       Congregations Organizing People for Equality (COPE).\n       Congregations United for Neighborhood Action, Allentown, \n     PA.\n       Connecticut Association for Human Services.\n       Connecticut Legal Services.\n       Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Forsyth County, Inc., \n     NC.\n       Contra Costa County Interfaith Supporting Community \n     Organization, CA.\n       Delta Interfaith Network (DIN).\n       Essex County Community Organization, Essex County, MA.\n       Fair Housing Law Project, CA.\n       Faith in Action Kern County, Kern County, CA.\n       Faith in Community, Fresno, CA.\n       Faith United Empowering Leadership (FUEL).\n       Faith Works, North San Diego County, CA.\n       Federation of Congregations United to Serve, Orlando, FL.\n       Financial Protection Law Center.\n       Flint Area Congregations Together, Flint, MI.\n       Florida Legal Services.\n       Greater Long Beach Interfaith Community Organization, Long \n     Beach, CA.\n       Greater Pensacola Community Organization, Pensacola, FL.\n       Hope Ministry of Point Coupee.\n       Housing Preservation Project, MN.\n       Inland Congregations United for Change, San Berardino/\n     Riverside/Coachella, CA.\n       Interfaith Action, Rochester, NY.\n       L.A.

Mr. President, as I address this Chamber today, more \nAmericans find themselves face to face with the grim reality of home \nforeclosure than ever before. The magnitude of this problem is hard to \noverstate, and the human cost of forced evictions and shuttered windows \nis heartbreaking. In the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, \nneighborhoods across the country are battered by month after\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nmonth of record foreclosures, and there does not seem to be an end in \nsight. We must therefore move with urgency to put an end to this crisis \nand help keep hardworking Americans in their homes.\n  With this increasingly dire situation in mind, I urge my colleagues \nto pass the Durbin amendment to the Helping Families Save Their Homes \nAct.\n  As it stands, 8.1 million homes are expected to be lost to \nforeclosure before we emerge from this crisis. The Durbin amendment \nwould preserve more than $300 billion in equity for responsible \nhomeowners and prevent 1.7 million of those mortgages from falling into \nforeclosure. Together with President Obama's Housing and Stability \nPlan, this measure would create strong incentives to modify mortgages \noutside of bankruptcy. Under this plan, a few troubled borrowers would \nreceive controlled assistance in the court system. This empowers \nhomeowners and also protects lenders to ensure that everyone is getting \na fair deal.\n  Some elements of the powerful banking industry oppose what I see as a \ncommonsense solution. They seek to misrepresent our efforts to help \nAmericans remain in their homes, despite the fact that this legislation \nsafeguards their assets too, and even provides lenders with a ``veto'' \nover which of their borrowers can go into bankruptcy. Please do not \nfall victim to the myths that some have tried to spread about this \nbill. Let me be clear: this measure is not a stopgap, it is not a \nbailout, and it will not cost taxpayers one more penny. It is a \npragmatic and effective solution to a set of problems that have been \nwreaking havoc on the American families for far too long.\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Durbin, for his leadership on this \nissue. Where others have pointed fingers and played partisan games, \nSenator Durbin has acted swiftly to provide a clear vision and a strong \nvoice on behalf of troubled homeowners in our home state and across the \ncountry. I thank him for his hard work in creating this important \nlegislation, and I am proud to support it.\n  Now is the time to focus on solutions. Now is the time to take swift \naction to save 1.7 million homes otherwise expected to fall into \nforeclosure. The day will come when it is appropriate to assign blame, \nto call those responsible to task for the recklessness that led us \nhere. But first we must act boldly to aid the victims of the mortgage \ncrisis and stop the relentless march of foreclosures across America's \nheartland. I call upon my colleagues to pass the Durbin amendment \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know that in a few minutes we are going to \nbe voting on the amendment offered by our colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin, and I wish to once again commend him and Senator \nSchumer and others who have been involved not just in the crafting of \nthe amendment, but I wish to thank their staffs. Brad McConnell has \ndone a Herculean job over these past number of weeks, including the 2-\nweek recess period we were out of session, to try to reach a compromise \nwith major lending institutions and others across the country to be \nsupportive of this proposal that Senator Durbin has asked us to \napprove, which is to allow judges under the bankruptcy law to work out \nmodifications between lenders and borrowers with home mortgages that \nare involved in principal residences.\n  Again, Senator Durbin has significantly shrunken his original idea to \nthe point where this is a very modest proposal, for a very limited \namount of time, affecting circumstances that would be very controlled \ndue to the fears that were raised by others that this would be too \nbroad and far-reaching. As to the point I attempted to make this \nmorning, I am confounded by those who would oppose this amendment. \nBankruptcy judges can engage in workouts between borrowers and lenders \nwhere vacation homes, holiday homes, recreational vehicles or yachts \nare involved, but they can't do it on a principal place of residence.\n  I think that is a hard argument to explain to the American people, \nmost of whom--while they might like to have a vacation or a holiday \nhome or other residences--only have a principal place of residence, so \nthey are restricted. What strikes them--and those of us who are \nsupportive of the Durbin amendment--is how you explain to two families \nwho live next door to each other, one of whom only has a principal \nplace of residence, as most Americans do, and the next-door neighbor \nwho, because of economic circumstances, inheritances or whatever else \nit may be, has that wonderful beach house or that cabin up in the \nmountains or that yacht on the lake, and if they are in trouble on \nthose mortgages, the bankruptcy judge can work out a new financial \narrangement which allows them to keep that vacation home or keep that \nboat or log cabin up in the hills. Yet the next-door neighbor, with \njust a principal place of residence, hears: I am sorry, you are going \nto foreclosure. We are not allowed to work that out for you.\n  I don't know how you explain that to people, not to mention the \ndamage you do, of course, to every other neighbor in that community \nwhose property value declines because of the foreclosure, that family \nwho is affected, neighborhood that is affected, economy that is \naffected.\n  What the Senator from Illinois has proposed is a very narrow, \nrestricted, commonsense idea. As I mentioned earlier, meeting with \nbankruptcy judges in Connecticut on Monday, I raised with them what \nthey thought of the Durbin amendment. They thought it was a wonderful \nidea. I half expected they would say the courts are crowded, already \novercrowded. That was not the argument at all.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues, as they come to this Chamber, give this \nthat additional consideration. This ought not be a matter that divides \nus here. This is one that could make some sense, even if it doesn't do \nas much as we hope it does. I mentioned earlier some 15,000 homes in my \nState could be positively affected by this amendment. What if it were \nonly 5,000? What if we were off? Is it wrong to try to save 5,000 homes \nin my State? Or the 325,000, or a number like that, in California, not \nto mention States that have numbers that vastly exceed what Connecticut \ncould benefit from?\n  We will not know unless we try. All the things we have tried--and I \nhave been involved with most of them--have never done quite as much as \nwe hoped they would. But until we get to the bottom of the mortgage \nmarket problem, until you get to the bottom of that, all these other \neconomic problems are going to be more difficult to solve.\n  I applaud my colleague from Illinois. He has been tireless in his \neffort. I express my strong support for what he is trying to achieve \nhere and hope my colleagues will do so as well in the few moments \nremaining before they come to cast a ballot on this important issue.\n  You may never do anything that will allow for as much relief to as \nmany families as you will if you cast a positive vote on the Durbin \namendment. I would love to tell you these other ideas we are going to \nwork on will have great opportunity, but I must tell you candidly, as \nthe chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, this idea offers more \nhope for more people than any other idea you possibly ever will vote \non.\n  This is the moment, this is the hour, this is the day to make a \ndifference and I know all my colleagues would like to make a difference \nfor the people in their States who are going through job loss, home \nloss, retirement loss. Here is one answer that could very well provide \nthe kind of relief all of us would like to see.\n  I urge the adoption of the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of the amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now going to proceed to the \nStrickland nomination. There should be a vote on that within the next \ncouple of hours. We have a very important amendment that is going to be \ndebated this evening, this afternoon, by Senators Dodd and Shelby. It \nis a substitute to the amendment that is now before the body. It is an \nextremely important amendment.\n  I would hope if Senators have any other amendments they want offered \nto this bill that they should do it. We want to finish this legislation \nas quickly as we can. It is extremely important we get it done.\n  We have 3 weeks left in this work period. There are things we have to \ncomplete this work period. We have to complete this housing \nlegislation. I would like to do that in the next few days; hopefully, \ntomorrow. We are not going to have any votes tomorrow after 11 o'clock.\n  Hopefully, we have all of the cards lined up. We can finish this \nhousing legislation tomorrow. We are going to go to the credit card \nlegislation as soon as we finish this housing legislation. We are going \nto go, after that, to the procurement legislation. That is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation with Senators Levin and McCain.\n  Then, before we leave, we are going to do the supplemental \nappropriations bill. There is one other piece of work I wanted to do, \nbut we--it doesn't appear that the HELP Committee is going to be able \nto have that marked up in time for me to do it. Frankly, we probably \nwould not have time to do it anyway; that is, the FDA regulation of \ntobacco.\n  So everyone needs to understand this is work we have to do before we \nleave. Then when we come back, the next work period is only 4 weeks. I \nhave told Senator Kohl that we are going to do the railroad antitrust \nlegislation during that 4-week work period. We are going to do that \neither the first or second week. Hopefully, no other emergencies come \nup that get in the way of not allowing us to do that.\n  Also, because the budget passed yesterday, as soon as we get the \n302(b) allocations, which should be soon, we are going to move as \nquickly as we can to start working on the appropriations bills.\n  There is a general feeling of the Democrats and Republicans that we \nwant to be able to get some appropriations bills done.\n  Senators Inouye and Cochran are two of the most valued Senators we \nhave; they are experienced. They should be able to move us through \nthem. So we pretty well understand what the workload is. The main \nquestion this afternoon is whether there are other amendments to be \noffered to the housing bill? During this period, we have a significant \nnumber of nominations that we will do our best to work out with the \nRepublicans. We have done pretty well so far. We have quite a chunk \nstill pending. We are concerned about David Hayes, Dawn Johnsen, and a \nnumber of others we have to see if we can work out a time agreement on.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1018\n\n              (Purpose: to provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Shelby and myself, I \ncall up amendment 1018 and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 1018.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. I will wait until after the completion of the debate on the \nStrickland nomination to talk about the amendment. I am sure Senator \nShelby will as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4938-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4938-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF THOMAS L. STRICKLAND TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FISH \n                              AND WILDLIFE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Thomas L. Strickland, of \nColorado, to be Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 3 hours of debate with 1 hour \nunder the control of the majority and 2 hours of debate under the \ncontrol of the minority, with 30 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nThomas Strickland to be Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife at \nthe Department of the Interior. I have met with Mr. Strickland, and \nwhile he has a distinguished career in public service, I do not believe \nhe is the appropriate candidate to fill this position. His disregard \nfor second amendment rights, coupled with his position on domestic \nenergy production, leaves me little choice other than to oppose his \nnomination today.\n  In December of this past year, the Department of the Interior took \ngreat steps forward toward reversing the ban on lawful firearms in \nparks. However, because of one court case on technical grounds, \nmillions of law-abiding park visitors find their second amendment \nrights challenged yet again. For decades, regulations enacted by \nunelected bureaucrats at the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service have prohibited law-abiding citizens from \ntransporting and possessing operational firearms on Federal lands \nmanaged by these agencies. The enactment of these rules preempted State \nlaws, bypassed the authority of Congress, and trampled on the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding Americans guaranteed by the second \namendment for more than 170,000 acres of public lands. No other Federal \nland management agency has enacted anti-gun rules similar to the Park \nService and Fish and Wildlife.\n  Both the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service allow \nfor the law of the State in which the Federal property is located to \ngovern firearm possession. Neither of these agencies experienced any \ndifficulties as a result of allowing firearm possession.\n  I have met with my friend, Secretary Salazar, who is now the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior, and told him of my support \nfor repealing this firearm ban. At the time, Secretary Salazar agreed \nwith me and stated before the Senate Energy Committee that he supports \nrepealing the ban. This is the same committee that\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nvoted this past November, 18 to 5--I repeat that, the committee voted \n18 to 5--to repeal the ban. Secretary Salazar, then-Senator Salazar, \nvoted in support of the repeal. Because of one court case, the \nDepartment of the Interior is backpedaling on its original position.\n  I believe this is an unsound policy and extremely shortsighted. This \nis why I, along with my good friend Senator Coburn and 16 other \ncolleagues in the Senate, sent a letter to the Department of the \nInterior for a clarification of its views on this regulation. While I \nappreciate the Secretary getting back to me so quickly on this, the \nresponse I received was short and vague. I have always had a good \nworking relationship with Secretary Salazar. In the past, he has gone \nout of his way to tell me personally of his support for second \namendment rights. Rest assured, I will hold him to his word and will be \nwatching this situation very closely as it continues to unfold. I will \ncontinue to work with the Department of the Interior to get this \nregulation implemented properly.\n  I am also concerned about this nominee's stance on domestic energy \nproduction. I have long said, along with many of my colleagues in the \nSenate, that America has a domestic resource to meet its growing energy \nneeds. In order to meet them, we need to use all our resources, \nincluding nuclear, clean coal, renewables, along with oil and natural \ngas. America has a wealth of oil and natural gas reserves that, if \nutilized properly and in an environmentally sound manner, could meet \nour energy demands for decades to come. The nominee before us today, \nThomas Strickland, does not support using all forms of energy. He has \nbeen very public in his position that we should not open ANWR to \ndomestic energy production. I have been to ANWR to see firsthand what \nall the talk was about. After visiting it, I am even more confident in \nmy support for drilling there.\n  We met with the environmentalists and villagers on the border of ANWR \nand talked to them about the desperate need of the United States for \nmore domestic energy sources. There were a few residents who expressed \nopposition, but they were in a very small minority. The majority of the \npeople living near ANWR, more than 75 percent, support drilling there. \nI know that Strickland, along with some of my colleagues in the Senate, \nis desperate to stop us from opening ANWR. The facts about ANWR, \nhowever, are not on their side. Some of these facts need to be \nrepeated, especially for those who are new to this debate.\n  ANWR itself is roughly the size of South Carolina. It is absolutely \nenormous. It is 19.6 million acres or 30,000 square miles. When we talk \nabout drilling in ANWR, we are talking about clean drilling in an area \nthat is less than 2,000 acres. That is one one-hundredth of 1 percent \nof the total acreage in ANWR. It is actually smaller than most \nairports.\n  To say that drilling in this limited portion of ANWR threatens the \nentire environment of this refuge is farfetched and just plain wrong.\n  During my trip, I visited the sites at Alpine and Prudhoe Bay. There \nis no doubt in my mind that we can develop ANWR in a safe and effective \nmanner. Drilling will only be a small footprint in ANWR that can be \ncarried out in an environmentally sound manner. State-of-the-art \ntechnology will lessen the environmental impact. The old stereotypes of \ndirty oil drilling don't apply anymore. We all want to do what we can \nto protect the environment, but it is not credible to say that looking \nfor oil in this small, limited part of ANWR is a dangerous threat to \nthe entire region. As our demand for energy is growing, we must \nincrease our energy supply to keep up. ANWR is the most promising \ndomestic source of oil we have. To automatically take it off the \nnegotiating table, as this nominee has, is shortsighted.\n\n  Finally, I have concerns with Mr. Strickland's stance on regulation \nfor coal mining operations. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is home to \nsome of our Nation's largest coal reserves. In fact, we have about 250 \nyears of coal reserves or about the same amount of coal reserves that \nSaudi Arabia has for oil. I am proud to come from a State that has coal \nreserves and firmly believe we have the ability to develop and use this \nnatural resource in an environmentally sound manner. This is why I was \npleased, last December, when the Department of the Interior issued a \nrule to clarify the disposal of excess spoil created by coal mining \noperations.\n  The rule also requires mine operators avoid disturbing streams, to \nthe greatest extent possible, and clarifies when mine operators must \nmaintain an undisturbed buffer between the mine and the adjacent \nstreams. Aside from striking a balance between environmental \nprotections and responsible mining operations, this new rule clarified \na longstanding dispute over how the surface mining law should be \napplied.\n  Past confusion over how it should be applied has led to undue \nlitigation, suspension of mining operations and, ultimately, job loss \nfor many mining communities across the country and in Kentucky. In \ndiscussions I had with both the Secretary of the Interior and Mr. \nStrickland earlier this year, I expressed my support for this new rule \nand respectfully asked that they take this support into account. Both \nnominees stated they would not overturn the rule. Yet this past week \nthe Department of the Interior reversed its position and asked for the \nrule to be overturned.\n  Issuance of the rule represents the culmination of a 7-year process \nthat was complete and well thought out. While developing the rule, the \nOffice of Surface Mining solicited public input and received over \n43,000 comments on the proposal.\n  They held four public hearings that were attended by over 700 people. \nWhen considering alternatives to the proposed rule in the Environmental \nImpact Statement, OSM selected the most environmentally protective \noption. It helps ensure that coal mining activities are conducted in a \nmanner that protects both mining communities and the environment. \nOverturning this rule risks returning to a state of confusion about how \nto apply the surface mining law, risking the future of mining \noperations, local communities, and ultimately access to our most \nreliable domestic source of energy.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, over 24,000 jobs are at risk should \nsurface mining operations be disrupted. I repeat that. Over 24,000 jobs \nare at risk should surface mining operations be disrupted. This is \nabout half the jobs at risk for the region of Kentucky, Tennessee, West \nVirginia, and Virginia.\n  I am very disappointed that the Department of Interior, under the \nleadership of both Secretary Salazar and Mr. Strickland, chose to \noverturn this rule. Not only will it delay coal mining operations, but \nit will also jeopardize jobs and energy production. That is why I find \nmyself on the floor unable to support this nominee today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a good day for those of us who \nwant to see this environment protected because we have before us an \nexcellent nominee, Thomas Strickland, to be Assistant Secretary of the \nInterior for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. Many of us know Tom, and we \nknow he has the experience and the expertise to be an exceptional--an \nexceptional--Assistant Secretary of the Interior.\n  He has an outstanding record of service in the public sector. In the \n1980s, he was then-Colorado Governor Richard Lamm's chief policy \nadviser, and he had extensive experience dealing with the Interior \nDepartment and Federal agencies on all natural resource issues.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I think, as my colleague knows so \nwell, one-third of Colorado is in Federal lands, and the actions taken \nby the Federal Government in Washington have a profound impact on the \nState. So Tom's experience with public lands issues from that State's \npoint of view will give him a valuable perspective as he works with \nState and local governments to make sure their needs are being met, \ntheir voices are being heard. The people of America can be comfortable \nin that because Tom comes to\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nthis work very much through a State lens.\n  From 1985 to 1989, Tom was the head of the Colorado Transportation \nCommission, and he served as U.S. attorney for Colorado from 1999 to \n2001.\n  On a personal level, Tom Strickland has a passion for the outdoors, \nand he has a commitment to public lands. All of us know that when we \nthink about America, we think about our Constitution and we think about \nhow proud we are of the freedoms we have. We also think about ``from \nsea to shining sea.'' We think about this amazing--amazing--gift we \nhave been given. We must protect the environment, the parks, the \nrivers, the marshlands, the streams, the wildlife that rely on these \nassets. So in Tom Strickland, we have someone who gets it all. He \nunderstands the need to preserve our magnificent parks and open spaces, \nbut for the benefit of the people.\n  In the late 1980s and 1990s, he led an initiative called Great \nOutdoors Colorado which directed State lottery moneys to the \nacquisition of public lands for parks, open space, and conservation. \nThis great achievement has left Colorado with a lasting legacy of \npublic lands for future generations--with $600 million invested and \n600,000 acres protected in State parks, open space, and wildlife.\n  Mr. President, a lot of times you will hear people say: Well, there \nis too much land--too much land--in open space. There is too much land \nthat has been conserved. A lot of our friends on the other side of the \naisle sometimes express that view. But what I want to tell them here \ntoday is, from my own experience in my own State--and I am sure our \nPresiding Officer, who is sitting in the chair, would corroborate \nthis--the beauty we have in our States is a magnet for tourism, which \nis one of the largest businesses we have in the West and, frankly, \nthroughout our Nation. People want to come and not look at congested \nhighways. That is not why they come. They do not come to America to \nsee, frankly, offshore oil rigs. They come to America to see the \nbeauty--this God-given beauty of our Nation. I think Tom Strickland \ntotally gets that.\n  We certainly do live in a nation that is blessed with magnificent \nparks and spectacular wildlife refuges in all 50 States. In my own \nState--and I can tell you, people come from far and wide to see the \nwildlife refuges in San Francisco Bay and San Diego and our national \nparklands such as the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes \nNational Seashore, and Yosemite National Park. I will tell you, Mr. \nPresident, the first time I stepped onto the parklands at Yosemite, I \nwas awestruck. And all of you know I am not usually at a loss for \nwords. But I was. I was overwhelmed with God's gift. We just need to \nappreciate this, and we need people in places of authority who \nappreciate this and who do get the connection between a clean and \nhealthy environment and the physical health of our people; between a \nbeautiful, clean, healthy environment and tourism and recreation and \nfishing and all the things that add so much value--dollar value and \nalso just value to the spirit and value to the soul.\n  Today, our parks and our refuges are threatened by budget shortfalls, \nmaintenance backlogs, and other impacts. Because of the Endangered \nSpecies Act, we have saved some of America's iconic species, including \nthe bald eagle. But there is much more to be done.\n  Over 300 Fish and Wildlife Service positions have been eliminated \nsince 2004. Funding shortfalls have limited public access. What is the \npoint of all this beauty if the public cannot get access because we are \nso stressed in our budget? We have had reduced law enforcement in the \nparks, and we have seen threatened wildlife. Recent funding in the \nPresident's stimulus bill that we passed here will help to address some \nof the immediate needs, and I am so pleased about that. But a long-term \nsolution is needed. If I can say, the long-term solution to this lack \nof interest in the last 8 years in our resources--this neglect of our \nresources--the first step, it seems to me--we will say the second step \nbecause the stimulus package was the first step--the second step is \nputting someone in charge of these treasures who really gets it, who \nreally understands.\n  When Mr. Strickland came before our Environment Committee, he \nimpressed me with his understanding of these challenges, and he made a \ncommitment to address them.\n  During his nomination hearing, he pledged to uphold the commitment \nmade by President Obama to restore scientific integrity by being--and I \nquote him--``open and honest with the American people about the science \nbehind our decisions.'' Those are his words. So he is not coming there \nto just wake up one morning and say: Oh, I think I want to save this \nparticular species because I like it. He is going to come there and \ntalk to the scientists and make sure we are doing all we can to \npreserve and protect our heritage at the time when we have to take \naction because the scientists have pointed the way.\n  Tom Strickland's nomination enjoyed strong support in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I believe he is an excellent choice to \nprovide the strong leadership we need so we can oversee our unique and \nirreplaceable treasures.\n  Sometimes when I need inspiration I read from different religions, \nand one of the quotes I read was written by a rabbi in the eighth \ncentury. I am not quoting it exactly, but the paraphrase is this--it is \nGod saying: Please respect what I have given you because once you ruin \nit, it cannot be replaced. That is the essence of it. So it is not as \nif we have a do-over. If we lose these incredible assets--whether it is \nan endangered species such as the bald eagle or we lose the beauty of a \nclean-running stream because coal ash just leaked and covered it all up \nand there is no more stream--you really cannot get in there and do \nanything about it.\n  So we need someone like Tom Strickland who has the experience--who \nhas the pragmatic experience to seek that balance we need, that balance \nall of us need in this society between, yes, clean, sustainable \ndevelopment, but also sustaining the magnificent open spaces that, \nfrankly, people who came before us--and as I look at the Presiding \nOfficer, it is a very moving moment because we think of Congressman \nUdall, whom I worked with, who did so much to teach us about our \nobligation. Now we have two Senators Udall. What a spectacular thing \nthat is.\n\n  I think Tom Strickland comes before us today from Colorado with this \nbackground that we need to say: Thank you, Tom, for running--not give \nhim a hard time about confirming him. This should be an overwhelming \nthank-you. Tom Strickland, thank you for doing it. Thank you for \nworking so hard. Thank you for putting your name out there. Yes, you \ntake the hits, but today I think you are going to get the votes. I am \ngoing to get down there in the well and make sure Tom Strickland is, in \nfact, confirmed.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Thomas L. Strickland, to be Assistant Secretary for Fish \nand Wildlife and Parks at the Department of Interior.\n  Secretary Salazar and Thomas L. Strickland are both legendary \nColorado public figures in their own rights, and I cannot think of any \ntwo people better qualified to provide leadership in the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  Thomas L. Strickland was born and raised in Texas and later attended \nLouisiana State University, where he played football. He earned a J.D., \nwith honors, from the University of Texas in 1977.\n  Early in Strickland's career, he worked for Colorado Governor Dick \nLamm, and later became Lamm's director of policy and research. In \nColorado, such a prestigious statewide policy position requires one to \nbe well-versed in important issues affecting the West, and impacting \npublic lands and water. In 1984, Strickland accepted a position at \nBrownstein, Hyatt & Farber, where he eventually became partner.\n  Strickland was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in both \n1996 and 2002, but the seat eluded him, and though he lost both times \nto Senator Wayne Allard, Tom became well known throughout our State and \nhe is extremely well liked and respected on both sides of Colorado's \naisle.\n  After the 1996 campaign, Tom returned to his law practice.\n  In 1999, President Clinton appointed him U.S. attorney for Colorado. \nHe assumed office the day after the Columbine High School massacre and\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nworked to enforce existing gun laws in the wake of that horrible \ndisaster. He was cognizant of how important gun rights interests are, \nbut at the same time, he firmly believed in enforcing gun laws and \npreserving school safety. He worked with Federal and local prosecutors \nto bring gun charges under State or Federal laws, whichever were most \nstringent.\n  Strickland also worked with the Hogan & Hartson law firm, serving as, \nmanaging partner for the firm's Colorado offices, and was a member of \nHogan & Hartson's executive committee.\n  I was pleased when I first heard that President Obama and Secretary \nSalazar wished to make Tom such an integral part of their team. As a \nchief advise on fish, wildlife and parks issues, I know Tom will be a \nvital asset to my dear friend and predecessor Ken Salazar, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of his nomination.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and \nWildlife and Parks is one of the principal offices in the Department of \nthe Interior. He is responsible for overseeing both the Fish and \nWildlife Service and the National Park Service. The Fish and Wildlife \nService manages 550 national wildlife refuges, encompassing more than \n150 million acres of land. The National Park Service manages several \nhundred national parks, monuments, battlefields, landmarks, seashores, \ntrails, and rivers, encompassing 84 million acres. By any measure, the \nAssistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks is an important \noffice, which needs to be filled by a talented and capable individual.\n  President Obama has made an excellent choice in nominating Thomas \nStrickland for this important post. Mr. Strickland is a lawyer by \ntraining. He is a graduate of the University of Texas Law School and \nclerked for a Federal district judge in Houston. He practiced law in \nDenver and served as Governor Richard Lamm's chief policy adviser. He \nchaired Colorado's Transportation Commission. Ten years ago, President \nClinton nominated him, and the Senate confirmed him, as the U.S. \nattorney for Colorado. He ran for the Senate, twice, unsuccessfully, in \n1996 and 2002. He was the managing partner of the Denver office of the \nlaw firm of Hogan and Hartson and later the executive vice president \nand chief legal officer of the United Health Group. Since January, he \nhas served as Secretary Salazar's chief of staff at the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  Over the course of this long and distinguished career, Mr. Strickland \nhas dealt frequently and extensively with environmental and natural \nresource issues. Along with Secretary Salazar, Mr. Strickland was one \nof the founders of the Great Outdoors Colorado Program, which has \ninvested $600 million of State lottery money to protect 600,000 acres \nof state parks, wildlife habitat, and open space in Colorado since it \nwas founded in 1993.\n  Because the portfolio of the Assistant Secretary of Fish and Wildlife \nand Parks bridges the jurisdiction of both the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nour two committees share jurisdiction over Mr. Strickland's nomination.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on his \nnomination over a month ago, on March 24, and favorably reported the \nnomination to the Senate on March 31.\n  One hundred days into the Obama administration, Secretary Salazar \nremains the only Interior Department official confirmed by the Senate. \nThe work of the Interior Department is too important and too demanding \nfor one individual. The President has nominated a superbly qualified \nperson for the position of Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife \nand Parks. I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Mr. Strickland for \nthis important post.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nTom Strickland--and to raise concerns about recent actions taken by the \nDepartment of Interior relating to the Endangered Species Act.\n  As Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks at the \nDepartment of Interior, this position is responsible for overseeing \nmany important programs. Most notable to me as ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, are the management of the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Services and the implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  When Mr. Strickland came before our committee for a hearing on his \nnomination in March, Congress had just passed the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that contained a mandate to revise and reissue ESA \nrules concerning the listing of the polar bear and modifications to the \nsection 7 consultation process. This action allowed the Departments of \nCommerce and Interior to reverse rules without the usual requirements \nfor public input and allowances for legal objections under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Now today, as we debate the nomination of Mr. Strickland on the \nfloor, the administration has already reversed the section 7 \nconsultation rule in complete disregard of the APA and is poised to \nreverse both rules without the usual review process promised by \nPresident Obama's commitment to transparency and public process. \nUnfortunately, Congress and the administration's bold decision to \nwillfully set aside rules protecting public input and transparency are \nin direct contrast to the majority's constant complaints to the last \nadministration about the lack of process. Moreover, the revision of \nthese rules was done without respect to a bipartisan letter to the \nDepartment of Commerce that I signed with Senators Murkowski, Begich, \nand Hutchison urging the use of an open process complying with the APA \nand all laws governing the withdrawal of Federal regulations.\n  What troubles me further is the potential use of the Endangered \nSpecies Act as a tool to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. While some \nenvironmentalists would love to see the ESA used to regulate greenhouse \ngases, the ESA was never intended to set a climate change policy, but \nrather it is a tool only to protect endangered species. However, the \nlisting of the polar bear last year as a threatened species has opened \nthe door to the possible use of the ESA for disastrous carbon controls. \nThat is why in December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service jointly adopted a final rule that \nrevises the regulations governing the consultation obligations of \nfederal agencies under section 7 of the ESA and regulations providing \nfor protections against the ``take'' of the polar bear. These rules \nwere adopted through the normal rulemaking process and took into \nconsideration nearly 235,000 public comments.\n  Under the ESA, a Federal action agency is required to initiate \nconsultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine \nFisheries Service if it determines that the effects of its action are \nanticipated to result in the ``take''--including potential harm--of any \nlisted species, or the destruction or adverse modification of \ndesignated critical habitat. This includes actions the agency takes \nitself, actions that are federally funded, as well as the issuance of a \nFederal permit or license for a private party.\n  A key element of the final section 7 rule is its conclusion that it \n``is not an appropriate or effective mechanism to assess individual \nFederal actions as they relate to global issues such as global climate \nchange and global warming.'' The final rule then exempts from \nconsultation actions which are ``manifested through global processes \nand (i) cannot be reliably predicted or measured at the scale of a \nlisted species' current range, or (ii) would result at most in an \nextremely small, insignificant impact on a listed species or critical \nhabitat, or (iii) are such that the potential risk of harm to a listed \nspecies or critical habitat is remote.''\n  Likewise, the final 4(d) rule for the polar bear provides that \ncertain activities do not constitute a prohibited ``take'' of the polar \nbear. Specifically, the final rule states that the take prohibition \ndoes not apply to any incidental taking of polar bears within the \nUnited States, except for incidental taking caused by activities within \nthe polar bear's current range. Like the section 7 rule, the preamble \nto the final 4(d) rule maintains that ``[t]here is currently no way to \ndetermine how the emissions from a specific action both influence \nclimate change and then subsequently affect listed species, including \npolar bears.'' Accordingly, the preamble to the final rule provides \nthat section 7 consultation is not required solely because a Federal \naction's greenhouse gas emissions may contribute to global climate \nchange.\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n  In regards to Assistant Secretary Designate Strickland, I am happy he \nstated in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that he does not believe the ESA was intended or \ndesigned to regulate greenhouse gases or climate change. However, in \nhis response to questions submitted by me after his confirmation \nhearing in the EPW Committee, I am troubled that Mr. Strickland did not \nfully address if he would set aside the APA or ensure an open public \nprocess in regards to revising the polar bear and consultation rules. \nIt is my hope, that if confirmed by the Senate today, that Mr. \nStrickland will allow for the transparency and open public process \nexpected of our government in reviewing the polar bear rule.\n  I plan on voting to confirm Mr. Strickland today to become the next \nAssistant Secretary at the Department of Interior. The Fish and \nWildlife Service does a great deal of good, and I believe that Tom \nStrickland will do a good job, but I urge him to heed the call for an \nopen and transparent governing process and to use the Endangered \nSpecies Act only for what it was created to do: to protect endangered \nspecies, not regulate greenhouse gases.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we can have this vote shortly. At \nthis time I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ndivided equally during the quorum calls between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no one knows the man about whom I am going \nto speak better than the Presiding Officer, but I wish to talk about \nTom Strickland. I can say without reservation or hesitation that Tom \nStrickland is a good friend and a tremendous public servant. He will be \na great Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. That is a \nfancy name. Basically, what he will be is Ken Salazar's chief of staff. \nKen Salazar depends on him and will depend on him even more after his \nconfirmation.\n  Tom Strickland went to college at Louisiana State University where he \nwas a football player--quite a good athlete--before returning to his \nnative Texas to study law. He graduated from the University of Texas \nLaw School with honors and went to work for the Governor of Colorado.\n  As Governor Lamm's chief policy adviser in a State where protecting \nnatural resources is a top priority, Tom Strickland worked often with \nthe Interior Department he will now help lead.\n  Even after Tom joined the private sector, he continued to advance \nmany environmental and natural resources issues on a voluntary basis. \nHe is especially proud of helping to create the Great Outdoors Colorado \nProgram which has protected hundreds of thousands of acres of \nColorado's beautiful wilderness and wildlife.\n  Tom is a well-known and successful lawyer in Colorado. President \nClinton appointed Tom to be a U.S. attorney for Colorado in 1999. In a \nturn of events no one could have anticipated, he was sworn in the day \nafter the terrible tragedy at Columbine High School just outside \nDenver. The 10th anniversary was observed with sadness just last week.\n  Tom Strickland has been a managing partner of an internationally \nrespected law firm and the executive vice president of a major health \ncare company. He has been very successful personally. He accumulated \nsome wealth, but because of his belief in public service, he accepted \nhis friend Ken Salazar's call for assistance to become part of the \nObama administration. I admire his willingness to leave behind the \nlifestyle he has acquired to serve his country once again.\n  Tom's hometown newspapers called him tough and effective. He will \ncertainly be both of those as Secretary Salazar's right-hand man in the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Tom Strickland is a strong environmentalist who understands the \nimportance of investing in renewable energy and making America more \nenergy efficient. He also appreciates our environment for its many \nsplendors. Tom and his wife, Beth, are well on their way to achieving a \ngoal they set to visit every national park in America.\n  It is fitting that someone with such a great appreciation for our \nNation's natural wonders will be responsible for protecting and \nimproving America's National Park Service.\n  Once Tom Strickland is confirmed, our country will be in a better \nplace.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, today, I rise to support the \nconfirmation of fellow Coloradan, Tom Strickland, to be the next \nAssistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks for the Department \nof the Interior.\n  As chairman of the National Parks subcommittee, I am particularly \npleased to support the nomination of Tom Strickland for Assistant \nSecretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, because he has had a long \nhistory of activism on behalf of protecting national an State parks.\n  You will excuse me for indulging in a bit of home State pride when I \nsay how great it has been to see so many Coloradans going to work for \nthe Department in the Federal Government that has so much influence on \nthe economic life of the West.\n  I think it speaks highly of the motivational leadership of both \nSecretary Salazar and this nominee to be the Assistant Secretary for \nFish and Wildlife and Parks, Tom Strickland, that so many of their \nfellow Coloradans have voluntarily left the best State in the Union to \nwork in Washington.\n  I know that Tom Strickland will be an excellent Assistant Secretary \nat the Interior.\n  He has an exceptional track record of leadership both as an attorney, \nas a businessman, as a civic leader and as someone dedicated to public \nservice. He also has an extraordinary wife, Beth, who is inspirational \nin her own right.\n  Before coming to Interior, Tom worked in both the public and private \nsectors.\n  He served as U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado from 1999 \nthrough 2001, and has been a partner at several law firms, including \nHogan & Hartson in Colorado.\n  From 1982 to 1984 he served as the chief policy adviser for Colorado \nGovernor Richard D. Lamm, advising the Governor on all policy and \nintergovernmental issues, and from 1985 to 1989, he served on, and \nchaired, the Colorado Transportation Commission.\n  Tom graduated, with honors, from Louisiana State University, where he \nwas an All-SEC Academic Football Selection, and he received his J.D., \nwith honors, from the University of Texas School of Law.\n  I think it is clear that I have known Tom Strickland over many years.\n  Our work together has largely been in the public arena, where Tom--\nworking with Secretary Ken Salazar--led efforts in Colorado to pass the \nhistoric ``Great Outdoors Colorado'' program, which dedicates State \nlottery money to the acquisition of public lands for parks, open space \nand conservation.\n  Tom is also an accomplished outdoorsman, and while we haven't climbed \nmountains together--at least not the 14,000 foot kind--we both have a \nlove for the out-of-doors and the history, people, and landscapes of \nthe West.\n  I think this love for the land is what motivated Tom to public \nservice in the\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nfirst place, and sustained his two courageous runs for the U.S. Senate.\n  I was struck, as I often am, by a comment in a recent Tom Friedman's \ncolumn. Mr. Friedman reminded us of the value of ``inspirational \nleadership.''\n  Mr. Friedman quoted Dov Seidman, the author of the book ``How'' on \nwhat makes an organization sustainable:\n\n       Laws tell you what you can do. Values inspire in you what \n     you should do. It's a leader's job to inspire in us those \n     values.\n\n  I mention this because I know that, as the Assistant Secretary for \nFish and Wildlife and Parks, Tom's job will demand both enforcement of \nimportant rules, regulations and laws, and inspired, collaborative \nleadership.\n  As one of the country's most successful lawyers, Tom will know how to \nenforce environmental laws. As a man who draws inspiration from our \nmountains, plains and waters, he also knows how to motivate and lead \nothers.\n  With Secretary Salazar at the helm, I believe Tom Strickland will be \na strong and effective partner.\n  As I conclude, I urge all my colleagues to support the confirmation \nof Tom Strickland this afternoon. There is no question he will do us \nproud in this new role he is so eager to assume.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate time be \nyielded back and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination \nof Thomas Strickland, with all other provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas L. Strickland, of Colorado, to be Assistant Secretary for \nFish and Wildlife? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Sessions), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the Senator from \nNevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), and the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        immigration enforcement\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, sometimes change comes quietly. \nSometimes it comes with a big bang. Today change came quietly. I want \nto make sure everyone realizes the change that occurred.\n  For 3 years I have been talking about the problem of illegal \nimmigration and what has caused this problem to flourish. I have been \ntalking about the problem of the magnet of jobs that has drawn people \nover the border without documentation because they are trying to feed \ntheir families and the fact that no one was doing anything about \nemployer enforcement.\n  When I got to Washington and I asked the head of immigration \nenforcement how many employers have been held accountable for knowingly \nhiring illegal immigrants, how many have been arrested, she could not \neven tell me. They didn't even keep the statistics. Think about that \nfor a minute. They didn't keep the statistics of how many employers \nwere held accountable for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. I began \npounding on immigration and customs enforcement about this, talking to \nthem about basic investigative techniques.\n  In Missouri right now there are hundreds of employers that are \nbreaking the rules knowingly. They are hiring people, paying them under \nthe table, cash on Fridays. They are bringing pickup trucks from Mexico \nfull of people, stuffing them all in an apartment. The vast majority of \nthe business people are doing it right. They are trying to play by the \nrules, doing the very best job they can. But there is a chunk of \nemployers out there that knew they were not going to get caught, knew \nnobody cared if they did, and they knowingly violated the law.\n  I asked the new head of immigration enforcement if that was going to \nchange. I asked the new Secretary of Homeland Security if that was \ngoing to change. Today they announced a new policy. Finally, they have \na set of guidelines going to everyone in the country about how we are \ngoing to prioritize going after those employers that knowingly hire \nillegal immigrants. We finally are going to get to the magnet. This is \na crime we can deter.\n  If you think somebody is going to put you in jail for saying: Hey, I \ndidn't care if you have papers or not, I can pay you cheaper; work you \nharder. I don't care if you are illegal or not; I don't want to know. \nIn fact, bring your friends--if you don't think those people being held \naccountable is going to make a difference, then you don't understand \nlaw enforcement.\n  Today I am proud to say change came. The new guidelines require that, \nin fact, instead of working off tips, they are now going to embrace \nbasic investigation. They will use undercover. They will use \ninformants. They will use all kinds of documentation they can look at \nin terms of paper documentation. They will enlist the support and \ncooperation, ahead of workplace enforcement, of local law enforcement \nagencies, including the Justice Department. They have decided it is a \nnew day in immigration enforcement and that we will get at the root of \nthe problem.\n  I support E-Verify and I support giving employers all the tools we \ncan to do the best job they can in hiring legal workers. But for those \nemployers that don't care, that are doing it on purpose and knowingly \ndoing it, we need to come down on them and come down hard.\n  This administration has figured it out. I congratulate the Secretary \nof\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nHomeland Security for these new policies. I stand in full support, and \nI know most of my colleagues do also. We finally will do something \nabout illegal immigration when we shut down the magnet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me inquire, Madam President, if I may, of my colleague: \nDo you want to offer the amendment at this juncture or do you want to \nmake some comments on it?\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I do not want to make any comments. I \njust want to call it up.\n  Mr. DODD. Why not go ahead and do that.\n  Mr. CORKER. OK. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1019 To Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1019 to amendment No. 1018.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To address safe harbor for certain servicers)\n\n       On page 17, strike line 1 and all that follows through page \n     18, line 4 and insert the following:\n       ``(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to \n     investors or other parties to maximize the net present value \n     of such mortgages, the duty shall be construed to apply to \n     all such investors or group of investors; and\n       ``(2) the servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied the \n     duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, before December 31, 2012, \n     the servicer implements a qualified loss mitigation plan that \n     meets the following criteria:\n       ``(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has occurred, \n     is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as such terms are \n     defined by guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization \n     Act of 2008.\n       ``(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing the \n     mortgage as his or her principal residence.\n       ``(C) The servicer reasonably determined, in good faith, \n     consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury or his designee, that the application of such \n     qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of \n     mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the \n     outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the \n     anticipated recovery through foreclosures or other \n     resolution.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. Let \nme--since we are across the room from each other--invite you and your \nstaff to meet with our staff and talk about the amendment since we are \nnot sure what it is. But let's see if we can reach some accommodation.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I have a sense the merits of this \namendment are so great that it will be accepted universally.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would expect nothing less from the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me first of all thank our colleague \nfrom Illinois. I know he did not prevail in his amendment dealing with \nthe bankruptcy provisions, but I commend him for his efforts over the \nlast number of weeks, I know in serious negotiations with others, to \ntry to achieve an accommodation. That did not happen. I regret that was \nthe case because I think that was one meaningful way to try to avoid \nsome of the foreclosure problems we see in the country. So I am sorry \nthat did not prevail.\n  Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes, if I may, briefly \ndescribing the substitute amendment I have offered on behalf of myself \nand Senator Shelby that is before us and will be now open for \namendment--as the Senator from Tennessee has his amendment, and I know \nmy colleague from Louisiana also has at least one--maybe two \namendments--to offer on this bill as well.\n  Let me say to others, we would urge, if you have amendments, to let \nus know what they are. I also say to my colleagues this is a bill that, \nwhile it is going to be helpful to consumers and helpful to homeowners \nin trying to deal with the underlying problems, it is being sought \nafter primarily by the financial institutions, the banks across the \ncountry, dealing with the FDIC, the insurance limits, among other \nmatters. So it is very important to them, and Senator Shelby and I \nrecently worked this out to move forward.\n  But I want to say to my colleagues, there were other matters that are \nimportant as well. If this gets bogged down for days on end, the leader \nhas indicated to me he will pull this bill down and we will maybe deal \nwith it next fall. So to those out there who have an interest in what \nwe have worked on here, I urge them to communicate with people that it \nis important we try to get this done fairly quickly.\n  We spent a lot of time on it. I think it is a good bill. It is a \nbalanced bill. Senator Shelby and I worked hard on these matters with \nour committee members. So this substitute is bipartisan, and we hope \nour colleagues will respect that and let this not become a vehicle for \nan awful lot of other issues for which I do not question the \nmotivations or the sincerity of those who might offer amendments, but \nthis is not going to become a vehicle for all these other ideas that do \nnot relate to the underlying purpose of this bill.\n  As we all know, and I have mentioned before, we have a staggering \nnumber of foreclosures in the country. Some 9,000 to 10,000 homeowners, \nbefore this evening is out, will receive a default or action notice. If \ncurrent trends continue, two-thirds of those people will lose their \nhome. So of the 10,000 today who will receive that default or action \nnotice, two-thirds of them will probably lose their home unless some \naction is taken. In all, some 3.4 million homes are expected to go into \nforeclosure this year alone--between 8 and 12 million homeowners over \nthe next several years. Those are breathtaking numbers when you \nconsider the damage to families, to neighborhoods, and to communities \nacross our Nation.\n  According to industry figures, by the end of last year, 20 percent of \nall mortgage loans were already under water--1 in 5--that is, the cost \nof the mortgage exceeded the value of the home. Those are stunning \nnumbers: One out of every five homeowners owed more on their mortgage \nthan the home was worth.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, the problem is very serious and \nspreading. The Center for Responsible Lending projects that some 17,000 \nhomes in my State of Connecticut will go into foreclosure in 2009--\nnearly 60,000 over the next 4 years.\n  I recently invited HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan to my State. We \nvisited Bridgeport, CT, which alone has some 5,200 subprime mortgages--\nmany already in foreclosure. Joan Carty, the CEO of the Housing \nDevelopment Fund, a housing nonprofit group in Bridgeport, CT, showed \nthe Secretary and me a series of maps of the city of Bridgeport. She \nhad in those maps the locations of each subprime loan and each \nforeclosure. It literally looked like a cancer spreading across the \nbody politic of that city.\n  We visited New Haven, CT, where we saw how property values for homes \nlocated within an eighth of a mile of a foreclosed home dropped by an \naverage of $5,000 the day of that action or default. And as we saw \nacross Hartford, CT, where home prices have sunk almost 8 percent in \nthe last year alone, it does not take long before the epidemic affects \nwhole cities.\n  In fact, this crisis could even result in a net loss in home \nownership rates for African Americans, wiping out a generation of hard \nwork and gains in wealth.\n  The people I have met who are losing their homes are not statistics. \nThey are grandmothers on fixed incomes who trusted a mortgage broker \nwho put them in adjustable rate mortgages with exploding payments. \nTheir incomes were not going to ever adjust to a level where they could \nafford the fully indexed price of that mortgage. But their mortgages \nadjusted, and the brokers knew these borrowers were headed for trouble.\n  I have met working parents who lost a job or are facing a health care \ncrisis. Fifty percent of the foreclosures are related to a health care \ncrisis in that family--not acquiring an automobile\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nyou cannot afford or a big-screen television, as some have been \nsuggesting. Fifty percent are related to a health care crisis. One \nvictim of predatory lending I met in Hartford, CT, tests children for \nlead poisoning for a living.\n  These are good people, decent Americans, many of whom were taken \nadvantage of, often by deceptive practices. In fact, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that 61 percent of those in subprime mortgages could \nhave qualified for prime mortgages but were urged or pushed into \nriskier mortgages by lenders and brokers who knew better. Why did they \ndo so? Because those brokers and lenders made more money by putting \nthese unsuspecting borrowers into riskier, higher priced mortgages.\n  So we have an obligation, I think as a body, to do everything we can \nto get this right. That is not to excuse irresponsible behavior. I am \nnot suggesting such. But in matter after matter, this was not a matter \nof irresponsibility; it was either deceptive practices or conditions \nwhich forced a family--through a job loss or a health care crisis or \nothers--to be put at risk of losing their home. This effort is to get \nthis right not only for the families but even, in a larger sense, for \nthe economy as a whole, which hinges on our ability to put a stop to \nthese foreclosures.\n  Protecting families and our economy was what motivated me 2 years \nago--this month, in fact--when I convened a Homeowners Preservation \nSummit, at which leaders and servicers agreed to a set of principles. \nThis was in the spring of 2007, 2 years ago. We met, and they committed \nthemselves to a series of principles to making their best efforts to \nreduce foreclosures through loan modifications.\n  To say there was a total failure by the industry to follow through on \nthat agreement would be a vast understatement.\n  Thankfully, even if lenders, servicers, and the previous \nadministration failed to understand the magnitude or the severity of \nthe crisis and the obligation to act, there has been no such problem \nwith the current administration, I am pleased to report. In putting \nforward a $275 billion plan, the Obama administration clearly \nunderstands that we cannot get our economy back on track until we stop \nthe tidal wave of foreclosures sweeping across our country.\n  The underlying legislation Senator Shelby and I have offered gives \nthem the tools to do that as effectively as possible by expanding the \nability of FHA, the Federal Housing Administration, and Rural Housing--\nand I have mentioned cities. But I want to point out, rural housing is \nalso suffering from foreclosures; this is not just an urban problem. \nThis affects rural States. I know the Presiding Officer and my friend \nfrom Louisiana will testify to this: In their rural communities, \nforeclosures are not limited to the larger cities in their States but \nit also affects rural people as well. That point needs to be made.\n\n  The underlying legislation gives them the tools to do that as \neffectively as possible by expanding the ability of FHA and Rural \nHousing to do loan modifications, by creating more enforcement tools \nfor FHA, the Federal Housing Administration, to drop lenders who break \nFHA rules, by expanding access to the HOPE for Homeowners Program, and \nby providing safe harbor for servicers who modify a loan consistent \nwith the Obama plan or refinance a borrower into a HOPE for Homeowners \nloan.\n  It is disheartening that even as more and more homeowners have fallen \nbehind on their loans, the response of loan servicers has been so \ninadequate. We have heard over and over that the reason servicers are \nhesitant to use the tools we have given them is that they fear they \nwill be sued for violating pooling and servicing agreements.\n  You would think that from an investor's point of view, reduced \ninterest payments from modified loans would be better than no interest \npayments from defaulted loans. Unfortunately, you would be wrong in \nthat. The mortgage-backed securities market in which so many of these \nloans are tied up is--not to put too fine a point on it--a mess. These \nmortgages have been sliced and diced into thousands of pieces, with \nsecurities sold off to different investors all over the globe. These \ninvestors have different interests in the loan pools--some rated \ntriple-A, others have more risky segments. Untangling this complex mess \nof competing interests has been nearly impossible. One direct solution \nto this problem would have been the bankruptcy amendment offered by \nSenator Durbin. That failed.\n  Another, which we provide for in this amendment, is to make \nmodifications more likely by ensuring that servicers who provide \nmodifications consistent with the administration's plan get the benefit \nof safe harbor from needless lawsuits.\n  Our colleague from Florida, Mel Martinez, is the author of this \nprovision. This, again, is a bipartisan proposal. Senator Martinez, I \nthink, will come to the floor and address the issue in greater detail. \nSenator Martinez is a former Secretary of HUD under the Bush \nadministration and brings a wealth of knowledge to these debates and \ndiscussions. It was his contribution on the safe harbor provision which \ncaused it to be included in this legislation.\n  Another provision, which we provide for in this amendment Senator \nShelby and I have offered, is to make modifications more likely by \nensuring that servicers who provide modifications, consistent with the \nadministration's plan, get the benefit of safe harbor from needless \nlawsuits. I mentioned that. To ensure more servicers take advantage of \nthe HOPE for Homeowners legislation we created last summer, those \nrefinances are covered as well. Indeed, the legislation also \nstreamlines the HOPE for Homeowners program. My colleagues will recall \nwe adopted that last summer. We all hoped it would be a great source of \nmodification for these mortgages. And, candidly, it ended up being a \nlot less than we hoped for. As the author of those provisions, it was a \ncomplicated proposal. There were a lot of fingerprints on it to try to \nget it out of the Congress. Unfortunately, I think we made it far more \ncomplicated than we needed to.\n  Our bill today is designed to streamline that program and to make it \nmore workable for families across the country. The truth is, despite \nthe efforts of Senator Shelby, myself, and others, the HOPE program has \nnot worked to date--in large part because of servicers' steadfast \nrefusal to accept reasonable settlements for second mortgages, which \nbelong to about half of all at-risk mortgage holders.\n  This is a problem the administration recognizes, with its recently \nannounced Second Lien Program, which will make it easier for borrowers \nto modify or refinance their loans under the HOPE for Homeowners \nprogram.\n  With this legislation, we make the program far more user-friendly for \nborrowers and servicers alike by lowering fees and streamlining \nborrower certification requirements. In addition, we allow for \nincentive payments to servicers and originators to participate in the \nprogram, while giving the HUD Secretary limited discretion to determine \nwho reaps the benefits of any future appreciation on that home.\n  For all these reasons, it is time for the banks, I believe, to step \nto the plate.\n  Consider for a moment all that we are doing to prevent foreclosures \nand restart lending in this legislation alone, this substitute.\n  As I said, we are offering banks a safe harbor to do modifications \nand refinancing.\n  To free up credit, we increase permanent borrowing authority for the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union \nAdministration to $100 billion and $6 billion respectively. On a \ntemporary basis, we increase that authority to five times those \namounts. Chairman Sheila Bair has said those levels will allow the FDIC \nto reduce the special assessments on banks by as much as 50 percent, \nmaking credit more available in our communities. According to the \nIndependent Community Bankers Association, which strongly supports this \nlegislation--and I thank them for it--this will increase lending by \nsome $75 billion.\n  In addition, Senator Shelby and I extend for 4 years--to December 31, \n2013--the increase in deposit insurance limits from $100,000 to \n$250,000. We initially did this in the Emergency Economic Stabilization \nAct. However, in that legislation we increased the limit only through \nthis year.\n  For 75 years, deposit insurance has been a stabilizing force during \nsome of\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nour Nation's most troubling economic times. This increase will prove \nespecially helpful for smaller financial institutions today, \nparticularly our community banks across the country, which derive 85 to \n90 percent of their funding from deposits.\n  The increase from $100,000 to $250,000 goes a long way toward \neliminating uncertainty in the system. If you are planning for your \nretirement and buy a 3-year certificate of deposit at a bank for \n$150,000, you want to know your investment will be safe after 2009 \ncomes to a close. This is to say nothing of the many other programs and \ncapital injections already in place to protect and sustain them in our \ncredit markets.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to commend our majority \nleader, Senator Harry Reid, for a very important contribution he has \nmade to this legislation. Section 103 of this bill authorizes an \nadditional $127.5 million, on top of other amounts that may be \nauthorized, for foreclosure counseling and outreach efforts targeted to \nthe areas that are the hardest hit by foreclosures. In addition, the \nprovision provides for funding to increase public awareness such as \nthrough advertising, including Spanish language advertising, to try to \nsteer people away from foreclosure and other financial scams that \nproliferate in hard times such as these.\n  Ultimately, this legislation by itself, of course, will not turn this \nNation's economy around, but it will be a contribution, and a positive \none, both to a healthier banking system and, more importantly, to more \nstable home ownership. There is no silver bullet--I know my colleagues \nknow that--when it comes to solving our financial crisis, but each step \nsuch as this that we take brings us closer to seeing this come to an \nend, these most troubling economic times for our country. So by \nproviding additional stability and certainty within the banking system, \nby providing assurances and help in rural housing as well as urban \nhousing, by providing additional support for these efforts with the \nHOPE for Homeowners Act, this legislation goes a long way to \ncontributing to that stability and that certainty.\n  Again, I am very pleased to have as my partner in this, as we have on \nmany occasions, my colleague from Alabama, the former chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Richard Shelby, along with the members of my \ncommittee who have worked very hard on these matters as well. As I said \nat the outset, I regret the Durbin amendment is not part of this, but \nmy colleagues have expressed their views on it and that is why it is no \nlonger on this bill.\n  I know my colleagues have other ideas they wish to offer to this \nbill. I will include them if I can. If there is some reason I can't, I \nwill explain why. If we can reach some compromise, I will try to do \nthat as well. This is the background of this substitute proposal that \nSenator Shelby and I are offering. Again, I wish to move quickly if we \ncan on this. I think it would be an important message to send to the \nfinancial sector of our communities that we are stepping to the plate. \nThese are matters that have been before us for some weeks now. They \nhave been waiting patiently for us to move on these matters. We have a \nchance to do that. That is not to say that other people have ideas that \ndon't have merit, but we have to make decisions about whether to move \nforward, and my hope is that we will, either by this evening or \ntomorrow. What better way to conclude this week than to conclude this \nbill and send a message to the citizens of this country that the Senate \nof the United States has moved to rise to the challenge of this crisis.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1016 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up Vitter amendment No. 1016 to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1016.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize and remove impediments to the repayment of funds \n    received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPAYMENT OF TARP FUNDS.\n\n       Section 111(g) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \n     of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5221(g)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Subject to'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) Repayment permitted.--Subject to'';\n       (2) by inserting ``if, subsequent to such repayment, the \n     TARP recipient is well capitalized (as determined by the \n     appropriate Federal banking agency having supervisory \n     authority over the TARP recipient)'' after ``waiting \n     period,'';\n       (3) by striking ``, and when such assistance is repaid, the \n     Secretary shall liquidate warrants associated with such \n     assistance at the current market price''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) No repayment precondition for warrants.--A TARP \n     recipient that exercises the repayment authority under \n     paragraph (1) shall not be required to repurchase warrants \n     from the Federal Government as a condition of repayment of \n     assistance provided under the TARP. The Secretary shall, at \n     the request of the relevant TARP recipient, repay the \n     proceeds of warrants repurchased before the date of enactment \n     of this paragraph.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this amendment is very simple. In fact, \nit is identical to an amendment I offered to a different bill last week \nwhich unfortunately we did not get to vote on because cloture was \npassed.\n  This amendment says that under the TARP, if a bank wants to repay its \nTARP money that it has taken from the taxpayer, with all of the \npenalties and interests that are relevant, it can do that immediately \nwhenever it wants, as long as it remains perfectly sound and meets all \nof the liquidity, safety, and soundness requirements that the normal \nregulators impose on those sorts of institutions. I think that is very \ncommonsensical and straightforward. If a bank wants to repay with \ninterest, why shouldn't it be able to leave the program? That is the \nguarantee and the promise that was made to banks when TARP was \noriginally instituted. Yet several banks are trying to do that now and \nare getting a different story: No, no, no, no. This isn't your decision \nalone. This is our decision, the Government's decision, even if it \ndoesn't impact the safety and soundness of your institution.\n  Several folks in this institution mirror the concerns of citizens \naround the country. We are very concerned about the Federal Government \ngetting ever more involved in the business of private business and \ninstitutions, in particular, of banks and financial institutions. This \nis a steady trend that began last September, and it is a very steady \ntrend that the Government is becoming first a junior partner and \nseemingly a senior partner in more and more significant institutions in \nour private market. Now we see that it is expanding beyond banks and \nfinancial institutions into auto companies, insurance companies, and \nwho knows what next.\n  Certainly, with all of these legitimate concerns we have about that \ntrend, it should be an established principle of the TARP that if a bank \nwants to repay the money fully with interest and if that repayment does \nnot impact its safety and soundness, if they meet all of the liquidity \nrequirements put on them by the Federal regulators, they should be able \nto do that. Yet they are not. They have not been able to do that. Some \nhave. I am very proud to say that IberiaBank, headquartered in \nLafayette, LA, was the first bank to apply for repayment and to \nactually give all of its TARP money back. I am very happy to say that \nwas successfully done. They were followed by six other smaller or \nregional banks: the Bank of Maine, Bancorp, Old National Bancorp, \nSignature Bank, Sun Bancorp, Shore Bancshares, and Centra Financial \nHolding, Inc. All of those banks followed Iberia's lead and gave that \nmoney back.\n  But more recently, unfortunately, the Federal Government has been \nsinging a different tune and has said, Wait, wait. You can't decide \nthis on your own. We are your new partner and we get to decide this, \nand we are going to decide it on our criteria, even if it is a \nperfectly reasonable and safe thing to do with regard to your liquidity \nand\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nyour safety and soundness. That exemplifies what so many of us are \nconcerned about, about expanding government authority.\n  Let me quote directly from Secretary Geithner. The Wall Street \nJournal reported an interview recently where he:\n\n     indicated that the health of individual banks won't be the \n     sole criteria for whether financial firms will be allowed to \n     repay bailout funds.\n\n  He also testified before Congress in the last few weeks and the \nbottom line of his testimony was: Stay tuned. We will give you \nguidelines on how to repay TARP funds in the future. We are not there \nyet, and we are not--we are certainly not willing to allow banks to \nmake that decision. We are going to make that decision.\n  I have to say it sort of reminds me of the analogy of businesses that \nare infiltrated by the mob and they have as their new senior partner \nthe mafia, and all of a sudden, if they want to get out, it is no \nlonger their choice. Their new big brother partner is going to make the \ncalls and is going to decide: No, no, no. We have our claws into you. \nThat is not changing anytime soon.\n  Is that the new rule we want to establish for private market \ncapitalism? Is that the amount of power and authority we want to give \nto the Federal Government over private institutions in the private \nsector? Even when they can repay the money and remain perfectly liquid, \nperfectly solvent, meeting all of the relevant safety and soundness \ncriteria, do we want to say no, no, no, big brother government says no. \nWe know best.\n  I am very disturbed by this policy that my amendment is counterpoised \nto. It does suggest that big government knows best and that big \ngovernment is going to make the call, apart from the interests of that \nparticular private firm. If that firm meets liquidity requirements, \nmeets all the safety and soundness regulations in sight, then they \nshould be able to do whatever the heck they want to determine their own \nfuture, and that includes repaying their TARP money to the government.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, reasonable, \npro-free market amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1017 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Madam President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthat amendment and call up the Vitter amendment No. 1017 to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nI am going to have to object at some point because we have too long a \nstack here. This is not aimed at my colleague from Louisiana, but I \nwant to be careful and check with leadership as to how many amendments \nwe can lay aside in terms of what their plans are for this evening and \nfor tomorrow. I won't object to this particular one, but I want to use \na moment here to express to my colleague that at some point we will \nhave to put some limitation on this so we can start to grapple with the \namendments before us.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from the Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1017.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that the primary and foundational responsibility \n    of the Federal Housing Administration shall be to safeguard and \n              preserve the solvency of the Administration)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DUTIES OF THE FHA.\n\n       (a) Duty to Maintain Solvency.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law or of this Act, the primary and foundational \n     responsibility of the Federal Housing Administration shall be \n     to safeguard and preserve the solvency of the Administration.\n       (b) Suspension of Activities.--If in the determination of \n     the Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, any \n     existing Federal requirement, program, or law, or any \n     amendment to such requirement, program, or law made by this \n     Act, threatens the solvency of the Administration or makes \n     the Administration reasonably likely to need a credit subsidy \n     from Congress, the Commissioner shall--\n       (1) temporary suspend any such requirement, program, or \n     law; and\n       (2) recommend legislation to the appropriate congressional \n     committees to address such solvency issues.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis comments and for his forbearance. I will be very brief on this \namendment, which goes directly to the bill and is very germane.\n  This amendment, again, is very simple and very straightforward but I \nalso think very important. It would require that the Federal Housing \nAdministration recognize as its first duty to maintain its own \nsolvency. If the provisions of the underlying bill or any other \nexisting requirement cause the FHA to be reasonably likely to need a \ncredit subsidy from Congress, then it shall require the Commissioner, \nNo. 1, to temporarily suspend any program that is threatening the \nsolvency of the FHA; and No. 2, to recommend legislation to Congress to \naddress those solvency issues.\n  I commend the motives of the distinguished chairman and others with \nregard to this bill. Clearly, they are trying to help homeowners in \ndire need, and there sure as heck are many of them around the country, \nincluding my State. But as we walk down this path, I think we all want \nto be careful that we don't create a new crisis, a new solvency crisis \nat the FHA. I believe we need to be very aware of that so we don't \ncreate another crisis there as congressional and other action has in \nthe past at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and elsewhere.\n  Recently, on April 23 at a nomination hearing for Mr. David Stevens, \nwho is the designate for housing and Federal Housing commissioner, the \nperson whom President Obama has chosen to run the FHA, I asked how he \nviewed the health of the FHA mortgage insurance fund and if he \nanticipated having to ask Congress for a credit subsidy. His answer on \nApril 23 was:\n\n       At the present time, the FHA fund is solvent and meets \n     actuarial requirements. Maintaining that solvency would be a \n     top priority for me.\n\n  I am glad to hear that it is solvent as of now but, quite frankly, I \ndon't want that solvency to be a top priority for him; I think it \nshould be the top priority for him. I think we should be very cautious \nabout expanding programs under the FHA if it could lead to a crisis of \nsolvency there which could be a further rattling of the financial \nmarkets, just as similar crises have been in the past.\n  Unfortunately, there are significant signs that the FHA is a ticking \ntimebomb now. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association National \nDelinquency Survey, for the fourth quarter of 2009 seasonally adjusted \ndelinquency rate, 13.73 percent of FHA loans would present an increase \nof 81 basis points from the third quarter of 2008.\n  Similarly, in a report from J.P. Morgan Securities issued in January \nof this year, it says 70 percent of Ginnie Mae borrowers, those who are \nFHA borrowers and VA borrowers, would be underwater if home prices drop \nanother 10 percent.\n  On March 8 of this year, a Washington Post investigation led many \nobservers to view the FHA as a ticking timebomb. The article reports:\n\n       There has been a spike in quick defaults that seem to \n     follow the pattern that preceded the collapse of the subprime \n     market as some of the same flawed lending practices that \n     contributed to the mortgage crisis are now eroding one of the \n     main Federal agencies charged with addressing it.\n\n  Of course they were talking about the FHA.\n  According to the same article:\n\n       More than 9,200 of the loans insured by the FHA in the past \n     2 years have gone into default after no or only one payment.\n\n  So already we see very troubling signs.\n  On top of that, this bill, in some ways, erodes the stability of the \nFHA. It does things such as say that an individual receiving assistance \nunder this program must verify their income, providing income tax \nreturn information but reducing the upfront fee for the program from 3 \npercent to 2 percent. It reduces the annual fee from 1.5 percent to 1 \npercent, and it adds incentives with $1,000 for each loan for folks to \nenter and service the program.\n  So I am concerned, No. 1, that the FHA right now shows real signs of \na possible future crisis, and No. 2, that\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nthis bill could unintentionally be making that worse and making that \nday come quicker.\n  I am not proposing we scrap the provisions of the bill, but my \namendment would simply say that the first duty of the FHA is to \nmaintain solvency, and secondly, if the provisions of this bill or any \nother requirement causes the FHA to be reasonably likely to need a \ncredit subsidy from Congress, the Commissioner has the power to, No. 1, \ntemporarily suspend that program, and No. 2, recommend legislation to \nCongress to address the solvency problem.\n  Let's not let the FHA be the next chapter in terms of this financial \ncrisis. Let's not repeat the kinds of mistakes we have seen in other \nFederal Government or related entities. Let's be careful to avoid that, \nwhich would be an enormous rattling of the financial system and which \nwould cause an enormous drop in confidence.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank the Chair and the chairman for \nhis forbearance, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Release of DOJ Memos\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment with the Obama administration's decision to publicize \nthe memorandums from the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \nJustice. The four memos released by the administration examine whether \nthe CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques would violate U.S. statutes \nor international agreements prohibiting torture.\n  It is important to note that all four memos determined that the \ntechniques did not violate U.S. constitutional or international law or \nU.S. criminal law. It is disappointing that the White House released to \nthe public these highly sensitive memos. There is simply no productive \nor meaningful purpose in their release.\n  The memos describe in detail the CIA's interrogation program, the \nspecific techniques that were used, psychological evaluations of \ndetainees, and even detailed descriptions of some of the detainees \nthemselves. All of this information raises questions about how \nseriously the President believes in protecting our national security as \nwell as the confidentiality of legal counsel and the privacy of \nindividuals. I believe the only reason the Obama administration chose \nto release these memos was for perceived political gain, and I also \nbelieve, based upon what I have heard in my home State, that the \npolitical gain has backlashed.\n  I think if Americans read these memos for themselves, they will agree \nthat after the 9/11 attacks, the CIA program was necessary to detect \nand prevent additional American deaths. The program was designed to \nexploit information held by only the most senior, hardened, and \ndangerous al-Qaida figures who had perishable information about the \nattack's planning.\n  Since its inception in early 2002, fewer than 100 individuals were \nheld in this program, which had significant safeguards, including \ndetailed assessments to determine that the detainees were senior \nmembers of al-Qaida--not mere foot soldiers--who likely had actionable \nintelligence on terrorist threats and who posed a significant threat to \nU.S. interests before the CIA could detain them.\n  Out of the 100 or so detainees the CIA has held, only 3 were \nsubjected to the most serious, yet legal, interrogation techniques. \nThose three were Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, whose deadly plan resulted in the murder of some \n3,000 innocent Americans; secondly, Abu Zubaydah, a senior member of \nal-Qaida, whom the CIA assessed to be the third or fourth ranking \nmember of the terrorist group and who had been involved in aspects of \nevery al-Qaida attack against America; and thirdly, Abd al-Rahim al-\nNashiri, a key al-Qaida operational planner. Information obtained from \nthese three detainees saved American lives by disrupting al-Qaida \nattacks and led to the capture or arrest of even more terrorists. These \ndetainees, who have been in the inner circle of al-Qaida and who have \noccupied some of the most important positions in that group's \nhierarchy, held information that simply could not have been obtained \nfrom any other source.\n  In fact, the memos reveal some of the invaluable information we have \ngained from the CIA program. This includes prevention of numerous \nterrorist attacks, such as the west coast airliner plot, which sought \nto replicate the hijacking of airplanes and crash them into buildings \non the west coast of the United States.\n  One memo describes the discovery of this plot by stating:\n\n       The interrogation of KSM--\n\n  Which is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--\n\n     --once enhanced techniques were employed, led to the \n     discovery of a KSM plot, the ``Second Wave,'' to use East \n     Asian operatives to crash a hijacked airliner into a building \n     in Los Angeles.\n\n  The same memo describes how interrogations provided information on \ntwo operatives who planned to build and detonate a dirty bomb in the \nWashington, DC, area. There is no doubt that the disruption of these \nattacks has saved American lives.\n  CIA detainees have also confirmed that al-Qaida continues to operate \nagainst the United States and its allies. Just recently, a statement \nfrom none other than the Director of National Intelligence, Dennis \nBlair, acknowledged that the high-value information came from this same \nCIA interrogation program and that al-Qaida continues to plan attacks \nagainst America.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have seen CIA \nassessments on the value of information the United States has gained \nfrom interrogations as well as intelligence on the continuing resolve \nof al-Qaida to attack the United States and to attack its citizens. \nHowever, much of this information remains classified, so only half of \nthe story is being told. It is important that Americans have an \nopportunity to see what they were protected from as a result of the CIA \ninterrogations--interrogations that were not only effective but were \ndeemed by the Justice Department not to be torture under U.S. and \ninternational law.\n  The CIA's High Value Terrorist Detainee Program was a crucial pillar \nof U.S. counterterrorism efforts and was the largest source of insight \ninto al-Qaida for the United States and its allies. Now, as a result of \nthe release of these memos, the program is the largest source of \ninformation on U.S. operations to al-Qaida and our other enemies.\n  The administration claims it released these memos in an effort to be \ntransparent, but the only transparency it has provided is to al-Qaida. \nThe group now knows the outer boundaries of what the United States is \ncapable of doing and that we are no longer using these methods or any \nothers for interrogation.\n  Our enemies--traditional enemies and terrorists--now know that some \ninterrogation methods were 100 percent effective on our own soldiers \nwhen used in what is called SERE training. I can only imagine how \ndelighted our enemies are to learn how to gain secrets from our \nsoldiers. However, I am sure our enemies will not have the same \nsafeguards, medical and otherwise, in place when they conduct \ninterrogations on our men and women in uniform who might be captured.\n  While giving transparency to al-Qaida and our other enemies, the \nrelease of these memos will deprive this administration and all future \nPresidents from receiving candid advice from Justice Department \nlawyers.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to provide the President and \nthe executive branch with thorough and frank legal analysis on a \nvariety of topics. If these talented attorneys have to worry that their \nconfidential and often classified legal advice is going to be released \nto the public and could result in their prosecution, I guarantee you \nthey will not be able to offer the most straightforward opinions and \nalternative legal analysis necessary to guide policy. Instead, policy \nwill now guide these lawyers' advice.\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n  Finally, it is disingenuous for Members of Congress to say they were \nunaware of the CIA program. From its inception, CIA lawyers repeatedly \nobtained legal guidance regarding the program from the Department of \nJustice, as one can see from the four classified memos released and \nfrom other unclassified memos previously released. The CIA briefed \ncongressional leaders early on about the details of the program and the \nspecific interrogation techniques that could be used.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was aware that \nthe CIA was holding high-valued detainees and was gaining extraordinary \ninsight into al-Qaida's structure and operations. Also, information \nabout the program was leaked to the public and press. Reports about it \nstarted to circulate as early as 2005. Yet Congress continued to fund \nthe program for several years afterward.\n  In fact, as the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nnoted, the fiscal year 2007 intelligence authorization bill included \nlanguage which specifically acknowledged that the CIA's program had \nbeen important in collecting valuable intelligence on al-Qaida \noperatives and associates and on planned terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  This bill was voted out of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nunanimously by a 15-to-0 rollcall vote. I hope that in the future this \nadministration places more emphasis on protecting our national security \nrather than on placating critics of the rules the United States used to \nprevent another attack on our domestic soil.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I am sorry, I did not see the Senator from South Carolina. I do \nnot suggest a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, in a moment I would like to bring up an \namendment, but in deference to Senator Dodd, I wish to wait for him to \nbe back on the floor. In the meantime, I would like to explain \namendment No. 1026 and talk about it briefly until the Senator returns.\n  We are all well aware of the bailout bill that was passed last \nOctober. It had one purpose, at least as that purpose was described to \nus, and that was to purchase what they called toxic assets that were \nclogging up the credit system. That $700 billion was then used in other \nways, and I believe unconstitutionally, to loan money to banks, \ninsurers, auto companies, and to actually turn those loans into \npreferred stock, in some cases.\n  It now appears the administration is going to take this a little bit \nfurther. We have seen the hiring and firing of executives. We have seen \nthe Government, in effect, break contracts that were established in the \nprivate sector. We see the Government continuing to use this TARP money \nto gain more and more control over private sector industries, \nparticularly the financial industries.\n  The administration appears now to have a plan that would swap this \nloan money in the form of preferred stock for common stock, which means \nwe not only own but we have voting rights and, in some cases, \ncontrolling interests in General Motors. My amendment addresses \nspecifically financial institutions, but we are talking about \nfinancial, auto companies, and other aspects of our economy using this \nTARP money in ways that were totally different than we ever imagined.\n  My amendment addresses specifically banks. It would prohibit the \nFederal Government from converting preferred stock to common stock and \nbasically taking ownership and control of banks across the Nation.\n  Many banks that participated in the TARP funds suggest they were \npressured to take it when they did not need it. Many banks now say they \nwould like to give it back, and they are not allowed to give it back. \nWe need to back the Federal Government out of our private sector \nfinancial system and set up a good system of laws and regulations so it \ncan work in a way that is transparent, honest, and good for the \nAmerican people. But we don't need the Federal Government to own our \nbanks and to try to run the day-to-day business in our banks, just like \nwe do not need the Federal Government to own General Motors and to run \nGeneral Motors.\n  My amendment would address, specifically, the financial institutions \nin our country and prohibit the use of TARP funds to be translated into \ncommon stock ownership and voting rights.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I would like to bring up amendment No. \n1026.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, it will take unanimous consent to \ntemporarily lay aside the pending amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say \nrespectfully to my colleague and friend from South Carolina, a member \nof the Banking Committee, reluctantly I will object to that request at \nthis point. We have amendments pending, and I will explain, as I did to \nhim, the detail. At this very moment, I respectfully and reluctantly \nobject to temporarily laying aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as I said a moment ago, we already have a \nlot of amendments filed on this bill. I can tell my colleagues and \nthose who are following this debate, this bill is critically important \nto our financial institutions. They have been waiting weeks for this \nbill that Senator Shelby and I put together. I am not, in any way, \nsuggesting the amendments being offered are not motivated by the best \nof intentions, but the net effect of it is to virtually bring down this \nbill. I say to my colleagues, I know they are hearing from others \nacross the country who have been waiting for this bill to come up, to \nbe considered, and moved along. There is no way we can spend the amount \nof days now that may be confronting us with the list of amendments to \ngo forward.\n  The leadership--and I agree with them on this--needs some clarity. If \nI am going to be faced with a stack of amendments being offered, then I \nam going to have to, as the leadership said, take this bill down and \nmaybe in the fall at some future date get back to it, if at all.\n  That is a tragedy and unfortunate because it is an important matter. \nIt is widely supported across the country. It is essential in many ways \nwe get it done. I wish for my colleagues to know it is not aimed at any \nparticular amendment. It is not suggested their amendments are not well \nmotivated. But when you load up a bill such as this with that many \namendments, it makes it impossible to get the job done.\n  I objected to laying aside the pending amendment because we have \nseveral amendments now pending. We will try, over the coming day or so, \nto see if we can resolve some of those amendments, maybe accept some. I \nhave to speak with, of course, my colleague from Alabama, Senator \nShelby, to see if there is agreement on some of the matters or some \nmodification to make them acceptable.\n  I suggest to my colleagues, any additional people coming over to \ntemporarily lay aside the pending amendments, that I will object to \ndoing that until we get clarity and try to clear out the underbrush to \ndetermine whether we bring down the bill, which I will do, or to get a \nreasonable number of these amendments which we can handle to go \nforward. One or the other.\n  For those who are following this debate, the possibility of this bill \nbeing taken down is very real. I hope those who are interested in this \nbill will notify their respective Members who wish to offer amendments \nand suggest there may be a better time for those amendments to be \noffered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, tonight I rise to speak on the Dodd-\nShelby legislation and specifically on my amendment, No. 1015, which is \nat the desk.\n  First, I commend my chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, for his work on this legislation. This legislation will \ntake important steps in addressing the very heart of our economic \ncrisis, the housing market. But we can do more.\n  Tonight I rise to offer an amendment that will put an end to the \ndeceptive and unfair mortgage practices that played a pivotal role in \nsteering American families into accepting risky and unsustainable \nmortgages. As I have discussed before, two key factors drew families \ninto unsustainable mortgages and paved the way for this recession. \nFirst, steering payments were paid to brokers who enticed unsuspecting \nborrowers into deceptive and expensive mortgages. These secret bonus \npayments, called yield spread premiums, turned home mortgages into a \nscam.\n  A family would go to a mortgage broker for advice in getting the best \npossible loan. The family would trust the broker to give good advice \nbecause, quite frankly, they were paying the broker for that advice. \nBut what the borrower did not realize was that the broker would earn \nthousands of bonus dollars from the lender if the broker could convince \nthe homeowner to take out a high-priced mortgage such as one with an \nexploding interest rate rather than a plain vanilla 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgage.\n  Prepayment penalties added insult to injury. After the homeowner \nrealized he or she had been steered into an unsustainable mortgage, the \nhomeowner soon discovered that a large prepayment penalty made it too \ncostly for them to refinance into a lower cost loan. The homeowner was \nlocked into a destructive mortgage. This scam had tremendous impact.\n  A study for the Wall Street Journal found that 61 percent of the \nsubprime loans originated in 2006 went to families who qualified for \nprime loans, meaning that millions of American families were placed at \nrisk. This is simply wrong--a publicly regulated process designed to \ncreate a relationship of trust between families and brokers but that \nleaves borrowers unaware of payments that place them in expensive and \ndestructive mortgages.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to a New York Times editorial \npublished on April 10 entitled ``Predatory Brokers,'' which highlighted \nthis problem. The editorial pointed out a study by the Center for \nResponsible Lending that found that subprime borrowers who used a \nbroker actually fared worse than those who went directly to lenders. \nThose borrowers paid $17,000 to $43,000 more for every $100,000 they \nborrowed. That is outrageous.\n  The Times concluded:\n\n       The first step must be to outlaw the kickbacks that lenders \n     pay brokers for steering clients into costlier loans.\n\n  The editorial went on:\n\n       The most clearly unethical form of payment is the so-called \n     yield-spread premium.\n\n  It is difficult to overestimate the damage that has been done by \nthese expensive loans and secret steering payments. An estimated 20,000 \nOregon families will lose their homes to foreclosure in 2009. \nNationwide, an estimated 2 million families will lose their homes this \nyear, and the total of foreclosed families is predicted to reach 9 \nmillion by 2012.\n  These practices didn't only hurt families on Main Street, they were \nalso the prime enablers for the propagation of destructive subprime \ncollateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that have now brought Wall \nStreet to its knees. Had these procedures been banned--steering \npayments, prepayment penalties--Wall Street would not have been able to \nengineer the tremendous bubble on the backs of unsuspecting homeowners \nand, accordingly, would not have had the billions in write-downs that \ncaused this credit crisis and sent our economy into a terrible \nrecession.\n  The problem is simple and the solution is simple. The costs of doing \nnothing are tremendous both for homeowners and for the financial \nsystem. By banning steering payments and prepayment penalties, this \namendment will restore transparency to the mortgage lending process and \nhelp make home ownership a stable investment for families once again.\n  The time has come for us to make sure that secret steering payments \nand paralyzing prepayment penalties never again haunt American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending our colleague \nfrom Oregon for this proposal. We have had a chance to talk about it, \nand he is exactly right. He described it more adequately as to what \nhappened, what goes on, what went on, that contributed so much to the \noverall economic mess we are in today. This is where it all began. This \nwas not a natural disaster that occurred like Katrina, an act of God. \nThese were intentional decisions made by people to abuse purchasers, \nborrowers, luring them into financial situations where they were fully \naware that borrower could never meet the fully indexed cost of that \nmortgage as it matured.\n  In fact, I recall one of the early hearings we held in 2007, the Web \nsite of the brokers. The first piece of advice to a broker was: \nConvince the borrower that you are their financial adviser.\n  Not that you were their financial adviser, but to convince them that \nyou are so that you can then engage them in such a way as to convince \nthem to enter arrangements that they could hardly afford. As we now \nknow from a number of different studies, somewhere between 60 and 65 \npercent of the people who ended up with subprime mortgages actually \nqualified for conventional mortgages.\n  For those who may not understand the differentiation, the cost of a \nconventional mortgage is substantially less than a subprime mortgage.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alaska, spent a good part of \nhis career in this business, so he knows firsthand how all of this \nworks and appreciates the proposal by our colleague from Oregon. Yield \nspread premiums were one of the key causes of the current crisis \nbecause these premiums create incentives for brokers to upsell \nborrowers; in other words, to convince them and to draw them into \narrangements that would be more costly because that is how they got \npaid. It was nothing more complicated than that. You got a better fee \nif you could convince someone, talk them into a situation that cost the \nborrower more. The borrower could never meet those obligations, \nparticularly people on fixed incomes.\n  One of the first witnesses I ever called before the committee as \nchairman in 2007 was a woman from Chicago whose husband had passed \naway. She worked for 30 or 40 years, had retired, was living in a home \nthat she and her husband had bought years before, had $3,000 of \nconsumer debt. A broker convinced her that she needed to refinance that \nhome to meet that obligation. Of course, the fully indexed cost of that \nmortgage blew through her fixed income as a retiree. She came very \nclose to losing the home. We stepped in. The bank stepped up, was \nembarrassed by what it had done. She ended up keeping the home but only \nbecause, candidly, she was a witness before a Senate committee. Had she \nbeen out there in Chicago without any other recognition or notoriety, I \nam not sure she would have fared as well as she did when she achieved \nsome notoriety in appearing before the committee.\n  The bank in question was sitting at the table next to her, so they \ndecided to work it out in her case. But literally hundreds of thousands \nof people across the country were not so fortunate. Again, they were \nlured into these arrangements our colleague has talked about.\n  I thank him for his amendment. We have had a lot of discussions about \nthis matter. In the last Congress we put together a whole bill on \npredatory lending, and yield spread premiums was one of the key \nprovisions.\n  What I would like to suggest, if he would be amenable, this is a \nmatter that needs to be revived. We had a hearing almost 2 years ago \nnow so it has gotten a little dated in terms of\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nthe information. As chair of the committee, I would like to ask him, as \na new member, whether he would be willing to chair a hearing on the \nsubject matter of predatory lending, including yield spread premiums, \nand arrange that in the coming weeks. My intention would be that as we \nmove forward to deal with the modernization of financial regulations, \nthat this is an area we will want to include as part of our \nconsideration of that larger bill.\n  I, for one, would look forward to some specific ideas that we could \nuse to address this kind of problem. I thank him for bringing the \nmatter to our attention this evening. I look forward to working with \nhim on this matter as well.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I deeply respect and appreciate the fact \nthat the chairman has done so much to bring public attention to these \nimportant issues over the past several years. I would be delighted and \nhonored to have the opportunity to assist with hearings as described on \npredatory lending and to refresh this conversation about how we, as a \nCongress, can reach out and assist working Americans to make sure that \nin the future they will not find that the dream of home ownership is \nturned into a nightmare, as it has been through steering payments, \nthrough prepayment penalties for so many in the near past. I would be \ndeeply honored.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague. He is, obviously, very knowledgable \nabout this area, as is the Presiding Officer. It is tremendously \nimportant in this body. My two colleagues are relatively new Members, \nbut believe me, they could not be here at a more opportune time with \ntheir backgrounds and experiences for this debate and discussion.\n  As a senior Member, I welcome their presence in the Senate. I look \nforward to working with our colleague from Oregon and to include his \nidea as part of a larger bill on predatory lending.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1025 to the pending bill, and I ask that amendment be \nmade pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I said to \nmy friend, this is not a personal matter--we are trying to get a finite \nlist of the amendments and get time agreements on all of them. I have \nhad to object to other amendments being offered--laying aside \ntemporarily the pending amendments--both on the minority side as well \nas the majority side. It is with reluctance, I say to my friend, that I \nwill have to object.\n  My hope would be that he would let us have the amendment and the \narguments, and so forth, so we could take a look at it--Senator Shelby \nand I. If we could agree in some way or work on something together so \nwe could possibly accommodate him or give him a clear indication of \nsome time so we can debate it and discuss it and go forward, that is my \nintention.\n  With that, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might speak to the amendment for a few \nmoments.\n  I offered a similar amendment last week to the fraud recovery bill \nand was told at the time--and, of course, cloture ultimately was \ninvoked on that bill, and I was told it was not germane. So it fell \npostcloture.\n  In order to make it germane to this underlying bill--in fact, I was \ntold at the time last week, when I brought it up, it would be germane \nto the housing bill, which would be considered next. So I decided I \nwould offer this amendment again. But running into the same sort of \nquestion about whether this amendment would be germane postcloture, I \nhave adapted the amendment so it is germane to the underlying bill.\n  I will tell you, I would have preferred keeping it in its original \nform because, essentially, it would have taken TARP moneys repaid to \nthe Federal Treasury by lending institutions and applied them to debt \nreduction. That was the amendment in the form it was in last week when \nI offered it to the fraud recovery bill. I still think that is a good, \nsound idea: As TARP funds are paid back into the Federal Treasury, \nrather than being recycled or used on some other Government program, we \napply it to debt reduction.\n  Lord knows we are spending and borrowing enormous amounts of money. \nThe least we could do when these moneys are paid back is put them \ntoward paying down the Federal debt so we are not handing this \nenormous--enormous--bill to our children and grandchildren.\n  But, as I said before, in order to get this amendment in a form that \nit would be germane postcloture, I have revised it. I will describe it \nin a minute. But I wish to start by saying, on October 7, 2008, we all \nknow Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, as \npart of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. It authorized $700 \nbillion for the purchase of toxic assets from banks, with a goal of \nrestoring liquidity to the financial sector and restarting the flow of \ncredit in our markets.\n  The Department of Treasury, however, without consultation with \nCongress, changed the purpose of TARP and began injecting capital into \nfinancial institutions through a program called the Capital Purchase \nProgram, or CPP, rather than purchasing toxic assets.\n  Financial lending was not increased with the implementation of the \nCPP and the expenditure of $218 billion of TARP funds, despite the goal \nof the program.\n  Those receiving funds through CPP are now faced with additional \nrestrictions related to accepting those funds. A number of community \nbanks and large financial institutions have expressed their desire to \nreturn those CPP funds to the Department of Treasury. Treasury has, in \nfact, begun the process of accepting receipt of these funds. However, \nbecause of the financial stress test Treasury is currently conducting, \nit is possible Treasury will restrict some banks from returning funds \nthey received from the CPP.\n  I mentioned last week when I offered the amendment to the fraud \nrecovery bill that there were banks I was aware of that were not able \nat the time to return funds to the Treasury. They were told they \ncouldn't. They had money from the TARP, they were banks that were in \ngood financial standing, and they wanted to pay back that TARP money \nand couldn't do it. I believe now, at least, the Treasury is working \nwith a number of banks to try and receive some of these monies that the \nbanks want to pay back, but it is entirely possible, because of these \nstress tests, that some banks will be restricted from returning funds \nthey received from the CPP.\n  In his testimony before the TARP congressional oversight panel on \nApril 21, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that Treasury estimates \n$134.6 billion of TARP funds are still available. What is interesting \nabout that number is that in that figure, he includes $25 billion they \nexpect to receive back from banks under CPP. Geithner also stated he \nbelieves that $25 billion is a conservative number and that private \nanalysts, of course, are predicting that more--much more--is going to \nbe returned. But the important point is that of the $134.6 billion that \nTreasury Secretary Geithner referred to in terms of TARP funds that \nwill be available, $25 billion of that is in the form of payments they \nexpect to receive back from banks under the CPP.\n  So my point is there is money coming in, and rather than using that \nto pay down the debt, which I think many of us assumed was going to be \nthe use of those funds if they came back in, that they are sort of \nplanning on, it looks like, recycling back into TARP or, perhaps--I \nhope not but perhaps--using them for some other purpose.\n  Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act terminates \nthe authority for TARP funds on December 31, 2009, and the Secretary \ncan request an extension to that deadline not later than 2 years after \nenactment, which would be October of 2010. But keep in\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nmind, that restriction only applies to Treasury's issuance of new loans \nand does not cover the reuse of previously issued assistance that was \nreturned to the Treasury. So there is no prohibition on the Treasury \nusing these recycled TARP funds.\n  The TARP Reduction Priority Act, which is the subject of my \namendment, reduces TARP authority by any amount returned by a financial \ninstitution to Treasury. So instead of having TARP monies that are \nreturned from the banks back into the Treasury applied to debt \nreduction, what I do now with this amendment--in order to have it fit \nwithin the confines of this bill and to remain germane should, in fact, \ncloture be invoked--is reduce the TARP authority by whatever amount is \nreturned by a financial institution to the Treasury. In other words, \nthe TARP amount--the amount that would be available for lending under \nTARP--as it is paid back, monies come back from the banks, the TARP \nlending amount is reduced commensurate with the amount that is \nreturned, so that those monies cannot be recycled. Once they have been \nout there and returned by the banks, they can't be recycled and reused \nor put to some other purpose.\n  Let me also say that until the December 31, 2009 expiration date, and \npossibly longer--again, if the Secretary is granted an extension--that \nwithout this legislation, Treasury can continue to use TARP funds, \nincluding those repaid in any manner they see fit. It is certainly not \nwhat Members of Congress envisioned when this legislation passed last \nyear. These are taxpayer dollars. They should not become a \ndiscretionary slush fund for the administration. Under the \nConstitution, Congress controls the power of the purse, and I, as do \nmany Members of Congress and others around the country, have major \nconcerns regarding the Treasury's handling of TARP funding. If the new \nadministration, the Obama administration, or the Treasury Department \nbelieves it needs additional funding to address problems in the \nfinancial sector, they should come to Congress for that authority.\n  Inspector General Neil Barofsky stated in his quarterly report to \nCongress that there are 12 separate programs being funded under TARP \ninvolving up to $3 trillion of government and public funds. Amazingly, \nthat is the equivalent amount of the size of the entire Federal budget. \nIt certainly wasn't what Congress was told the funding would be used \nfor.\n  Mr. Barofsky also mentioned in his April 4, 2009 CBO report--he \nestimated that TARP would cost the Federal Government $356 billion, \nmeaning that the Treasury will only be able to recover $344 billion or \napproximately 49 percent of the $700 billion that was originally \nallocated by the Congress.\n  When this program was initially pitched to Congress--and my \ncolleagues in the Senate should remember--Secretary Paulson at the time \nargued that the Government would end up making money once those toxic \nassets were sold after the economy recovered. Clearly, this is no \nlonger the case. Barofsky's report spans 247 pages. It says the very \ncharacter of the bailout program makes it:\n\n       Inherently vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, including \n     significant issues related to conflicts of interfacing fund \n     managers, inclusion between participants, and vulnerabilities \n     to money laundering.\n\n  So again, the point of the amendment is very simple; it is very \nstraightforward. All I am trying to do is to make sure the TARP funds, \nas they come back in, when they are repaid by banks, are not recycled, \nthey are not reused, they are not put into some program which the \ninspector general says in his report is inherently vulnerable to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse; that it actually be used to reduce the amount of the \nTARP authority. It is the best solution we could come up with short of \napplying those repaid funds to deficit or to debt reduction which, as I \nsaid, was the original form of this amendment, but under the rules of \nthe Senate, to make sure it is germane, this is the approach we have \nselected. I think it accomplishes the same purpose. It makes certain \nthat the monies that come back in, that are paid back by banks that \nhave received TARP funds are not reused, reallocated, put into some \nother purpose or some other fund, but it actually is reducing the \namount of TARP authority that is available to be used and, therefore, \nprotecting taxpayer interests and taxpayer dollars that were extended \nunder this program in the first place.\n  So I hope my colleagues, when they are making final determinations \nabout which amendments are going to be on the so-called list--and it \nseems to me, at least, that on a bill such as this, a housing bill, it \nought to be wide open to amendments and we ought to be able to get \nvotes on some of these amendments but evidently the leaders on the \nother side have concluded they are going to limit those amendments and \ntry to come up with some finite list--I hope they will include this \namendment on that list. I think it makes sense. It is perfectly fitting \nwith the purpose of the underlying bill, which is a housing bill.\n  TARP funds, of course, were supposed to deal with the credit crisis, \nthe housing crisis, and I would hope this amendment would be one that \nthe other side, as they make those decisions about which amendments are \ngoing to be allowed to be debated and voted on with respect to the base \nbill, that this amendment will be on that list. I think it makes a lot \nof sense.\n  I hope some of the other amendments my colleagues have offered also \nwill be allowed to be voted on. I think that is the way the Senate is \nintended to work and to function. All Members of the Senate are \nsupposed to be able to come to the floor and offer amendments and have \nthose amendments debated and voted upon. It seems to me that sort of \narbitrarily putting in place a construct that limits amendments and \npicks and chooses ones that get voted on does not represent the \nheritage and the tradition of this body. I hope my colleagues who are \nmanaging the bill on the floor will decide what I think is in the best \ninterests of this institution, and that is that these amendments all be \noffered, be debated, and be voted on, and I hope this certainly is the \ncase with the amendment I put before the Senate right now.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time and I hope this \namendment can be made pending and get voted on whenever we get back on \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is no secret that I have worked for \ndecades to bring greater transparency and accountability to all facets \nof government operations. If there is one thing that I have learned \nover those years it is that you cannot achieve the goal of greater \ntransparency and accountability without access to information.\n  During this financial crisis, we hear daily about the need for many \nmore billions in Federal funds to save this bank or that financial \nfirm. In response to the crisis the Treasury Department is buying \nstakes in banks and other companies. That program is known as the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program or TARP. It is costing the American \ntaxpayer nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars. Transparency and \naccountability has never been more important than with a program that \nbig.\n  In an effort to provide some accountability to the American people \nfor TARP funds, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, the \ninvestigative arm of Congress, was required by legislation to conduct \noversight of the TARP program.\n  The GAO's mission is to look at the overall performance of the \ninitiative and its impact on the financial system. The GAO is also \nrequired to prepare regular reports for Congress.\n  However, GAO cannot do its job effectively without access to \ninformation about how the funds are used. This should be obvious. \nUnfortunately, however, the bill that created the TARP and told GAO to \noversee it, did not give them the authority to access books and records \nof the private firms that receive TARP money.\n  In January, Senator Baucus and I introduced a bill, S. 340, to \nprovide the GAO the ability to access the books and records of firms \nwho received money from the TARP. Senator Snowe is also a cosponsor of \nthe bill, known as the TARP Enhancement Act. Unfortunately, my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee have not yet taken any action on \nthe bill.\n  Amendment No. 1020 is simply the text of S. 340. It would ensure that \ncompanies that receive assistance from the American taxpayer are \nrequired to\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\ncooperate with requests for information from the Government \nAccountability Office about how they used taxpayer money.\n  The GAO is supposed to be the ``eyes and ears'' of Congress. Well it \ncan't do that job wearing blinders and ear plugs. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support amendment No. 1020, to ensure that GAO has access \nto TARP recipients' books and records.\n  Mr. President, in March the Finance Committee held a hearing on the \nprogress and oversight of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP. At \nthat hearing, we heard testimony from acting Comptroller General, the \nhead of the Government Accountability Office, GAO. He testified that in \naddition to the problem that S. 340 is intended to fix, there is \nanother major gap in GAO's access to information about the TARP. It is \nnot just firms that take taxpayer money who can say ``no'' to GAO's \nrequests for information. The Federal Reserve can too.\n  The GAO is prohibited by law from auditing the the Federal Reserve. \nPerhaps that restriction was defensible back when the Federal Reserve \nfocused on monetary policy. However, today it is routinely exercising \nextraordinary emergency powers to subsidize financial firms far above \nthe levels Congress is willing to authorize through legislation. The \nFederal Reserve is taking on more and more risk in complicated and \nunprecedented ways. That risk is ultimately borne by the American \ntaxpayer, but the elected representatives of the taxpayers have not had \na say in the Federal Reserve's activities or even a reasonable level of \ntransparency to make sure we understand how much risk taxpayers are on \nthe hook for.\n  The GAO testified at our hearing that the Federal Reserve is heavily \ninvolved in two new TARP programs announced since March of this year. \nIt is also responsible for managing huge portfolios of troubled assets \nit took on in the bailouts of Bear Stearns and AIG. According to GAO \ntestimony, as of March 27, 2009, Treasury has announced initiatives \nthat are projected to use $590.4 billion of the $700 billion in TARP \nfunds authorized by Congress. However, the projected assistance in \nthese initiatives by the Federal Reserve could be up to $2.9 trillion \nby GAO estimates. In addition, the Federal Reserve has a variety of \nother facilities it has established to address the financial crisis \nadding up to another $1.5 trillion.\n  Despite these enormous numbers, there is a statutory limitation \nprohibiting GAO from examining the Federal Reserve. That provision is \nnow in direct conflict with the mission that Congress gave GAO to \nmonitor and report on the TARP.\n  Amendment No. 1021 would fix this conflict by allowing the GAO to \nprovide Congress a complete and independent view of all the TARP \nprograms, including those with Federal Reserve involvement, such as the \nTerm Asset Loan Facility, TALF, and the Public Private Investment \nPartnership, PPIP. It would also allow the GAO to examine other \nextraordinary Federal Reserve actions, such as its acceptance of risky \nassets from Bear Stearns and AIG.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 1021. Let's not give \nGAO an important mission to do with a blindfold on. Let's take off the \nblindfold and let the professionals at GAO take a good hard look on \nbehalf of the American people at what the Federal Reserve is doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4953-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, today, I come to the floor to honor Cpl \nWilliam Craig Comstock of Van Buren, AR. His life and service to our \ncountry embody the full measure of the Marine Corps motto, ``Semper \nFidelis,'' meaning ``always faithful.''\n  We lost Corporal Comstock when he paid the ultimate sacrifice while \nserving in Iraq's Anbar Province. Comstock was on his second tour with \nthe 2nd Supply Battalion, Combat Logistics Regiment 25, 2nd Marine \nLogistics Group, II Marine Expedition Force, Camp Lejeune, NC. Working \nas an ammunition technician on his first tour in Iraq, he earned a \nPurple Heart for his bravery after sustaining a gunshot wound in the \nknee. Ever faithful to his Corps, he volunteered in January to return \nto Iraq a second time. He told his family he wanted to make that \nsacrifice for his fellow marines who he knew were eager to return home \nto see their own.\n  Coporal Comstock was loved by many. Those who knew him remember him \nfor his wide smile, independent spirit, and warm heart. He was proud to \nbe a U.S. marine, and the Marines were proud to have him. His awards \ninclude the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the National Defense Service \nMedal.\n  Even before joining the Marines, family, colleagues, and friends say \nCoporal Comstock lived by the ``Semper Fidelis'' motto. As an Alma High \nSchool football star, he played on despite an injured shoulder, \nrefusing to let his teammates down. One of his football teammates, Nick \nHarrison, will graduate from Marine Corps basic training next month. \nHarrison's mother said it was Coporal Comstock that inspired her son to \nenlist.\n  Coporal Comstock was a loyal teammate to his fellow U.S. marines and \nplanned to make a career in military service. Coporal Comstock's memory \nwill live on through his friend Nick Harrison and others like him who \nselflessly serve our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are grateful \nfor his service and my prayers are with his family during this \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4953-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4953-S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A DECADE OF INACTION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Monday marked the tenth anniversary of \nthe tragic shooting at Columbine High School. The prior Thursday was \nthe second anniversary of the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech. These \nhorrific anniversaries have become far too common. Since the shooting \nat Columbine, I have spoken regularly on the Senate floor about the \npressing need for common sense gun safety legislation. Unfortunately, \nCongress has failed to act.\n  Even a decade later, the very mention of Columbine High School \nstrikes a nerve with those who hear it. Many of us can still recall \nwith eerie detail the chaotic scenes of hundreds of terrified children \nrunning from their school as SWAT-teams descended on the building, \nsearching for two adolescents who, before taking their own lives, \nmurdered 12 innocent students, a teacher, and wounded two dozen others.\n  In the years that have followed, those closest to the event have \nrecounted how they are constantly reminded of that day by the fragments \nof ammunition in their bodies or the physical scars from wounds \nsuffered that day. Many victims have described shuddering at the sight \nof a trench coat or being instantly transported back to the incident \nfrom the sound or smell of fireworks. The physical and emotional pain \nthese victims have endured should be intolerable to us. Yet\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nCongress has refused to take the necessary steps to prevent it.\n  Our Nation suffers from a horrific epidemic of gun violence. Over \n30,000 Americans die from firearms every year, nearly 12,000 of which \nare homicides. That is an average of 32 gun murders every day, the same \nnumber killed at Virginia Tech. While we all hope and pray that these \ntypes of public tragedies do not happen again, the truth is that the \nthreat of gun violence has not diminished.\n  Gun violence is preventable, however, it requires action. Without \naction, gun violence will continue to be found in our high schools, \nuniversities, religious institutions and our homes. For too long, \nvictims and their families, educators and police officials around this \ncountry have cried out for sensible gun legislation that would keep \nguns out of the wrong hands, close the gun show loophole, reauthorize \nthe assault weapons ban and aid law enforcement agencies in tracking \ngun traffickers. Passage of such legislation would serve as monumental \nsteps toward ensuring these types of tragedies do not continue. \nCongress must do everything possible to reduce the level of gun \nviolence in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4954-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmillions of Asian Pacific Islander Americans for their significant \ncontributions and service to strengthen this great Nation, and to join \nthe Nation in celebrating Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage \nMonth.\n  This month-long tribute would not be complete without recognizing the \nvisionaries who founded Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month: \nU.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, former U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga, former \nSecretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta, and former U.S. \nRepresentative Frank Horton. As a result of their steadfast leadership, \na joint resolution established Asian Pacific Island American Heritage \nWeek in 1978, and the celebration was later expanded to an entire month \nin 1992.\n  This celebration takes place in May to mark the first Japanese \nimmigrants' arrival in America in 1842, as well as the completion of \nthe Transcontinental Railroad in 1869--which would not have been \nfinished without the hard work and dedication of Chinese laborers.\n  Today, our Nation faces its trials and tribulations as it sees harsh \neconomic times. People throughout the country are losing their homes \nand their jobs and we must come together as a community and remain \nstrong and dignified. The Asian Pacific Islander American community \nconstitutes one of the fastest growing minority communities in the \nUnited States, with over 13 million Asian Pacific Islander Americans in \nthe country. Despite these economic hardships, members of the Asian \nPacific Islander American community have continued to take positions of \nleadership and have worked hard to secure a brighter future for all.\n  Asian Pacific Islander Americans are making great strides both in the \nprivate and public sectors. Members of the Asian Pacific Islander \nAmerican community have been named to key appointments in President \nBarack Obama's administration and at other levels of government. As \nAsian Pacific Islander Americans advance to positions of power and \nleadership, we can ensure that the voice of the community is being \nheard.\n  While we celebrate the many accomplishments and the promising future \nof the Asian Pacific Islander American community, we must not forget \nthe history of Asian Pacific Islander Americans in this country. The \nAngel Island Immigration Station has a significant place in Asian \nPacific Islander American history. Declared a National Historic \nLandmark in 1997, Angel Island served as the entry point in the West \nfor over 1 million immigrants from 1910-1940. This includes \napproximately 175,000 Chinese immigrants who were detained at Angel \nIsland before they were granted entry to San Francisco. Along with \nRepresentative Lynn Woolsey, I sponsored the Angel Island Immigration \nStation Restoration and Preservation Act, which passed in both the \nHouse and the Senate in 2005, authorizing $15 million of federal funds \nfor the Angel Island Immigration Station Preservation Project. After \n3\\1/2\\ years since it was closed for restoration, Angel Island reopened \nthis February and will educate the public about the immigration \nexperience and the significance that it holds for many immigrant \nfamilies today.\n  After the recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct of 2009, benefits were finally granted to long-time Filipino \nveterans of World War II. The act recognizes the service of these \nveterans and includes a provision which allocates $198 million to the \nFilipino veterans for their defense of the Philippines, a commonwealth \nunder the United States during World War II. We must praise and commend \nthese brave soldiers for the sacrifices they made during their service \nin the Armed Forces.\n  The idea of family is important to Americans and continues to be at \nthe center of the Asian Pacific Islander American value system. It is \nimperative that we do what we can to keep families united to ensure \nthat immigrants and children receive the support to sustain a \nlivelihood in the United States.\n  I have continued to support immigration initiatives, such as \ncomprehensive immigration reform and have supported family \nreunification. I authored legislation to reform the treatment of \nunaccompanied immigrant children who are in Federal immigration \ncustody. The bill gives unaccompanied minors access to pro bono legal \ncounsel and requires family reunification whenever possible.\n  We must recognize that the Asian Pacific Islander American community \nis diverse, not only in language, culture and foods, but in education \nand socio-economic levels as well. That is why it is so important to \nprovide talented students who have clearly embraced the American dream \nthe incentive to take the path toward being a responsible, contributing \nmember in our civic society.\n  I have cosponsored the DREAM Act of 2009 to give undocumented high \nschool students who wish to attend college or serve in the Armed Forces \nan opportunity to adjust to a lawful status and pursue these goals. If \nit becomes law, the DREAM Act would help Asian Pacific Islander \nAmericans and others triumph over adversity.\n  As future generations of Asian Pacific Islander Americans continue to \nstrive for excellence in our educational system, economy, and \ncommunities, I am pleased to honor and distinguish the many triumphs \nand accomplishments of the Asian Pacific Islander American community \nand their role in shaping our Nation's identity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4954-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4954-S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAERSK ALABAMA HEROES\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this month the Nation was gripped by the \npirate attack on Maersk Alabama off the coast of Africa. Today, I rise \nto cheer Captain Richard Philips, for his bravery and valor, and the \nNavy SEALs, for securing the Captain's safe return.\n  We also need to honor the Merchant Marines who did not give up their \nship. Though unarmed, using their wits, grit and training, they saved \ntheir ship--an American flag-ship--and the much-needed food aid they \nwere carrying to the desperately poor of Africa.\n  The 20-man crew of the Maersk Alabama belonged to the American \nMerchant Marines. They were sailing a U.S.-flag vessel carrying 17,000 \nmetric tons of cargo to Mombasa, Kenya.\n  I am so proud that many of them trained in Maryland at Calhoon MEBA \nEngineering School in St. Michael's or at the maritime training school \nin Piney Point. Here, they learned how to navigate at sea, operate and \nrepair ships, and how to handle a pirate or terrorist attack. Here, \nthey received the education to sail the sea with skill that allowed \nthem to save their ship with courage.\n  Thirteen of the 20 crew members aboard the Maersk Alabama trained in \nMaryland; 4 at Calhoon MEBA Engineering School and 9 at the Paul Hall \nCenter for Maritime Training and Education.\n  Richard Matthews of St. Michael's was an engineer aboard Maersk \nAlabama. He trained at Calhoon MEBA Engineering School, as did three \nothers aboard the ship: Ken Quinn, the ship's second mate who called \nCNN from the ship; Michael Perry; and John Cronan.\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nJohn Cronan later told the ``Today'' show: ``We didn't have to retake \nthe ship because we never surrendered it. We're American seamen. We're \nunion members. We stuck together and did our jobs.''\n  Twelve crew members aboard the Maersk Alabama are members of the \nSeafarers International Union, SIU. Many of them trained at SIU's \nmaritime school, the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and \nEducation, in Piney Point, MD. It is the largest training facility for \ndeep sea merchant seafarers. It teaches skills for sailors and \nseafarers, such as how to maintain a boat engine and how to secure a \nship from pirates. I salute the SIU members aboard the Maersk Alabama \nfor their patriotism and pluck and for their refusal to surrender their \nship.\n  This incident reminds us of the importance of the Merchant Marines. \nOften unseen and unappreciated, they are vital to our economic security \nand our national security. They are our eyes and ears on the water. \nThey are experts in marine safety, environmental protection and the new \nand latest technology. They keep our ports safe and our commerce \nflowing.\n  They are the Ready Reserve. They are there in war, transporting vital \nmilitary aid and supplies to our troops. They are there in peace, \nsupplying aid to those most in need--just as the Maersk Alabama was \ndoing when the pirates attacked. They are prepared to risk their lives \ndefending their flag.\n  Let's salute the Merchant Marine, not just for what they did aboard \nthe Maersk Alabama, but for what they do, what they stand for, their \nproud tradition. The Merchant Marine tradition is one of saving America \ntime and time again. They have been the Nation's fourth arm of defense \nsince the American Revolution.\n  President Roosevelt called our Merchant Marines ``heroes in \ndungarees'' because during World War II these gallant men braved the \nwaters of the North Atlantic and the dangers of the Murmansk run to \nkeep our troops overseas fed and clothed. They have fought on the front \nlines of every war since then--from Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf \nto the Iraq War. They were there on 9/11, ferrying thousands of people \nto safety in New York. They were there in the aftermath of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. And they have been there providing food to starving \nchildren in Ethiopia, Somalia and dozens of other regions around the \nworld.\n  The maritime community has been a major player in my personal and \npolitical history, from growing up in east Baltimore to my early days \nin Congress on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. I got my \nstart in politics by representing blue collar workers in Baltimore, the \nshipyard workers and the dock workers.\n  I am relieved by the safe return of the Maersk Alabama's crew and \ncaptain and I am grateful for all of those involved in their safe \nrescue and return: the Navy and their elite Navy SEALs squad and \nPresident Obama and his administration for handling the hostage \nsituation with great skill.\n  As we welcome them home, let us acknowledge not just their heroism \noff the horn of Africa, but the everyday heroics of our Merchant \nMarines; their skills and training, their patriotism and proud \ntradition, and the role they play every day, in every way, supporting \nour troops, guarding our ports, keeping our economy strong and \nsafeguarding our interests overseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4955-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JUDY COLLINS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Alternating \n     between the guitar and the piano, Ms. Collins offers a \n     version of a personal musical history that is too complicated \n     and rich to be covered in a single evening.\n       On Tuesday night at the Cafe Carlyle, where she began a \n     six-week engagement, the emphasis was on her folk-music side, \n     and for more than half the show she accompanied herself on \n     acoustic guitar, with Russell Walden assisting on piano and \n     backup vocals.\n       Her song ``Mountain Girl,'' performed early in the evening, \n     set the tone. Ms. Collins grew up in Colorado, and her \n     silvery vibrato-free voice might be described as an Alpine \n     instrument. Especially when she sings a cappella, it has the \n     ringing purity of a voice emanating from a lofty altitude and \n     reverberating in an endless echo chamber of mountain passes. \n     Ms. Collins, who will turn 70 on May 1, has miraculously \n     retained her upper register. The higher she sings, most of \n     the time with perfect intonation, the more she projects the \n     ethereality of a flute played by the wind.\n       The influence that propelled her from a piano prodigy who \n     played Mozart, she recalled, wasn't the sound of the Weavers \n     or Woody Guthrie, but that of Jo Stafford on her 1950s folk \n     albums. In particular it was Ms. Stafford's recording of \n     ``Barbara Allen,'' first heard on the radio, that drew Ms. \n     Collins away from classical piano. And as she sang this \n     ballad of unrequited love, death and grief, her vocal \n     similarities with Stafford, who died last year, were \n     striking. Both singers expressed a demure self-containment in \n     unadorned phrases that imbued their performances with faraway \n     longing.\n       In recent years Ms. Collins has descended from the folk-\n     goddess pedestal to emerge as a funny, self-effacing Irish-\n     American storyteller, and the tension between her pristine \n     singing voice and her salty reminiscences lends her shows a \n     theatrical dimension. She reminisced at length about her \n     first meeting with Leonard Cohen, who had no confidence in \n     his talents until she recorded his song ``Suzanne.'' He \n     returned the favor by persuading her to take up songwriting.\n       Her wildest tale described an adventure in Chicago on a \n     winter night in which she caroused until 3 a.m. with two \n     folk-singing colleagues, one of whom gave her a handgun for \n     protection during the walk back to her hotel. Once safely in \n     her room, she tried to remove the clip, and the gun went off.\n       Those were the wild old days to which Ms. Collins \n     increasingly alludes in her shows. The more she talks about \n     her itinerant life as a folk musician, the more you want to \n     know. The high point of the show was her rendition of a \n     recent Jimmy Webb song, ``Paul Gauguin in the South Seas.'' \n     The song, which describes the painter's retreat from \n     civilization in a search for paradise that eventually landed \n     him in the Marquesas Islands, evokes the quest of any artist \n     for sacred ground that has never been visited: an elusive \n     place Ms. Collins conjures when her voice soars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4955-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4955-S4956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BUDDY AND JULIE MILLER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marcelle and I have gotten to know Buddy \nand Julie Miller over the years--especially with their friend of ours, \nEmmy Lou Harris. So many times when I have traveled I have listened to \nBuddy and Julie's music on my headphones and one of the great thrills I \nhad was when they dedicated a song to Marcelle and me years ago at the \nBirchmere.\n  The Wall Street Journal this week wrote an excellent article about \nthe ``first couple of Americana.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 28, 2009]\n\nBuddy and Julie Miller: First Couple of Americana Sings of Setbacks and \n                                Sorrows\n\n                            (By Barry Mazor)\n\n       Nashville--By virtue of their broad musical \n     accomplishments, Buddy and Julie Miller have essentially \n     reigned since the mid-1990s as the unpretentious but royal \n     couple of Americana music, that lovably motley modern-roots \n     music genre derived from the American music traditions of \n     country, folk, gospel, roots rock and more. Their CDs, \n     whether recorded together or individually, have consistently \n     garnered high praise for both the songs they write for them \n     and for the often touching, sometimes feisty country-soul \n     delivery. Their long-incubating new release, ``Written In \n     Chalk'' (New West Records), is no different in that regard.\n       Songs of theirs have been recorded by everyone from country \n     hit makers Lee Ann Womack, Patty Loveless, the Dixie Chicks \n     and Dierks Bentley, to jazz great Jimmy Scott. Mr. Miller was \n     seen bringing his always coveted, tasteful guitar work behind \n     Alison Krauss and Robert Plant on this year's Grammy Awards \n     show, as he did throughout their recent tour of major arenas. \n     (Led Zeppelin veteran Mr. Plant performs a comic duet with \n     Mr. Miller on the\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\n     new release.) And Mr. Miller has produced records for Solomon \n     Burke, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Allison Moorer.\n       Still, Mr. Miller, 56, and the more flamboyant Mrs. Miller, \n     52, are by temperament genuinely modest, and each, during \n     separate recent interviews, remarked on being taken aback by \n     the international outpouring of good wishes and concern that \n     followed Mr. Miller's triple-bypass surgery. He'd felt a \n     heart attack coming on after a Feb. 19 performance with \n     Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin and Shawn Colvin in Baltimore.\n       ``The first month was rough; then it got better,'' Mr. \n     Miller noted. ``I feel like I'd been beaten with baseball \n     bats by a couple of the Sopranos, but I'm doing good. I've \n     got a free pass to rest--no dates until June.\n       ``You know, after the heart attack and surgery, a side \n     effect was that all my senses were really heightened. For a \n     week or so, I could smell somebody down the hall and my \n     hearing was really heightened. And that kind of beautiful \n     note that John Deaderick plays on keyboards on the record, \n     the kind that really hurts you, would make me start weeping \n     uncontrollably. It was kind of cool; I was hoping I could \n     hold on to part of that--although it wouldn't be so good on \n     stage!''\n       Nine of the dozen songs on ``Written In Chalk'' were \n     written by Mrs. Miller, and--some comic change-ups and love \n     songs with attitude aside--most of them concern loss or \n     learning to be reconciled with personal setbacks, as titles \n     such as ``Everytime We Say Goodbye'' and ``Hush, Sorrow'' \n     suggest. As many fans of the Millers are generally aware, \n     Mrs. Miller has not been seen on stage harmonizing with Mr. \n     Miller or engaging in their George Burns-Gracie Allen style \n     badinage for the past five years. She's been sidelined by the \n     severely exhausting, painful condition fibromyalgia and by \n     the sudden loss of her brother, killed when he was struck by \n     lightning. Some of the new songs that seem most to reflect \n     that experience in particular were, in truth, composed before \n     the event.\n       ``One of the things that sort of broke me,'' Mrs. Miller \n     recalls, ``was that I went to Texas to be with my mother \n     after my brother died, and when she asked about the record \n     I'd been working on for half a year before that, I couldn't \n     remember one single thing about it, not a note. When I came \n     back to Nashville and found the notebook with those songs in \n     it, they were all so strangely prophetic that it freaked me \n     out.''\n       As a practical matter, Mr. Miller's packed schedule and \n     Mrs. Miller's physical restrictions made it difficult to get \n     this record made, delayed it, and inevitably affected the \n     nature of their collaboration on it. There are, for instance, \n     fewer outright duets on the record than on previous joint \n     efforts.\n       ``I worked on this so long, starting and stopping in \n     between tours,'' Mr. Miller recalls, ``that it was hard to \n     gain perspective on it. It started out as her record, but she \n     couldn't finish it, and it went back and forth. It's \n     difficult for Julie to start and stop; she kind of gives \n     everything together, everything she's got. So she would just \n     get started sometimes and I'd have to go back on the road, \n     which was really, really difficult for her--and that went on \n     for years.''\n       ``It's funny,'' Mrs. Miller says. ``We live just a few \n     blocks from Music Row, where people make appointments to meet \n     and write songs for three hours. But I have to get totally \n     lost in my soul and go oblivious to time and space and \n     surroundings--and Buddy's the only person I can do that with. \n     But he's been so busy and structured, and me so completely \n     not. Unless I'm pressured, it's like I have my own radio \n     station going that I can just tune into for songs; it's like \n     whoever is doing the songwriting in me is playing, and three \n     or four years old. Once you let them know they have to do it, \n     they can't handle it.''\n       It's more than a little surprising, but Mrs. Miller has not \n     actually heard the released ``Written In Chalk'' CD. ``Is \n     that ridiculous?'' she asked. ``I never listen to anything \n     I'm on after it's recorded, because I'm always tormented; \n     I'll wish there was something I hadn't done.'' With the \n     record overdue, Mr. Miller finished mixing the recordings in \n     their state-of-the-art home-based studio, as he would most of \n     the time--but to speed getting the job done at last, he did \n     it with headphones on, so Mrs. Miller couldn't hear the sonic \n     calls he was making, a source, they both admit, of some \n     tension.\n       Mrs. Miller, however, characterizes her husband as ``one of \n     the all-time great singers in the universe, with a unique \n     sound--strong yet feeling very deeply, and emotionally \n     vulnerable.'' And Mr. Miller says that the songs his wife \n     writes ``are unique, not contrived; they come from such a \n     pure place. She never writes anything that hasn't come from \n     somebody's experience that's affected her. There's a place of \n     innocence and depth at the same time that really gets me.''\n       Mr. Miller hopes, he says, that the many songs his wife has \n     backed up and stored will still yield an outright Julie \n     Miller album sometime soon, but that's far from a foregone \n     conclusion. He, meanwhile, is already booked to finish \n     producing a gospel CD for Patty Griffin, to return as musical \n     director of the Fall Americana Music Awards, and then to get \n     to work on a record project with the jazz- and country-\n     influenced Bill Frisell and Marc Ribot.\n       Whatever (and whenever) the musical outcomes, the Millers \n     can be sure that there's an audience waiting expectantly--\n     with considerable love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4956-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4956-S4957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARILYN BERGMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy to have this opportunity to \nhonor the many accomplishments and contributions of my good friend, \nMarilyn Bergman. Marcelle and I have had the pleasure of knowing both \nMarilyn and her husband Alan for years. They are as accomplished \nsongwriters as I have ever met. For the past 15 years, Marilyn has \nserved as the distinguished president and chairman of the board of the \nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, a position never \nbefore held by a woman.\n  Marilyn's list of achievements is vast and impressive. Her work as a \nchampion of the arts has brought about many important changes. She was \ninstrumental in developing ``A Bill of Rights for Songwriters and \nComposers''--an initiative designed to raise public awareness of the \ntremendous contribution and rights of those who make music. In \naddition, she has gone to great lengths to support and promote the work \nof female songwriters.\n  This month, Marilyn will step down from her position as chairman of \nthe board of ASCAP and will move on to the next phase of her career. I \nknow that she will bring the same commitment to excellence and vitality \nto all of her future endeavors and Marcelle and I wish her only the \nbest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an April 8, 2009 ASCAP press \nrelease describing Marilyn's work be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From an American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Press \n                        Release on Apr. 8, 2009]\n\n Marilyn Bergman to Step Down as President and Chairman of ASCAP After \n                                15 Years\n\n       Los Angeles/New York: April 8, 2009: Three-time Academy \n     Award-winning songwriter Marilyn Bergman today announced her \n     decision to step down as President and Chairman of the Board \n     of ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors and \n     Publishers). Her successor will be elected by the ASCAP Board \n     of Directors during their next meeting later this month.\n       Bergman was the first woman to be elected to the ASCAP \n     Board of Directors and was named President and Chairman of \n     the Board in 1994. She will continue to serve as an active \n     Board Member.\n       Commenting on her decision, Bergman said: ``I am grateful \n     to have had the honor of serving as the President and \n     Chairman of ASCAP for 15 years, and am exceedingly proud of \n     all that was accomplished during my tenure. I will continue \n     to be a passionate advocate for all music creators through my \n     work on the ASCAP Board of Directors. But in terms of the \n     Presidency itself, I see that now is the right time to step \n     down.''\n       Bergman noted that she and her writing partner and husband, \n     Academy Award-winning songwriter Alan Bergman, have a number \n     of new projects in the works which require her focus. ``Alan \n     has always been supportive of the time that my ASCAP \n     Presidency required. But with so much exciting work before \n     us, I feel it's time that I fully devote myself to my first \n     calling: writing. So I look forward to shifting my energy \n     back to our work, while having the privilege to continue to \n     serve ASCAP and my fellow music creators.''\n       The Bergmans have just completed work on Steven \n     Soderbergh's film, The Informant, with composer Marvin \n     Hamlisch, and are currently working on two musical theatre \n     projects, one with Marvin and one with Michel Legrand. They \n     are also at work on Visions of America: A Photo Symphony \n     Celebrating the Sites and Songs of Democracy with renowned \n     photographer Joseph Sohm and composer Roger Kellaway. This \n     was premiered at the Kimmel Center-Verizon Hall on January \n     25, 2009 in Philadelphia with Peter Nero and the Philly Pops.\n       A Strong Legacy of Advocacy, Education and Growth\n       Bergman's 15-year tenure as President and Chairman of the \n     Board of ASCAP was marked by a series of noteworthy \n     achievements, all of which have had a positive and lasting \n     impact on music creators.\n       As a passionate voice for the rights of music creators, \n     Bergman has a strong presence on Capitol Hill. She helped \n     lead ASCAP to several major legislative victories, including \n     most notably the Supreme Court's decision in 2003 to uphold \n     the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which \n     extended copyright protection an extra 20 years--to the life \n     of the author plus 70 years. Other legislative highlights \n     include:\n       Helming ASCAP through the modernization of the Federal \n     consent decree that governs ASCAP's operations.\n       Leading ASCAP's lobbying effort that helped secure the \n     passage and signing of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n     in 1998--bringing the U.S. into line with World Intellectual \n     Property Organization treaties and strengthening music \n     copyrights on the Internet.\n       Serving on the National Information Infrastructure Advisory \n     Council (NIIAC) from 1994\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\n     to 1995, at the request of Vice President Al Gore. Serving \n     two terms (from 1994 to 1998) as President of CISAC, the \n     International Confederation of Performing Right Societies.\n       Most recently, Bergman played a key role in the launch of A \n     Bill of Rights for Songwriters and Composers, an ASCAP \n     advocacy and awareness-building initiative designed to remind \n     the public, the music industry and Members of Congress of the \n     central role and rights of those who create music.\n       Bergman was also instrumental in the launch of the ASCAP I \n     Create Music EXPO, the premier conference for songwriters, \n     composers and producers. The 4th annual EXPO is set to take \n     place at the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel in Los Angeles, \n     April 23-25, 2009.\n       She has also been a strong supporter of educating young \n     people about the creative process and the rights inherent in \n     the creation of music. Programs established under her \n     leadership include:\n       The ASCAP Foundation Children Will Listen Program--created \n     in honor of ASCAP member and musical theatre great Stephen \n     Sondheim (West Side Story, Gypsy!, Pacific Overtures, A \n     Little Night Music) to provide the musical theatre experience \n     to a generation of students who might not otherwise have this \n     opportunity.\n       The ASCAP Foundation Creativity in the Classroom Program--\n     designed to help students recognize their own creative work, \n     to understand their rights as owners of intellectual property \n     and to respect the ethics of protecting the creative property \n     of others.\n       The Donny the Downloader Experience in partnership with i-\n     SAFE Inc., the worldwide leader in Internet safety \n     education--an interactive school assembly program aimed at \n     educating middle school students on what it means to be a \n     music creator and the real cost of music piracy.\n       The Junior ASCAP Members (J.A.M.) Program in partnership \n     with MENC: The National Association for Music Education--\n     created to support and nurture music students, and to educate \n     them on the value of music and the importance of intellectual \n     property rights.\n       She also supported the development of The ASCAP Foundation/\n     Lilith Fair Songwriting Contest--a national competition \n     designed to encourage unsigned women songwriters, co-\n     sponsored by The ASCAP Foundation and Lilith Fair.\n       ``From the moment she assumed the role of President and \n     Chairman of the Board, Marilyn worked tirelessly on behalf of \n     our membership to the benefit of all music creators,'' said \n     John LoFrumento, CEO of ASCAP. ``She has been tremendously \n     effective in helping ASCAP anticipate the changing needs of \n     our members--particularly given the immense shifts that have \n     occurred in music, technology and society as a whole over the \n     past decade. I will greatly miss the insights and \n     collaborative spirit that she brought to our working \n     relationship. But I am comforted to know that Marilyn will \n     remain a strong and active presence on our Board of \n     Directors.''\n       Bergman presided over the largest expansion of ASCAP \n     membership in the history of the organization--growing from \n     55,000 when she assumed the Presidency in 1994 to a current \n     membership of more than 350,000 music creators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4957-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 100 YEAR BIRTHDAY OF GLENROCK, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I appreciate a lot of what you stand for and accomplish in \n     DC. I am a high school teacher in Idaho and have chosen to \n     take a $10,000 cut in pay to have the opportunity of teaching \n     privately instead of remaining in the public system. So, in \n     addition to all the common woes of teachers, I have no \n     benefits and a smaller paycheck.\n       I ask not for more pay; I only work 180 days a year, for \n     crying out loud. But I hold to that centuries-old \n     conviction--that the free American can provide for himself, \n     his community, his beloved nation, and for the world around \n     him when he so chooses. But the regulated, restrained, and \n     restricted American will find himself captive and controlled \n     as he watches the oppression, long familiar to the history of \n     mankind, push individual freedoms aside in favor of the \n     omniscience of a well-meaning government.\n       I, with my wife and six children, used to travel every \n     summer to Mexico and the Western states. We no longer do so, \n     but we need no assistance from the Senate. We used to visit \n     Yellowstone and Craters of the Moon every spring and fall. We \n     no longer do so, but we need no assistance from the Senate. \n     We used to drive to visit grandparents in California every \n     Christmas. We no longer do so, but we need no assistance from \n     the Senate. Please, as you fought against climate change \n     legislation, fight also against any financial assistance that \n     would result in using tax monies.\n       Our country flourishes best when its people are trusted to \n     be wise beyond mere elections.

I met you \n     personally one fall evening after you and other friends had \n     spent the day duck hunting and were in a very close game of \n     shuffle board. The town of Hagerman enjoys our fame for the \n     duck hunting and the people it brings to our town. The sport \n     of hunting is not cheap, and now with the gas prices??\n       I work for Con Paulos Chevrolet in Jerome. It is 33-mile \n     trip one way. It used to cost $30.00 to $40.00 a week to get \n     to my job. Now it is $60.00 plus. Same car, a minivan, 2005. \n     How do our farmers and ranchers survive with their pick up 44 \n     and the farm produce trucks? So gas is up, food is up and \n     Idaho Power needs a rate hike again. Our salaries in southern \n     Idaho are not up. Companies cannot afford any raises due to \n     all the ups. The oil companies report massive earnings, yet \n     we are paying and paying and paying. Why cannot someone put a \n     cap on the gas? Stop it dead; just say no. The gas \n     speculators would have to deal with that, the oil companies \n     should be sued by the people they are gouging and get busy \n     building refineries and spend some of that money we are \n     paying them for better fuels or give it back.\n       Does it seem to you that the Middle East has been planning \n     our demise for some time now? It is working. The panic is \n     just around the corner; why cannot we see it coming?\n                                                  Deana, Hagerman.\n       P.S. I was impressed with one thing about you the evening \n     we met. You drank water!\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a recent graduate of BYU-Idaho, and I still live in \n     Rexburg. I have a job working for an engineering firm in \n     Idaho Falls. Each day I commute the 30 miles to work. This \n     commute is becoming increasingly expensive, and I am \n     considering alternatives on how to get to work and back. \n     Public transportation is limited to Idaho Falls, and I am the \n     only one from work who comes from Rexburg making it difficult \n     to carpool. One thing I have done is bought a Honda Accord. \n     It gets good gas mileage and reliability to save on the \n     travel costs. I would like to buy American-made cars if they \n     could match the reliability and economy of some of the \n     foreign cars. With the high-cost of gasoline driving my focus \n     though, I am forced to spend our American dollars on foreign \n     cars.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n     I know the automakers are rapidly trying to change, but in \n     the meantime, they are losing money, making it more \n     difficult.\n       I also know firsthand that research currently being done at \n     the INL on syngas production from nuclear power plants \n     coupled with hydrogen production plants could completely \n     revolutionize the gasoline market. It would allow us to still \n     use gasoline, and so not have to change our infrastructure, \n     but we would never have to dig any more fossil fuels. We \n     could make our own hydrocarbons chemically. If done the right \n     way, this process would also be an almost zero pollution \n     process. The carbon would come from garbage, sewage, and \n     mulch already being collected at local dumps and waste \n     treatment facilities. Rather than rot and naturally send \n     methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (that so many \n     people seem to be worried about these days), it would be used \n     in the production of hydrocarbons. The carbon that would \n     already be entering the atmosphere through the decomposition \n     process would just be intercepted and used it in our fuel. A \n     patent has already been filed on this technology. I feel like \n     one way to help in lowering energy costs is to give groups \n     like this one in Idaho ample funding to develop these \n     technologies. The budget on that program is entirely too \n     small.\n       If you are looking for areas to get funding from, I would \n     suggest rerouting some of the money being sent to help out \n     ``honest'' consumers who did not realize they were getting \n     into a debt-trap by overspending, overborrowing, and over-\n     mortgaging their lives. It is a sad situation, but fiscal \n     responsibility will never be instilled in our minds if the \n     government is always standing by with a handout. In the long \n     run, a future catastrophe could be avoided if we ride this \n     crisis out and educate our consumers but do not give a \n     handout. People are still responsible for their actions, even \n     if millions are guilty of them. A $300 billion handout does \n     not seem like it teaches us as consumers anything.\n       Thank you for considering my comments; I hope they are \n     helpful. If you have any further questions or comments, I \n     would love to talk.\n     Bryant, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to vent on energy. I believe \n     we should look past the current prices and look to be energy \n     independent ASAP. There is so much technology available in \n     almost all areas of energy. Renewable sources such as solar \n     wind and hydro should be promoted along with bios out of \n     byproducts and waste. Fuel from our food bad idea. Assistance \n     for private enterprise to facilitate the distribution of \n     hydrogen gas since the current energy providers do not want \n     to make the investment because it will cost them. Let them \n     know it will really cost them if they do not move in that \n     direction the tech for hydrogen is amazing and profitable at \n     $4 as I understand it, production cost on large scale would \n     be under $3 per gallon and is our best long term source. \n     Combine that with solar as the tech becomes available our \n     cars and homes and roads etc. will be painted with solar \n     collectors. Right now! It should be required to have a \n     posting of where fuel comes from (nation of origin) like \n     seafood so we can choose not to support our enemies even if \n     it costs us more. States should make the decisions on mining \n     exploration and development of resources. Help the \n     innovations get power to the people. This should be what \n     saves freedom and liberty. Get the government out of the way \n     and let free I mean really free enterprise be allowed to work \n     remove the restrictions on new refineries and development of \n     hydrogen gas take all the red tape out of the way and let us \n     get with it and nuclear power as well. Let us do it and do it \n     now.\n     Harold.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a wife and mother of two children with another on his \n     way (July 21st C-section is planned). We are a family who \n     strongly believes in the importance of the mother staying at \n     home in a child's early years to ensure confidence, morals, \n     and stability is taught before each child starts school. Due \n     to these strong beliefs, we are a one-income family living \n     off $39,500 per year before taxes and church tithing. Living \n     on such a strict budget to ensure that I can stay home with \n     my young children has not been easy over the last few years. \n     We do not enjoy conveniences most Americans take for granted \n     so we do not have to put our children in someone else's care. \n     For example, we do not subscribe to the newspaper, cable or \n     satellite television, any magazines, and until having the \n     need for my husband and I to finish our degrees in an \n     internet-based university, we did not have home internet \n     access for six years.\n       Financially, we have been struggling for years; however, \n     now gas, energy, food, health care, and utility prices have \n     consistently risen at such enormous rates, I am facing having \n     to leave my young children and new baby in daycare and go \n     back to work. Even so, when I was working before and my \n     children were just babies, my paycheck went straight to \n     daycare and I was lucky to break even financially. Obviously, \n     I quit to tend to my own children to ensure they were getting \n     the nurturing they needed and due to the fact that my family \n     financial contribution was canceled out by daycare costs. \n     Even though I have a degree now, I will have three children \n     as well, and I cannot imagine I will be able to find a high \n     enough paying job to break even anywhere in the Boise area. \n     With the economy and housing instabilities, the last thing \n     our family wants to risk is moving to another area for an \n     insecure job and not being able to get back into a house, \n     which is the only secure item in our lives right now. So, we \n     are stuck . . . not to mention I have such incredibly low \n     confidence, (after just graduating at the end of May), that \n     my husband and I could support a larger family; thus, I am \n     having my tubes tied. These economic stresses are taking \n     control of our way of life, family, future goals, and now \n     even the size of our family (and therefore future generations \n     of our family).\n       How do we battle the high rise in gasoline and energy costs \n     (and everything being affected by these prices) when employee \n     income levels have been stagnant or only rising 2-3% for \n     years? Expenses have risen from 10% to 200% on varying \n     services and products. The economy has spun out of control \n     and, for Idahoan families like ours, we feel completely \n     helpless and in dire straits for the future. Just making ends \n     meet from paycheck to paycheck and trying our best to stay \n     out of credit card debt has been tough enough, but now with \n     two sets of student loans going into repayment with no hope \n     of an income increase and yet substantial increases in \n     necessity items, what hope do we have of ever saving a dime \n     for retirement or kids' college expenses? The future is \n     looking extremely dim, and we feel trapped. I guess my \n     husband and me, both college-educated and wanting to obtain \n     MBAs, may have to give up on our dreams and get two jobs a \n     piece and put our children in full-time day and night child \n     care to make ends meet. The sad thing is I do not feel any \n     confidence this will be a short-term sacrifice but the way of \n     life for the future. I only see things getting worse. I have \n     lost confidence our country will ever get to a better place \n     economically. America may have to change the border patrol to \n     the Mexican side as Americans may start jumping the border \n     soon to a better life down in Mexico!!\n       Thank you for your time and what you are doing to try to \n     get us out of this mess.\n     Janiel, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read your e-mail regarding your request as to how high \n     energy prices have been affecting me and my family, and may I \n     say the effect has been positive. Now that gasoline prices \n     more accurately reflect what actually is happening in the \n     global market, I have been taking steps to reduce my gasoline \n     consumption.\n       Primarily, my family and I are no longer taking unnecessary \n     trips, but are trying to consolidate trips to the store or \n     other venues so as to maximize the efficiency of our trips, \n     rather than taking repeat trips to the same or nearby \n     locations. We are attempting to carpool as much as possible, \n     and have been utilizing alternative forms of transportation \n     such as bicycling. Also, I have been altering my driving \n     techniques in order to be more fuel efficient, for example, \n     driving slower, and slowing and accelerating more gradually.\n       All these techniques are simple and painless, as well as \n     being beneficial both economically and environmentally. It is \n     unfortunate that those of you who have the power to act to \n     change how we as a nation utilize our energy lacked the \n     perspicacity to make changes in our energy policy which would \n     likely have prevented, or at least softened the impact from \n     these market changes.\n       However, now that the market has taken over, I believe it \n     would be disingenuous of you to attempt ``reform'' that would \n     ultimately lead to more of the same. Please allow the market \n     to drive oil prices upward. This will result in ordinary \n     citizens such as me conserving fuel, which will lead to \n     diminished greenhouse gases and less global warming. It will \n     also allow alternative forms of clean and renewable energy to \n     be more competitive in the global market, encouraging \n     entrepreneurship which will stimulate our lagging economy, \n     create new jobs, and will be a market driven path to \n     decreased greenhouse gas emissions and reduction in global \n     warming.\n       I hope you have the courage and the integrity to evaluate \n     what is currently occurring in the energy market rationally. \n     Please do not interfere with the counterproductive and likely \n     ineffectual means you are proposing.\n     Frank.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to tell you about how the high energy prices \n     are affecting me personally, as well as my family. I am an \n     outside salesperson with my company, and as such, I must \n     travel around to see different clients as well as potential \n     clients. Even though I do not necessarily travel great \n     distances as in metropolitan areas, the distances between \n     towns here in the Magic Valley are substantial. So, in order \n     to service my clients and get new business, I have gone from \n     spending approximately $150 per month in fuel to almost $300 \n     per month, and that with cutting back on who I see. My salary \n     is based on sales, so the more I see and sell, the more I \n     make. With cutting back on where I go and who I see, my \n     potential for better earnings, for my family, is greatly \n     inhibited; and with the increase in fuel, I have actually \n     taken a decrease in pay!\n       Then there is the issue of my parents who are on a fixed \n     income, with the increase in their fuel costs and the costs \n     at the grocery store, results from the increase in fuel. They \n     have no choices!\n       I believe that we need more domestic oil production, from \n     drilling where there is plenty of supply, to more refineries, \n     to whatever it takes! We here in rural Idaho do not\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\n     have mass transit, or any other alternative. I believe it is \n     high time that Congress stop catering to Big Oil and \n     conservationists who do not have a clue. Please help your \n     constituents!\n     Vern, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for soliciting and receiving emails about the \n     high energy prices. As is so often heard these days, \n     ``something has to be done''. We are a middle class, working \n     family with two adult children (one in the Coast Guard, one \n     soon to leave for college) and one teen driver (yikes!) still \n     at home. I could elaborate on and on about how gas prices are \n     affecting all of us but will try to keep it concise. We had \n     been planning a congratulatory vacation to Hawaii for our \n     family for quite some time--to congratulate one son for \n     graduation from high school and to honor our son in the Coast \n     Guard for his promotion. Due to gas prices, we have had to \n     scale down our trip and will now be camping on the beach in \n     Oregon. Our youngest is working full time, so we have given \n     him the use of our fuel-efficient car to get to and from \n     work. He is unable to ride a bike due to traffic and for his \n     safety. Therefore we are using a vehicle (not by choice) that \n     is not fuel-efficient to commute to work. In an effort to \n     keep it affordable, we are carpooling and will soon be taking \n     the motorcycle safety course in hopes to utilize a \n     motorcycle. Using a motorcycle is only a band aid as it will \n     not help in the winter. We have been looking for a used fuel-\n     efficient vehicle, but the prices have climbed dramatically \n     and they are very hard to find. I am so disappointed in the \n     gas mileage for all cars on the market. I know that our \n     country can improve this. Hondas and Toyotas for example have \n     gotten over 30 mpg for many years. Why cannot we raise the \n     bar and demand at least 35 mpg?\n       My husband and I have discussed the huge ``trickle-down'' \n     that the gas prices will have on the economy. Because of the \n     high gas prices, we have chosen to cut out other services. We \n     are no longer subscribing to the Idaho Statesman (which we \n     have always taken), we will be discontinuing our home phone \n     service and are cutting back any way we can. I know of other \n     people such as us who are doing the same. The impact of these \n     cutbacks is just beginning to be seen, such as with \n     Starbucks, Round Table and other businesses closing. We \n     understand that we will be contributing to this downturn by \n     cutting back on services but it is necessary.\n       Again, thank you in advance for your help with this matter.\n     Gail and Dennis.\n                                  ____\n\n       Here is an addition to the testimonials you asked for \n     recently concerning the effects on the high price of fuel. \n     Not only am I going broke due to high gas prices, food costs, \n     etc., but also this is the first year we have had to scratch \n     items off the grocery shopping list.

I support the work of the George J. Mitchell \nScholarship Program which seeks to strengthen relations between the \nUnited States and Ireland. Like the great man it is named after, the \nGeorge J. Mitchell Scholarship Program fosters connections between \nfuture generations of American leaders and their Irish counterparts, \nregardless of ancestry. It seeks to further the education of American \nstudents through post graduate studies while building bonds between the \nMitchell Scholars and the Irish and the Northern Ireland communities in \nwhich they live and study.\n  Like many Pennsylvanians, my family can trace its ancestry to \nIreland. Through the generations, our connection with and affinity for \nthe Emerald Isle has deepened. However, with fewer and fewer Irish \nmoving to America, it is critical that we encourage all Americans, not \njust those with Irish ancestry, to forge connections with the Irish \npeople. While Irish Americans have become Mitchell Scholars, so too \nhave young Americans from different backgrounds.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will soon be welcoming Alexandra \nChirinos, who will work as a judicial law clerk for the Honorable \nLegrome Davis in the Federal Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nAlexandra was born in Mexico and graduated from the University of \nTexas, Austin. Her college thesis explored the factors that cause \nmigrant women to endure domestic abuse and examined the reasons why \nexisting abuse prevention programs were ineffective in migrant \ncommunities. She founded the UT Bilingual Mentoring Program as well as \nthe Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar Chapter dedicated to providing \nacademic and service opportunities for students of all backgrounds. As \na Mitchell Scholar, she obtained her MA in human rights law from the \nNational University of Ireland Galway and Queen's University, Belfast. \nShe then graduated from Harvard Law School, where she was the executive \neditor of the Latino Law Review, the copresident of the Latin American \nLaw Society and one of the founding members of the Harvard Immigration \nProject.\n  Alexandra's journey and commitment to intellectual achievement, \nleadership, and public service is just one example of the many young \nAmericans participating in and being inspired through the George J. \nMitchell Scholarship program. The bond between Pennsylvania and Ireland \nwill only deepen as Dan Rooney of Pittsburgh, PA, is the President's \nnominee to become the next U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. In that \ncapacity, I fully expect Dan to advance the cause of peace among the \nIrish people and to continue developing relationships between the \nUnited States and Ireland like those created through the George \nMitchell Scholarship Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4959-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING MILFORD JUNE ``DOLLY'' COOPER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to join \nme in honoring the memory of a dedicated servant and leader, Milford \nJune ``Dolly'' Cooper. After a lifetime of unprecedented service to his \nState and Nation as a World War II veteran and a member of the South \nCarolina House of Representatives, Mr. Cooper passed away in \nGreenville, SC, on April 26, 2009, at the age of 88.\n  While he will be remembered by most as a man who loved to help people \nand demonstrated an unwavering dedication to the community, I will \nremember him as a spirited, commanding, honest giant of a man. \nAffectionately referred to as ``Dolly'' by all who knew him, he was a \nWorld War II veteran who prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice on \nbehalf of our freedom. He served in the 30th Infantry Division and saw \n11 months of combat in Europe, at Normandy, at the Battle of the Bulge, \nand at the Rhine River. He was also involved with the capture of the \nlast large German city, Madgeburg, which was 45 miles from Berlin. For \nhis service he was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, American \nDefense Silver Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge, and the Belgian \nForragere Award.\n  Perhaps one of my greatest honors was to see that Mr. Cooper was in \nperson at the dedication of the National D-day Memorial on June 6, \n2001. This memorial is a tribute to Mr. Cooper's valor, fidelity, and \nsacrifice, and those who served along side him during the allied \ninvasion of Western Europe.\n  Born and raised in upstate South Carolina, Mr. Cooper attended \nPiedmont High School in 1937 and joined the South Carolina National \nGuard in Easley. After his service in the military, Mr. Cooper opened \nthe Piedmont Economy Store, which he solely owned and operated from \n1955 to 1999.\n  In 1974 he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives \non a platform of bringing health care services to rural South Carolina. \nMr. Cooper served House District 10 for 16 years.\n  In addition to his time in politics, Mr. Cooper was active in the \nPelzer Lions Club for 55 years. He was member of the Medical University \nof South Carolina Board of Trustees from 1989 to 1996. Mr. Cooper also \nserved as a board member for the Pelzer Rescue Squad, the Appalachian \nHealth Council, and the Baptist Hospital Boards for Easley and \nColumbia. After decades of serving South Carolina, Mr. Cooper was \nawarded the Order of the Palmetto from Governor Carroll Campbell in \n1989.\n  Mr. Cooper is survived by his wife of 61 years, Melba Blackmon \nCooper, by his four children, six grandchildren, and three great-\ngrandchildren.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in commemorating Mr. Cooper's \nlifelong dedication to service to our country and to the State of South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4959-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4959-S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HALEKULANI HOTEL\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Halekulani is, without \nquestion, one of\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nthe signature hotels of Hawaii. It is synonymous of the interweaving of \nluxury hospitality and Hawaii's unique history and local culture. Its \nroots trace back some 200 years when Princess Likelike and ancient \nHawaiian fishermen named its Waikiki beachfront location Halekulani, or \nthe ``house befitting heaven.''\n  This year, the Halekulani is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its \nreopening in 1984, following a grand property-wide renovation by its \ncurrent owners, Mitsui Fudosan, USA, Inc., a branch of one of Japan's \nleading companies.\n  This new chapter for the Halekulani builds on its fabled history, and \nstrengthens and expands its international reputation for excellence and \ncommunity involvement. The Halekulani is more than a unique visitor \nexperience with open courtyards, lush gardens, ocean breezes, and a spa \nthat offers the healing touch of Polynesian traditions; it is also an \nenthusiastic promoter of Hawaii's history and the arts, sponsoring the \nHonolulu Symphony's ``Halekulani Masterworks'' and offering guests \nspecial access to Hawaii's leading museums and historic buildings.\n  In 1907, the original Halekulani opened as a residential hotel owned \nby Robert Lewers that was called the Hau Tree with a beachfront home \nand five bungalows. Ten years later, Juliet and Clifford Kimball bought \nthe hotel, renamed it the Halekulani, and began catering to well-do-to \ntravelers. In 1962, the Norton Clap family of Seattle bought the hotel, \nand sold it 39 years later to Mitsui Fudosan, USA.\n  While each owner of the Halekulani sought to enhance the hotel's \ndistinctiveness in different ways, all four shared a common goal: a \ncommitment to excellence that remains unwavering.\n  I congratulate the Halekulani as it celebrates the 25th anniversary \nof its reopening, and as it looks forward to a bright future. I am \ncertain its owners will continue their best efforts to maintain the \nHalekulani as a landmark hotel, a leader in the international travel \nand visitor industry, and an icon of Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4960-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MARGARET JOHNSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I honor in the Record of the \nSenate LTC Margaret A. Johnson of the Georgia Army National Guard on \nthe occasion of her retirement after 22 years of service.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, who is from Macon, GA, graduated from \nWesleyan College in 1969 with a bachelor's degree in English, and in \n1976 received a master's degree in English from the University of South \nFlorida. In 1980 she graduated from Mercer University's Walter F. \nGeorge School of Law with a juris doctor degree. Lieutenant Colonel \nJohnson took her impressive resume to the Georgia National Guard and \nwas commissioned as first lieutenant into the Judge Advocate General \nCorps.\n  During her 22 years of service, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was given \nmany challenging assignments throughout the United States, and rose to \nthe challenge on each and every occasion. When her country asked her to \nserve in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, she answered the call \nand has spent the last 2 years on active duty. Lieutenant Colonel \nJohnson culminated her career as the deputy staff judge advocate for \nthe Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy \nCombatants, Arlington, VA, where she rose to the challenge once again \nand performed her job duties excellently. She provided much-needed \nleadership for a legal department that had to quickly respond to ever \nchanging standards established by Congress and the Federal courts.\n  In testament to her service, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was awarded \nthe National Defense Service Medal, the Army Reserve Components \nAchievement Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Medal and the Georgia Meritorious Service Medal. I honor LTC \nMargaret A. Johnson on the occasion of her retirement, and I extend to \nher my sincere gratitude for her dedication to the defense of our \nnation. I know that Lieutenant Colonel Johnson's children, Mary \nCatherine Johnson and Margaret Amy Allen, are so proud of their mother \nfor her long and distinguished career, and I would also like to express \nmy gratitude to them as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4960-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASTRONAUTICS CORPORATION OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I acknowledge the outstanding \nachievements of the Astronautics Corporation of America which will be \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary in Milwaukee on May 31, 2009. I want \nto share a bit of background with my colleagues about the Astronautics \nCorporation and recognize their vital contribution to Milwaukee and the \nNation.\n  The Astronautics Corporation of America was established in 1959 when \nNate Zelazo and a small team of experienced engineers started their own \ncompany devoted to advanced technology in the aerospace field. Since \nthen, the company has become a trailblazer in developing and \nmanufacturing military and commercial electronics. Their products are \nused throughout the world in a wide range of sea, ground, and aerospace \napplications. Today, more than 100,000 aircraft use Astronautics flight \ninstruments, displays, computers, and components. The company keeps \njobs in Wisconsin while building technology systems that keep our \nservice men and women safe.\n  It is with great pride that I wish the Astronautics Corporation of \nAmerica congratulations on their 50th anniversary and continued success \nas innovators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4960-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4960-S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE LYME-OLD LYME FIRST ROBOTICS TEAM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the \n``Techno Ticks,'' the FIRST Robotics team from Lyme-Old Lyme High \nSchool in Old Lyme, CT, which won the Chairman's Award at the 2009 \nInternational FIRST Robotics Championship. The Chairman's Award is the \nmost prestigious honor given out at the FIRST competition, which this \nyear included 348 teams from most states in the United States as well \nas Brazil, Israel, Canada, and Mexico. It is awarded to the team that \nbest represents a model for other teams to emulate, and which embodies \nthe goals and purposes of FIRST.\n  FIRST--For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology--was \nestablished in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and \nparticipation in science and technology through a variety of mentor-\nbased programs that help young people develop skills in science, \ntechnology, and engineering. Every year, the FIRST Robotics Competition \nchallenges teams of high school students to design and build robots \nfrom a kit of hundreds of parts. The teams then control their robots in \na game against other teams. The goal of this program is not just to \nteach students about robotics, but help them to develop general problem \nsolving abilities as well as self-confidence, communication skills, and \nleadership.\n  Before participating in the International Competition, the Techno \nTicks won the Chairman's Award at the Connecticut FIRST Robotics \nCompetition for the 7th year in a row--a record amongst the more than \n1700 FIRST teams now in operation worldwide. This remarkable record of \nsuccess is a testament to the hard work and dedication of head coach \nWilliam Derry and all the students and faculty who have been a part of \nthe Techno Ticks over the last 11 years. The team has also benefitted \nfrom the efforts of many volunteers and supporters, including mentors \nfrom local businesses that generously share there time and expertise \nwith the team.\n  At a time when our Nation's ability to sustain a growing economy and \ncreate good jobs at home increasingly depends upon our achievements in \nscience and technology, the FIRST competition has helped to instill in \nmany young people a thirst for discovery that leads so many to pursue a \ncareer in the physical sciences. It is hardly surprising that so many \nformer Techno Ticks have gone on to study engineering. Two years ago, I \nwas fortunate enough to attend the Connecticut regional competition in \nHartford, and I couldn't help but be amazed by the creativity and \ndedication the Ticks and all the other teams put into building their \nrobots.\n  I offer my congratulations to Coach Derry and the Lyme-Old Lyme \nTechno Ticks for winning the Chairman's Award at the 2009 International \nFIRST Robotics Championship and commend\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\nall the faculty members, volunteers, mentors, and supporters who were \ninstrumental in their victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        41ST BRIGADE DEPLOYMENT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to show my appreciation \nfor the dedication and commitment of the Oregon National Guard. They \nare the best that Oregon has to offer. The best our Nation has to \noffer. I am honored, this weekend, to personally see off the largest \nOregon guard deployment since World War II.\n  Right now, 2,700 citizen soldiers from across my State are gearing up \nfor a 10-month deployment to Iraq, and I am positive that their actions \nwill bring honor to the United States and to the great State of Oregon.\n  Despite progress, Iraq remains a dangerous place. But our National \nGuard soldiers are well-trained, well-led and well-equipped. I know \nthey will do their best to complete their missions and return to their \nfamilies. I also know that our Nation has done its best to give them \nthe tools they need to do so safely and expediently.\n  I have been fortunate enough to meet with many of Oregon's citizen \nsoldiers more than once--first in the dust and heat of southern Idaho \nlast summer then in their armories in the days leading up to training \nat Camp Roberts. I made a promise to see them off when they are \ndeployed and I intend to be there to welcome all of them home after \ntheir courageous service is complete.\n  These are uncertain times--not only in the United States but around \nthe world. It is a world that is once again turning its eyes toward \nAmerica for leadership and inspiration. Now, more than ever, it is time \nfor America to be strong for those in need.\n  The Oregon National Guard is the face of that strength. Our men and \nwomen in uniform are this country's greatest representatives to the \nworld. While being strong, we must also demonstrate our values through \ncompassion, justice, and integrity.\n  I realize these soldiers have a difficult road ahead, which will \ninvolve both professional and personal struggles. Whether this is their \nfirst deployment or their fourth, their dedication and commitment will \nbe tested on a daily basis--but, courage and determination are their \nhallmarks.\n  Members of the Oregon National Guard are exactly the kind of soldiers \nthat our Founding Fathers believed could best defend this Nation--\nvolunteer citizen soldiers with roots in the community and a patriotic \nspirit.\n  I salute Oregon's great band of citizen soldiers. May God bless them \nand see each and every one of them home safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4961-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4961-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4961-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 10:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 586.

 By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Wicker, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 935. A bill to extend subsections (c) and (d) of section 114 of \nthe Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (Public Law \n110-173) to provide for regulatory stability during the development of \nfacility and patient criteria for long-term care hospitals under the \nMedicare program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould extend reasonable measures to protect access to long-term care \nhospitals, while ensuring that these institutions are admitting the \nappropriate type of patients. I am pleased to be introducing the bill \nalong with my colleague, Senator Hatch, and I urge my colleagues to \nconsider cosponsoring this cost-saving proposal.\n  Long Term Acute Care hospitals, or LTAC hospitals, serve a vital role \nin the Medicare program by providing care to beneficiaries with \nclinically complex conditions that need hospital care for extended \nperiods of time. I am happy to have two of these hospitals in North \nDakota, one in Fargo and one in Mandan. They are a vital part of the \nNorth Dakota continuum of care.\n  While these hospitals provide important health services to very frail \nindividuals, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nbecame concerned with the rapid growth in these facilities, and as a \nresult began to arbitrarily cut LTAC hospital payments across-the-\nboard. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, MMSEA, \nenacted important changes that included the development of much-needed \npatient and facility certification criteria to assure that the right \npatient is seen in the right post-acute care setting. This law issued a \nmoratorium on new facilities and expansions of older facilities and \nprovided regulatory relief to protect patient access to LTAC hospitals \nwhile patient criteria are being developed. The legislation I am \nintroducing today would extend these provisions by two years to provide \nstability to these hospitals and the patients they serve as CMS \nconsiders payment bundles and other changes in post-acute care.\n  As Chairman of the Budget Committee, I have a unique appreciation for \nthe enormous fiscal challenges that face our country and respect CMS's \nefforts to reduce growth in Medicare. We should address the growth in \nLTAC hospitals, but we also want to ensure that there is a place for \npatients who truly need long-term hospital stays.\n  It was not easy for the LTAC hospitals in North Dakota and across the \ncountry to support legislation that restricts their payments, but I \ncompliment them for working with me to put forward a constructive \npublic policy proposal. Long-term care hospitals serve a vital role in \nour health care system, and we must protect access to these facilities \nfor those who truly need it. But we can also take responsible steps to \nensure that our federal tax dollars are well spent and directed to the \nmost appropriate level of care. I believe my legislation achieves this \nbalance and urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend, Senator \nKent Conrad, and others in introducing the Medicare Long-Term Care \nHospital Improvement Act of 2009. This legislation would help ensure \nthat Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to long-term, \nacute-care,\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nLTAC, hospitals. These hospitals provide inpatient care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries who spend at least 25 days in the hospital. Typically, \nthe average patient stay in an acute care hospital is only six days. We \nhave several LTAC hospitals and facilities in Salt Lake, Provo, and \nBountiful, UT.\n  Our bill would extend for two more years the LTAC hospital moratorium \nincluded in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, \nMMSEA, P.L. 110-173. While MMSEA's LTAC hospital provisions helped the \nLTAC hospitals, they also addressed important issues raised by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, regarding these \nhospitals. Under MMSEA, new LTAC hospitals would not be allowed to open \nuntil the three year moratorium ends in 2010--the intent was to give \nCMS time to develop new federal standards on LTAC patient criteria. The \nbill that we are introducing today would extend the MMSEA moratorium \nfor another 2 years.\n  To my friends in the hospital community and to those responsible for \nissuing federal regulations impacting the hospital community, I urge \nyou to work together to address some of the valid concerns that have \nbeen raised with regard to LTAC hospitals. But I want these concerns \naddressed fairly so that beneficiaries will continue to have access to \nquality care and choice of long-term care coverage.\n  I also believe that while most LTAC hospitals provide good care in \nmany parts of the country, the industry must do a better job convincing \nCongress and Federal agencies that the type of care you provide is \nvaluable and necessary. Only truly sick patients should go to LTAC \nhospitals. Less medically-complex patients should be seen at less \nintensive facilities.\n  It is my hope that Federal officials making important decisions \nregarding LTACs get the job done. Five years ago, LTAC hospitals were \ntold that they needed new standards and yet, we have made limited \nprogress in this area. You need to finish this important job once and \nfor all! It needs to be done in partnership with the LTAC community. \nHopefully, the introduction of this bill will get the ball rolling in \nthis area.\n  Finally, President Obama's budget guidelines for fiscal year 2010 has \na bundling proposal that would include the payment of post-acute care \nwith the hospital payment system. The Senate Finance Committee is \nconsidering a similar proposal. Therefore, I do not want to leave the \nimpression with anyone that the introduction of this legislation is \nmeant to delay such a proposal from moving forward. However, I do \nbelieve that should bundling be seriously considered by Congress, all \nstakeholders should be included in those discussions, including the \nLTACH hospitals.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 940. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \nthe Nevada System of Higher Education certain Federal land located in \nClark and Nye counties, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Southern Nevada Higher Education Land Act of \n2009. This bill will expand opportunities for higher education in one \nof the nation's fastest growing areas, southern Nevada.\n  In July 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Land Grant College \nAct into law, creating a higher education legacy that continues to \nbenefit our country today. That bill, now referred to as the Morrill \nAct, provided 30,000 acres of Federal land per Member of Congress to \nestablish institutions of higher education in each State. Today, thanks \nin large part to the foresight of Senator Justin Smith Morrill from \nVermont and others from his time, this Nation has one of the finest \npublic university systems in the world.\n  Among the many universities established as a result of this forward-\nlooking legislation was the University of Nevada. The State's first \nuniversity was originally founded in Elko in 1874. Two years later, \nNevada's state legislature voted to move the university to its current \nhome in Reno. The University of Nevada remained the State's only higher \neducation institution for 75 years.\n  From these humble beginnings, the State of Nevada has expanded its \nhigher education system to now include two research universities, one \nState college, one research institution, and four community colleges. \nThe Nevada System of Higher Education, which was formed in 1968 and \nencompasses all eight institutions, has grown to serve roughly 98,000 \ndegree-seeking students.\n  As the State of Nevada continues to grow, so too must its university \nsystem. With over 2 million residents in 2007, greater Las Vegas is the \nfourth-largest metropolitan area in the Mountain West. In this decade \nalone, the area's population has grown by 31 percent, five times faster \nthan the Nation as a whole. We must expand higher education \nopportunities to meet the demands of this growing region.\n  Consider the following--bthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with \n28,000 students and 3,300 faculty and staff, is the fourth fastest-\ngrowing research university in the Nation. The College of Southern \nNevada, also in Las Vegas, serves 41,000 students and its three urban \ncampuses are at near capacity. The town of Pahrump, 60 miles from Las \nVegas in rural Nye County, has grown by 20 percent since 2000. Great \nBasin College's small branch campus in Pahrump uses high school \nclassrooms at night to serve the city's 41,000 residents.\n  Our legislation will make selected parcels of Federal lands available \nfor the future growth of the university system. Land will be provided \nfor new campuses for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; the College \nof Southern Nevada; and a Pahrump campus of Great Basin College. The \ncurrent campuses for these three institutions comprise 1,150 acres in \nsouthern Nevada. With the passage of this legislation, an additional \n2,400 acres will be available for new classroom, research, and \nresidential facilities to help further the missions of these three fine \ninstitutions.\n  To establish these new campuses, three parcels of land would be \nconveyed from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, to the Nevada System \nof Higher Education. Two of the parcels are located in Clark County, \nwithin the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, SNPLMA, disposal \nboundary. The third parcel is located in Pahrump, west of Las Vegas, in \nNye County. BLM has designated all of these parcels for disposal \nbecause they are surrounded by development and are difficult to manage.\n  It is important to point out that the land our legislation conveys \nfor the University of Nevada, Las Vegas borders Nellis Air Force Base. \nNellis was once on the outskirts of town, but now development is on its \ndoorstep. In order to protect the mission of the Nellis Air Force base, \nwe have put a special provision in the legislation requiring that the \nuniversity system and Air Force sign a binding agreement regarding \ndevelopment plans for the campus. The university system and the Air \nForce worked together on this issue for the last 3 years and have found \na middle ground that will serve the interests of both parties. We \ngreatly appreciate the efforts of the university system and the Air \nForce to make this work.\n  This same land bordering Nellis was once used as a small arms range \nduring World War II and will need to be cleaned up before it can be \nconveyed to the university system. Because it will take time to \naccomplish this, our legislation allows the land to be conveyed in \nphases, as the remediation is completed.\n  This proposal to expand higher education opportunities in southern \nNevada has been welcomed by area leaders. City and county officials \nhave worked closely with the Nevada System of Higher Education to plan \nthe development of world-class facilities in their communities. These \nfacilities are critical to meeting the challenge of diversifying their \neconomies and attracting and growing knowledge industries in the area.\n  I also want to note that a long-time champion of this legislation, \nand especially the Pahrump campus, passed away recently. Bob Swadell \nlived a life of service. He saw action in Korea where he earned a \nBronze Star and later worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. More \nrecently, Mr. Swadell devoted a great deal of his time to looking out \nfor the future of\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nPahrump. I regret that he will not be with us to see this legislation \nmove forward, but we will certainly keep his vision and spirit with us \nas we work on this important bill.\n  Just as the Morrill Act opened up Federal land to expand higher \neducation across the Nation, I am hopeful that this important, though \nmuch more modest effort can do the same for the residents of southern \nNevada. We look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking \nMember Murkowski and the other distinguished Members of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to move this legislation in an expeditious \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent the abuse of Government charge cards; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Government \nCharge Card Abuse Prevention Act to ensure that federal departments and \nagencies do not take the eye off the ball when it comes to spending the \ntaxpayers' money. I have put in a lot of time and effort to call \nattention to instances of waste, fraud, and abuse using government \ncharge cards while agencies were looking the other way. Now I want to \nmake sure that they stay on top of this issue.\n  In 1998, the General Service Administration's, GSA, entered into a \ncontract with a set of commercial banks to utilize charge cards, not \nunlike those used by businesses large and small and millions of \nconsumers worldwide. This is called the SmartPay' program. \nThese Government charge cards include government purchase cards, which \nare used for acquisition of commercial goods and services by agencies \nand paid directly by the agency, and Government travel cards, which are \nused to pay for individual Government travel expenses and issued in the \nname of individual government employees.\n  Government charge cards were intended as a low cost method to \nstreamline government acquisition and travel processes. The whole idea \nwas to adopt the best practices of the commercial sector. In the \nbusiness sector, charge cards have been a success. They save time and \nmoney. The main reason they work so well is because the control \nenvironment in the private sector is rock solid and accountability is a \nfact of life. When a business is spending its own money, it is going to \nbe sure that it accounts for every penny or it would not stay in \nbusiness. As a result, in corporate America, if an employee is caught \nabusing a card, they'll lose it or get fired.\n  This was not the case when the Federal Government began using charge \ncards. Federal agencies did not put in place the necessary controls to \nmake sure that all spending on charge cards was legitimate. When I \nstarted looking into this with the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, we uncovered blatant examples of wasteful spending like LA-Z-Boy \nreclining rocking chairs, kitchen appliances, and even a sapphire ring \nbeing paid for with Government purchase cards, with the American \ntaxpayer paying the bill.\n  Government travel cards have been used for gambling, sporting events, \nconcerts, cruises, and even gentlemen's clubs and legalized brothels! \nWhile travel cards are not paid directly with taxpayers' money like \npurchase cards, failure by employees to repay these cards results in \nthe loss of millions of dollars in rebates to the federal government. \nAlso, when credit card companies are forced to charge off bad debt, \nthey raise interest rates and fees on everyone else.\n  A series of GAO reports over the last decade have identified an \ninadequate and inconsistent control environment across numerous federal \nagencies with respect to both government purchase cards and Government \ntravel cards. This has led to millions of dollars in taxpayers' money \nwasted. In some cases purchases were outright fraudulent, and others \nwere of questionable need or were unnecessarily expensive. In each \nreport it has issued, the GAO has made recommendations about what kind \nof controls need to be implemented to prevent such abuses from \noccurring in the future. In many cases, the same controls were often \nmissing or inadequate, and therefore the same recommendations are \nrepeated in report after report. One agency would promise to clean up \nits act, but then we would find the exact same problems with another. \nThat is why I worked to develop legislation that would incorporate \nGAO's recommendations regarding some of the most basic controls needed \nin every agency to prevent abuse of government charge cards.\n  As a result of the pressure applied by the relentless oversight of \nCongress, the GAO, and agency Inspectors General, we have seen some \nprogress toward establishing a better control environment. In fact, the \nOffice of Management and Budget has issued a circular to agencies that \nseeks to bring about many of the controls we identified. However, this \nprogress would not have been possible without the continual spotlight \nbeing shone on the problem and the threat of congressional action. It \nis also clear that we still have a way to go in stamping out abuse of \ngovernment charge cards as evidenced by a GAO report on the internal \ncontrols for purchase cards governmentwide that came out just last \nyear.\n  That report found that a weak control environment led to government \npurchase cards being used for items like iPods at NASA, internet dating \nand pornographic sites at the Postal Service, women's lingerie from a \nplace called ``Seduction Boutique'' at the State Department that was \nsupposedly for use during jungle training'', and over $642,000 over six \nyears in fraudulent payments at the USDA for the cardholder's live-in \nboyfriend. These funds went for personal expenditures like gambling, \ncar loan and mortgage payments, and other retail purchases. Clearly we \nstill have a problem and that's why I'm determined to make sure this \nsituation is fixed once and for all.\n  In addition to requiring federal agencies to establish a series of \nbasic and vital internal controls that the GAO has found lacking in \nmany cases, my bill would also provide that each agency Inspector \nGeneral periodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card \nand travel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify \npotentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had \ngreat success working with Inspectors General using techniques like \ndata mining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge \ncards. Having this information on an ongoing basis will help maintain \nand strengthen a rigorous system of internal controls to prevent future \ninstances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government charge cards.\n  My bill also requires agencies to establish penalties so that \nemployees who abuse government charge cards will face real and \nconsistent consequences. This is necessary not only so that taxpayers \nknow that those who would squander their money are held accountable, \nbut also to send a message to other government employees that such \nbehavior will not be tolerated. In fact, these penalties must include \ndismissal in serious circumstances.\n  This legislation has been revised a number of times with considerable \ninput from the GAO as well as the Inspector General community and other \nstakeholders. I am also glad to have Chairman Lieberman and Ranking \nMember Collins as original cosponsors of this bill. Their help, \nassistance, and support has been very much appreciated as this \nlegislation has developed. The result is a carefully considered and \ntargeted piece of legislation that I look forward to seeing become law. \nI know that will give me and a great many American taxpayers more peace \nof mind about how their money is being spent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 944. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nSecretaries of the military departments to give wounded members of the \nreserve components of the Armed Forces the option of remaining on \nactive duty during the transition process in order to continue to \nreceive military pay and allowances, to authorize members to reside at \ntheir permanent places of residence during the process, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Armed Forces have come a long way in \naddressing the bureaucratic hurdles that have long plagued wounded \nservice members transitioning out of the Services. However, much more \nremains to be done to ensure that wounded service members do not go \nwithout income, due to injuries sustained in the line of duty. \nCurrently, many are going without compensation of any kind because they \nare never told about the patchwork of programs designed to care for \nthem as they transition back to civilian life and into the VA. This has \nbeen an issue of particular concern for members of the Reserve \nComponents. Therefore, Sen. Murkowski and I are introducing the Wounded \nWarrior Transition Assistance Act to help ensure that wounded \nreservists and members of the Guard are informed of the various \nprograms to compensate them for their injuries before they separate\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nfrom the military and to guarantee that there is no gap in income as \nthey transition into the VA.\n  This bill was inspired by a young soldier from Wisconsin who came to \nme for assistance when he returned from Iraq with serious wounds. He \nhad been separated from the Army without going through the medical \ndischarge process even though he had sustained a serious injury that \nimpaired his ability to work. No one had informed him that he may have \nbeen entitled to medical retirement, temporary disability retirement, \ncombat-related special compensation or incapacitation pay due to the \nextent of his injuries. After his separation, it took several months \nfor the VA to review all of his claims and begin compensating him for \nhis injuries during which time his family struggled to get by. Now, \nnearly a year since he first contacted me, the Army has recognized its \nmistake and plans to evaluate him for medical retirement or placement \non the temporary disability retirement list.\n  Unfortunately, this is a systemic issue. The Wisconsin National Guard \nhas estimated that, in Wisconsin alone, there have been a dozen cases \nof wounded service members who were eligible for military compensation \nfor their injuries who never received it and were instead sent home \nwith nothing only to have to wait for the VA to process their claims. \nThis has compromised their ability to focus on their recovery.\n  Members of my staff have been told by several officials within the \nDefense Department that they continue to see members of the Reserve \nComponents given disparate and unequal treatment with regard to the \nmedical discharge process. This legislation is urgently needed to \nensure that wounded service members receive counseling about these \nissues before discharge so that they can make an educated decision \nabout their treatment. Congress must act to convey the importance of \nthis issue and to set a floor for how the Department will handle \nwounded members of the Reserve Components.\n  This bill would prohibit the discharge of wounded members of the \nReserve Components until they have been evaluated for their eligibility \nfor the various programs to assist wounded service members. The service \nmember may elect to separate from the Armed Services after consulting \nwith a JAG attorney. For those undergoing evaluation, the bill would \nensure that they are returned to their home, if medically feasible, \nduring the process. The Services currently have community-based wounded \ntransition units established for this purpose.\n  If someone was prematurely discharged and cannot work due to his or \nher injury, the bill would require the relevant Service to return him \nor her to active duty, if the service member chooses to do so. It would \nalso ensure that the Reserve Components have access to Defense Health \nProgram funds. These measures will help ensure that future service \nmembers will not face the gap in income that created such a hardship \nfor my constituent and his family. It is the least we can do.\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that wounded service members have \ntrained advocates to help them navigate the entire medical discharge \nprocess. The fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act \nrequired the Defense Department to, among other things, provide service \nmembers with legal counsel during the physical disability evaluation \nprocess. In September 2008, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nfound that only 5 of 35 Army treatment facilities had legal personnel \ndedicated to providing assistance during the disability evaluations \nprocess.\n  In addition, GAO has reported that there are still insufficient JAG \nattorneys to provide comprehensive legal support early in the \nevaluation process. According to Army staff, if attorneys counseled \nservice members earlier in the discharge process, starting with the \nmedical evaluation board process, service members could have a better \nunderstanding of what steps to take to ensure that they receive any \ncompensation to which they may be entitled. Early outreach could also \nhelp to make the disability evaluation process proceed faster and more \nefficiently. This bill would require the Armed Services to hire \nsufficient personnel to provide comprehensive legal support early in \nthe evaluation process.\n  At the same time, we should do everything possible to take advantage \nof veteran service officers who offer this counseling free of charge \nand at no cost to the federal government. Federal law requires \ncommanders to make space available on base for chartered veteran \nservice organizations that provide counseling to wounded service \nmembers. Therefore, I was extremely troubled to learn last year that \nseveral veteran service organizations that provide assistance to \nwounded service members, free of charge, including the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America and the National Veterans Legal Services Project, were all \nhaving trouble accessing U.S. bases for the purpose of providing \ncounseling to wounded service members.\n  This bill would reiterate that the Armed Services are required by law \nto provide the space needed for wounded service members to receive \ncounseling from trained advocates, especially during this time of war \nwhen so many are returning with serious wounds. Furthermore, it \nrequires the Services to broadly disseminate information on the \nexistence of the Wounded Warrior Resource Center, which, among other \nthings, provides legal referrals.\n  This bill should not be costly. The Army has requested about 20 \nadditional attorneys. The vast majority of the wounded service members \nwill be medically discharged with retirement pay or other compensation \nand will not be in need of the assistance provided by this bill. \nFurthermore, the requirement that the Services retain wounded service \nmembers until they have been evaluated will sunset after five years, at \nwhich time it is my hope that the rate of deployments and subsequent \ninjuries will be vastly lower.\n  Nonetheless, I have provided an ample offset to cover the costs of \nthe bill. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Defense \nDepartment recovered over $600 million in overpayments to contractors \nover the last 4 years. The Department identified but did not recover an \nadditional $273 million. The funds needed to provide for these wounded \nservice members during the evaluation process would come from the \nrecoupment of these overpayments.\n  The National Guard Bureau has informed me that this legislation would \ngo a long way to closing one of the remaining gaps in care for those \ntransitioning from the Armed Forces to the VA. I am pleased that the \nlegislation has been endorsed by the Disabled American Veterans, the \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Officers Association \nof America, the National Guard Association of the U.S. and the enlisted \nNational Guard Association of the U.S.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 945. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., in recognition of his \nimportant contributions to the Progressive movement, the State of \nWisconsin, and the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the extraordinary \nlife of Robert M. La Follette Sr. This weekend, people around my home \nState of Wisconsin, the U.S. and the world will celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the Progressive Magazine, which was founded by Bob La \nFollette and his wife Belle Case La Follette. The Progressive has been \na powerful force for change and a leading advocate for civil rights, \ncivil liberties, women's rights, clean Government, and many other \npriorities since its inception 100 years ago.\n  Throughout his life, La Follette was known for his diligent service \nto the people of Wisconsin and to the people of the U.S. His dogged, \nfull-steam-ahead approach to his life's work earned him the nickname \n``Fighting Bob.''\n  Robert Marion La Follette, Sr., was born on June 14, 1855, in \nPrimrose, a small town southwest of Madison in Dane County. He \ngraduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1879 and, \nafter being admitted to the State bar, began his long career in public \nservice as Dane County district attorney.\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\n  La Follette was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, \nand he served three terms as a member of that body, where he was a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  After losing his campaign for reelection in 1890, La Follette \nreturned to Wisconsin and continued to serve the people of my State as \na judge. Upon his exit from Washington DC, a reporter wrote, La \nFollette ``is popular at home, popular with his colleagues, and popular \nin the House. He is so good a fellow that even his enemies like him.''\n  He was elected the 20th Governor of Wisconsin in 1900. He served in \nthat office until 1906, when he stepped down in order to serve the \npeople of Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate, where he remained until his \ndeath in 1925.\n  A founder of the national progressive movement, La Follette \nchampioned progressive causes as governor of Wisconsin and in the U.S. \nCongress. As governor, he advanced an agenda that included the \ncountry's first workers compensation system, direct election of U.S. \nSenators, and railroad rate and tax reforms. Collectively, these \nreforms would become known as the ``Wisconsin Idea.'' As governor, La \nFollette also supported cooperation between the State and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin.\n  His terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate were spent \nfighting for women's rights, working to limit the power of monopolies, \nand opposing pork barrel legislation. La Follette also advocated \nelectoral reforms, and he brought his support for the direct election \nof U.S. Senators to this body. His efforts were brought to fruition \nwith the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Fighting \nBob also worked tirelessly to hold the Government accountable, and was \na key figure in exposing the Teapot Dome Scandal.\n  La Follette earned the respect of such notable Americans as Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman Upton for making \ncivil rights one of his trademark issues. At a speech before the 1886 \ngraduating class of Howard University, La Follette said, ``We are one \npeople, one by truth, one almost by blood. Our lives run side by side, \nour ashes rest in the same soil. [Seize] the waiting world of \nopportunity. Separatism is snobbish stupidity, it is supreme folly, to \ntalk of non-contact, or exclusion!''\n  La Follette ran for President three times, twice as a Republican and \nonce on the Progressive ticket. In 1924, as the Progressive candidate \nfor president, La Follette garnered approximately 17 percent of the \npopular vote and carried the State of Wisconsin.\n  La Follette's years of public service were not without controversy. \nIn 1917, he filibustered a bill to allow the arming of U.S. merchant \nships in response to a series of German submarine attacks. His \nfilibuster was successful in blocking passage of this bill in the \nclosing hours of the 64th Congress. Soon after, La Follette was one of \nonly 6 Senators who voted against U.S. entry into World War I.\n  Fighting Bob was outspoken in his belief that the right to free \nspeech did not end when war began. In the fall of 1917, La Follette \ngave a speech about the war in Minnesota, and he was misquoted in press \nreports as saying that he supported the sinking of the Lusitania. The \nWisconsin State Legislature condemned his supposed statement as \ntreason, and some of La Follette's Senate colleagues introduced a \nresolution to expel him. In response to this action, he delivered his \nseminal floor address, ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' on October 6, 1917. \nIf you listen closely, you can almost hear his strong voice echoing \nthrough this chamber as he said: ``Mr. President, our government, above \nall others, is founded on the right of the people freely to discuss all \nmatters pertaining to their government, in war not less than in peace, \nfor in this government, the people are the rulers in war no less than \nin peace.''\n  Of the expulsion petition filed against him, La Follette said:\n\n       I am aware, Mr. President, that in pursuance of this \n     general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, \n     requests from various individuals and certain organizations \n     have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this \n     body, and that such requests have been referred to and \n     considered by one of the Committees of the Senate.\n       If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I \n     should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their \n     consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have \n     been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the \n     same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the \n     mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth \n     of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided by \n     such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and directed by \n     a solemn conviction of right and duty.\n\n  This powerful speech led to a Senate investigation of whether La \nFollette's conduct constituted treason. In 1919, following the end of \nWorld War I, the Senate dropped its investigation and reimbursed La \nFollette for the legal fees he incurred as a result of the expulsion \npetition and corresponding investigation. This incident is indicative \nof Fighting Bob's commitment to his ideals and of his tenacious spirit.\n  La Follette died on June 18, 1925, in Washington, DC, while serving \nWisconsin in this body. His daughter noted, ``His passing was \nmysteriously peaceful for one who had stood so long on the battle \nline.'' Mourners visited the Wisconsin Capitol to view his body, and \npaid respects in a crowd nearing 50,000 people. La Follette's son, \nRobert M. La Follette, Jr., was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate \nafter his father's death and served in this body for more than 20 \nyears, following the progressive path blazed by his father.\n  La Follette has been honored a number of times for his unwavering \ncommitment to his ideals and for his service to the people of Wisconsin \nand of the United States.\n  During the 109th Congress, I was proud to support Senate passage of a \nbill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Tammy \nBaldwin that named the post office at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., \nBoulevard in Madison in La Follette's honor. I commend Congresswomen \nBaldwin for her efforts to pass that bill and I am pleased she is \nintroducing House companion measures of the legislation I am \nintroducing today in the Senate.\n  The Library of Congress recognized La Follette in 1985 by naming the \nCongressional Research Service reading room in the Madison Building in \nhonor of both Fighting Bob and his son, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., for \ntheir shared commitment to the development of a legislative research \nservice to support the U.S. Congress. In his autobiography, Fighting \nBob noted that, as governor of Wisconsin, he ``made it a . . . policy \nto bring all the reserves of knowledge and inspiration of the \nuniversity more fully to the service of the people. . . . Many of the \nuniversity staff are now in state service, and a bureau of \ninvestigation and research established as a legislative reference \nlibrary . . . has proved of the greatest assistance to the legislature \nin furnishing the latest and best thought of the advanced students of \ngovernment in this and other countries.'' He went on to call this \nservice ``a model which the federal government and ultimately every \nstate in the union will follow.'' Thus, the legislative reference \nservice that La Follette created in Madison served as the basis for his \nwork to create the Congressional Research Service at the Library of \nCongress.\n\n  The La Follette Reading Room was dedicated on March 5, 1985, the \n100th anniversary of Fighting Bob being sworn in for his first term as \na Member of Congress.\n  Across the magnificent Capitol in National Statuary Hall, Fighting \nBob is forever immortalized in white marble, still proudly representing \nthe state of Wisconsin. His statue resides in the Old House Chamber, \nnow known as National Statuary Hall, among those of other notable \nfigures who have made their marks in American history. One of the few \nseated statues is that of Fighting Bob. Though he is sitting, he is \nshown with one foot forward, and one hand on the arm of his chair, as \nif he is about to leap to his feet and begin a robust speech.\n  When then-Senator John F. Kennedy's 5-member Special Committee on the \nSenate Reception Room chose La Follette as one of the ``Five \nOutstanding Senators'' whose portraits would hang outside of this \nchamber in the Senate reception room, he was described as being a \n``ceaseless battler for the underprivileged'' and a ``courageous \nindependent.'' Today, his painting still hangs just outside this \nchamber, where it bears witness to the proceedings of this body--and, \nperhaps, challenges his successors here to continue fighting for the \nsocial and government reforms he championed.\n  To honor Robert M. La Follette, Sr., during the week of the \nanniversary of\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\nthe Progressive Magazine, today I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl and the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  I am introducing a bill that would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins to commemorate Fighting Bob's life and legacy. \nThe second bill that I am introducing today would authorize the \nPresident to posthumously award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to \nRobert M. La Follette, Sr. The minting of a commemorative coin and the \nawarding of the Congressional Gold Medal would be fitting tributes to \nthe memory of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and to his deeply held \nbeliefs and long record of service to his State and to his country. I \nhope that my colleagues will support these proposals.\n  Let us never forget Robert M. La Follette, Sr.'s character, his \nintegrity, his deep commitment to Progressive causes, and his \nunwillingness to waver from doing what he thought was right. The Senate \nhas known no greater champion of the common man and woman, no greater \nenemy of corruption and cronyism, than ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette, \nand it is an honor to speak in the same chamber, and serve the same \ngreat State, as he did.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lugar, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 949. A bill to improve the loan guarantee program of the \nDepartment of Energy under title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nto provide additional options for deploying energy technologies, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the 21st \nCentury Energy Technology Deployment Act with my colleagues Senators \nMurkowski, Dorgan, Voinovich, Stabenow, Lugar, and Shaheen. I would \nparticularly like to thank Senator Murkowski for her thoughtful input.\n  As I have said previously on this floor, I am a strong proponent of \npricing carbon dioxide emissions in order to properly align the \nincentives of the marketplace to avoid the very real costs of \ncatastrophic climate change. I am happy to see that discussion has \nbegun both here and in the other body. However, we should be careful \nnot to think that when we do price in the effects of carbon emissions, \nwhich I believe will happen, then we have solved the entire problem.\n  As the current economic downturn and credit climate make clear, even \nwhen we do get the incentives straight, that is no guarantee that the \nmeans will be available to developers and individuals to make the smart \ninvestments they want to make. That is where this bill comes in; to \nfill in critical financing gap and bring down the costs of the \ninvestments that will not only increase our climate and energy \nsecurity, but help put the U.S. in a leadership position in these \ntechnologies that I believe will be in great demand in the coming \nyears.\n  I hope that the Energy Committee will agree to include this provision \nin the comprehensive energy legislation the Committee is currently \nworking on. I will have more to say about the measure as we get further \nalong in that process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 14. A joint resolution to acknowledge a long history of \nofficial depredations and ill-conceived policies by the Federal \nGovernment regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native \nPeoples on behalf of the United States; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat in many ways is long overdue, a resolution to officially apologize \nfor the past ill-conceived policies by the US Government toward the \nNative Peoples of this land and re-affirm our commitment toward healing \nour nation's wounds and working toward establishing better \nrelationships rooted in reconciliation.\n  Apologies are often-times difficult, but like treaties, go beyond \nmere words and usher in a true spirit of reconciling past difficulties \nand help to pave the way toward a united future. Perhaps Dr. King said \nit best when he stated, ``The end is reconciliation, the end is \nredemption, the end is the creation of the beloved community.'' This is \nour goal, with this resolution today.\n  Native Americans have a vast and proud legacy on this continent. Long \nbefore 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, \nNative peoples inhabited this land and maintained a powerful physical \nand spiritual connection to it. In service to the Creator, Native \npeoples sowed the land, journeyed it, and protected it. The people from \nmy State of Kansas have a similar strong attachment to the land.\n  Like many in my State, I was raised on the land. I grew up farming \nand caring for the land. I and many in my State established a \nconnection to this land as well. We care for our Nation and the land of \nour forefathers so greatly that we too are willing to serve and protect \nit, as faithful stewards of the creation with which God has blessed us. \nI believe without a doubt citizens across this great Nation share this \nsentiment and know its unifying power. Americans have stood side by \nside for centuries to defend this land we love.\n  Both the Founding Fathers of the United States, it and the indigenous \ntribes that lived here were attached to this land. Both sought to \nsteward and protect it. There were several instances of collegiality \nand cooperation between our forbears--for example, in Jamestown, VA, \nPlymouth, MA, and in aid to explorers Lewis and Clark. Yet, sadly, \nsince the formation of the American Republic, numerous conflicts have \nensued between our Government, the Federal Government, and many of \nthese tribes, conflicts in which warriors on all sides fought \ncourageously and which all sides suffered. Even from the earliest days \nof our Republic there existed a sentiment that honorable dealings and a \npeaceful coexistence were clearly preferable to bloodshed. Indeed, our \npredecessors in Congress in 1787 stated in the Northwest Ordinance:\n  ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the \nIndians.''\n  Many treaties were made between the U.S. Government and Native \npeoples, but treaties are far more than just words on a page. Treaties \nrepresent our word, and they represent our bond. Treaties with other \ngovernments are not to be regarded lightly. Unfortunately, again, too \noften the United States did not uphold its responsibilities as stated \nin its covenants with Native tribes.\n  I have read all of the treaties in my State between the tribes and \nthe Federal Government that apply to Kansas. They generally came in \ntranches of three. First, there would be a big land grant to the tribe. \nThen there would be a much smaller one associated with some equipment \nand livestock, and then a much smaller one after that.\n  Too often, our Government broke its solemn oath to Native Americans. \nFor too long, relations between the U.S. and Native people of this land \nhave been in disrepair. For too much of our history, Federal tribal \nrelations have been marked by broken treaties, mistreatment, and \ndishonorable dealings.\n  I believe it is time to work to restore these relationships to good \nhealth. While the record of the past cannot be and should not be \nerased, I am confident the United States can acknowledge its past \nfailures, express sincere regrets, and work toward establishing a \nbrighter future for all Americans. It is in this spirit of hope for our \nland that I and my Senate colleagues, Senators Inouye, Baucus, Boxer, \nCrapo, Cantwell, Coburn, Harkin, Lieberman, and Tester, are offering \nthis Senate Joint Resolution, the Native American Apology Resolution. I \nam also pleased to be in partnership with Representative Dan Boren who \nis offering the companion Joint Resolution in the House of \nRepresentatives today as well.\n  This resolution will extend a formal apology from the U.S. to tribal \ngovernments and Native peoples nationwide--something we have never \ndone; something we should have done years and years ago.\n  I am proud that this Joint Resolution, which I have introduced since \nthe 107th Congress, has passed the Indian Affairs Committee unanimously \nin the 108th, 109th and 110th Congresses and passed the Senate in the \n110th Congress.\n  Additionally, I want my fellow Senators to note this resolution does \nnot--does not--dismiss the valiance of our American soldiers who fought \nbravely for their families in wars between the United States and a \nnumber of the Indian tribes, nor does this resolution cast all the \nblame for the various battles on one side or another.\n  Further, this resolution will not resolve the many challenges still \nfacing Native Americans, nor will it authorize, support or settle any \nclaims against the United States. It doesn't have anything to do with \nany property claims against the United States. That is specifically set \naside and not in this bill. What this resolution does do is recognize \nand honor the importance of Native Americans to this land and to the \nU.S. in the past and today and offers an official apology for the poor \nand painful path the U.S. Government sometimes made in relation to our \nNative brothers and sisters by disregarding our solemn word to Native \npeoples. It recognizes the negative impact of numerous destructive \nFederal acts and policies on Native Americans and their culture, and it \nbegins--begins--the effort of reconciliation.\n  President Ronald Reagan spoke of the importance of reconciliation \nmany times throughout his Presidency. In a 1984 speech to mark the 40th \nanniversary of the day when the Allied armies joined in battle to free \nthe European Continent from the grip of the Axis powers, Reagan \nimplored the United States and Europe to ``prepare to reach out in the \nspirit of reconciliation.''\n  This resolution is not a panacea of course, but perhaps it signals \nthe beginning of the end of division and a faint first light and first \nfruits of reconciliation and the creation of beloved community Dr. King \nso eloquently described.\n  This is a resolution of apology and a resolution of reconciliation. \nIt is a step toward healing the wounds that have divided our country \nfor so long--a potential foundation for a new era of positive relations \nbetween tribal governments and the Federal Government.\n  It is time, as I have stated, for us to heal our land of division, \nall divisions, and bring us together. I hope a number\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nof my colleagues in the Senate will join me and support this resolution \nand begin a much needed healing process in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the joint resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited \n     the land of the present-day United States since time \n     immemorial and for thousands of years before the arrival of \n     people of European descent;\n       Whereas for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, \n     protected, and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       Whereas Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       Whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a \n     new chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       Whereas while establishment of permanent European \n     settlements in North America did stir conflict with nearby \n     Indian tribes, peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions \n     also took place;\n       Whereas the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       Whereas in the infancy of the United States, the founders \n     of the Republic expressed their desire for a just \n     relationship with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the \n     Northwest Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins \n     with the phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be \n     observed toward the Indians'';\n       Whereas Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       Whereas Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts in which unfortunately, both took \n     innocent lives, including those of women and children;\n       Whereas the Federal Government violated many of the \n     treaties ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements \n     with Indian tribes;\n       Whereas the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       Whereas many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (1) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (2) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (3) on numerous Indian reservations;\n\n       Whereas the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       Whereas officials of the Federal Government and private \n     United States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       Whereas the policies of the Federal Government toward \n     Indian tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian \n     tribes have contributed to the severe social ills and \n     economic troubles in many Native communities today;\n       Whereas despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples \n     by the United States, Native Peoples have remained committed \n     to the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the \n     fact that, on a per capita basis, more Native Peoples have \n     served in the United States Armed Forces and placed \n     themselves in harm's way in defense of the United States in \n     every major military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       Whereas Indian tribes have actively influenced the public \n     life of the United States by continued cooperation with \n     Congress and the Department of the Interior, through the \n     involvement of Native individuals in official Federal \n     Government positions, and by leadership of their own \n     sovereign Indian tribes;\n       Whereas Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       Whereas Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (b) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this Joint Resolution--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4977-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4977-S4978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 121--DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2009, AS ``ENDANGERED \n                             SPECIES DAY''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nBrown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, Mr. Sanders, \nand Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas, in the United States and around the world, more \n     than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of \n     extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of \n     extinction;\n       Whereas the actual and potential benefits that may be \n     derived from many species have not yet been fully discovered \n     and would be permanently lost if not for conservation \n     efforts;\n       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping \n     crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray \n     wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have \n     resulted in great improvements in the viability of such \n     species;\n       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound \n     research, careful coordination, and intensive management of \n     conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness \n     and education;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of endangered or threatened species reside on \n     private lands;\n       Whereas voluntary cooperative conservation programs have \n     proven to be critical to habitat restoration and species \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the \n     first steps in effectively informing the public about \n     endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2009, as ``Endangered Species Day'';\n       (2) encourages schools to spend at least 30 minutes on \n     Endangered Species Day teaching and informing students \n     about--\n       (A) threats to endangered species around the world; and\n       (B) efforts to restore endangered species, including the \n     essential role of private landowners and private stewardship \n     in the protection and recovery of species;\n       (3) encourages organizations, businesses, private \n     landowners, and agencies with a shared interest in conserving \n     endangered species to collaborate in developing educational \n     information for use in schools; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to become educated about, and aware of, threats to \n     species, success stories in species recovery, and \n     opportunities to promote species conservation worldwide; and\n       (B) to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

I am introducing this legislation with \nSenators Collins, Boxer, Brown, Cantwell, Feingold, Kerry, Levin, \nSanders, Whitehouse, and Akaka whose cosponsorship and support of this \nresolution I appreciate very much.\n  The designation of Endangered Species Day will provide many wonderful \nopportunities for Americans to familiarize themselves with the status \nand recovery efforts of endangered species in our own country and \naround the world, including such magnificent species as the polar bear.\n  Last year, more than 100 events were held across the country to \nhighlight endangered species success stories, and even more are slated \nfor this year. Educational activities were held at zoos, aquariums, \nlibraries, and schools across the country, including Disney's Animal \nKingdom in Florida, the San Diego Zoo in California, the Port Defiance \nZoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington, and the Bronx Zoo in New York \nCity.\n  Based on the success of last year, I am confident that this year's \nEndangered Species Day will continue to foster increased awareness \nabout endangered species by encouraging educational activities such as \nschool field trips to the zoo or attending an art fair at a local \nlibrary.\n  Endangered species recovery programs in California are great examples \nof the conservation and management efforts that have helped to \nsignificantly restore populations of the California condor and the \nCalifornia gray whale. Over 300 species classified as either endangered \nor threatened live in California, and efforts to protect them will \nensure that they continue to do so.\n  Despite these success stories, we must consider what more can be \ndone. There are over 5,000 threatened species that receive protection \nin the United States and abroad. An important step to preventing \nfurther threats to and endangerment of wildlife is to increase \nawareness about the seriousness of the problem and educating our youth \non what we can do.\n  I would also like to commend the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and \nCommerce Secretary Gary Locke, who recently lifted the Bush \nadministration's last-minute consultation rule. This will allow the \nUnited States to take immediate action to ensure that independent \nwildlife experts are consulted on the impacts on endangered and \nthreatened species.\n  I am introducing this bill with the hope that Endangered Species Day \ncan spark the interest in our youth to continue the conservation \nefforts that we have begun, but are still far from finishing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4978-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 122--DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2009, AS ``DIA DE LOS \n      NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG AMERICANS'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nDurbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Ms. Stabenow) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The maximum outstanding \n     amount of all borrowings from the Treasury by the \n     Stabilization Fund and the National Credit Union Share \n     Insurance Fund, combined, is limited to the amount provided \n     for in section 203(d)(1), including any authorized increases \n     in that amount.\n       ``(2) Repayment of advances.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The advances made under this section \n     shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and interest on \n     such advance shall be paid, to the General fund of the \n     Treasury.\n       ``(B) Variable rate of interest.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall make the first rate determination at the time \n     of the first advance under this section and shall reset the \n     rate again for all advances on each anniversary of the first \n     advance. The interest rate shall be equal to the average \n     market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the \n     United States with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 \n     months.\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\n       ``(3) Repayment schedule.--The Stabilization Fund shall \n     repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with \n     interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined \n     by the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid \n     not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the \n     first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board \n     extends this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed \n     extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended \n     repayment.\n       ``(d) Assessment to Repay Advances.--At least 90 days prior \n     to each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board \n     shall set the amount of the upcoming repayment and determine \n     if the Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make \n     the repayment. If the Stabilization Fund might not have \n     sufficient funds to make the repayment, the Board shall \n     assess each federally insured credit union a special premium \n     due and payable within 60 days in an aggregate amount \n     calculated to ensure the Stabilization Fund is able to make \n     the repayment. The premium charge for each credit union shall \n     be stated as a percentage of its insured shares as \n     represented on the credit union's previous call report. The \n     percentage shall be identical for each credit union. Any \n     credit union that fails to make timely payment of the special \n     premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described \n     under subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 202.\n       ``(e) Distributions From Insurance Fund.--At the end of any \n     calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an \n     outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is \n     prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit \n     unions described in section 202(c)(3). In lieu of the \n     distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund \n     shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the \n     maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance \n     Fund's equity ratio below the normal operating level and does \n     not reduce the Insurance Fund's available assets ratio below \n     1.0 percent.\n       ``(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund Assets.--The Board \n     may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such \n     portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's \n     judgment, required to meet the current needs of the \n     Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with \n     maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, \n     as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into \n     consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.\n       ``(g) Reports.--The Board shall submit an annual report to \n     Congress on the financial condition and the results of the \n     operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to \n     Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first \n     advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will \n     use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate \n     stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to \n     Treasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from \n     the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the \n     Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may \n     reflect a deficit. With planned and required future \n     repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to \n     termination of the Fund.\n       ``(h) Closing of Stabilization Fund.--Within 90 days \n     following the seventh anniversary of the initial \n     Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board's \n     discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, \n     or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the \n     Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the \n     Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under \n     subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the \n     Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of \n     days.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 202(c)(3)(A) of the \n     Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(3)(A)) is amended \n     by inserting ``, subject to the requirements of section \n     217(e),'' after ``The Board shall''.\n\n     SEC. 205.

Res. 122\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'', on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States and are the center of American \n     families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas according to the latest Census report, there are \n     more than 44,000,000 individuals of Hispanic descent living \n     in the United States, nearly 15,000,000 of whom are children;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on Dia de los Ninos, and \n     wish to share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and that encourage children to explore and \n     develop confidence;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     aspirations, and to find comfort and security in the support \n     of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the Nation to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans'', a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2009, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, especially extended \n     and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength and the \n     will and fire of the human spirit to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4996-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VIETNAMESE REFUGEES DAY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 124, which was \nintroduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 124) recognizing the threats to press \n     freedom and expression around the world and reaffirming press \n     freedom as a priority in the efforts of the United States to \n     promote democracy and good governance, on the occasion of \n     World Press Freedom Day on May 3, 2009.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on May 3, people from across the country \nand around the world will celebrate World Press Freedom Day--a time to \ncommemorate and honor the principles of freedom of expression. \nEstablished by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993, World Press \nFreedom Day provides an important opportunity for us all to remember \nthe journalists and other members of the news media--of all \nnationalities--who have sacrificed their personal safety, and in some \ncases their lives, to ensure the free flow of information to the \npublic.\n  Charles Caleb Colton said that ``Despotism can no more exist in a \nnation until the liberty of the press be destroyed, than night can \nhappen before the sun is set.'' According to the International \nFederation of Journalists, at least 109 journalists and other members \nof the media have been killed in the line of duty during 2008. \nCountless others have been arrested and/or detained simply for \nperforming their professional duties. Our Founders prized and protected \nfreedom of the press in our national charter, the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\nCourageous American journalists have documented volatile turning points \nin our history--and the world's history--and some have suffered or even \ndied for their efforts, beginning with America's first martyr to press \nfreedom, Elijah Lovejoy.\n  Recently, we witnessed the troubling case of Iranian-American \njournalist Roxana Saberi, who was arrested by Iranian authorities in \nJanuary for buying a bottle of wine and was later tried behind closed \ndoors and detained on absurd and unfounded charges of espionage. Two \nother American journalists--Laura Ling and Euna Lee--were detained by \nNorth Korean officials last month, while working on a story about the \nplight of female Chinese refugees living along the Chinese border. \nThese troubling events are just two examples of the growing threat \nfacing journalists around the world.\n  Preserving press freedoms and freedom of expression is one of my \nhighest priorities as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That is why \nI am pleased to join Senators Feingold, Kaufman and Lugar in \ncosponsoring a resolution in honor of World Press Freedom Day.\n  Next week, the Judiciary Committee will consider legislation that I \nintroduced and that is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Specter, \nFeingold, Whitehouse, McCaskill and Tester to roll back the \ngovernment's excessive use of the state secrets privilege to shield \ngovernment information. The State Secrets Protection Act, S. 417, will \nhelp guide the Federal courts to balance the government's legitimate \ninterests in protecting national security, with accountability and the \nrights of citizens to obtain government information and seek judicial \nredress.\n  The committee also has on its agenda long-overdue legislation to \nestablish a qualified privilege for journalists to protect the \nconfidentiality of their sources and the public's right to know--the \nFree Flow of Information Act, S. 448 and H.R. 985. Last year, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee favorably reported a similar measure that I \ncosponsored with Senators Lugar, Dodd, Specter, Schumer, and Graham, \nwith a strong, bipartisan 15 to 4 vote.\n  I am very pleased that President Obama has stated his support of \nFederal shield legislation, and that Attorney General Eric Holder has \nalso expressed his support of a carefully crafted federal shield law. \nAt my request, the Obama administration is working closely with the \ncommittee to help reach consensus on a meaningful Federal shield bill \nthat we can enact this year.\n  As we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, we are reminded that an open \nand accountable society comes with the duty of its citizens to seek out \nthe truth and to empower themselves with that knowledge. All of us--\nwhether Republican, Democrat or Independent--have an interest in \npreserving press freedoms and protecting the public's right to know. \nEnacting the State Secrets Protection Act and the Free Flow of \nInformation Act will send a powerful signal to the entire world about \nthis Nation's commitment to freedom of expression. For this reason, I \nstrongly encourage all Members to join me in supporting the resolution \nin honor of World Press Freedom Day and in supporting these very \nimportant bills.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 124) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 124\n\n       Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly \n     proclaimed May 3 of each year as ``World Press Freedom Day'' \n     to celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom, to \n     evaluate the state of press freedom around the world, to \n     defend the media from attacks on the independence of the \n     media, and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their \n     lives in the line of duty;\n       Whereas, according to the International Federation of \n     Journalists, at least 109 journalists and other media workers \n     were killed in 2008 while on assignment;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     nearly 3 out of 4 journalists killed in the line of duty are \n     murdered, and the killers go unpunished in nearly 9 of 10 \n     cases;\n       Whereas, according to estimates by Reporters Without \n     Borders, in 2008, 673 journalists were arrested, 929 \n     journalists were physically attacked or threatened, and 29 \n     journalists were kidnapped;\n       Whereas Freedom House reported that press freedom has been \n     declining during recent years in both authoritarian countries \n     and established democracies;\n       Whereas, reflecting the rise in influence of Internet \n     reporting, an increasing number of online editors, bloggers, \n     and web-based reporters are being imprisoned and their \n     websites closed; and\n       Whereas press freedom is a key component of democratic \n     governance and socio-economic development and enhances public \n     accountability, transparency and participation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the threats to press freedom and expression \n     around the world, on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day \n     on May 3, 2009;\n       (2) commends journalists around the world for the essential \n     role they play in promoting government accountability and \n     strengthening civil society, despite numerous threats;\n       (3) pays tribute to the journalists who have lost their \n     lives in the line of duty;\n       (4) condemns all actions around the world that suppress \n     press freedom;\n       (5) reaffirms the centrality of press freedom to efforts by \n     the United States to support democracy, mitigate conflict, \n     and promote good governance around the world; and\n       (6) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to \n     develop means by which the United States Government can more \n     rapidly identify, publicize, and respond to threats against \n     press freedom around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/30/senate-section/article/S4997-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MAY 1, 2009\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.
