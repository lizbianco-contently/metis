Mr. President, at the beginning of each of this year's work \nperiods, we have returned to the Capitol from all corners of the \ncountry reminded of the serious nature of the challenges we face. \nAmerican families are looking up from the deepest ditch in \ngenerations--a hole we all inherited and one from which we are \ncommitted to climb out. Like Americans who worry about how they will \npay their bills, send their kids to school, and afford to stay healthy, \ngetting our economy back on track is the first thing we think about in \nthe morning and the last thing we think about at night. We also know we \nare headed in the right direction.\n  Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada is home to the largest solar array of \nits kind in the Western Hemisphere. Last week, President Obama and I \ntoured the Nellis solar array and met the people who benefit from the \ntens of thousands of solar panels that help power that base. It is a \nhuge base; 12,000 people are fixed on that base. But the solar panels \nprovide 30 percent of the electricity for that electric-hungry base. It \nis an example of exactly the kind of project that creates jobs, moves \nAmerica toward energy independence, and makes the air we breathe \ncleaner. Because of the economic recovery plan we passed earlier this \nyear, we are investing in projects such as this one at Nellis to put \nAmerica on a path to prosperity.\n  During the past few weeks, we have seen the good that can happen when \nwe look out for Main Street, not just Wall Street.\n  There is no reason the next work period should be any different. \nSimilar to the earlier months of this year, the next one presents a \nlong list of priorities.\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n  Before the July 4 holiday, we will do everything we can to help stop \nkids from smoking before they start, make tobacco products less toxic, \nand make sure tobacco companies are honest with the American people \nabout the dangers of smoking.\n  We will pass the conference report of the supplemental appropriations \nbill we passed last month--a bill that gives our brave troops the \nresources they need to do their jobs and return home safely.\n  Both the HELP and Finance Committees will continue to work on health \ncare reform legislation, the top priority of President Obama and \nmillions of Americans. Both committees hope to report out legislation \nbefore our July 4 recess.\n  We will begin work on a number of appropriations bills and, with \nRepublican cooperation, we would like to finish work on some of those. \nI spoke to the Republican leader a few minutes ago, and we will have a \nplan to move forward on some of those appropriations bills.\n  We will continue working to confirm President Obama's many nominees \nfor critical positions. Those who have chosen to serve our country must \nbe able to get to work without delay.\n  We will begin the process of reviewing the most high-profile \nnomination of all, which is President Obama's outstanding pick for the \nSupreme Court. Judge Sotomayor's record and qualifications are terrific \nand tremendous. In fact, if she is confirmed, she will bring to the \nbench more judicial experience than any sitting justice had when they \njoined the Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's experience comes not only from the legal world but \nthe real world as well. Her understanding of the law is grounded not \nonly in theory but also practice.\n  Several Senators will have the pleasure of meeting with Judge \nSotomayor this week, and I know they will be impressed. She deserves a \nfair and respectful hearing, and I know she will get that. I will do \nall I can to ensure she gets that and that Senators get what they \nrequire as quickly as possible. I wish to make sure she is ready to go \nwhen the new term starts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5892-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on the matter of the Supreme Court, I \nnote that I spoke with the President's nominee, Judge Sotomayor, over \nthe recess, and I assured her she would be treated fairly and \nrespectfully during the confirmation process. I will deliver the same \nmessage when the two of us have a chance to sit down and talk later \nthis week.\n  Republicans take very seriously our obligation to review anyone who \nis nominated to a lifetime position on our Nation's highest Court. The \nSenate will therefore thoroughly review Judge Sotomayor's judicial \nrecord to ensure a full and informed debate over her qualifications to \nbecome one of the chief guardians of our Nation's Constitution and its \nlaws. We believe the American people expect nothing less.\n  Judge Sotomayor is no stranger to the process. This will be the third \ntime she has come before the Senate for confirmation to the Federal \nbench. In considering her for a seat on the Supreme Court, the \nstandards for review become understandably more rigorous, as the Vice \nPresident observed when he chaired the Judiciary Committee. Yet the \nbasic qualities we look for in our justices are the same qualities we \nlook for in any Federal judge: superb legal ability, personal \nintegrity, sound temperament, and, most importantly, a commitment to \nread the law evenhandedly.\n  In this last respect, some of Judge Sotomayor's past statements and \ndecisions have raised some understandable questions and concerns. One \nof these is a statement she made a few years back that the Court of \nAppeals is, ``Where policy is made.'' I think that is a tough statement \nto square with Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which clearly \ncontemplates a far more limited role for Federal judges, and I suspect \nthat a number of us over here in the legislative branch will want to \nask Judge Sotomayor questions about that statement.\n  The reason is simple. I think most Americans would agree that the \ncourtroom is not an appropriate place to exercise one's political \nbeliefs or personal preferences. As far as most of us are concerned, \npolitics ends at the courthouse door. The courtroom is where you go to \nget a fair and evenhanded reading of the law, regardless of who you are \nor where you came from or who you voted for. Legislators make the laws, \nnot judges. Most people understand that and place a high value on it. \nAnd the last time Judge Sotomayor came before the Senate for \nconfirmation, I voted against her nomination precisely out of a concern \nthat she would bring pre-existing personal and political beliefs into \nthe courtroom.\n  Many of the same concerns I had about Judge Sotomayor 11 years ago \npersist. But a fresh review of her record has now begun and, as I said, \nRepublicans will insist that the confirmation process for Judge \nSotomayor is conducted in a fair and professional manner. This is the \nway Republicans have treated judicial nominees in the past, and this is \nthe way we will continue to treat them: with respect.\n  But respectful doesn't mean rushed. Judge Sotomayor has a long \nrecord, and it will take a long time to get through it. She has served \n17 years on both the trial and the appellate court. She has been \ninvolved in more than 3,600 cases since becoming a judge. In order to \nconduct a thorough examination of all these cases, it is vital that the \nSenate have sufficient time to do so.\n  During the last three Supreme Court confirmations, the average amount \nof time the Senate had to prepare for a hearing was more than 60 days. \nFor Justice Alito, the Senate had 70 days to prepare for an informed \nhearing. And like Judge Sotomayor, Justice Alito had thousands of cases \nfor Senators to review. Our Democrat colleagues who were in the \nminority during the Alito nomination appreciated the fairness they were \nafforded; both the senior Senator from Vermont and the senior Senator \nfrom New York noted at the time that in handling the Alito nomination \nit was important to do it right, not quick.\n  This time around, our friend Senator Schumer notes that Judge \nSotomayor has a very ``extensive'' record, and we certainly have a \n``right'' to ``scrutinize'' it. So in considering this nomination I am \nconfident our Democratic colleagues will treat us fairly and allow us \nto do it ``right.''\n  Throughout this process, Republicans will be guided by a few simple \nprinciples. But perhaps the most important ones are these: Americans \nexpect and should receive equal treatment under the law, and Americans \nwant judges who understand their role is to interpret the law, not \nwrite it. As Chief Justice Roberts put it during his confirmation \nhearing, the American people expect a judge to be like an umpire--\nsomeone who applies the rules but doesn't make them. No one ever went \nto a ballgame, as he put it, to watch the umpire.\n  Lawmakers make law, and they have to answer for those laws every 2 or \n6 years to the voters. Federal judges, on the other hand, never have to \nface the voters, and thus aren't supposed to\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\nmake policy. Lifetime appointments are a serious matter, and voting on \na Supreme Court Justice is one of the most important decisions a \nSenator will ever make. Republicans approach this nomination with a \nclear set of guiding principles, and we will make every effort to \ndetermine whether Judge Sotomayor shares them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5893-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we're all interested in reforming \nhealth care. And while this debate has yet to fully play out, we \nalready know one thing for sure: any action we take on this issue will \naffect every single American.\n  There is no doubt Americans are frustrated with the increasing cost \nof health care and that many are worried about losing the health care \nthey have. Many Americans can't afford health care or have to choose \nbetween basic necessities and medical care they need. This is what is \nwrong with the current system, and we need to fix it.\n  Yet it is also true that many Americans are satisfied with the care \nthey have. They like being able to see their doctor and being able to \nget the care they need, when they need it. These are the things that \nare right about patient-focused American-style healthcare, and that we \nwouldn't want to sacrifice.\n  So while both parties recognize that serious reform of our health \ncare system is needed, we must also recognize the importance of getting \nit right. Americans want reform. The question is what kind of reform. \nReform is necessary, but not all so-called reforms are necessarily \ngood.\n  Based on some of the things we have been hearing out of Democrats in \nWashington in recent weeks, Americans have good reason to be concerned \nabout what the future holds for health care.\n  The biggest concern is the talk of a Government takeover of health \ncare. Americans suspect that what's being sold as a Government \n``option'' would soon become the only option.\n  Those who like the care they have don't particularly like the idea of \nthe people who brought us the Department of Motor Vehicles handling \nlife or death health care decisions, like whether or not they are \neligible for surgery or whether they qualify for a certain medicine \naccording to some impersonal Government board in Washington. They don't \nwant to rely on bureaucrats in Washington to get their phone calls \nreturned or their office visits covered. But the prospect of a \nGovernment takeover of health care is becoming more and more real.\n  Democrats in the Senate want Government to play a dominant role in \nhealth care delivery. Both the chairmen of the Senate Finance and HELP \nCommittees have said they want to produce legislation that relies on a \nGovernment-run plan. And nearly half of Senate Democrats have endorsed \na resolution stating that any health care reform must include a \nGovernment-run plan.\n  Democrats in the House of Representatives are circulating an outline \nof how they would like to change American health care. Their plan would \ncreate a Government-run insurance model that could limit patient \nchoices. Americans who want to keep their health insurance plan should \nbe allowed to do so. Yet one respected study showed that 118 million \nAmericans could lose their current private insurance and end up in a \nGovernment plan if this proposal was enacted. The House Democrats' plan \ncould also lead to the creation of a Government board that would \ndetermine what benefits and drugs are available to patients and what \nprices would be charged.\n  The administration also wants the Government to take a leading role \nin health care. During the campaign, the President said that if he were \ndesigning a system from scratch, he would probably ``go ahead'' with a \nsingle-payer system. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shares \nthe President's belief that any reform must guarantee the inclusion of \na Government plan.\n  The American people want health care decisions left up to families \nand doctors, not bureaucrats in Washington. They don't want a \nGovernment takeover that denies or delays the care they need, and they \ndon't want politicians telling them how much or what kind they can \nhave.\n  That is why many of us who recognize the need for reform will insist \non making health care more affordable and accessible, while protecting \nthe doctor-patient relationship and ensuring every American can get the \ncare they need, when they need it. This is the kind of health care \nreform that Americans want, and this is the reform we will support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5893-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, several years back--actually, it was \nfurther than several years, it was in the early 1990s--there was a \npopular culture sensation in kids' books. The books were entitled, \n``Where's Waldo.'' Those with kids probably remember the books. It was \na great way to test your kids' eyes and areas of identification. This \nwas crafted by a gentleman by the name of Martin Hansford. You try to \nfind Waldo with his glasses and his red-and-white striped hat. He would \nbe tucked in on the page somewhere, filled with lots of other colors, \nand you would have to hunt through the page. More often than not, Waldo \nwas tucked in behind similar looking characters who would attract your \nattention. They played a central role in the overall picture but \nultimately were not Waldo. I see the young pages nodding. They have all \nseen the ``Where's Waldo?'' books.\n  I do not want to take time this afternoon talking about the ``Where's \nWaldo.'' books, but I will tell you I am concerned and the point of my \ncomments today is the concern I have that the Obama administration has \nengaged in a new game of ``Where's Waldo'' and doing so with our energy \npolicies, only this time instead of ``Where's Waldo'' it is ``Where's \nNuclear.'' We will need to search carefully to find where the \nadministration has hidden the resurgence of nuclear energy.\n  The confluence of high oil prices this past summer and the desire to \nreduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions has certainly and justifiably \npromoted the interest in and development of renewable and alternative \nforms of energy, from more mature technologies, such as wind and solar, \nto greater awareness of the potential for geothermal, biomass, ocean \ntidal energy, along with greater energy efficiency and conservation \nmeasures.\n  Congress in both the Bush administration and now the Obama \nadministration was active in promoting these fields, in extending the \ntax breaks, mandating levels of ethanol to be used, updating our energy \nefficiency standards, and providing for incentives for energy \nconservation measures.\n  We are expecting to tackle a climate change bill at some point this \nCongress. In what shape or form certainly remains to be seen at this \npoint in time, but we know that we must work to slow and reduce our \ncarbon emissions. There is certainly a role for all of these \ntechnologies and increased energy efficiency to play in our energy \nfuture. But ultimately, as the new administration lays out its energy \npolicy priorities, I have to ask the question: Where is nuclear?\n  In an interview with ``U.S. News & World Report,'' Secretary of \nEnergy Steven Chu says:\n\n       [t]he biggest gains, in terms of decreasing the country's \n     energy bill, the amount of carbon dioxide we put into the \n     atmosphere, and our dependency on foreign oil, will come from \n     energy efficiency and conservation in the next 20 years.\n\n  Our Energy Secretary, Secretary Chu, has basically said that when it\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\ncomes to making reductions in emissions, it is going to come from \nenergy efficiency and conservation.\n  I am absolutely all for conservation, but, once again, nuclear power, \nthe one energy source that currently provides emissions-free, stable, \nbaseload power, along with large-scale, high-paying job creation across \nthe United States, seems to be missing from the Obama administration's \nenergy plans.\n  What is the current state of play when it comes to nuclear? The map \nbehind me indicates where we have nuclear facilities throughout the \nNation. The different colors are based on years of operation. The blue \ntriangles are nuclear facilities that have been in operation from \nbetween 30 and 39 years. That is the majority of the reactors. We have \n52 that have been in operation for about a 40-year period, 42 for a 20 \nto 29-year period.\n  What this map demonstrates quite clearly is not only where in the \ncountry our nuclear facilities lie, but the fact that we simply do not \nhave any new nuclear plants that have been ordered in this country \nsince 1978. We have 104 operating nuclear powerplants across the \ncountry that are providing right around 20 percent of our electric \npower and approximately 75 percent of our carbon-free power.\n  Again, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in this country since \n1978. But we have seen a resurgence of interest that has led to license \napplications for 26 new reactors at 17 sites. These applications have \nall been docketed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with \nconstruction on the first plant expected to begin in the year 2012. \nThis is a very welcome revival. This comes at a time when we know our \neconomy is suffering.\n  At a recent Senate Energy and Natural Resources hearing, the \npresident and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, Mr. Marvin Fertel, \nnoted that to date, investment in new nuclear energy plants over the \npast 2 to 3 years has created 15,000 jobs. If all 26 new reactors \ncurrently in the licensing process are built, that would result in an \nannual average of over 100,000 new jobs, according to a recent study by \nOxford Economics. Over 20,000 long-term jobs would be generated to \noperate those plants. Those new jobs would allow nuclear energy to \ncontinue to make the contribution that it does today as our energy \nneeds grow.\n  We know that nuclear plants also play a key role in reducing our \ncarbon emissions and meeting our climate change goals, while also \nhelping to mitigate economic harm. In 2007 alone, nuclear power \nresulted in the avoidance of almost 700 million metric tons of carbon \nemissions.\n  How much is 700 million metric tons of carbon emissions? It is more \ncarbon than Canada collectively emits each year. It is roughly twice \nthe amount of carbon emitted by all privately owned vehicles in the \nUnited States on an annual basis. It is safe to say that nuclear power \navoids a significant amount of carbon emissions, and it brings our \nexpenses down as well.\n  An EIA analysis of last year's Lieberman-Warner climate change \nlegislation showed that a new nuclear plant construction would reduce \ncarbon prices in 2030 by 33 percent, residential electricity prices by \n20 percent, and residential natural gas prices by 19 percent compared \nto a scenario where new nuclear construction is limited.\n  Not only is nuclear emission free, nuclear also provides a constant \nreliable source of baseload power. This is an issue we hear time and \nagain in the Energy Committee, an issue that renewable and alternative \nenergy sources, as much as we like them, struggle with this reality of \nreliable baseload. After all, we certainly know, regardless what part \nof the country you are from, the Sun does not always shine, and the \nwind does not always blow. On the other hand, in 2008, the average \noperating capacity for the 104 nuclear plants in the United States was \nover 90 percent--well above that of coal-fired power generation.\n  If we look at the chart, in terms of the capacity factor and what \nnuclear can provide on a sustainable, reliable basis, we have nuclear \nand then coal coming in a good second. But as we look to wind, hydro, \nsolar, even oil and gas, if what we are looking for is a level of \nreliability, the answer is nuclear. It is the type of dependable power \nthat our utilities need to operate efficiently and effectively.\n  This year's Gallup Environmental poll shows 59 percent of Americans \nsupport the use of nuclear power, which is a new high, but support for \nnuclear is nothing new in the international community. Since 1978, when \nthe last nuclear reactor was ordered in the United States, over 250 new \nreactors were constructed overseas. Japan intends to increase the \namount of electricity it gets from nuclear from where they are today at \n30 percent to over 40 percent by the year 2020. France already gets 75 \npercent of its electricity from nuclear.\n  I think the American people get it and the international community \ncertainly gets it. Nuclear power is a broadly accepted form of safe \nenergy, and it is time that we in Washington understood this as well.\n  It is clear that nuclear provides good-paying jobs at home, reduces \nour carbon emissions, provides reliable baseload power, and it is \nsupported by the American people. So what is not clear is where the new \nadministration is on nuclear. While there has been some mention of \nnuclear energy being part of the overall energy strategy, the actions \nof the administration do not support the claim.\n\n  So far, the administration has sought to kill Yucca Mountain as a \nlong-term repository for spent fuel. They have shown an unwillingness \nto increase the loan guarantee program and the funding levels to \nsupport construction of new nuclear plants, and they have focused on \nrenewable and alternative fuel developments to reduce our carbon \nemissions without any mention of nuclear energy. So where nuclear \nenergy truly stands with the current administration is a bit of a \nmystery to me. Let's talk about Yucca Mountain.\n  The administration seems to view Yucca Mountain in the same vein as \nthe Guantanamo Bay prison. Both are politically uncomfortable solutions \nto a toxic problem, and they are going to be shut down, never mind that \nwe do not have an alternative plan for either one of them. So what are \nwe going to do with the thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and \ndefense-related, high-level waste that is spread out all across the \ncountry?\n  That map we saw earlier with all of those dots all across the country \nis where we are keeping the nuclear waste. It is sitting right there \nspread out across this country.\n  How many tens of billions of dollars in liability will the American \ntaxpayers be on the hook for when the administration finally abandons \nall hope of fulfilling the Nuclear Waste Policy Act's already well past \n1998 deadline for a permanent repository?\n  Billions of dollars have been spent over the last 25 years in \ncharacterization and engineering development for the Yucca Mountain \nlicense. It is hard to imagine a better understood piece of real estate \non the planet. Onsite dry cask storage is a safe but a temporary \nsolution, and it does not remove the need for a permanent repository.\n  In the meantime, the nuclear industry faces uncertainty regarding \nspent fuel liabilities, States have no permanent disposition path for \ndefense-related waste, and the Federal Government cannot address tens \nof billions of dollars in taxpayer liabilities.\n  So far the alternative plan seems to be to leave the waste at its \ncurrent location, and we will talk about it.\n  I mentioned the Loan Guarantee Program. The administration seems to \nbe just as confused about its support for the new reactor construction \nneeded to maintain nuclear energy's current contribution. As part of \nthe 2005 Energy Policy Act, Congress created the Loan Guarantee Program \nto help us develop the 21st century energy system our country needs.\n  The Loan Guarantee Program provides support for a broad portfolio of \nclean energy technologies, from energy efficiency and renewable energy \nsystems to pollution control and vehicle technology used to advance \nnuclear and carbon capture projects. It is a widely popular program. \nDespite the current limitation of $42 billion for the program, the \nDepartment of Energy has received applications for over $120 billion in \nnew projects.\n  Of the $42 billion for the overall program, $18.5 billion was made \navailable for the new nuclear technology. Over $93 billion in support \nhas been requested. Mr. President, $18.5 billion has been made \navailable for the new nuclear technology, but $93 billion has\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nbeen requested. It is oversubscribed by a factor of five.\n  We can see on this chart that $93 billion has been requested; $18.5 \nbillion available. The others--the renewable, nuclear, fossil, mix--\nwhen you look at what we had intended with the Loan Guarantee Program \nand how we envisioned that would move forward, I think we can clearly \nunderestimate where that support would be for the nuclear programs.\n  It is important to note that the Loan Guarantee Program is also \nentirely self-funded and does not represent a handout to the industry \nand does not expose the taxpayer to default risks. The total loan \nvolume for the program is established by the Appropriations Committee, \nbut any potential defaults are covered by fees paid by the applicants, \nnot by the taxpayer. So the industry does get the help, the \nassistance--that backstop, if you will--of the loan guarantee from the \nFederal Government, but they pay for it. That seems reasonable.\n  During debate on the stimulus bill, there was a $50 billion increase \nin the size of the Loan Guarantee Program that was sought. Again, this \nis a $42 billion program with $120 billion in application requests. But \nincreasing the size of the program authority was shot down several \nmonths back because of fears that construction of new nuclear plants \nwould take up the bulk of the loan guarantee authority. So where was \nthe administration's support for the Loan Guarantee Program during this \ndebate? This program helps all forms of clean energy technologies, but \nthis increase was denied because nuclear was in the mix.\n  For 10 years now, we have consistently heard about the urgency of \nglobal climate change and the need to address it. I agree. There is \nclearly evidence of climate change. I see the real-life impacts in my \nState of Alaska. But I do find it more than a little bit inconsistent \nthat the same entities that would press for immediate action would deny \nnuclear a role in the solution.\n  Perhaps the current administration thinks global climate change isn't \nas important as developing a centrally planned electrical system based \non renewable energy that the administration believes is in the best \ninterest of the public. Renewable energy sources will be important and \ndeserve solid support, but, as you can see from this chart--and I \napologize because it is very busy--we could double the amount of \nelectricity produced by renewable resources and it still wouldn't equal \nwhat we currently receive from nuclear power.\n  So if you look at our nuclear electric power, 100 percent of nuclear \npower goes to generation of electricity; 21 percent of the sector \ncreates our electric power here. Looking up to renewable energy and how \nit feeds into consumption, whether it is transportation, industrial, \nresidential and commercial, or electric, if we were to increase--\ndouble--our renewable energy, again we still don't come close to what \nwe are able to provide currently with nuclear.\n  So going back to the issue of climate change, I believe it is \nimportant to ask the question as to whether this issue of climate \nchange can really wait for renewables to develop to such a scale that \nthey will become the primary source of energy. The point I wish to \nleave folks with is that we need to be advancing all technologies \nequitably.\n  Nuclear energy is the most robust form of nonemitting base load power \nwe have available to us, bar none. Over the last 20 years, the industry \nhas demonstrated its ability to operate these reactors efficiently and \nsafely to the great benefit of our country.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned it earlier. The rest of the world gets it, \nthe American public gets it, but where is the administration on \nnuclear? The time to demonstrate our resolve for new nuclear energy \ndevelopment is now. We as a nation cannot afford additional delay if we \nare truly serious about how we reduce our carbon emissions while \nmaintaining access to affordable energy.\n  It is time for the administration to come forward with its plan for \nthe inclusion of nuclear power in its overall energy policy and what it \nintends to do with existing and future spent nuclear fuel. We shouldn't \nbe left standing here asking: Where is nuclear?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5895-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, do I understand that the time for morning \nbusiness expires at 3 o'clock?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend that for \nan extra 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while my colleague from Alaska is still in \nthe Chamber, let me bring her some good news, as one on our side who is \na strong advocate for nuclear power and who believes it is incredibly \nimportant that we do it safely. I chair the Senate Subcommittee on \nClean Air and Nuclear Safety, and, as she mentioned, we have now, I \nthink, 17 applications to build 26 new nuclear powerplants. I think we \nhave $18 billion in loan guarantees.\n  One of the things we have done this year is we have taken off the \ntime restriction on the loan guarantees so they can go beyond the next \ncouple of years, if needed. Hopefully, they won't be needed, but at \nleast the amount of money will be there and available for a number of \nyears.\n  Another piece we had put in the stimulus package was a provision that \nsays that not only can renewables--solar, wind, geothermal, and all the \nrest--be able to participate in the manufacturing tax credits to \ncreate--if you will, manufacture--the components of solar, wind, \ngeothermal, but also nuclear. If we are going to build 26, 27 new \nnuclear powerplants in the next decade or two, I sure don't want to be \ngetting the components from China, South Korea, Japan, or someplace in \nEurope. We should get the components from manufacturers that are here, \nand part of the stimulus package has been designed to do that.\n  The other thing I would mention regarding cap and trade on climate \nchange, if we actually take that approach--and my hope is we will--just \nby its very nature, being a producer of electricity but not one that \ncreates carbon dioxide, money will flow in the cap-and-trade approach \nto utilities which use nuclear energy, which will develop more nuclear \nenergy.\n  So I appreciate the concerns the Senator from Alaska raises.\n  I might add that just 3 weeks ago, I hosted a roundtable at MIT, near \nBoston, and we brought to the table some of the smartest people \naround--from MIT and from Harvard--who focused a lot on spent nuclear \nfuel and what to do with it. As you know, a lot of the fuel rods, I am \ntold, still have 80 or 90 percent of the energy in the spent fuel rods. \nOne of the questions I asked was, What should we do about it? Yucca \nMountain is on hold for now. And I was pleasantly surprised to hear a \nunanimous opinion from everybody there who said, for now, maybe for the \nnext 30, 40, 50, 60 years, even longer, the spent fuel rods, which are \nstored on site with our nuclear powerplants in dry cask storage, are \nperfectly adequate in terms of providing security and safekeeping for \nthe spent fuel.\n  In the meantime--and I would hope the Senator would join those of us \nwho are advocates of nuclear power, would also understand we need to \naddress the spent fuel issue, and would work with us to help fund \ntechnology for reprocessing and recycling to make sure we don't wait 50 \nor 60 years to do that but we get started a lot sooner.\n  So it is not all gloom and doom, but I appreciate the concerns the \nSenator from Alaska has raised and very much look forward to working \nwith her on these issues, as we do on so many others, hopefully to good \neffect, and I thank her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5895-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5895-S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN CODEL\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I missed you in Afghanistan/Pakistan. I \nunderstand you and another CODEL were there at the same time we were, \nand I think we missed you by a day or so in both countries. I don't \npresume to speak for you or for those in your CODEL. We had five in \nours. Senator Mark Udall, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Kay Hagan, \nSenator Mark Begich of Alaska, and I was privileged to be a part of \nthat delegation.\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\nWe had 2 days in Afghanistan and 2 days in Pakistan. We left Lahore, a \nlarge city in the eastern part of the country, about 2 days before they \nhad the assault that killed 30 or so people, a terrorist assault.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes, if I could, today. We could \nalmost take turns here. I understand you can't speak from the podium \nabout your congressional delegation, but if we could, we could probably \nhave quite a good conversation.\n  There is a reason they call Afghanistan the graveyard for empires, \nbecause for a long time empires have been going there and trying to \nsubdue the Afghans--the Brits among them, the Soviet Union among them--\nand not with great success. When the Afghans sort of thrust the Soviet \nUnion out from their country, with our support, we promptly left. As we \nleft, we left a vacuum in Afghanistan, and we left a vacuum which was \nfilled all too readily by the Taliban, and providing a sanctuary for \nal-Qaida.\n  On the heels of 9/11, we decided to go back and clean the place out, \ndrove the Taliban out of there, and a bunch of them took refuge over in \nthe mountainous areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Once we had \ndone that, we took our eye off the ball. We decided to go into Iraq and \nmade that country take down their regime--Saddam Hussein's regime--and \nwe transferred a lot of our troops and treasure and attention to Iraq \nand took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan. Into that vacuum we left \ncame--not surprisingly--the Taliban to resume their ways of before. \nThey are especially plentiful in the southern part of the state.\n\n  As we were preparing to leave Afghanistan and head for Pakistan, we \ndid a series of press interviews, radio and print interviews, from that \ncountry. Among the questions that were asked of our congressional \ndelegation were: What is the exit strategy? What is your exit strategy \nfrom Afghanistan? I responded that I think the exit strategy is our new \nstrategy.\n  The reporters said: Why is that?\n  I said: Well, let me take a minute to talk about that new strategy. \nIt is not just about sending 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan, a \nlittle more than half of which are marines, and some of those are being \nredeployed from Iraq, and some are to be brought in fresh from the \nUnited States. But, I said, if all we did was put another 17,000 or \n27,000 troops in Afghanistan, that is not going to be the answer to \nsuccess. It is not going to be what we need to do.\n  In addition to the 17,000 troops who are being committed in a buildup \nthat will occur over the next 3 months or so, we are bringing in about \n150 additional helicopters to move around where the Taliban is and \ntrack them down and hopefully eliminate their presence in that country. \nBut even that is not enough force at this juncture.\n  The other thing that is called for in our strategy is to bring in \nabout 4,000 trainers. These trainers are to go along with the men and \nwomen, the American troops who are embedded and mentoring Afghan units \nalready--4,000 new trainers. Their job really is twofold: one, to help \nnot just to stand up the Afghan army--and the Afghan army is a good \nfighting force. They are not big enough, given the size of their \ncountry and all the people who live there.\n  I don't know if this is the experience of the Presiding Officer, but \nwe met with a number of American troops who had been in Iraq and were \nnow in Afghanistan, and I said: What is the difference in terms of the \nfighting force--what you saw in Iraq and what you are seeing in \nAfghanistan?\n  They said: Well, there were times when we almost had to coax the \nIraqis out of their barracks and try to cajole them into taking the \nlead on operations. We don't have to do that with the Afghans. These \nguys are ferocious fighters.\n  That is why they are known as the graveyard for empires and drove out \nthe Brits and the Soviets with our help.\n  We want to help the Afghans double the size of their army and improve \nthe quality. We want to help them double the size of their police force \nand improve dramatically the quality.\n  The Afghans have a whole lot of respect for their army. They do not \nhave the same level of respect for the police force. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, the country is rampant with corruption. The corruption \nincludes the police. It is not uncommon for police to take bribes, to \nalmost solicit or command money from others in their country. As a \nresult, it is maybe less effective as a force, certainly less respected \nas a force.\n  One of the smartest things done this year is the salaries of the \npolice officers have been raised by a factor of four--quadrupled--\nputting them pretty much on parity with the salaries paid to the army, \ntaking away the need for those police officers who feel they need to \nsupplement their income by bribing or accepting bribes from folks.\n  One of the questions that was asked as I did that press interview \nwas: What surprised you about what you saw in Afghanistan?\n  I said: Well, a number of things. I didn't realize this was a country \nthat as recently as the 1970s was able to feed itself, and not just \nfeed itself but to feed a number of other nations in that part of the \nworld.\n  This is a country that is able to raise fruits, has vegetables and \norchards, they can raise wheat, they can raise cotton and saffron, and \nthey can raise chickens--some of the same things we raise in each of \nour States, as the Presiding Officer knows. Currently, though, for the \nmost part, what they raise is poppies. They raise the poppies to feed \nthe opium trade, and they use the opium to make heroin. Most of the \nheroin in the world, literally and figuratively, has its root in \nAfghanistan.\n  The production of poppies peaked in 2007. It began coming down in \n2008. We want to continue to drive it down in 2009, again in 2010 and \n2011, until we get to the point where there are no poppies being grown \nin Afghanistan and where the farmers are able to feed themselves and to \nmake a good living raising and selling fruits and vegetables in their \ncountry and for neighboring countries, and to be able to do the same \nkind of thing with the wheat they raise and the other commodities they \nraise too. It is not unrealistic. Our troops cannot go in and tell them \nhow to do that, but it turns out there is a component of our strategy \nthat calls for a significant civilian component. What we are going to \nsee is people going into Afghanistan--our folks in many cases, \nsometimes our NATO allies--who are specialists in agriculture, helping \nthe Afghan farmers diversify away from poppies and toward other \ncommodities which will enable them to feed themselves and to feed their \ncountry. It is a smart strategy.\n  That isn't all, though. Going back to the question of what surprised \nme, I was surprised to learn about those big mountains, big snow-capped \nmountains--they are quite beautiful--in that there are a lot of \nminerals and there is a potential for a very successful mining and \nmineral industry in Afghanistan. They need a little help figuring out \nhow to get it going and figuring out how to transport the minerals they \nmine, but there is money to be made there for that country.\n  Also, I didn't realize they have oil and gas deposits in Afghanistan. \nI certainly didn't realize they found, about a year ago, they have \nthree times more oil and gas holdings beneath the surface of the Earth \nand in those mountains more than was originally believed to be the \ncase. We have all seen pictures of Afghanistan. I was a naval flight \nofficer, going through my training earlier in my career in Corpus \nChristi, the area of south Texas toward Brownsville. Afghanistan \nreminds me of that except it has these huge mountains that pop up all \nover the place. But the mountains give them a great opportunity for \nproducing wind power. Just as we have windmills on the tops of \nmountains in this country, the wind blows a whole lot in Afghanistan. \nThey can do themselves well by harnessing that wind and turning it into \nelectricity. They have vast expanses of lands that would lend \nthemselves to solar energy panels, and they also have rivers that could \nbe harnessed and used to create energy as well, hydroelectric energy.\n  There are a number of sources--oil, gas, wind power, solar, \nhydroelectric power--that could help this country meet its needs and \nmaybe even export some of that electricity to the other countries in \nthe region. Those are things that surprised me that I did not fully \nexpect to see.\n  What also surprised me was the level of corruption, the extent of the \ncorruption. It is endemic in that country.\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nThey have not much experience or time governing themselves, 5 years or \nso experience with democracy. Here in the United States we have been \nworking on democracy for how long? Over 220 years. We still struggle \nwith it. We should not be surprised that a country that has had maybe 5 \nyears of experience with democracy is struggling with it as well. They \nneed help figuring out how to govern at the national level; they need \nhelp figuring out how to govern at the provincial level; and they need \nhelp figuring out how to govern at the local level. Part of what our \ncivilian component will do there is to help, really, like Self-\nGovernment 101, them figure out how to govern more effectively, govern \nmore honestly, and ferret out corruption where it exists.\n  One of the most encouraging conversations I had was at Ambassador \nEikenberry's residence. Right across from me at the table was a fellow \nI called the Secretary of Finance. He was really the Minister of \nFinance, like our Treasury Secretary in this country. We talked about \ncorruption. It was a very frank discussion.\n  He said, basically I am ashamed of what goes on in this country. He \nsaid, in my ministry, the Ministry of Finance, we basically set, last \nmonth--in April at the time--zero tolerance. We are not going to put up \nwith it anymore. The idea that people skim revenues coming in to the \ngovernment, we don't even have enough to make ends meet, even to come \nclose. He said, on my watch, in my ministry, in my department, we are \ngoing to get rid of that. If people want to do that, they are not going \nto work with me.\n  That is the kind of leader we need in every ministry. That is the \nkind of leader we need in the whole country. As they go to the polls, I \nthink in August, to elect a President, they have a number of people who \nare running. I hope whatever flows from that will include a leader who \nwill provide the right kind of personal example, calling on the \ngovernment that he leads to lead by example and to ferret out \ncorruption where it exists.\n  Let me take a minute or two on Pakistan, if I could. I had not been \nto Pakistan either. In the weeks before we arrived there, in fact the \nmonths before we arrived, the Taliban, who were already pretty well \nentrenched in the territories up along the border of Afghanistan, began \nreaching out tentacles and spreading their influence to other parts of \nthe country that in ways I found alarming. I know many people in this \ncountry saw the expansion of Taliban influence in Pakistan as something \nto be concerned about. Here is a country with about 100 nuclear \nwarheads with the Taliban less than 100 miles from their capital of \nIslamabad. That got my attention and caused me a fair amount of \nconcern; not just me but others in our delegation, in our Senate and \nCongress and in the administration.\n  Something happened a couple of weeks before we got there that helped \nturn that situation around. The Government of Pakistan was following \nwhat I will call almost a policy of appeasement with the Taliban, \ntrying to get the Taliban to play nice, stay in their place, if you \nwill, and leave the rest of the country alone, a policy of appeasement \nthat allowed the Taliban to begin to exert its influence in places \nwhere it had previously not done so. As they extended their influence \nand presence, the Taliban sought to replace the regular law and order \nof the country, the laws of the provinces and the National Government \nwith Islamic law. One incident occurred a month or so ago which has \ndone maybe more to change this picture than anything I can think of. It \nwas rather remarkable.\n  In one of the areas where Islamic law had replaced the traditional \nlaw of the community, the father of a young woman insisted that she \nmarry a man she didn't want to marry. Apparently under Islamic law--I \ndon't pretend to be an expert, but under Islamic law apparently that is \nwhat fathers can do with their daughters, tell them who to marry. She \ndidn't want to have any part of that, and made it clear to him and to \nothers. She ended up being publicly flogged in the streets of her \ncommunity by the Taliban, in a flogging that was not just witnessed by \na number of people but it was videotaped. That videotape ended up being \nplayed hundreds of times on every television station in Pakistan and on \nthe Internet. Anybody who wanted to watch it or didn't want to watch it \nhad the opportunity to do so.\n  About the same time one of the Taliban leaders gave a major address \nin Pakistan and showed their true colors, what they were about if they \ngained the upper hand in Pakistan.\n  The people of that country, including the military, the political \nleadership, multiparty--the rank and file and the military basically \nstood up as one and said that is not where we want to go as a country. \nThat is not the Pakistan that we want. We don't want to have any part \nof seeing that kind of change occur to our country, and they turned on \nthe Taliban.\n  In the days the Presiding Officer and I were there, our CODELs were \nthere, we met with the military and political leadership of the \ncountry--I am sure his delegation did--and I was very much heartened by \nthe forcefulness with which they are going after the very people they \nappeared to be almost appeasing in the months before. They are \ndetermined to wipe them out, to crush them, and to be able to live \ntheir lives and govern their country in a way that I think more of us \nwould want any country to be able to govern itself.\n  I came back and, I say to my colleagues--I came back not wearing \nrose-colored glasses. I did not change my name to Pollyanna. I realize \nthe fighting that lies ahead, especially in Afghanistan as we stand up \nour 17,000 troops, roughly 10,000 marines, and bring in all those \nhelicopters and trainers. We are going to take up the Taliban in the \nsouthern part of the country, in Kandahar, in Helmand Province. That is \nwhere they raise all the poppies for the drug trade. That puts money in \nthe pockets of farmers. It also puts money in the pockets of the \nTaliban and other terrorists, not only in that country but other \ncountries as well. We do not need that. The people in Afghanistan and \nPakistan don't need that either. One of the advantages of getting rid \nof the poppy trade and replacing it with fruits and vegetables and \nchickens and wheat, and so forth, is we stop supporting in a financial \nway the terrorists wreaking such havoc over there.\n  But there is going to be a lot of tough fighting in the weeks that \nlie ahead as we raise our profile, as we raise our ability to deliver a \npunch. We are going to be there training our Afghan colleagues, both at \nthe military level, the army, and at the police level. Ultimately, \nwhile we help them to stand up and strengthen themselves in the next 3 \nto 5 years, we have sown the seeds of an exit strategy that will enable \nus to draw down and eventually pull most of the fighting forces out of \nthere--perhaps leave behind a residual to help lead the training effort \nas many of our NATO allies are helping with the training effort.\n  Let me close with this. One of the other things I learned when I was \nover there, I was surprised to find out how many other countries are \ninvolved. We have the major part of the fighting force. There are a lot \nof other nations involved. I am sure my colleague, who is presiding, \nsaw that too. One of the things that surprised me was the Japanese, who \nhave no trainers there, no fighting forces there--I don't know that \nthey have a civilian component there--but they are paying the salary of \nthe police force for the whole country for the next 6 months. It is \nabout $100 million, a substantial contribution. It is an example of \nwhat others can do to help. We hope those who are helping will do more \nof the same and those who are not will find ways to be supportive.\n  The operations today and in the months ahead will be military led \nwith a civilian component. Eventually it will transform and we will \nhave a force led by the civilians, and the military will be a smaller \npart of what we do in Afghanistan.\n  That is about it. I look forward to coming back and maybe presiding \nwhen the Presiding Officer shares what he saw and learned as well. But \nI look forward to working with him and those who accompanied him on his \ndelegation trip, and those who went with us, as we help the Afghans and \nPakistanis take on a tough enemy in a fight that can be won and should \nbe won.\n  With that, I see no one seeking to speak so I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it will come as no surprise to many that \nrural health care issues are near and dear to my heart. Prior to my \nservice in the Senate, I practiced medicine in Casper, WY, for almost a \nquarter of a century. I have firsthand knowledge of the obstacles \nfamilies face in obtaining medical care throughout rural America. I \nalso understand the challenges hospitals and providers must overcome in \ndelivering quality care to families in remote areas with limited \nresources.\n  To give a snapshot of Wyoming's health care landscape, we have only \n26 hospitals spread over nearly 100,000 square miles. With vast \ndistances, complex medical cases, and increased demand for technology \nand advanced medical care, the rural health care delivery system is not \na one-size-fits-all system. I have fought, and will continue to fight \neach and every day, to protect Wyoming's hospitals, providers, and the \npatients they serve. This is one of my top legislative priorities. That \nis why I am an active member of the Senate rural health caucus. For \ndecades the caucus has built a reputation of bipartisan and bicameral \ncollaboration and cooperation. Each Congress we come together to design \nrural and frontier-specific health care legislation. These efforts have \nproduced incredible results.\n  For example, when Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act of \n2003, it included a comprehensive health care package specifically \ntailored with rural communities, rural hospitals, and rural providers \nin mind. The Medicare Modernization Act finally put rural providers on \na level playing field with other doctors and hospitals across the \ncountry.\n  In Wyoming, that meant hospitals in Worland, Lander, and Torrington \ncould keep their doors open and serve patients as close to home as \npossible. With the passage of that act, Congress put into place \ncommonsense Medicare payment equity provisions critical to maintaining \naccess to quality health care in isolated and underserved areas. Rural \nand frontier America achieved a significant victory. There was much to \ncelebrate. But the mission is not complete. Several of the act's rural \nhealth provisions have expired, and many are set to expire soon.\n  That brings us to the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity \nAct or R-HoPE. I have joined Senators Conrad, Roberts, and Harkin in \nintroducing a comprehensive rural health care bill. The legislation is \ntitled the ``Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act.'' \nThis bill reauthorizes expiring rural provisions included in the \nMedicare Modernization Act. It also takes additional steps to address \ninequities in the Medicare payment system. These inequities continually \nplace rural providers at a disadvantage.\n  But there are additional challenges. We have a great need for \nadequate outpatient reimbursement in smaller towns, towns such as \nRawlins, Kemmerer, and Laramie. Rural hospitals such as these are more \ndependent on Medicare payments as part of their total revenue. In fact, \nMedicare accounts for approximately 70 percent of total revenue for \nsmall rural hospitals. Rural hospitals have lower patient volumes. But \nthese same hospitals must compete nationally to recruit doctors and \nnurses. This is due to an alarming shortage of nurses and other health \ncare professionals across the country. Additional burdens are placed on \nthese hospitals and providers due to higher rates of uninsured and \nunderinsured patients who live in rural areas. Also, seniors living in \nrural areas have more financial needs and have increased rates of \nchronic disease. This legislation would preserve achievements in the \nMedicare Modernization Act and give much needed relief to rural \ndoctors, nurses, and hospitals.\n  First, this bill equalizes payments that are known as Medicare \ndisproportionate share hospital payments. These are payments that help \nhospitals cover the extra costs associated with serving a high \nproportion of low-income and uninsured patients. It is time we bring \nrural hospital payments in line with the benefits big city hospitals \nreceive when they are providing medical care to the uninsured.\n  Second, the bill recognizes that low-volume hospitals do have a \nhigher cost per case, which further puts Wyoming's similar hospitals in \nthe red. This bill would give these unique rural hospitals extra \npayments, payments that will give Wyoming's low-volume hospitals the \nresources to continue to provide high-quality, lifesaving medical care. \nThere are several hospitals in my State located in Laramie, Rawlins, \nKemmerer, and Lander that need this critical provision.\n  In addition to the Medicare hospital payment provision, this bill \nalso strengthens over 3,500 rural health clinics across the country. \nMany of these communities depend on these clinics for important \npreventive health care. Currently, rural health clinics receive an all-\ninclusive capped payment rate that has not been adjusted, except for \ninflation, since 1988. That is 21 years. So to recognize the rising \ncost of health care, this measure would raise the rural health clinic \ncap from $72 to $92. This increase makes it comparable to the \nreimbursement urban community health centers currently receive.\n  Since every small town cannot support a full-service hospital, rural \nhealth clinics are a key component to deliver medical care all across \nWyoming. To see how critical this program is, all we have to do is \nvisit two towns in northeastern Wyoming: Moorcroft, a population of \n807; and Hulett, population of 434. Residents in these ranching and \nmining towns depend on their rural health clinics to receive primary \nmedical care as close to home as possible.\n  Finally, the legislation would help rural areas maintain important \nemergency medical services. Rural EMS providers are primarily \nvolunteers. They have difficulty recruiting, difficulty retaining, and \nspend additional time educating EMS personnel. These volunteers have \nday jobs as farmers, ranchers, teachers, and lawyers. They volunteer \nbecause the community needs their help.\n  Not all Wyoming cities and towns have the resources to pay for this \nservice. Even less have the means to buy and upgrade essential \nlifesaving equipment. This legislation will allow ambulance providers \nto collect payments for transporting patients to the hospital after \nthey answer a 911 call--regardless of the final diagnosis of the \npatient.\n  Wyoming is blessed with pristine landscapes. These landscapes, \nthough, also present significant challenges. Longer distances, bad \nweather, and other challenges make obtaining and providing quality \nhealth care often difficult. Our unique circumstances require us to \nwork together to share resources and to develop networks.\n  I believe the Federal Government must continue to recognize the \nimportant differences between urban and rural health care and respond \nwith appropriate policy. Washington must remember that one payment \nsystem does not fit all. Rural providers provide care for their \npatients under circumstances much different than their urban \ncounterparts.\n  This legislation is designed to make sure rural hospitals, rural \nclinics, rural ambulance providers, rural home health agencies, rural \nmental health providers, rural doctors, and other critical health \nclinicians are paid accurately and fairly.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues with an interest in rural health \nto cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to talk about health \ncare reform which is just about happening. We have an unprecedented \nopportunity to reform our health system. It has major flaws. It is one \nthat has left 46 million people in this country without health \ninsurance and millions of others are struggling to afford the cost of \nhealth care. It is in need of repair, and that is what this Senate, \nthis Congress is going to try to tackle in the next few months. As a \nmatter of fact, the majority leader has expressed his intention to have \nsuch a bill of monumental proportions on this Senate floor for \nconsideration by next month. It is ambitious, but it is necessary. We \nhave no choice but to succeed.\n  The health care costs are felt by many of our fellow Americans. There \nare significant economic costs associated with this broken system. \nThose who lack insurance have few options for care, which means they \nwill delay and delay treatment until the condition worsens to the point \nthat what could have been treated has turned into a full-blown \nemergency. Guess what happens. Where do they go? They go to the \nemergency room, and it is the most expensive place. As a result, the \ncost of that expensive care is borne by all Americans with health \ninsurance by us paying higher premiums for those who do not have any \ninsurance, but they still get the care.\n  This is a phenomenal statistic. According to research done by \nFamilies USA, our families in America with health insurance paid an \nadditional $1,000, on average, last year to cover the care for the \nuninsured.\n  One very important component, therefore, of this package that the \nSenate Finance Committee is going to take up pretty soon and try to \npass--I hope we are able to do it--is bipartisanship. We keep hearing \nit is going to be done in a bipartisan way. I know the chairman and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee are committed to trying to do \nthat. But at the end of the day, the proof is going to be in the \npudding. Are the Republicans on the Finance Committee going to support \na committee approach? Will they support universal health insurance, \nwhich is what I described? It is hard to disagree with what I \ndescribed, insuring all those 46 million so the average family does not \npay an additional thousand bucks on their health insurance premiums to \ncare for those who are uninsured. That is hard to disagree with. But \nsomehow the word ``universal'' has some taint on it. That is what it \nis. So until we have everyone in the system, we are going to continue \nto see the inefficiencies and the cost shifting I described.\n  In this system that I think we are going to bring to the floor, those \nwho like what they have are going to be able to keep it. If you are \nhappy with your insurance, with your employer, and it is affordable to \nyou, you can certainly keep it. But for those who cannot afford \ninsurance or those who have the very sad tales we have heard, have a \npreexisting condition and, therefore, they cannot even get insurance \ncoverage, this insurance reform package is going to mean they are going \nto have access to insurance that is going to be affordable and that is \ngoing to be quality. In this reform system that I hope we are going to \nbe able to pass, insurers are going to have to be prohibited from \ndenying coverage based on a preexisting condition. The needs of those \nindividuals are often the greatest, and they deserve to be met.\n  We are also going to try something called a health insurance \nexchange. It would simplify the process of purchasing insurance, and it \ncould be simplified in purchasing it through a Web portal that would \npresent all of the available insurance options in a comprehensive \nmanner and in a comprehendible manner and expedite the enrollment \nprocess with a standardized application.\n  If you are satisfied with your employer's insurance, you stay right \nthere. But all the others who want an alternative or cannot get \ninsurance from an insurance company, they would have this health \ninsurance exchange, participated in by the private insurance companies \nthat would have a series of maybe a half-dozen standardized policies, \nthat then those insurance companies would bid--make available, in other \nwords--competition, get the free market competition going on for those \nwho could offer the best policy at the best price for all those \nmillions of Americans who would want to purchase from that health \ninsurance exchange.\n  As we do this package, it is also important for us to focus on cost. \nHealth care costs have skyrocketed. They have been increasing at a rate \nmuch higher than the average American's paycheck. In addition to \nplacing a prohibitive financial burden on American families, these \ncosts are affecting American businesses as well and their ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace. So health care reform is going to \nhave to be assisting individuals, families, and businesses in managing \nwhat has become an overwhelming expense.\n  As we consider this package, we ought to provide tax credits. We can \ndo tax credits that could help small businesses to offset the cost of \nproviding the insurance to their employees, if that is what they \nchoose, instead of doing it through the health insurance exchange.\n  Tax credits could also be extended to low-income individuals to \nassist them in purchasing coverage from that exchange.\n  Along with those incentives, there would also come the responsibility \nfor insurance coverage that would be shared by individuals and, in some \ncases, their employers.\n  Then we always have the question of what should be the eligibility in \nthe Medicaid Program. Medicaid is a joint State-Federal program for the \npoor and\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nfor the disadvantaged. One of the things that will be taken up will be \nthat coverage should be expanded through the Medicaid Program by \nincreasing eligibility for parents, for children, and for pregnant \nwomen who otherwise cannot afford the health care.\n  I also think it is important to have reform that promotes quality \ncare by mandating coverage of the services necessary to maintain health \nand wellness. What do I mean? I mean primary care, a lot of what we \ntalk about that is preventive care so you get at the root of the \nproblem before it becomes a big problem, and then it becomes expensive \nto treat. Get at the root of the problem, and a lot of that is with \nprimary care doctors and other health providers who provide that very \nimportant preventive medicine. For example, diabetes, heart disease--if \nyou catch it early, you can prevent the big problems. But prevention \nrequires knowledge and awareness that comes with comprehensive care, \nand it is critical that preventive care is available to Medicaid and \nMedicare recipients and, therefore, also in that health insurance \nexchange. We are going to have to bring these preventive services into \nthese programs.\n  I close by saying we have come in this country to feel, as we should, \nthat access to a quality, affordable health insurance system is a \nright. We certainly do not have that now. The system is cockeyed. This \nis a historic opportunity to answer this need by expanding and \nimproving coverage while cutting the wasteful spending and addressing \nthe flaws of the system.\n  The time for reform is now. We are going to start hashing it out, as \nwe have been in these long roundtable sessions in the Finance \nCommittee. I hope this can be bipartisan, but the proof is going to be \nin the pudding on final passage. Are there going to be votes, and how \nmany from both sides of the aisle? If we are successful, it is going to \nturn around our ability to have adequate quality and affordable health \ncare, which we need.\n\n  But it is going to do one more thing: It is going to start bringing \nunder control the exploding cost of Medicare and Medicaid that, over \nthe next 20 to 30 years, unless we change it, the Government is not \ngoing to be able to afford. That doesn't say one thing about cutting \nback on access to care nor the quality of care; it simply speaks to \nbringing those costs under control by rooting out the inefficiencies in \nthe system and doing a lot of the things I have just talked about.\n  I look forward with great gusto to tackling what is one of the most \nenormous problems facing us. I look forward to sharing my thoughts with \nthe Senate later in the week about GEN Charlie Bolden to be the next \nhead of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, General Motors' decision to put the \nSpring Hill plant in Tennessee on standby is a blow to many employees \nwho work there and to their families, but hopefully it will be a short-\nterm problem. I have discussed with Governor Phil Bredesen how I can be \nof as much help as possible to the families who are affected, as well \nas the suppliers and the dealers. For the longer term, though, there is \nno reason in the world why the New GM cannot build cars and trucks at \nSpring Hill, TN, more competitively than any other location in America. \nTennessee offers hundreds of suppliers, one of the country's best four-\nlane highway systems, a right-to-work law, thousands of trained \nworkers, and low taxes. The Saturn plant was said to be the largest \nU.S. capital investment in history, and since then, General Motors has \nspent hundreds of millions of dollars modernizing it. For the same \nreasons Saturn and Nissan, Volkswagen, and their suppliers located \nhere, Tennessee will continue to be a major automotive center.\n  What is more, General Motors has a proud history in Tennessee. As \nGovernor of our State in 1985, I wrote the full-page ad for the Wall \nStreet Journal. I took almost all of our economic development funds for \nadvertising that year, and the ad proudly said this: ``Saturn finally \nfound a home in Spring Hill, Tennessee.'' Saturn was the most sought-\nafter plant in America then. A Saturn car had not been built then. Yet \nthe name was better known than Pontiac, which had been on the market \nfor 60 years. Saturn, together with the arrival of Nissan a few years \nearlier, helped to attract auto industry to a State--Tennessee--that \nhad almost no auto jobs and to a region that had very few auto jobs. \nToday, nearly 150,000 jobs--or about one-third of Tennessee's \nmanufacturing jobs--are auto related, almost all of them at suppliers \nto the 12 auto-assembly plants that are now located in the Southeastern \nUnited States.\n  Madam President, I would like to look ahead a little bit toward the \nNew GM and the Government ownership of 60 percent of what we are \ncalling the new General Motors. We are told that when General Motors \nemerges from bankruptcy in 60 or 90 days, the U.S. Treasury will own 60 \npercent of the New GM. To avoid the possibility of the Government \nowning New GM for years, I will introduce legislation authorizing the \nTreasury to distribute to individual taxpayers all of its stock in the \nNew GM and in Chrysler as soon as is practical following the emergence \nof the New GM from bankruptcy proceedings. So instead of the Treasury \nowning shares in the New GM and Chrysler, you would own them if you \nwere one of 154 million Americans who filed individual Federal tax \nforms on April 15.\n  The stock certificates would be in your name, not that of your \nGovernment. To keep it simple, and to help the little guy also have an \nownership stake in America's future, Treasury would give each taxpayer \nan equal number of the available auto shares.\n  The Treasury Department has said it wants to sell its auto shares as \nsoon as possible, but Fritz Henderson, the president and CEO of General \nMotors, told Senators and Congressmen in a telephone call this morning, \nin which I participated, that while it is the Treasury's decision to \nmake, this is a ``very large amount'' of stock, and that the orderly \noffering of these shares to establish a market might have to be \n``managed down over a period of years.'' Another option, of course, \nmight be to sell blocks of the New GM stock to one or more large \ninvestors, but that might also take years.\n  So I want the Treasury also to have the option of getting the \nownership of these companies out of the hands of Washington and back in \nthe hands of the marketplace in months rather than years. Distributing \nNew GM shares and Chrysler shares to individual taxpayers is the way to \ndo that.\n  Those shares might not be worth very much today, but put them away \nand 1 day they might help pay for a college education. For example, \nGeneral Motors' 610 million shares were only worth 75 cents just before \nbankruptcy, but they were worth $40 per share 2 years ago.\n  I would not interfere with the loans the Federal Reserve Board made \nto companies in trouble. The Fed is independent. Its loans are \ncollateralized. It makes money for the Treasury. I am only talking \nabout the taxpayer bailouts that Congress has authorized since last \nOctober that have resulted in Government ownership of auto company \nassets.\n  Under my proposal, the fiduciary duty that management owes to owners \nwould be owed to the more than 154 million Americans owning New GM \nstock and not to a few Washington politicians and bureaucrats.\n  You know what would happen if the Treasury owned 60 percent of the \nNew GM for the next several years: Members of Congress would start \nholding hearings and saying things such as: ``We are the owners and we \ndemand to know why are you building this model? Why are you closing the \nplant in North\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nCarolina and not in Tennessee? Why are workers not paid more? What \nabout these work rules? Why is this battery being built in South Korea \nand this engine being shipped from Mexico?''\n  When the company negotiates with the Federal Government on such \nthings as, for example, fuel efficiency standards, won't it be \nnegotiating with itself? And as the elections approach, might not the \nWhite House be tempted to build plants in States it might carry instead \nof States it might not?\n  As the New York Times editorialized this morning:\n\n       It was only March when the Obama administration let GM \n     slide toward bankruptcy by denying it more taxpayer money, \n     partly on the grounds that the company was too heavily \n     dependent on SUVs, while its biggest stab at fuel economy, \n     the Volt, was too expensive to work in the near future.\n\n  Not long after that, we saw the President of the United States fire \nthe president of General Motors. So if it is going to take years to \nsell the Treasury's New GM stock and Chrysler stock, the best way to \nhelp those auto companies succeed and recover the taxpayers' more than \n$50 billion in loans may well be to simply give all the Government \nstock to taxpayers and get Washington out of the business of owning and \nrunning auto companies--the sooner the better.\n  Here is one disadvantage. Giving the stock to taxpayers might well \nadd a few billion dollars to the Federal debt. But whose debt is it, \nanyway? The 154 million taxpayers'. So why not give individual \ntaxpayers the ride up, if there is to be one.\n  Some will say another disadvantage is that the old GM will not be \nable to sell its tax breaks to an acquiring company. But these tax \nbreaks would be just another bailout paid by taxpayers. It would be \nbetter to distribute the Treasury's stock to individual taxpayers and \nlet the marketplace decide what happens, rather than spend billions \nmore on bailouts.\n  Here are the advantages as I see them. No. 1, 154 million new \ninvestor cheerleaders. Think fan base of the Green Bay Packers, whose \nownership is distributed among the people of Green Bay. This new \ninvestor fan base could produce customers for the auto companies.\n  No. 2, better odds for success. Does anyone think Washington can run \ncar companies? Did you ever ride in a Lada, a clunky Soviet car made by \na government-run company? The standing joke was: How do you double the \nvalue of a Lada?

Decisions about these auto companies would be made \nby collective decisions of people in a marketplace rather than by \nlobbyists with access to Washington.\n  No. 4, any benefits are more likely to go to taxpayers rather than to \nsome Government program. For example, the law says that all proceeds \nmade from the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP, purchased assets \nshould go to reduce Government debt. Yet that is not happening because \nTreasury has not purchased toxic assets yet and has not made any profit \nyet. My proposal would make sure taxpayers get the profit rather than \nrecycling this money into more bailouts.\n  Finally, this is the fastest way back to the wise principle, if you \ncan find it in the Yellow Pages the Government probably should not be \ndoing it. More than the money, it is the principle of the thing.\n  The other day a visiting European automobile executive said to me, \nwith a laugh, that he had come to ``the new American automotive \ncapital: Washington, DC.''\n  To get our economy moving again, let's get our auto companies out of \nthe hands of Washington and back into the marketplace--the sooner the \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am concerned by the reports of \nseveral news outlets that the implementation of Executive Order 12989, \nwhich mandates the use of E-Verify for Federal contractors and \nsubcontractors for the Federal Government, is now being delayed again \nuntil September of this year. This is the fourth such delay this year \nand I am afraid that it signals this administration is not serious \nabout immigration enforcement--not even serious enough to utilize \neffective systems that we have in place.\n  On January 28 of this year, President Obama pushed back \nimplementation of Executive Order 12989 to February 20. A few weeks \nlater, that implementation date was pushed back again to May 21. Prior \nto that date, implementation was pushed back to June 30. Now various \nsources are reporting implementation will be delayed until sometime in \nSeptember. E-Verify is one of the most effective tools at our disposal \nfor protecting American jobs and should be made mandatory and \npermanent. Instead, the administration yet again has decided to delay \nthis program as it applies to Federal contractors and subcontractors--\nthat is, people who do work for the Federal Government; not every \nprivate business, just those who get jobs and money from the Federal \nGovernment to do contracting work. The administration claims they need \nmore time to review the program. But it has been 5 months already.\n  I was also, let me recall, extremely disappointed when this Senate's \nDemocratic Members stripped the E-Verify provisions from the final \nversion of the economic stimulus package without discussion or debate. \nI tried to bring up an amendment in the Senate that would have matched \nthe language that the House accepted unanimously in committee and was \nincluded in the final version of their bill. That language said that \ncontractors who get money out of the stimulus program from the Federal \nGovernment had to use E-Verify, this computer system, to determine \nwhether the people they are hiring are legally in the country. That was \nnot too much to ask, I thought. The House, as I said, unanimously \naccepted that provision in committee and passed it overwhelmingly as \npart of the final version of their bill.\n  Every time I sought to bring it up, it was blocked by the Democratic \nleadership. They did not want to vote on it. It became pretty clear \nwhy, because if it was in the Senate bill and the House bill, it would \ncertainly be in the final conference report language and would become \nlaw. As long as they could keep it out of the Senate bill, when they \nwent to conference they could take the language that had been passed in \nthe House out of the bill. Part of the compromise in conference would \nbe to eliminate the E-Verify related language. I warned that would \nhappen and that is exactly what did happen. We could not get a vote in \nthe Senate. If we had gotten a vote, I am confident the Senate would \nhave voted in favor of requiring recipients of stimulus funds to use E-\nverify.\n  The purpose of the stimulus bill was to put Americans back to work. \nUnemployment continues to rise. We are now hearing it will hit 10 \npercent. That is a serious number, much higher than some were \nprojecting. I think the Obama administration's budget projected \nunemployment would be between 8.1 to 8.5 percent. Currently, \nunemployment rates are close to 9 percent and many are saying we will \nhit 10 percent. So why would we want to use stimulus money that was \npromoted as a way to create jobs for Americans and reduce unemployment \nin this time of recession and not make sure that those jobs go to \nAmerican citizens. I think it is a matter of real, serious import and I \nam baffled by it.\n  Briefly, E-Verify is an on-line system operated jointly by Homeland \nSecurity and the Social Security Administration. Employers can check \nthe work status of people who apply to work for them on line by \ncomparing information from the employee I-9 application form against \nthe Social Security and DHS databases. More than 112,000 employers are \nalready using it because they do not desire to hire somebody not \nlegally in the country. I think they should be congratulated for that.\n  It also helps the employer because they can use this as a defense and \nsay I used the E-Verify system if it is later found out that an \nemployee they hired is here illegally. It did not tell me the person \nwas illegal. They produced a\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\ndocument. It looked good to me. I checked the number and they said it \nwas OK. They are protected. They have safe harbor against Government \naction for hiring people who are illegal.\n  E-Verify is a free and voluntary system. As a practical matter, it is \nthe best means we have today for determining employment eligibility for \nany hires and the validity of their Social Security number.\n  We have had thousands of employees using bogus Social Security \nnumbers to get work. There are examples of hundreds of people being \nhired under the same Social Security number. Well, that ought to give \nsomebody a clue.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, 96 percent of the \nemployees who are checked by businesses are cleared immediately. So the \nidea that large numbers of people are being blocked is not true. If you \nare not cleared, you can still be hired temporarily until further \nvalidation occurs to see if you have a legitimate Social Security \nnumber or if you are legitimately in the country.\n  It is working fine. This many companies would not be using it if it \nwere not. On a related note, though people do not like to talk about \nthe impact of illegal immigration on low-skilled workers, we must be \nfactual. The large number of illegal workers in this country is having \na depressing effect, particularly on the standard of living of low-\nskilled Americans.\n  The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late civil \nrights pioneer, Barbara Jordan, found:\n\n       Immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to \n     unskilled U.S. workers.\n\n  The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated that such \nimmigration has reduced the wage of the average native-born workers in \na low-skilled occupation by 12 percent, or almost $2,000 annually.\n  Harvard economist, George Borjas, himself an immigrant from Cuba, has \nstudied this probably more than any other person in the whole source of \nissues on this. He has written a book on the subject. He has estimated \nthat immigration in recent decades reduced the wages of native-born \nworkers without a high school degree by 8.2 percent.\n  Doris Meissner, in 2009, a few months ago, the former head of \nImmigration Services under President Clinton, said:\n\n       Mandatory employer verification [that is what we are \n     talking about through E-Verify] must be at the center of \n     legislation to combat illegal immigration . . . the E-Verify \n     system provides a valuable tool for employers who are trying \n     to comply with the law. E-Verify also provides an opportunity \n     to determine the best electronic means to implement \n     verification requirements. The administration should support \n     reauthorization of E-Verify and expand the program . . . ''\n\n  That was Doris Meissner, the INS Director under President Clinton, \nwho said that a few months ago.\n  Alexander Aleinkoff, who was an official at INS under President \nClinton, and the Obama administration DHS transition official--he \nparticipated in the transition for President Obama--calls it a ``myth'' \nthat ``there is little or no competition between undocumented workers \nand American workers.''\n  I know our majority leader has written that he favors the E-Verify \nProgram. Senator Reid wrote this:\n\n       I strongly believe that every job in our country should go \n     only to those who are authorized to work in the United \n     States. That is why I strongly support programs like E-Verify \n     that are designed to ensure that employers only hire those \n     who are legally authorized to work in the United States, and \n     believe we need to strengthen enforcement against employers \n     who knowingly hire individuals who are not authorized to \n     work. I support reauthorization of the E-Verify program, as \n     well as immigration reform that is tough on lawbreakers, fair \n     to taxpayers and practical to implement.\n\n  Those are Senator Reid's comments. So it is time for us to get busy. \nLet's do some of these things. I know some have said this is a \ncumbersome program. That is not so. These are excuses put out by big \nbusinesses that are using workers, many of whom they have reason to \nbelieve--I would suggest--are illegal. They do not want to be checked. \nThey do not want to have any checks.\n  There was a recent letter to the Wall Street Journal by Mark Powell, \na human resource executive for a Fortune 500 company. This is what he \nsaid about how hard it is to use this system:\n\n       The E-Verify program is free, only takes a few minutes, and \n     is less work than a car dealership would do checking a credit \n     score prior to selling a vehicle or letting you take a test \n     drive.\n\n  Well, that is correct. He is right about that. How else can you \nexplain the thousands of employers who voluntarily sign up to use the \nprogram? Short-term extensions and delay in implementation, such as \nwhat we are seeing today, only discourage participation in the E-Verify \nProgram, since employers have no assurance that the program will even \nexist down the road.\n  I have offered legislation, and others have worked on the floor, to \ntry to make E-Verify permanent and mandatory. We keep having one \nroadblock after another one.\n  Who is pulling the strings around here? I do not believe they are \ntalking to the American people. I do not believe whoever it is blocking \nthis kind of activity is talking to the American people, talking to \npeople with common sense.\n  They must be talking with people who have special interests that are \nnot interested in a lawful system. T.J. Bonner, who heads the Border \nPatrol Officers Association, testified at the Judiciary Committee, and \nhe said this many times: One of the best things, perhaps the best \nthing, you can do to reduce the numbers of people who enter our country \nillegally is to eliminate the jobs magnet. The jobs possibility is a \nmagnet that draws those who come illegally.\n  He said: There are a lot of things that can be done to eliminate that \nmagnet, and this is one of them.\n  Further delay in the implementation of this Executive order is not \nacceptable, I believe, and am afraid it signals some sort of lack of \ncommitment to enforce our immigration laws. You see, E-Verify does not \nrequire anybody to be arrested, it does not require anybody to be \ndeported, it does not require anything--you simply do not get the job \nif you are not legally authorized to work. Law enforcement officers are \nnot called. The businesses check the number to see if the person is \nlegally here with a valid Social Security number, and if they have \ninformation that the individual is not, then they do not hire them.\n  That is all that happens. How simple is that? It is a good step, a \nmodest step but an important step. We keep putting it off and keep \nrejecting the idea that even Government contractors that get work from \nthe Government of the United States should have to use the program.\n  Every employer in America should be using the program. That is where \nwe should be going. That is the policy we should be pursuing if we are \nat all serious about dealing with the matter.\n  There has been some good news. The good news is that last year, our \nborder enforcement officers arrested only 770,000 people entering our \ncountry illegally. A couple years ago it was over 1.1 million arrests. \nThat number doesn't include illegal aliens that evade CBP agents at the \nborder. The reason the number of apprehensions is still so high, in my \nopinion, and I have studied it a good bit, is that we have \ninadvertently, perhaps intentionally, sent messages around the world \nthat our border is open.\n  As long as we have a willing worker and a willing employer, President \nBush once said, he almost said: I am okay with it. Well, that is not \nright, is it? We have laws. Good people every day apply to come to our \ncountry and to enter our country through legal channels. Some of them \nhave to wait in line, and they do so dutifully. But large numbers are \nignoring that because somehow they have gotten the impression that \nnobody here cares at all.\n  So we have stepped up enforcement. We have built some fencing, not \nnearly what was contemplated being built, but we built some. We are \ndoing better. We are prosecuting some of the people who enter the \ncountry illegally. That has worked dramatically. I do not mean long \ntimes in jail but a prosecution for a misdemeanor.\n  They serve a little time, they got a conviction, if they come back it \ncan be a felony. That is working. So you do those kind of things and it \nmakes a big difference. If we make the E-Verify system a part of what \nwe do within this country every day, and especially for government \nbusiness, that will further send the signal to the world that our \ncountry is not open to illegal entry. If\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nyou want to come you should come under the normal, lawful process.\n  It is so important America reestablish the rule of law when it comes \nto immigration in our country. We are a nation of immigrants. We are \nthe most generous Nation, I think, in the world for allowing people to \ncome here. But there has to be some limit on those numbers. It has to \nbe done in an orderly fashion, a lawful fashion.\n  If you do not have order and lawfulness at our border and you have \nhuge numbers coming through every year, then it undermines respect for \nlaw and sends a signal worldwide that we are not serious.\n  I think we are making some progress. We need to get E-Verify going. \nIt needs to be made permanent and mandatory. At the very least, every \nbusiness that does business with the U.S. Government should have to use \nit. Pretty soon every business in America should use it. When we do \nthat, we will have taken a big step toward assuring even ourselves that \nwe mean what we say and that we are going to establish a lawful \nprogram.\n  Some say we need these workers. Well, let's talk about a good guest \nworker program that would work, and we could allow people to come \nlegally. That is critically important. So when your unemployment rate \nis going over 9 percent, highest in over 20 years, then maybe we do not \nneed as many people coming into our country, as some people have said \nwe do.\n  But regardless, there ought to be a mechanism for allowing temporary \nworkers to come, the number allowed to come should serve our national \ninterest, and we ought not to allow the large numbers who are now \ncoming illegally to come and be able to successfully take jobs that \nAmericans need right now.\n  Maybe the reports saying that the administration is delaying \nimplementation of mandatory E-Verify for Federal contractors are not \ncorrect. But since we have seen it happen several times already, I \nthink it is important the American people know something is not going \nwell here and maybe there will be an opportunity to make their voices \nheard and maybe we can somehow, some way get this E-Verify Program made \npermanent and workable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5903-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE CAMPBELLSVILLE UNIVERSITY TIGERS BASEBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Against Lindenwood on Thursday, \n     Fuller, who throws sidearm, pitched three scoreless innings \n     for the save.\n       With just 25 minutes between games, Campbellsville's \n     coaches decided to start Fuller in the next game, against \n     Kansas Wesleyan, which had won 26 straight. Fuller, according \n     to assistant coach Jake McKinley, ``is an undersized kid'' \n     who had started only once previously in four seasons.\n       ``We were nearly out of pitching and he looked \n     comfortable,'' McKinley said. ``We told Fuller we would need \n     him to make his second career start and if he could give us \n     three or four innings, that would be great, and it was in the \n     biggest game in the history of our program against a team \n     that had won 26 straight games.''\n       Fuller ended up pitching a complete game as Campbellsville \n     snapped Kansas Wesleyan's winning streak with a 11-0 victory.\n       That put Campbellsville in the final. According to \n     McKinley, the coaches were prepared to start their No. 1 \n     pitcher on two days' rest, but Fuller wanted the start.\n       ``We told him no way, because we didn't want to hurt him . \n     . . He just threw 12 innings the day before,'' McKinley said. \n     ``He told us that he was a senior that will never play pro \n     ball and he was going to be an accountant in just a few \n     weeks. He said he didn't care about his arm and told us he \n     will give us a chance to win.''\n       And he did, using just 77 pitches in his second consecutive \n     complete-game shutout as Campbellsville (39-10) beat Kansas \n     Wesleyan again 4-0, giving the Tigers their first NAIA World \n     Series appearance in school history.\n       ``We're not sure yet, but we are not opposed to using him \n     in any role,'' McKinley said. ``At this point, we'd be fools \n     not to start him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5903-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5903-S5904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES H. BILLINGTON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I join with Senator Lisa \nMurkowski, to convey heartfelt good wishes to Dr. James H. Billington, \nthe Librarian of Congress, who will celebrate his 80th birthday on June \n1.\n  Dr. Billington was educated in the public schools in the Philadephia \narea and was valedictorian at Princeton University before pursuing his \ndoctorate at Oxford University where he was a Rhodes Scholar. Following \nservice in the Army he taught history at Harvard and Princeton. From \n1973-1987, he was director of the Woodrow Wilson School for \nInternational Scholars where he founded the Kennan Institute for \nAdvanced Russian Studies. He is a well-known scholar of Russia, has \nauthored six books on Russian history, accompanied 10 congressional \ndelegations to Russia and the former Soviet Union, and received more \nthan 40 honorary doctorates from around the world.\n  In 1987 James Billington was nominated to be the 13th Librarian of \nCongress by President Reagan and was confirmed for that position by the \nSenate. From the day he took over the Library of Congress, he has \nvigorously pursued his vision for the Library and its future: to \ncontinue to acquire and preserve materials for its unparalleled \ncollections and make them available to Congress, the American people \nand the world. Dr. Billington has a phrase for this, ``to get the \nchampagne out of the bottle.'' His aim from the beginning has been to \nshare the riches of the world's largest collection of knowledge with \never broader audiences and to translate this wisdom into a catalyst for \ncivilization.\n  Early in his tenure, even before the digital revolution, Dr. \nBillington saw the need to use new information technologies to get \ncontent out to users around the country so that the Library of Congress \nwould not simply become a ``warehouse of information.'' Through \ninitiatives such as the pioneering American Memory Project created in \n1990 he saw to it that the rich American history collections of the \nLibrary were available in new ways to a wider audience, culminating in \n1995 with millions of digital items posted on the Web through the \nNational Digital Library. The Library of Congress, through its National \nDigital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program, led an \nongoing effort with partner institutions to collect and preserve \ndigital materials that would otherwise disappear. The Library is also \nleading the way in getting more than 15 million of its rich primary \nsource materials out online to K-12 educators throughout the nation. In \n1995 Dr.\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\nBillington proposed to UNESCO formation of a World Digital Library to \ngather an online collection of significant primary materials from \ncultures around the world which was officially launched in seven \nlanguages in Paris last month with the Library, UNESCO, and more than \n30 partner institutions around the world.\n  Dr. Billington has been a prodigious private fundraiser for the \nLibrary's programs. In 1990 he formed the Madison Council whose members \nhave raised nearly $400 million for the Library which has been well \nused to support scholarly studies such as the Kluge Center and some 300 \nstimulating and popular exhibitions such as the Vatican Library, \nAmerican Treasures, Lewis and Clark, and the recent Lincoln \nBicentennial. A major accomplishment was the creation of the Packard \nCampus for Audio-Visual Conservation achieved through a public/private \npartnership with the Packard Humanities Institute for archiving and \npreservation of the Library's massive collection of audio visual \nmaterial.\n  Jim Billington has presided over an increase of more than 50 million \nitems in the Library's collections which now total nearly 140 million. \nHe has also ensured that the Library's valuable multiple format \ncollections are preserved for future generations and enhanced the \nsecurity of staff, researchers, and visitors.\n  It was Dr. Billington's far sighted initiative in 1999 to bring young \nleaders to the United States from Russia to learn practical skills \nthrough exposure to America's democratic government and free market \nsystem. Since then through the Open World Program more than 14,000 \ncurrent and future leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and \nUzbekistan have experienced our democracy and community life gaining \nnew ideas for implementing change in their countries and fostering \ncooperation with the United States.\n  These are just a few of the many accomplishments that Jim Billington \nhas made both to the Library of Congress and the Nation. His energy, \nenthusiasm and vision for a knowledge based democracy and the life of \nthe mind are commendable and he is still going strong at 80. We wish \nhim a happy birthday.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I offer my best wishes to the \nLibrarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, who just celebrated his \n80th birthday.\n  Dr. Billington became the Librarian of Congress in 1987 after being \nnominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the Senate. If you read \nhis confirmation testimony closely you can see the seeds for the \ndirection he wanted to take the Library of Congress. It was Dr. \nBillington's vision for what the Library of Congress could be for \ncurrent and future generations and his effective management that \nsteered that great institution into the digital age. Because of his \nleadership, the Library today collects a diversity of material in both \nconventional and digital formats. Dr. Billington refers to this as \n``adding without subtracting,'' and it is now a model for archival \ninstitutions. But simply collecting and preserving this material is not \nenough. It was his insistence, through programs such as the National \nDigital Library and World Digital Library, that this goldmine of \ninformation be shared much more widely with researchers, educators, and \nthe general public both here on Capitol Hill and online via the \nLibrary's renowned Web site that makes it so useful.\n  I know how much Jim Billington reveres the Library's role of service \nto Congress and the American people. He works tirelessly to attract \nMembers to visit the Library. It has been my pleasure to co-host with \nhim several dinners in recent years for my colleagues which gave them a \nclearance to see some of the incomparable Library of Congress exhibits, \nsuch as Creating the U.S., Jefferson's Library, and Winston Churchill, \nin the magnificent surroundings of the Jefferson Building.\n  Formation of the Madison Council, the Library's first ever \nphilanthropic and advisory body, was Dr. Billington's idea which he \ncarried out with great energy and success. The Madison Council has been \ninvaluable in bringing priceless collections to the Library and \naugmenting appropriated funding.\n  Finally, I applaud Dr. Billington for instituting and cosponsoring \nwith First Lady Laura Bush the National Book Festival since 2001, in \nwhich I have had the good fortune of participating as an author. The \nNational Book Festival, modeled on the Texas Book Festival initiated in \nthe 1990s by Laura Bush, has been a very popular annual event in \nWashington and has done much to promote reading and the creativity of \nAmerica's writers.\n  Jim Billington is truly a national treasure.

Madam President, today I want to speak about an \nextraordinary young woman who has left us far too soon. On May 15, my \nformer staff member Frances Nam died after a 3-year battle with lung \ncancer. Fran was just 39 years old. She left behind two beautiful \ndaughters--Seanna, age 11, and Henna, age 9.\n  In the mid to late 1990s, Fran was my legislative assistant on all \nmatters related to appropriations, immigration, housing, judicial \nappointments, and matters under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee. She was a standout staff member in every way: always \nenthusiastic and diligent about her work, always caring about her \ncolleagues, and an exemplary public servant who cared deeply about our \nconstituents.\n  In January 1999, Frances went to work for U.S. Department of \nJustice's Community Relations Service, CRS, DOJ's race relations \nmediation arm. This job brought out another side of Fran: the \ncompassionate but cool-headed mediator, a master of human relations. \nCRS sent Frances all over the country, wherever ethnic communities were \nat odds with one another, to prevent or soothe civil strife and bring \ndisparate people together despite their differences. Originally a \npolitical appointee in the Clinton administration, Fran stayed at CRS \nuntil 2003 as a senior policy adviser.\n  Frances then went to work as senior policy adviser to the late \nCongresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. Along with her primary \nlegislative and policy duties, Fran was the Congresswoman's liaison to \nthe Congressional Black Caucus, CBC. In this role she became the first \nnon-African American to organize a CBC annual legislative conference, \nand she is still remembered fondly by CBC members and staff for her \ncharm, efficiency, and diplomatic skills.\n  Since late 2003, Frances has worked as vice president of Government \nAffairs for Sodexo USA, a major food service company. Here, in addition \nto working with Congress as well as State and local governments, Fran \nwas known for her extraordinary efforts to open new educational and \ncareer opportunities for Asian Americans and other people of color.\n  Outside her working life, Fran was a vivacious young woman who \nenjoyed a wide circle of friends and her two loving daughters. A woman \nwho truly loved her work and life, she was recently the subject of an \narticle in Working Woman magazine on successful working mothers.\n  In her all-too-brief life, Frances Nam made a deep and lasting \ndifference in the lives of many people--here in the Senate, in \ncommunities across the country, and in her own close community of \nfamily, friends, and colleagues. She will be deeply and truly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5904-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5904-S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HARRY M. HALLMAN, JR.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Mayor Harry M. Hallman, Jr., on the occasion of his \nretirement as mayor of Mount Pleasant, SC. Mayor Hallman is a dedicated \npublic servant and his work has earned our gratitude and appreciation.\n  It was with much personal and professional sadness that he recently \nannounced he would have to relinquish his position as the mayor of one \nof South Carolina's largest municipalities as he continues his personal \nbattle with Alzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n  In an address to the residents of Mount Pleasant, the mayor made \nclear this was a difficult decision. He could have stayed in office and \ncarried on. But Mayor Hallman felt he could no longer meet the high \nstandard he had set for himself of being ``effective.''\n  As Mayor Hallman said in his resignation, ``To me, being `effective' \nmeans `excellence'. I realize now that I am not meeting my personal \ndefinition of `effective.' This Town deserves only the best from its \nleadership. Half way will not do for my Town.''\n  His resignation was the mark of a true public servant willing to put \nthe interests of the town he loves above his own personal interests.\n  Mayor Hallman has compiled a long and distinguished career of service \nin public office and private life.\n  After being elected to the office of mayor in September of 2000, \nMayor Hallman spent nearly two terms in office growing his town and \nimproving its assets. He will be remembered as a mayor who instituted \ninfrastructure projects that helped change the face of Mount Pleasant. \nAfter only 3 years under his service, the town saw over $150 million \nworth of road improvements and city development. Additionally, he \nhelped secure Federal and State moneys for a newly debuted farmer's \nmarket venue and a waterfront park for public use.\n  During his time as mayor of Mount Pleasant, Mr. Hallman chaired the \nPolice, Legal and Judicial Committee and the Transportation Committee. \nHe also served on the Water Supply Committee and as an ex-officio \nmember of the Mount Pleasant Waterworks Commission, the Patriots Point \nAuthority, and the Charleston Aviation Authority.\n  In 1988, Mayor Hallman was elected to serve in the South Carolina \nHouse of Representatives. While in office, he chaired the Charleston \nCounty Legislative Delegation as well as the State House Committee, \nwhich was responsible for overseeing the $78 million renovation of the \nSouth Carolina State House. He also offered his skills on the Joint \nBond Review Committee, and the State Development Board.\n  Born and raised in South Carolina, Mayor Hallman took great pride in \nseeing his State develop from corner to corner. As the son of a retired \noil executive and a stock market investor in Greenwood, SC, he grew up \nto appreciate all that the State has to offer. He was a 1958 graduate \nof the University of South Carolina, where he finished with a degree in \nbusiness administration. Years later he was awarded an honorary doctor \nof humanity letters degree from the University of Charleston.\n  As a distinguished member of the State community, Mayor Hallman was \noften asked to participate in the development of multiple health and \neducational improvements and expansions. He served on the University \nStudy Committee as their chairman, as well as the Low Country Graduate \nAdvisory Board. Mayor Hallman chaired the South Carolina Department of \nHealth and Environmental Control and served as treasurer for Charleston \nMemorial Hospital. His dedication to all aspects of life in South \nCarolina was broad in scope and great in impact.\n  A devoted citizen, Mayor Hallman formally retired on May 20, 2009, as \na revered member of the Mount Pleasant and South Carolina community. \nHis leadership and his commitment to our State will be forever marked \nby his extraordinary vision and endless sacrifice. Throughout his \nentire career and to this day, Mayor Hallman has served as a model to \nthose around him.\n  Along with his wife Shirley ``Brooke'' Hallman, who has stood next to \nhim with unwavering loyalty and shared sacrifice, he celebrates his \nretirement with his three children and six grandchildren. I thank him \nfor his service and wish him the very best in his retirement.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring him for his lifelong career \nof service and also send along our best wishes to him and his family as \nhe continues his battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DR. TOM DEAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I rise to recognize Dr. \nTom Dean of Wessington Springs, SD, who has been named the National \nRural Health Association's 2009 Practitioner of the Year and wish to \ncongratulate him on this well-deserved honor.\n  Dr. Dean has spent the majority of his 30 years in practice as a \nfamily physician in Wessington Springs, SD, and has served as a member \nof the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission since 2007.\n  After completing his medical education and training out of the State, \nDr. Dean returned to his native Wessington Springs, SD, as a National \nHealth Service Corps physician. Dr. Dean dedicated his professional \ncareer to delivering health care to his neighbors in rural South \nDakota. He is well known in his community for the personal attention he \ngives to his patients and for his understanding of the value of the \npatient-doctor relationship.\n  Having spent most of his career helping the residents of Wessington \nSprings stay healthy, Dr. Dean has come to understand the particular \nchallenges of rural health care delivery and the impact of health \npolicies on rural America. Dr. Dean is greatly involved with the \nNational Rural Health Association, an organization whose mission is to \nimprove the health and well-being of rural Americans and to provide \nleadership on rural health issues.\n  In addition to his practice and MedPAC work, Dr. Dean is chief of \nstaff at Avera Weskota Memorial Medical Center, and serves on the board \nof directors of the Bush Foundation Medical Fellowship and the South \nDakota Academy of Family Physicians. He is a past president of the \nNational Rural Health Association, recipient of numerous awards and \nhonors, and his research is published in many medical journals.\n  Through his practice and research, Dr. Dean has demonstrated his \ncommitment to improving the quality of care provided to the one-fifth \nof Americans who live in rural areas.\n  I applaud Dr. Dean's commitment to providing quality health care to \nhis patients. His contribution to shaping health care policy has added \na valuable and powerful voice for both rural health care providers and \npatients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5905-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERIC F. ROSS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Eric \nF. Ross who will celebrate his 90th birthday on June 25, 2009. A loving \ngrandfather, great-grandfather, and husband, Eric has been dedicated to \neducating the public about the Holocaust and is a passionate supporter \nof educational and cultural institutions in the United States, Germany, \nand Israel.\n  Born in Dortmund, Germany, Eric fled Nazi Germany and arrived in the \nUnited States when he was 20 years old. He courageously returned to \nEurope in 1942 as a soldier in the U.S. Army and a member of the \n``Ritchie Boys,'' a group of young men who escaped Nazi Germany and \njoined the Army. These men were specially trained to fight the Nazis \nand because of his service, Eric was awarded a Bronze Star. He went on \nto become a successful businessman, establishing Alpha Chemical & \nPlastics in Newark, New Jersey and Mercer Plastics Company, which is \nbased in Florida.\n  Holocaust remembrance and education are extremely important to Eric. \nIn 2003, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the U.S. \nHolocaust Memorial Council and he remains actively involved with the \nmuseum. He and his beloved wife Lore, who recently passed away, are the \nmuseum's largest individual donors and the museum's Ross Administrative \nCenter is named in memory of his parents, Albert and Regina Rosenberg, \nwho perished during the Holocaust.\n  I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the \n90th birthday of this remarkable man. His passion for education and \ndedication to philanthropy has touched countless lives and should serve \nas an example to others. I thank him for his tireless work and would \nlike to extend my warmest wishes on this momentous occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5905-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5905-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5905-S5906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/01/senate-section/article/S5906-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, announced that the House has passed the following bills, \nin which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 915.
