Mr. President, when you talk about the top teams in college \nfootball since the start of the century, you have to talk about Boise \nState University. A lot of people know about their famous blue turf and \ntheir quick, creative offense. Even casual college football fans can \ntalk like experts about the stunning trick plays that led the Broncos \nover a heavily favored Oklahoma team in a 2007 bowl game.\n  It is decidedly one of the most dominant programs of the decade. How \ndominant? Since Boise State joined the Western Athletic Conference in \n2001, it had lost just four conference games in 10 years.\n  On Friday night in Reno, it lost its fifth.\n  Boise State came in ranked third in the country and was on track for \nits third undefeated season in 5 years. It had a shot at the national \nchampionship. But thanks to the University of Nevada Wolf Pack and its \nbrilliant head coach, Chris Ault, Boise State is no longer in the \nrunning. And now when you talk about the top upsets in college \nfootball, you have to talk about Nevada.\n  Nevada and Boise State have been rivals for a long time--back when \nthey played in the Big Sky and Big West Conferences, and in the Western \nAthletic Conference where they play\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\ntoday. They will soon leave the WAC together to join the Mountain West \nConference, and the rivalry will continue. Although some recent games \nhave been close--the 2007 one went to four overtimes--Nevada had not \nwon since 1998.\n  But this year's Nevada team has been among the best in school \nhistory. It leads the conference in offense, rushing yards and points \nscored. After this weekend's win, it is ranged fourteenth in the \ncountry.\n  Still, beating a powerhouse like Boise State was no piece of cake. No \none had beaten the Broncos since December 2008. The Wolf Pack were 14-\npoint underdogs. They were down 17-0 late in the second quarter. Then \nquarterback Colin Kaepernick led an incredible second-half comeback and \nforced overtime.\n  They won the game when a 5-foot-6 freshman from McQueen High School \nin Reno, a young man named Anthony Martinez, kicked the most important \nfield goal in State history.\n  It was not that long ago that the University of Nevada did not even \nfield a Division I team. Now our proud program has knocked off one of \nthe toughest teams in the Nation.\n  It is no fluke. Coach Chris Ault is an exceptional leader and a good \nman. I am proud to call him a very good friend.\n  I have known Chris for a long time. When he was just 23 years old, he \nbecame the youngest high school head coach in the state, leading the \nBishop Monogue Miners in Reno. I was a member of the school's athletic \nbooster club, and I was impressed with Chris Ault from the day I met \nhim.\n  He led the Wolf Pack as its quarterback in the 1960s, as its athletic \ndirector two decades later, and has been its head coach three times, \ntotaling 26 years. He is one of the smartest coaches in the country. A \nfew years ago he invented the Pistol offense. Now schools across the \nNation, and even some NFL teams, are copying it.\n  In fact, only two men enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame \nare still actively coaching at the sport's highest level: the legendary \nJoe Paterno and Nevada's Chris Ault.\n  At the end of October, I was in church in Reno when a tall young man \nsat down next to me. It was Nevada's quarterback, Colin Kaepemick, \npreparing himself spiritually for the next game. In Friday's game, he \nbecame the first player in NCAA history to throw for more than 2,000 \nyards and run for 1,000 yards in three straight seasons.\n  Sometimes it is true what they say--that it is just a game. But this \nis one of those times when it is much more. This remarkable, memorable \nwin means so much for an underrated and underappreciated athletic \nprogram, for a great university and for the whole State of Nevada.\n  Congratulations to Coach Ault, Colin Kaepernick, Anthony Martinez and \nthe Wolf Pack. I never doubted you would pull it off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8208-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition principally to \nurge my colleagues to ratify the START treaty with Russia. I ask \nunanimous consent at the outset that the text of a memorandum from \nSenator Jon Kyl and Senator Bob Corker, two Republican Members, dated \nNovember 24, 2010, regarding progress in defining nuclear modernization \nrequirements be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I urge my colleagues to move ahead with the prompt \nratification of this treaty.\n  I have long been interested in the relationship between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union, predecessor to Russia, on the issue of \narms control, going back to my college days as a student of \ninternational relations.\n  One of the first items which attracted my concern on election to the \nSenate was a Saturday speech made by then-President Reagan where he \nsaid essentially that the United States had sufficient weapons to \ndestroy the Soviet Union and, similarly, the Soviet Union had \nsufficient weapons to destroy the United States. For decades, the two \ncountries lived under the truce, so to speak, of mutual assured \ndestruction. That has given way to arms control negotiations and the \nsuccessful negotiation of treaties. For example, the START I treaty in \n1992 was approved by a margin of 93 to 6. The START II treaty of 1996 \nwas approved by a margin of 87 to 4. The Moscow Treaty of 2003 was \napproved by a vote of 98 to nothing.\n  The memorandum I have referenced raises a number of concerns which I \nsubmit to my colleagues ought not to stop us from moving ahead with \nratification. For example, the memorandum makes this point on page 5:\n\n       Additional funding could be applied to accelerate the \n     construction of these facilities to ensure on schedule \n     completion. . . .\n\n  Well, there is no showing of a problem on on-schedule completion. To \ntalk about ``additional funding could be applied'' is far from saying \nit is necessary for our national security.\n  The memorandum further says:\n\n       Further Administration effort to advance funding is the \n     best path to successful completion of these facilities.\n\n  Well, here again, there is no showing that advance funding is \nnecessary for successful completion. It simply says it ``is the best \npath to successful completion of these facilities,'' but no showing \nthat the current path is not an adequate path.\n  The memorandum, in another spot, makes this statement:\n\n       . . . the NNSA is reviewing an updated surveillance plan \n     that could lead to greater budget requirements.\n\n  ``Could.'' It does not say it would lead to greater budget \nrequirements, and what is speculative as to what could happen ought not \nto be taken as any reason for objecting to the ratification.\n  Still later in the memorandum there is the statement:\n\n       . . . there are still no costs or funding commitments \n     beyond FY 2015.\n\n  Well, that is not surprising when we are in the year 2010. Adequate \ntime to consider and make commitments beyond 2015 is hardly a reason \nnot to move ahead with ratification.\n  Then, on page 5, under the category of ``Conclusion,'' there is a \nstatement about ``assurances from the appropriate authorizers and \nappropriators must be obtained to ensure that the enacted budget \nreflects the President's request.''\n  Well, that is unrealistic. There is no way to get assurances from \nauthorizers--that is referring to the Armed Services Committee--or the \nappropriators, specifically the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, a \nsubcommittee on which I have served during my tenure.\n  When you talk about getting assurances from legislators, from \nSenators, from Members of the House of Representatives, that, simply \nstated, is unrealistic, I submit.\n  The concerns I had in the early days of my tenure in the Senate led \nme to propose a resolution for a summit meeting which was contested by \nSenator Tower, who was then-chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \nOn this floor--I can still see Senator Tower on the end seat in the \nthird row back and I in the junior league my first couple of years in \nthe Senate. Senator Tower was a tough advocate. We had quite a \nprotracted debate about the triad.\n  I had done my homework. I had been to Grand Forks, ND, and seen the \nMinuteman II. It was my first experience seeing a nuclear weapon, and \nit was quite a sight. I recall looking down an open space--I think it \nwent close to 100 feet, perhaps 90 feet; I would not affirm exactly \nwhat it was--and seeing the Minuteman II, and that was, in effect, \nsmall potatoes compared to what we have had since. I went to the Air \nForce base in California to look at the B bomber, the B-1 or the B-2 at \nthat time, and to South Carolina to Charleston to see the nuclear \nsubmarines.\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\n  I had quite a debate with Senator Tower as to whether the subs were \ndetectable, which bore on the issue of whether we had sufficient \nstrength, and the tabling motion was defeated on a vote of 60 to 38. I \nrecall Senator Laxalt walking down the aisle and voting no and starting \nto head for the Republican cloakroom, and Senator Tower walked fast, \nchasing him up the aisle, and said: You don't understand, Paul, this is \na tabling motion. I am looking for an ``aye.'' And Laxalt turned and \nsaid: I understand what you are after, John, but I agree with Arlen \nSpecter. Senator Tower said: He is trying to tell the President what to \ndo. Senator Laxalt said: Well, so is everybody else--really, in effect, \nsaying that is what Senators do from time to time, just expressing \ntheir opinions.\n  The tabling motion was defeated 60 to 38, and the resolution was \nadopted 90 to 8.\n  There has been a lot of unease and consternation among foreign \nnations as to what is going on in the Senate. I do not question the \nmotives of the writers of the memorandum. I do not question their \nmotives or their good faith. But there is considerable concern both at \nhome and abroad as to the gridlock which now confronts the Senate. That \nis inevitable when one Senator says: We are going to see to it that \nthis is President Obama's Waterloo, and when leadership on the other \nside of the aisle says: Our principal objective is to defeat President \nObama in 2012. There is a concern about what is happening, whether \nthere are really bona fide objections to the START talks.\n  In connection with the travels I have undertaken during the course of \nthe past many months--in India, with a congressional delegation, a \ngroup of us met with the Prime Minister of India, a concern about \nagreements made with our executive branch, whether they will be upheld; \na meeting with officials in China on certain trade issues; talking to \nleaders in other foreign countries, a real question about what is going \non in the government of the United States.\n  In this interdependent world, I suggest it is very important we \nproject a national image, a national posture of rationality in what we \nare doing and not to throw up roadblocks to international agreements \nsuch as START without good reason in the context where at least in \nappearances there is obstructionism.\n  When we talk about risks involved, my own view is that we are far at \nthis point from a threat with the Russian Government. This is not the \nday of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 when the world may have \nteetered on the edge of a nuclear confrontation. The relations with the \nSoviet Union were disintegrated. The relations with Russia are vastly \nimproved, and we need the cooperation of Russia in dealing with many \nvery vexing international problems, paramount of which is our dealings \nwith Iran and the need to have the Russians join us in sanctions \nagainst Iran and to promote the Russian offer to enrich the uranium \nfrom Iran so they do not enrich it themselves, posing a threat with \nwhat Iran would do with enriched uranium--a threat which is not present \nif it is not in Iran's hands when uranium is enriched, which could be \nused for peaceful purposes.\n  We see today the importance of the cooperation of China in the \nconcerns we have with North Korea. When that problem broke last week, \nmy first comment publicly in a television interview on MSNBC was to \nstate what was the obvious: that we had to engage China to deal with \nNorth Korea. China's initial comments were muted, were not very \nencouraging. I am pleased to see the most recent reports are that China \nis moving ahead to try to deal with a threat posed by North Korea, \nhaving shuttle talks between North Korea and South Korea.\n  So it is in this overall context of having the assurances registered \nwith foreign governments that there is rationality. When we talk about \nrisks, my own assessment--and I have studied this situation closely. I \nwas a member of the U.S. arms talks in Geneva going back into 1987, \nduring that decade and beyond. But the risks are not what they once \nwere. It is never possible to eliminate risks entirely, but when we are \nlooking to evaluate the balance of risks and international cooperation \nwith Russia and our conduct on START, as we project an image of \nstrength with other countries, the risk is well worth taking to the \nextent that it exists. Again, I say my own evaluation is that there is \nnot much of a risk involved.\n  The Washington Post, last Friday, November 26, quoted one of the \nauthors of the memorandum expressing satisfaction:\n\n       I've come to the conclusion that the administration is \n     intellectually committed to modernization now. . . .Whether \n     they're committed in the heart is another matter. Suppose \n     Start is ratified, and they no longer have to worry about \n     that? Will they continue to press for the money?\n\n  Well, if we concede there is a commitment, be it an intellectual \ncommitment, there is not a whole lot more that we can ask for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8209-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had spoken about this when we \nreconvened several weeks ago, that it is my hope that Congress, the \nSenate specifically, will take up legislation which I have introduced \nwhich would authorize the use of Federal funding for embryonic stem \ncell research. Embryonic stem cell research holds enormous potential. \nYou take the embryos which are the most flexible of all of the stem \ncells and they can replace diseased parts of the body and they offer \npromise of a veritable fountain of youth.\n  The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said the \nExecutive order issued by President Obama was invalid. But Congress has \nthe authority to legislate to cure any defect. The case is on appeal to \nthe circuit court, and a stay has been issued. But the scientists are \nvery apprehensive, as they testified before the Labor, Health and Human \nServices Subcommittee. There are some 200 projects with some $200 \nmillion involved.\n  It is not a constitutional matter. It is a matter of statutory \ninterpretation on the existing statute. But to the extent there is any \nambiguity, this is something which we ought to address and we ought to \naddress promptly because it is a life-and-death matter. As long as the \nlitigation is pending in the Federal court, the scientists do not know \nwhich way to turn. So they have made their point very clear.\n  The case could go on for a very protracted period of time when you \nhave to file briefs, have argument, and a decision in the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. Then a possible petition for \ncertiorari could take a matter of years. With the ideological issues \ninvolved, who knows what the final outcome would be in the judicial \nsystem. But that can all be put to rest by legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8209-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8209-S8211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TELEVISING THE SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. One other point briefly--I see a colleague awaiting an \nopportunity to speak--and that is my hope we will address, before the \nend of the year, the issue of televising the proceedings of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. This is an issue I have worked on, on the \nJudiciary Committee, for a couple decades now. It has been reported a \nnumber of times out of committee. It is currently on the Senate agenda.\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States decides all of the cutting \nedge questions. There ought to be transparency. When the case of Bush \nv. Gore was argued, then-Senator Biden and I wrote to the Chief Justice \nurging that the proceedings be televised. We got a response back in the \nnegative, but on that day there was a simultaneous audio released. I \nnoticed 2 weeks ago that on C-SPAN there was a Supreme Court argument \nwhich was a couple weeks old with an audio, and they had a picture of \nthe Justice who was speaking and a picture of the lawyer arguing the \ncase--sort of like movies before talking; sort of like silent movies. \nThere was an audio.\n  It is high time the public's business be open. Newspaper reporters \ncan walk into the Supreme Court, make notes, upheld by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. Visitors are limited to some 3 minutes. The \nchambers can only hold about 250 people. It is time the Court was \ntelevised. I hope the Senate will act. I have discussed the issue with \nthe leadership in the House and there are positive responses on the \nissue.\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     From: Sen.

Bob Corker\n     To: Republican Members\n     Date: November 24, 2010\n     Re: Progress in Defining Nuclear Modernization Requirements\n       We appreciate your willingness to consider New START in the \n     context of modernization of our nuclear complex and the \n     weapons it supports.\n       In advance of having an opportunity to discuss the issue \n     more fully next week in Washington, we want to summarize the \n     status of our discussions with the administration.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Throughout the Obama administration's pursuit of a New \n     START treaty, we have been clear, as has Secretary Gates, \n     that we could not support reductions in U.S. nuclear forces \n     unless there is adequate attention to modernizing those \n     forces and the infrastructure that supports them. The \n     Administration's recent update of the 1251 plan, originally \n     submitted in May in accordance with Section 1251 of the \n     FY2010 NDAA, is an acknowledgment that more resources we \n     needed to accomplish the objectives set forth in the Nuclear \n     Posture Review for the modernization of the U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent. This memo discusses our concerns with the original \n     1251 plan, changes made and our assessment of those changes \n     and remaining issues.\n\n\n      Background--the Decline of the Nuclear Weapon Stockpile and \n                             Infrastructure\n\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear weapons \n     infrastructure (including laboratories, production facilities \n     and supporting capabilities) has been allowed to deteriorate. \n     The weapons have remained safe, secant and reliable, but they \n     and their caretakers have been in a state of limbo--only when \n     critical problems have arisen has action been taken. The \n     production facilities are Cold War relics, safety and \n     security costs have grown exponentially, and critical skills \n     have been jeopardized through layoffs, hiring freezes, and \n     the retirement of skilled scientists and technicians who \n     earlier were able to fully exercise the full set of nuclear \n     weapons-related skills. In FY2010, the Ohama administration \n     invested only $6.4 billion in the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration Weapons Activities funding line, a 20 percent \n     loss in purchasing power from FY2005 alone. It is no longer \n     possible to continue deferring maintenance of either the \n     facilities or the weapons. As a result, the 2010 Nuclear \n     Posture Review set forth a broad range of modernization and \n     sustainment requirements that would be impossible without \n     additional budget support.\n       A detailed explanation of these concepts is located in the \n     appendix to this memo; but to help understand the current \n     situation, imagine an automotive expert working in a garage \n     built in 1942. The roof leaks and his tools are becoming \n     outdated. Moreover, he has responsibility for a fleet of \n     eight racing Ferraris, which have been sitting in storage for \n     about 30 years. The last time any engine was turned on was \n     1992, but this ``steward'' is responsible for assuring that, \n     at any given moment, each of the eight finely-tuned cars will \n     respond to the key turn. To do this, he is allowed to assess \n     components of the cars for aging--leaks, cracks, rust, etc. \n     (though he isn't able to look at the components often enough \n     and in sufficient detail because of his maintenance budget).\n       Even on a shoe-string budget, he is beginning to see signs \n     of age throughout the fleet, and realizes that each and every \n     car will require a complete overhaul (a ``life extension'' \n     program). To be successful, he needs a new garage, updated \n     tools, and skilled assistants (because truthfully, the expert \n     will be retiring long before the overhauls are complete, \n     assuming his pension fund is still solvent). He will have to \n     replace some of the parts (especially the electronics--some \n     of his fleet of Ferraris still have vacuum tubes), because \n     they just aren't available anymore; but some parts will have \n     to be reused, or manufactured to be as close to the original \n     as possible. Some of the original parts contained materials \n     that are now illegal for safety or environmental reasons. To \n     add to the problem, the owner is asking for air bags, anti-\n     lock brakes and anti-theft technology. Each overhaul will \n     take about a decade, from planning through execution and \n     without a new garage, he will be unable to finish the \n     overhauls on time. And at the end of the day, the mechanic is \n     fairly certain that he will not be allowed to turn the \n     ignition to check his work.\n       This is the state of our nuclear deterrent today, except, \n     we're dealing not with cars, but with the most sophisticated \n     and dangerous weapons ever devised by man.\n\n\nSection 1251 Plan and FY2011 Budget--A Response to the Nuclear Posture \n                                 Review\n\n       The initial section 1251 report showed a ten-year budget \n     plan for Weapons Activities totaling $80 billion. But most of \n     that $80 billion is not directed at modernization activities \n     called for in the NPR--it is mostly consumed in ``keeping the \n     lights on'' at the laboratories and plants, including safety, \n     security, facility upkeep (which is difficult on very old \n     facilities that would have been replaced long ago in the \n     private sector), and routine warhead maintenance.\n       Only about $10 billion of that ten year number was for new \n     weapons activity, about half of it coming from DOD and half \n     from ``savings'' assumed from low inflation projections. We \n     doubt such savings can be realized and the DOD funding is not \n     enough to cover everything that needs to be done. It provides \n     for a small increase to stockpile surveillance for warhead \n     evaluation, funding for the W76 life extension program and \n     the B61 and W78 life extension studies, and partial funding \n     for badly-needed design, engineering and a modest investment \n     for construction of new plutonium and uranium processing \n     facilities--the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement \n     (CMRR) nuclear facility and the Uranium Processing Facility \n     (UPF). These new facilities will replace Manhattan Project-\n     era buildings that are a substantial maintenance burden and \n     are becoming increasingly challenging to maintain in a safe \n     and operable condition.\n       Recognizing that more money was needed up front, the \n     administration's FY2011 budget request of $7.0 billion for \n     Weapons Activities improved the FY2010 budget by $624 \n     million. The $624 million was included as a budget \n     ``anomaly'' in the two month C.R. we passed before the \n     October recess, but will have to be maintained in the \n     longer-term C.R. or Omnibus we will pass in December.\n       The initial 1251 plan left a lot of questions about how all \n     the work articulated in the NPR would be funded. Numerous \n     experts expressed concerns about obvious shortfalls in \n     funding and about restrictions placed on designers that will \n     constrain their ability to work through stockpile issues. The \n     funding levels for CMRR and UPF were of significant concern, \n     as was the funding for Life Extension Programs--especially to \n     incorporate improved safety, security and reliability in \n     these warheads. And of great concern to the directors of the \n     national weapons laboratories, much of the promised budget \n     increase for modernization was not pledged until FY 16, by \n     which point the Administration's commitment (if it is still \n     in office) may have waned. As a result, we requested an \n     update to the 1251 plan that would answer the questions we \n     raised and that would show a stronger commitment to \n     modernization.\n\n\n                           Undated 1251 Plan\n\n       Atter reviewing our questions, and with further review of \n     the requirements imposed by the NPR, the Administration \n     agreed that updated budgets were required. Thus, on November \n     17, 2010, an updated 1251 report was provided to the Senate, \n     including an early FY12 budget projection with White House \n     approval. The 1251 update, and the briefing provided as part \n     of the update, satisfied many, but not all, of the initial \n     questions we had earlier expressed.\n       The 1251 plan update increases the FY2012 budget request by \n     an additional $600 million, increases the FY2012 five-year \n     plan by $4.1 billion, and adds to the total FY11 ten-year \n     plan between $5.4 and $62 billion. We are told that the new \n     increases will not be taken from the DOD budget line. This \n     update brings the ten-year plan (from FY11) to between $85.4 \n     and $86.2 billion. Again, approximately $70 billion of the \n     original pledge of $80 billion was needed just to maintain \n     current operations of the nuclear weapons complex, without \n     covering the expense of the needed modernization of the \n     stockpile or infrastructure. This update also includes \n     revised cost estimates for CMRR and UPF; those estimates now \n     range from $3.7 to $5.8 billion for CMRR and $4.2 to $6.5 \n     billion for UPF.\n       The new $4.1 billion for the five years of the FY2012 FYNSP \n     is divided as follows:\n       $340 million for design and engineering and modest \n     construction activity for CMRR and UPF (see below for more \n     detail);\n       $1.7 billion (approximately) for other facility \n     construction and maintenance requirements, including the High \n     Explosive Pressing Facility at Pantex and test facilities at \n     Sandia National Laboratories;\n       $1.0 billion (approximately) for stockpile work, with added \n     funding for life extension programs, stockpile surveillance \n     and other design and research activities, though some of this \n     funding ($255 million for the W76) is only needed because one \n     life extension program will take longer due to the capacity \n     bottleneck in the complex;\n       $1.1 billion for contractor pension obligations spread \n     through Weapons Activities accounts (which, while needed, \n     does not support modernization).\n\n\n                           Remaining Concerns\n\n       Despite this new increase, there remain a few substantial \n     concerns about the adequacy of the proposed budget. For one, \n     the Administration is attempting to address the enormous \n     increases in the cost estimates for CMRR and UPF by delaying \n     the full operation of those facilities by one to two years. \n     This would stretch the final completion of CMRR to 2023 and \n     UPF to 2024, although the Administration states that some \n     operational capability would be established (as required) in \n     2020. If extended, hundreds of millions of dollars would be \n     needed annually to maintain Manhattan Project-era facilities \n     at LANL & Y-12. Additional funding could be applied to \n     accelerate the construction of these facilities to ensure on \n     schedule completion and prevent wasted investments in \n     maintaining an securing facilities that are being replaed \n     anyway.\n       Furthermore, the Administration is ignoring the benefits of \n     ensuring funding commitments for these facilities early in \n     the budget process. Responsible advance funding mechanisms \n     exist, such as a FY12 request for three-year rolling funding \n     (recommended by some NNSA budget specialists), or \n     alternatively, an Administration commitment to seek advanced \n     funding in FY13 following the completion of the 90 percent \n     design cost estimate. Further Administration effort to \n     advance funding is the best path to successful completion of \n     these facilities.\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\n       Given the need to live with our currently aging stockpile \n     until an adequate production capability is established (after \n     2020), accurate assessment of the state of the current \n     stockpile is paramount. The 1251 plan update shows a doubling \n     of surveillance funding from FY09 to FY11--which is \n     commendable--but is our understanding that the NNSA is \n     reviewing an updated surveillance plan that could lead to \n     greater budget requirements. NNSA should affirm that this \n     review has been completed and the budget request will reflect \n     updated requirements.\n       Finally, the 1251 update made clear that NNSA will not \n     restore a production capability adequate to maintain our \n     current stockpile levels (declassified as 5,113 weapons \n     total), and instead allow up to 1,500 warheads to be retired \n     or held with no maintenance unless funding increases are \n     sought and obtained. Failing to maintain hedge weapons will \n     increase the risk that the U.S. cannot respond to a problem \n     in our aging stockpile. The Administration should not engage \n     in further cuts to our deployed or non-deployed stockpile \n     without first determining if such cuts are in our national \n     security interest and then obtaining corresponding reductions \n     in other nations' nuclear weapons stockpiles, such as \n     Russia's large stockpile of weapons not limited by New START \n     (e.g., its tactical nuclear weapons).\n\n\n            Modernization of U.S. strategic delivery systems\n\n       The 1251 update deals not only with our nuclear weapons, \n     but the delivery systems that are part of our TRIAD. The \n     update indicates somewhat clearer intent by the \n     Administration to pursue a follow-on heavy bomber (though not \n     specifically nuclear) and air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), \n     though development costs beyond FY 2015 are yet to be \n     determined. While the update notes that estimated costs for a \n     follow-on bomber for FY 2011 through FY 2015 are $1.7 \n     billion, there are still no costs or funding commitments \n     beyond FY 2015. It is the same for the ALCM: $800 million \n     programmed over the FYDP, but no cost estimates are included \n     beyond FY 2015. We should have a better idea of these \n     estimated costs over the full ten years of the 1251 plan, and \n     know whether the Administration intends to make this new \n     heavy bomber and ALCM nuclear capable.\n       Decision-making for an ICBM follow-on is unlikely before FY \n     2015, at the completion of an ongoing analysis of \n     alternatives. The update notes: ``While a decision on an ICBM \n     follow-on is not needed for several years, preparatory \n     analysis is needed and is in fact now underway. This work \n     will consider a range of deployment options, with the \n     objective of defining a cost-effective approach for an ICBM \n     follow-on that supports continued reductions in U.S. nuclear \n     weapons while promoting stable deterrence.'' (emphasis added) \n     We think it important to understand what the Administration \n     intends when it suggests that a decision regarding a follow-\n     on ICBM must be guided, in part, by whether it ``supports \n     continued reductions'' in U.S. nuclear weapons--especially \n     since we seriously doubt it's in our interests to pursue \n     reductions beyond the New START treaty. One logical inference \n     from this criterion is that a follow-on ICBM is no longer \n     needed because the U.S. is moving to drastically lower \n     numbers of nuclear weapons. We continue to press for a letter \n     from the DOD confirming its commitment to follow-on nuclear-\n     capable delivery systems.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Until these issues are resolved, it will be difficult to \n     adequately assess the updated 1251 plan, despite the welcome \n     increases in proposed spending. And as has always been clear, \n     assurances from the appropriate authorizers and appropriators \n     must be obtained to ensure that the enacted budget refledcts \n     the President's request.\n\n\n                                appendix\n\n       Briefly, some of the stockpile programs most affected by \n     the lack of Administration support for modernization include:\n       Replacing Manhattan Project-era Facilities: Since the \n     closure of the Rocky Flat Plant in 1989, the U.S. has had \n     only a limited capability to produce the core component of \n     our stockpile weapons: the plutonium pit. To establish a pit \n     production capability, a 60-year-old research laboratory must \n     be replaced by the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) nuclear facility at Los Alamos. Likewise, \n     producing uranium components at the 70-year-old facility at \n     Y-12 in Oak Ridge is an increasing risk that requires \n     construction of a new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF). \n     Completion of these new facilities will be essential in \n     meeting life extension program requirements starting in 2020.\n       Production Capacity: As Secretary Gates stated, \n     ``Currently, the United States is the only declared nuclear \n     power that is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has \n     the capability to produce a new nuclear warhead.'' The United \n     States requires a nuclear weapon production capability with \n     sufficient capacity to satisfy the life extension requirement \n     of our aging weapons, as well as to provide a ``hedge'' \n     against future technical or political problems. Currently, we \n     are limited to producing a handful of plutonium pits a year \n     for one weapon, but are unprepared to produce most of the \n     remaining pieces of that weapon. Modernization of the NNSA \n     laboratories and plants is required to correct this issue, \n     with the stated goal of establishing a ``capability-based'' \n     production capacity. Without this capacity, there can be no \n     stockpile reductions. In fact, General Chilton argues the \n     stockpile might have to be increased: ``I would say because \n     of the lack of a production capacity there's a fear that you \n     might need to increase your deployed numbers because of the \n     changing and uncertain strategic environment in the future.''\n       Life Extension Programs: Under current policy, the \n     laboratories and plants are constrained to extending the life \n     of existing warheads to keep them in the stockpile for much \n     longer than originally expected. Thus, as the weapons age and \n     concerns are observed, the laboratories and plants determine \n     how best to repair the weapons. Aging components are \n     replaced, remanufactured or inspected for reuse in the \n     stockpile. In performing life extension for the W87 and the \n     ongoing W76, our experts have discovered that it is very \n     difficult to reconstitute processes and capabilities that \n     have been allowed to atrophy. Currently, the W76 warhead is \n     in LEP production, the B61 LEP study is underway and the NPR \n     called for an FY2011 start to a W78/W88 LEP study that \n     will research if the two warheads can be life-extended \n     simultaneously.\n       Surveillance: The average age of our current nuclear \n     weapons is approaching 30 years. To ensure that each warhead \n     remains reliable, each year approximately 11 warheads per \n     type should be returned from the military for dismantlement \n     and evaluation. Components are inspected and tested to ensure \n     reliable operation. This program aids in the annual \n     assessment of the stockpile performed by the laboratories and \n     is the lead mechanism for identifying potential stockpile \n     issues. Due to inadequate funding, surveillance requirements \n     have not been met for many years, raising concerns about \n     confidence in the stockpile.\n       Deferring Maintenance, Creating Chokepoints: In addition to \n     the CMRR and UPF construction projects to replace aging \n     facilities, a significant number of buildings in our \n     laboratories and plants have been accumulating a backlog of \n     maintenance. This deferred maintenance creates a substantial \n     number of facilities that could (and occasionally do) become \n     a choke point in the progress of a life extension program. \n     Maintenance can only be deferred for so long, until, \n     eventually, something breaks; and when it does break, it is \n     usually much more expensive to replace than routine \n     maintenance would have cost. Reducing deferred maintenance is \n     a demonstration that we are moving from a nuclear weapons \n     complex in decline, to a revitalized and robust capability.\n       Critical Skills: Perhaps the most significant attribute of \n     a strong deterrent is the scientific and technical capability \n     that is present in our laboratories and military complex. \n     Maintaining those skills, especially as most nuclear-test \n     experienced weapon designers are past retirement age, is a \n     growing challenge within the NNSA laboratories and plants.\n       Hedging: Without a robust production capability, the U.S. \n     maintains a large non-deployed stockpile as a technical hedge \n     against stockpile concerns and a political hedge that allows \n     rapid upload should another nation become increasingly \n     adversarial. With the technical hedge, if one weapon type \n     were discovered to have an urgent issue requiring \n     replacement, alternate components in the force structure \n     theoretically could be used to compensate for that loss of \n     capability. For example, W78 warheads on Minuteman III might \n     be replaced by W87 warheads maintained in storage, and vice-\n     versa.\n       Delivery Systems: Nuclear weapon delivery systems require \n     replacement within the next thirty years. These systems \n     include:\n       The B-52H bomber, first deployed in 1961 and scheduled to \n     be sustained through 2035;\n       The B-2 penetrating bomber, deployed in 1993 is currently \n     being updated for long-term sustainment;\n       The Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), deployed in 1981 \n     and scheduled to be sustained through 2030;\n       The Minuteman III ICBM, deployed in 1970, undergoing life \n     extension and scheduled for replacement by 2030;\n       And the ballistic missile submarines and missiles. Ohio-\n     class SSBNs were first deployed in 1981 and commence \n     retirement in 2027. The Trident II Submarine Launched \n     Ballistic Missile (SLBM), deployed in 1990, will be sustained \n     through at least 2042, following a life extension.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8211-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8211-S8212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              1099 REPEAL\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, we have a distinct opportunity to take \nwhat I regard as very clear and decisive action to uphold two very \nimportant principles. We as a Senate, No. 1, support enabling job \ncreation. In this regard, repealing the 1099 paperwork mandate helps \nfulfill our promise to clear Federal roadblocks that are stopping small \nbusinesses from expanding and putting Americans to work.\n  Small businesses want to expand. They want to hire more workers. \nMillions of Americans want to get back to work. Yet the tax paperwork \nmandate hidden in the health care law requires businesses to file a \nmountain of additional 1099 tax forms. It will consume\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nresources that would otherwise be spent on wages for new employees. Our \njob creators need to be focusing their time and energy on hiring and \nexpanding, not dealing with government-directed mounds of paperwork.\n  In addition to halting this enormous amount of tax paperwork, full \nrepeal would prevent erroneous IRS fines and hefty accountant bills \nfrom slamming our job creators.\n  As the President of the National Federation of Independent Business \nput it:\n\n       You can't operate and grow your business if you are \n     spending all your time filling out IRS forms and haggling \n     with auditors.\n\n  I couldn't agree more, and that is why I have been actively \nadvocating for a complete and full repeal of this burdensome 1099 \nrequirement for many months now. Anything less than a complete repeal \nis simply unacceptable.\n  No. 2, we take seriously the concerns of so many Americans with our \ngovernment's out-of-control spending. That is the second principle we \ncan stand for today. The elections recently held, I believe, sent a \nvery clear message about Washington's spending habits and our enormous \n$14 trillion debt. Voters expressed dismay and alarm with the rate of \ngovernment spending and with enormously good reason. Spending has \nincreased by more than 21 percent since 2008 and annual deficits weigh \nin at more than $1 trillion.\n  American households across this great country are doing the best they \ncan to put food on the table and pay the mortgage. In the face of a \nvery difficult economic environment, they are doing everything they can \nto survive. Our families have seen their wages slashed, jobs lost, and \nhome values plummet. Their solution to these difficulties isn't to \ncontinue spending with disregard for the level of their debt. Instead, \nthey dig deep and figure out ways to cut costs and to make ends meet. \nMeanwhile, they look at their Federal Government in disbelief when they \nsee how we continue to spend money we don't have.\n  My amendment takes their concerns to heart by fully offsetting the \ncost of the 1099 repeal. The alternative amendment piles $19 billion of \ndebt onto the backs of future generations, further kicking the fiscal \nresponsibility can down the road.\n  Then-Senator Obama said this in 2006: America has a debt problem and \na failure of leadership.\n  When he refers to the debt problem, he is absolutely right. How true \nthat is. Even the sponsor of the alternative has spoken very well on \nthis issue. Again, I am quoting, and the board shows the quote:\n\n       There is no one here who would argue the point that our \n     deficits are too high. . . .We have to pay our national debt \n     and then go on and find ways to reduce the budget deficits. I \n     think all of us can agree that is something we have to do.\n\n  Getting our fiscal house in order will not be easy, but for the sake \nof the country's future, we have to take action.\n  Today we have an opportunity to do that: No. 1, repeal the onerous \n1099 requirement; and No. 2, without adding a single penny to our \ndeficit or to the cost of the health care law.\n  Some here may try to argue that we don't have to pay for the repeal. \nI could not disagree more. This repeal should and must be offset. As my \ncolleagues may recall, in September, I offered a similar repeal that \nalso was fully offset. It did receive significant bipartisan support, \nbut some objected to my proposed offsets and came to me on the floor \nand said: I would be with you on this but for the offsets.\n  Opponents explained they voted no because they opposed taking money \nfrom the new health care law. So we sat down and, in the spirit of \ncompromise, I took those criticisms to heart and came up with a new, \nnoncontroversial way to pay for this needed repeal.\n  My amendment uses unspent and unobligated funds from Federal accounts \nto fully pay for the repeal of the 1099 mandate. This fiscally \nresponsible approach is not controversial, and it has been done many \ntimes before. At the end of every year, there is money left in the \naccounts of Federal agencies that has not been obligated for a specific \npurpose. According to the most recent OMB estimate, roughly $684 \nbillion is just sitting in these accounts at the end of fiscal year \n2010. This almost $700 billion does not include--does not include--\naccounts for the Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs. We leave \nthem off the table. So my amendment boils down to using about 5 percent \nof these funds--5 percent.\n  Additionally, my amendment gives the Office of Management and Budget \ndiscretion to decide what programs from which the funds can come. \nAgain, this is not unusual; it has been done before. This approach is \nbetter than an across-the-board cut. It allows important programs to be \nspared any reduction. However, let's face it. This funding has been \navailable all year long--some of it for several fiscal years. If it was \nimportant to our Nation, Federal agencies would have spent it now. As a \nformer Cabinet member, I ran one of these agencies.\n  So there is no basis for the claims about what vital programs this \namendment might reduce. Again, I emphasize, this has been done many \ntimes before. It is simply 5 percent of the nonsecurity-related funding \nthat was lying dormant in Federal accounts at the end of the year. If \nwe cannot agree to this noncontroversial offset, then the public demand \nfor fiscal responsibility voiced in November has fallen on deaf ears.\n  In September, when the Senate first voted down my 1099 amendment, the \nconcern was about the source of the offsets. No one argued that we \nsimply did not need to pay for the repeal. No one got up and said: \nWell, we don't have to pay for this. This was never a part of anyone's \nargument. Yet that is exactly what the Baucus alternative amendment \nproposes. It says to our children and grandchildren: It is too tough \nfor us to find $19 billion, so we are going to add it to the debt you \nwill have to assume. It is a rejection of fiscal responsibility.\n  After all the hoopla over pay as you go, the alternative amendment \ndoesn't include a single budgetary offset to cover costs. The amendment \nsimply says: Let our kids and our grandkids sort it out on top of the \n$14 trillion of debt we are leaving them. That is unfortunate. If we \ncan't come together to agree on a few billion dollars in budget \nconstraint, how do we ever hope to address the $14 trillion national \ndebt?\n  Any Senator who votes for the Baucus amendment is sending a clear \nmessage to his or her constituents that fiscal responsibility is not a \npriority. Any claim otherwise truly does ring hollow.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the Baucus alternative and vote for \nthe Johanns amendment. It will be a vote to protect our job creators \nand the prosperity of our children and grandchildren. We simply cannot \nkeep kicking the fiscal responsibility can down the road.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about my opposition \nto an amendment that is going to be offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma to eliminate congressionally designated projects.\n  For me, the job has always been about the people, and the best ideas \ndo come from the people. As I have traveled around the State of \nMaryland, whether to worksites or roundtables or unfettered, uncensored \nconversations in diners, I listen to the people. What they tell me is \nthat they are mad at Washington because when all is said and done, more \ngets said than gets done. Families are stretched and stressed, and they \nwant a government that is on their side. They want a strong economy, a \nsafer country, and a government that is as frugal and thrifty as they \nare. People want us to focus on a constitutionally based government.\n  I support the people because I feel the same way. I do think we have \nto\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\nfocus on building a strong economy. We do have to focus on being a more \nfrugal government. However, I say to my colleagues, getting rid of \ncongressionally designated projects is really a false journey to be on. \nIf we eliminate every congressionally designated project--otherwise \nknown as earmarks--we won't do anything to reduce the deficit because \ncongressionally designated projects are less than one-half of 1 percent \nof total Federal spending. What it will do, however, is make it harder \nto meet compelling human and community needs many of us hear about from \nour constituents. Without these congressionally designated projects, \noften their needs will be cast aside by a big government or a big \nbureaucracy.\n  I believe we need to fight for real deficit reduction, and the way we \ndo it is to look at the recommendations of the various commissions that \nare being put forward, whether it is Simpson-Bowles or Domenici-Rivlin \nor others.\n  What I do think is that we also should maintain our constitutional \nprerogatives of fighting for our constituents and fighting by being \nable to put special projects into the Federal checkbook.\n  I have been clearly on the side of reform. We have had many requests \nfor earmarks in my Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science. I got $3 \nbillion worth of requests, including $580 million for police officer \ntechnology. Another $980 million came for fighting crime, drugs, and \ngangs through enforcement, prevention, and intervention. Also, we got \n$220 million worth of requests in science and in education. We cannot \nfund those at those levels. In fact, we severely reduced them and \nstayed within what we think are acceptable limits. So we need the local \ncommunities to keep our communities safe, to educate our children in \nscience and technology, and make sure we keep our police officers safe \nwith earmarks of $3 billion.\n  There have been abuses of congressionally designated projects. That \nis why I support reform, and the leadership is focused on reform. In \n2007, new Senate rules began to require full disclosure of these \nprojects. In 2009, Senator Inouye insisted on more significant reforms: \nEvery project must be posted by Senators on their Web site. Every \nproject must be less than 1 percent of the discretionary budget.\n  Today, congressionally designated projects--otherwise known as \nearmarks--are 50 percent below what they were when the Republicans \ncontrolled the Congress. Mr. President, I emphasize that under \nDemocratic leadership, we reduced earmarks by 50 percent below what \nthey were in 2006, and we made the process open and transparent. I \nthink this is very important.\n  In the Commerce-Justice bill, I instituted my own reforms. I even \nwent a step further. I established criteria that met community needs \nand must be supported by a viable organization, and it must have \nmatching funds.\n  I have also fought and led the subcommittee in a more aggressive \nreform effort. I provided robust funding to inspectors general to be \nthe watchdogs of the agencies. I am the first Senator on an \nappropriations subcommittee to insist that the inspector general \ntestify at every one of my subcommittee hearings of an agency on issues \nrelating to waste and abuse.\n  I established an early warning system on cost overruns, and then I \nreduced overhead by 10 percent by getting rid of lavish banquets and \nconferences and also cutting the amount that could be spent on \ntchotchke giveaways at the conferences they did have. That might sound \nlike a small thing, but, my gosh, getting an inspector general there, \nwe found all kinds of things under every rock where another couple \nmillion were hidden and we worked to get rid of that. We also got rid \nof things such as the $4 meatball or $66 for bagels for one person at a \nDepartment of Justice breakfast. So we said: Let's get rid of the \nfolly, let's get rid of the fraud, let's into get into a more frugal \natmosphere, and we were able to do this.\n  I would hope we could institutionalize these reforms. There are \nreforms we could put in place that are common sense, but it would \nenable colleagues to exercise their constitutional prerogative of not \nletting big bureaucracies and big government determine the destiny of \nour communities. I am always going to fight for Maryland. I am not here \nto defend earmarks, but I am here to defend my ability to help \nMaryland. So I oppose Coburn.\n  Coburn would have a moratorium for 3 years on appropriations bills, \nauthorizing bills and tax bills. I oppose it because I do not think, \nfirst of all, it will reduce the Federal deficit; secondly, it takes \naway my constitutional power--the power of the purse that was given to \nCongress--to be able to help my constituents; and lastly but most of \nall, I wish to have every tool at my disposal to make sure big \nbureaucracies don't forget the little people who pay the taxes. So I \nhope we defeat Coburn.\n  At the same time, what I want to be able to do is stand on the side \nof reform. I can assure my colleagues, if Coburn is defeated, I will do \neverything in the institution to follow the leadership already \nestablished by Senator Inouye--a real reformer--to further reform our \nprocess. Let's get rid of abuse, but let's not give away our ability to \nstand and fight for our constituents.\n  Let me close by giving a couple examples. The Port of Baltimore \nprovides over 1,000 jobs. I want to be ready when those big ships come \nthrough the Panama Canal, so I have a dredging earmark in that makes my \nport fit for duty for the 21st century.\n  I also have another earmark in for Ocean City beach replenishment, \nwhich we have already done. It protects millions of dollars of real \nestate along Maryland's coast, where we generate over $10 billion in \ntourism.\n  I have also funded small projects but big in the hearts of my \nconstituents, such as helping with the building of a children's \nhospice. Imagine having a child so sick they require hospice care. The \nleast America can do and the least the Senate can do is to partner with \nfamilies, the local government, and people at great institutions, such \nas hospice, to make sure children at the end stage of life have a place \nto be.\n  So do I fight for congressional projects? You bet I do. Has it made a \ndifference in the lives and economy of Maryland? You bet it does. So we \ncan have this moratorium, but I will predict we will be back 15 months \nfrom now to reinstate it. I say: Let's keep it, let's reform it, let's \nhave a stronger economy, safer communities, and a more frugal \ngovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to first acknowledge the Senator \nfrom Maryland and to say I appreciate her work in reforming the system \nof congressionally initiated projects.\n  I also wished to mention, before I get to my main topic today, which \nis the expiration of the volumetric ethanol excise tax, the important \nvote we are having this evening on food safety. As the Chair knows, \ncoming from the State of Minnesota, we had three people who died during \nthe last foodborne illness tragedy--the salmonella in peanut butter \nepisode. One of those individuals included Shirley Ulmer, mother of \nJeff Ulmer, who has worked so hard to get this bill passed, and we are \nhopeful we have finally gotten the votes to improve our food safety \nsystem, which hasn't been improved since the 1930s. Clearly, we have \nseen a lot of changes to our food supply since then, and so this is \nlong overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8213-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8213-S8214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VOLUMETRIC ETHANOL EXCISE TAX\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to underscore the need to invest \nin homegrown energy and to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. Our \nNation's ability to produce a reliable low-cost domestic source of \nenergy is both an economic issue and a national security issue.\n  Two years ago, our Nation got a wake-up call. Gas prices exceeded $4 \na gallon, even $5 in some places. It was a chilling reminder that the \nUnited States spends more than $400,000 per minute on foreign oil. That \nmoney is shipped out of our economy, adding to our enormous trade \ndeficit and economic woes, and leaving us reliant on unstable parts of \nthe world to meet our basic energy needs.\n  Some of our colleagues have called for the volumetric ethanol excise \ntax credit--known as VEETC--to expire at the end of December. This tax \ncredit was created 5 years ago to help bring ethanol from our farms to \nour gas pumps. It has helped us start to invest in the farmers and the \nworkers of the\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nMidwest instead of the oil cartels of the Mideast.\n  My colleagues talk about how we need to let the free market solve our \ndependence on foreign energy. Well, I wholly support free markets, but \nI say: Let's have a level playing field and let the best ideas succeed. \nI would like to know if my colleagues truly think there is a level \nplaying field for those trying to compete with the oil industry. We \nhave an oil industry that has received decades of government support. \nYet we have an emerging biofuels industry, powered by American farmers, \nthat is starting to grow the crops, to improve the ethanol that is \nfinally displacing our demand for oil. Over the last few decades, more \nthan $360 billion worth of taxpayer subsidies and loopholes have lined \nthe pockets of oil companies. This is nearly 10 times greater than the \ninvestments we have made in homegrown biofuels. Meanwhile, in just the \nlast 5 years, the top five oil companies recorded $560 billion in \nprofits.\n  Since the ethanol tax credit was first adopted, it has helped the \nrenewable fuels industry grow and grow not just with the same kind of \nrenewable fuel but to begin to expand--as you know, from our home State \nof Minnesota--into cellulosic ethanol, into using water and, a better \npart of the process, into conserving water and into using all kinds of \nnew ideas. But to pull the rug out from under this new growing \nindustry, when it is competing against the big guys--against big oil--\nis the wrong thing to do. In our State alone, employment and economic \noutput from the ethanol biofuels industry has doubled. This year's \nbiofuels production in Minnesota is expected to exceed 1 billion \ngallons, employing nearly 8,400 people and creating an economic impact \nof more than $3 billion. Instead, do we want to give all those jobs to \nthe Mideast, to give them to countries we don't even want to be doing \nbusiness with?\n  Nationally, homegrown ethanol displaces about 5 percent of our oil \nconsumption or about 350 million barrels. The ethanol industry employed \nnearly half a million Americans to produce the ethanol right here in \nour country. Letting this tax credit expire would almost certainly put \nthousands of jobs in jeopardy and would also increase our dependence on \nforeign oil, thereby hurting our national security. The oil spill in \nthe gulf was a poignant reminder. Our addiction to oil comes with \nserious cost and it is time our Nation gets serious about investing in \nalternatives.\n  We didn't see a windmill blow up in the middle of a corn field. We \ndidn't see an ethanol plant blowing up in the middle of a corn field.\n  Senators Conrad and Grassley have called for a 5-year extension of \nthe ethanol tax credit, and I support their bipartisan legislation. \nSenator Johnson and I have introduced the Securing America's Future \nwith Energy and Sustainable Technologies--the SAFEST Act--with similar \nprovisions calling for an extension of the tax credit, but it also \nincludes a strong renewable energy standard--something we need in this \ncountry and something Senator Snowe and I have worked on.\n  I see Senator Kerry of Massachusetts is here. I was devoted last year \nto focusing on alternative energy and ways to focus on our homegrown \nenergy industry. I know this ethanol tax credit will not always be \nnecessary. That is why I have also been working to develop a new more \ncost-effective tax credit that would replace the existing VEETC credit \nand would more directly benefit and focus on the farmers who are \ngrowing our transportation fuel.\n  No one is denying we can improve the tax credit to make it even more \neffective with investments in alternative fuels, but the ethanol \nindustry, the biofuels industry, and private investors with billions of \ndollars in capital need to know our Nation is serious about supporting \nalternative fuels. Are we going to pull the rug out from under them? \nAre we going to put our heads in the sand and send all that money \ninstead to the Mideast?\n  Allowing this tax credit to expire before we can come up with a long-\nterm agreement about how to continue to invest in homegrown energy \nwould send the wrong signal to investors. Letting this tax credit \nexpire with no replacement would say America is not serious about \nfinding alternatives to oil and we are not serious about reducing our \ndependence on foreign energy.\n  Our Nation has an unemployment rate of 9.6 percent. To meet our basic \nfuel needs, we continue to send $730 million a day to foreign \ncountries, many of which have been known to funnel money to terrorists. \nNow is not the time to pull that rug out from underneath the largest, \nmost established domestic alternative to petroleum fuel. Now is not the \ntime to put in jeopardy tens of thousands of jobs. Now is the time to \nextend the biofuels tax credit and invest in those farmers in the \nMidwest instead of those oil cartels in the Mideast. Now is the time to \nincrease our support for alternative energy. These investments will \nhelp us to lower the unemployment rate, reduce the amount of money we \nsend overseas to meet our energy needs, and these investments will help \nmake our Nation less reliant on unfriendly nations--on those we don't \nwant to be doing business with.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to this argument and look at these \nnumbers--at how much money the oil industry is getting.\n  I note the Senator from Massachusetts is here, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are in what we all understand are very \ndifficult times--challenging in every respect and certainly with \nrespect to the national security concerns of the country. As we speak, \nAmerican soldiers are fighting a war in Afghanistan, winding down a war \nin Iraq, and our Nation has young men and women in harm's way in many \nparts of the world, engaged in a persistent challenge against global \nterrorism. Iran's nuclear program continues to advance, and North Korea \nis building a uranium enrichment facility and provoking the south on a \nregular basis with its military aggression.\n  Every single one of these is a complex challenge without any easy \nsolution. But in the middle of all these challenges, the Senate has \nbeen given an opportunity to actually reduce the dangers our country \nfaces. We have been given an opportunity set an example for the world. \nWe have been given an opportunity to make the decision that would help \nto put greater pressure on Iran, on North Korea or on any other country \nthat might be contemplating the notion of moving toward nuclear \nweapons. The Senate has been given the opportunity in the next days to \nexpress the leadership of our country with respect to moving in the \nopposite direction--away from nuclear weapons to greater controls, \ngreater accountability, greater security and safety for our people.\n  With one simple vote before we leave here in the next days, we could \napprove the New START treaty and make America and the world more secure \nand take an important step forward in leadership as we express to the \nworld our sense of responsibility with respect to the challenge of \nnuclear weapons. That is the opportunity we have. The question before \nevery Senator is going to be whether we come here in these next days to \ndo the business of the American people, to do our constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent to a treaty negotiated by the \nexecutive department of the country.\n  New START is, quite simply, a commonsense agreement to control the \nworld's most dangerous weapons and enhance stability between the two \ncountries that possess over 90 percent of them. Just think of the \nstatement it makes to those countries contemplating where Iran may be \ngoing when the countries that possess 90 percent of these weapons begin \nto dismantle these weapons and provide intrusive verification steps \nbetween us for how we will both behave. What an important statement at \nthis moment in time with respect to Iranian behavior, with respect to \nNorth Korean behavior, and what a completely opposite, irresponsible \ndecision it would be if the Senate just got bogged down in politics and \nwalked\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\naway from this moment, unwilling to make that kind of decision that \noffers the leadership that I think the world and certainly the American \npeople expect us to make.\n  This treaty will limit the number of nuclear weapons Russia can \ndeploy to 1,550 warheads. What American who contemplates the nature of \nnuclear war and conflict and the potential damage of 1 weapon, 10 \nweapons, 20 weapons--what American does not understand the common sense \nof limiting Russia to 1,550 weapons pointing at the United States of \nAmerica, some of them directly pointing at us even as I stand here and \nspeak today?\n  This treaty will give us flexibility in deploying our own arsenal so \nwe do not have to live by a strict restraint with respect to land or \nsea or air. We have flexibility in which weapons we want to put into \nwhich modality, and the verification provisions will significantly \ndeepen our understanding of Russian forces. It has been almost a full \nyear now since the original START treaty and its verification \nprocedures expired. Every day since then, insight that treaty provided \nhas been degrading.\n  New START does more than just restrain the weapons. It does more than \njust provide verification. It actually strengthens the relationship \nbetween the United States and Russia, and it enhances the global \nnonproliferation regime we signed up to years and years ago during the \nCold War. It will improve our efforts to constrain Iran and, most \nimportant, to contain the loose nuclear materials we all fear could one \nday fall into the hands of terrorists and, if not result in a nuclear \nexplosion, result in what we call a dirty bomb explosion where nuclear \nmaterial is, in fact, scattered for want of the ability to create a \nnuclear weapon itself but with grave consequences of radioactive \nmaterial doing enormous injury to large populations as a result. \nAlready in the 7 months since we signed the New START, Russia has shown \ngreater dedication to this renewed relationship. They have supported \nharsher sanctions against Iran. They have suspended the sale of the S-\n300 air defense system to Tehran.\n  The original START agreement which was the bedrock of the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, a program whereby we are \ncurrently reducing nuclear warheads with Russia and containing the \nnuclear material--one of the great contributions to nonproliferation of \nmodern times--that is the most successful nonproliferation effort to \ndate in which any country has engaged. That would be threatened if this \nSTART agreement does not pass. It is strengthened if the START \nagreement does pass.\n  Without the START treaty, the New START treaty--I think nobody \nexpresses concern greater than Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar, a \nRepublican Senator, has shown enormous leadership on this issue for \nyears and years now. He is respected all across the globe by those \npeople who follow these issues. He has expressed the urgency of passing \nthis treaty now, in this Senate, in this Congress, in this session.\n  In summary, the New START helps the United States to lead other \ncountries so we help each other to address the lingering dangers of the \nold nuclear age, and it gives us a very important set of tools in order \nto combat the threats of the new nuclear age. Indeed, the single most \nsignificant question being raised at this point in time is not about \nthe substance of the treaty within the four corners of the treaty; it \nis about language external to the treaty with respect to whether it \nsomehow might limit our missile defenses. All of us acknowledge that \nthose missile defense investments we have made to date will go a long \nway toward helping us to be able to address the threat of rogue states.\n  Let me just say as unequivocally as I know how that there is nothing \nin this treaty--there is no way this treaty--there is no way the \npolicies of this administration--there is no way any language that is \nformal or binding between our nations or any other language, in fact, \nbinds the United States or restrains us from pursuing missile defense. \nThe answer with respect to any question on missile defense in this \ntreaty is, no, it unequivocally does not restrain America's ability to \ndevelop and deploy missile defense. What is more, the evidence of that \nwas very clear in Lisbon just the other day where the President of the \nUnited States, together with European countries, publicly announced the \nprocedure by which we are going forward to deploy a missile defense in \nEurope in order to deal with the rogue threat problem.\n  Let me be even more clear. With respect to the question of any \nlimitation of missile defense, the Secretary of Defense, appointed by \nPresident George W. Bush, says no, there is no limitation on missile \ndefense; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says no, there is no \nlimitation on missile defense; the commander of our nuclear forces says \nno, no limitation on missile defense; the Director of the Missile \nDefense Agency says no, there is no limitation on missile defense. \nAgain and again, senior military leaders have said unambiguously that \nthis treaty does not limit our missile defense plans. So, in my \njudgment and the judgment of most people I know who reasonably approach \nthis treaty, there is no issue of missile defense with respect to this \ntreaty.\n  Now we are beginning to hear people say that maybe we do not have \ntime, in the context of the lameduck session, to deal with this \nquestion of American leadership, this constitutional responsibility \nthat ought properly to be executed by the Senate that has done all of \nthe work on this treaty. There is in that statement about lack of time, \nto some degree, a sort of question: Maybe there are a whole bunch of \nissues out there that just have not been resolved. Let me try to deal \nwith that for a moment because I wish to make it very clear that the \nNew START treaty's inspection and evaluation and analysis process by \nthe Senate and appropriate committees has been extensive and \nexhaustive.\n  I wish to make clear what the record says about the time we have to \nconsider this treaty. The Senate has been working on this treaty for \nthe past year and a half, ever since the negotiations first began.\n  Starting in June of 2009, the Foreign Relations Committee was briefed \nat least five times during the talks with the Russians. Senators from \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the \nSenate's National Security Working Group--all of them took part in \nthose briefings. That was an obligation of this Congress. This Congress \nwas present during the briefings with the negotiators, this Congress \nwas privy to those negotiations as they went along--something a future \nCongress could not be because the negotiations are over. That \nunderscores even more why this is the Congress that is the appropriate \nCongress to deal with this treaty. Roughly 60 U.S. Senators, through \nthose committees I named, were able to follow the negotiations in \ndetail, and individual Senators had additional opportunities to meet \nwith our negotiating team, and a delegation of Senators even traveled \nto Geneva in the fall of 2009 to meet with the negotiators. I might add \nthat included Senator Kyl, who has been one of the leading Senators on \nthe other side involved in our discussions on this treaty. In other \nwords, by the time the New START treaty was formally submitted to the \nSenate in May, the 111th Congress was already steeped in this, deeply \nsteeped in this. No other Senate can now replicate the input we had \ninto these negotiations.\n  Over the next 6 months after the Senate treaty was submitted, the \nSenate became even more immersed in the treaty's details through \nhearings, briefings, documents, and hundreds upon hundreds of questions \nthat were submitted to the administration. Something like 900 questions \nwere submitted to the administration, and all of them have been \nanswered in full.\n  This Senate has done its homework on the New START treaty, and it is \nthis Senate that has an obligation to complete the advice and consent \non that treaty.\n  The fact is, there are also very important security reasons for us \nnot to wait. Next Sunday, December 5, it will have been 1 year since \nthe original START treaty expired--a whole year without on-the-ground \ninspections in Russia. Some people say it doesn't really make a \ndifference whether it be a month or 2 months or whatever. I have to \ntell you something: When it comes to nuclear arsenals, every day \nmatters. Without this treaty, we know\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\ntoo little about the only arsenal in the world that has the potential \nto destroy the United States.\n  As James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, said--and he \ndoes not come to us with an opinion that is clouded by politics; he \ndoesn't come to us as a Democrat or a Republican; he comes to us as a \nprofessional whose task it is to defend the security of our country and \nwho has a lifetime career wearing the uniform of our Nation, defending \nour country--he says of ratifying New START, ``I think the earlier, the \nsooner, the better.''\n  One of our most solemn responsibilities is this responsibility of \nadvice and consent. We have been through a tough political year. The \nAmerican people, we all understand--Senators keep coming to the floor \nand referring to the anger. It is real. It is there. We know the \nAmerican people are angry. But they are angry because the business of \nthe country does not seem to get done. They are angry because they see \na partisan food fight, a political food fight taking place instead of \nthe serious business of our Nation.\n  I believe other countries are watching us to see whether we can \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Just how well does this \ndemocracy we sell all over the world actually work? If we can't make it \nwork here at home and we can't deliver now, what kind of a message does \nit send about the power of the United States to leverage its values and \nits interests in the challenging world we face today?\n  Every Senator has an obligation to ask that question of themselves \nover the course of these next days: Are we a credible partner? Can \nother nations rely on us? What happens when the President of the United \nStates negotiates a treaty, and he comes back here and the rest of the \nworld sees that treaty bogged down, not in the substance of the treaty \nbut in the politics of the day?\n  With this vote we can demonstrate our resolve and our leadership, and \nwe can demonstrate something about the quality of our democracy. I \nthink the schedule of the Foreign Relations Committee shows good-faith \nefforts which we have applied to live up to the Senate's \nresponsibility.\n  After the treaty was signed in April, Senator Lugar and I worked \ntogether to set up a bipartisan review of the treaty. Never once did \nSenator Lugar or I approach this in a partisan way. I am grateful to \nSenator Lugar for his exceptional leadership and his willingness to \nstand up to some of the currents of the day and act on the interests of \nthe country as he sees them.\n  Our primary consideration in the scheduling of witnesses before our \ncommittee was not whether they would support or oppose the treaty, we \nlooked for expertise and we looked for experience. On April 29, the \ncommittee heard from Bill Perry, former Secretary of Defense, and Jim \nSchlesinger, former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  These men recently led the congressionally mandated Strategic Posture \nCommission. They both said we should approve the New START treaty. Dr. \nSchlesinger said it is--this is the quote of Dr. Schlesinger, who \nserved a Republican President--``obligatory''--that is his word--\n``obligatory for the United States to ratify New START.''\n  Dr. Perry told us this treaty advances American security objectives, \nparticularly with respect to nuclear proliferation and nuclear \nterrorism. On May 18, the committee held a hearing with Secretary \nClinton, Secretary Gates, and Admiral Mullen. Admiral Mullen told us \nthe New START treaty ``has the full support of your uniformed \nmilitary.''\n  Secretary Gates made clear the treaty will not constrain U.S. missile \ndefense efforts. He said:\n\n       From the very beginning of this process more than 40 years \n     ago the Russians have hated missile defense. They do not want \n     to devote the resources to it and so they try and stop us \n     from doing it through political means. This treaty does not \n     accomplish that for them.\n\n  That is what Secretary Gates said. The next day, former Secretary of \nState Jim Baker, who helped negotiate START I and helped negotiate \nSTART II, said that the New START ``appears to take our country in a \ndirection that can enhance our national security while at the same time \nreducing the number of nuclear warheads on the planet.''\n  A week later, on May 25, Henry Kissinger recommended ratification of \nthe treaty. He also cautioned us that rejection of the treaty would, in \nhis words, have an ``unsettling impact'' on the international \nenvironment.\n  We also heard from two former National Security Advisers; Stephen \nHadley, who served under George W. Bush, who told us the treaty is ``a \nmodest but nonetheless useful contribution to the security of the \nUnited States and to international security''; and Brent Scowcroft, who \nserved under George H.W. Bush, said he supports the treaty and he told \nus the New START does not restrict our missile defense plans. He said \nthe Russian unilateral statement was simply an issue of ``domestic \npolitics for the Russians.''\n  So we heard from some of the most eminent statesmen this country has \nproduced, Republicans and Democrats, with decades and decades of public \nservice. They said we should approve this treaty. In all, six former \nSecretaries of State, five former Secretaries of Defense, the Chair and \nVice Chair of the 9/11 Commission, and numerous other distinguished \nAmericans have said it is important we approve New START.\n  On July 14, seven former heads of the U.S. Strategic Command and \nStrategic Air Command sent the committee a letter urging approval of \nthe treaty. Indeed, some of the strongest support for this treaty has \ncome from the military, which unanimously supports the treaty. On June \n16, I chaired a hearing on the U.S. nuclear posture, modernization of \nthe nuclear weapons complex, and our missile defense plans.\n  GEN Kevin Chilton, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, which is \nresponsible for overseeing our nuclear deterrence, explained why the \nmilitary supports the New START. He said:\n\n       If we don't get the treaty, A, the Russians are not \n     constrained in their development of force structure, and, B, \n     we have no insight into what they are doing. So it is the \n     worst of both possible worlds.\n\n  Again, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command says not ratifying \nthis treaty is the worst of both possible worlds. And LTG Patrick \nO'Reilly, who heads the Missile Defense Agency, told us the New START \ndoes not limit our missile defense plans.\n\n       I have briefed the Russians, personally in Moscow, on every \n     aspect of our missile defense development. I believe they \n     understand what that is. And that these plans for development \n     are not limited by this Treaty.\n\n  In other words, the Russians know what we intend to do and they \nsigned the treaty, nonetheless.\n  On July 14, the committee had a closed hearing on monitoring and \nverification of treaty compliance with senior officials from the \nintelligence community. Obviously, that was a highly classified \nbriefing. But every Senator is welcome to go down to the Office of \nSenate Security and read the transcript of that hearing, which I \nsuspect will stay there and not appear in WikiLeaks.\n  If my colleagues want a public statement on verification, I would \nonce again cite what James Clapper, the Director of National \nIntelligence, said last week about ratifying the New START treaty:\n\n       I think the earlier, the sooner, the better. You know the \n     thing is, from an intelligence perspective only--\n\n  This is General Clapper's perspective--\n\n     are we better off with it or without it? We're better off \n     with it.\n\n  The committee also heard testimony from the directors of the Nation's \nthree nuclear laboratories. As we all know, much of the debate on the \ntreaty has focused on the resources that are needed to sustain our \nnuclear deterrent and modernize our nuclear weapons infrastructure, and \nit was important for our committee to hear from the responsible \nofficials directly. They praised the Obama administration's budget \nrequest for this fiscal year. I suspect my colleague from North Dakota, \nin a few minutes, will have something to say about that additional \nfunding for the nuclear modernization program and the plan of action \nthat has been outlined.\n  I will simply say, again and again, the administration has bent over \nbackward to work in good faith openly and accountably with Senator Kyl. \nI have been part of those discussions all\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\nalong. I think we have acted in good faith to try to meet the needs--so \nmuch so that we put money into the continuing resolution a few months \nago, in order to show our good faith for this effort to try to produce \nthe modernization funding as we go forward.\n  In all, the Foreign Relations Committee conducted 12 open and \nclassified hearings, featuring more than 20 witnesses. The Armed \nServices and Intelligence Committees held more than eight hearings and \nclassified briefings of their own. We did not stack the deck with \nDemocrats. In fact, most of the former officials who testified were \nRepublicans. Even the executive branch witnesses included several \nholdovers from the last administration--Secretary Gates, Admiral \nMullen, General Chilton, Lieutenant General O'Reilly--all originally \nappointed to their posts by President Bush.\n  Overwhelmingly, these witnesses supported timely ratification of the \nNew START treaty. As I have said, some of the strongest endorsements \ncame from America's military leaders. The combined wisdom of our \ncurrent and former military and civilian leaders, accumulated over \ndecades in service, not to political parties but in service to the \nNation as a whole, was clear: All of them said this treaty should be \nratified.\n  Over the summer, the committee also reviewed a number of important \ndocuments, including a National Intelligence Estimate, assessing the \nU.S. capability to monitor compliance with the terms of the New START, \na State Department report assessing international compliance with arms \ncontrol agreements, including Russia's compliance with the original \nSTART, the State Department's analysis of the New START's \nverifiability, a classified summary of discussions during the treaty \nnegotiations on the issue of missile defense.\n  By the end of July, the Foreign Relations Committee had compiled an \nextensive record. We could have reported the treaty out of committee \nthen. We had the votes. I was prepared to move forward, but because \nsome Republican Senators knew we were prepared to move forward, they \ncame and asked for more time to review the treaty and to look at the \ntestimony and the documents we had gathered.\n  So, in August, in direct response to this Republican request, I made \na decision as chairman to postpone for 6 weeks, over the course of the \nAugust recess, until after that so Members would have more time to \nreview the record, as the Republicans requested. Frankly, the treaty, I \nhave said again and again, is too important to get caught up in \npartisan politics, so I thought it was very important not to allow \nanybody to say we were rushing it.\n  We gave that additional time, even though we had the votes. We came \nback afterwards and we dealt with each and every one of the concerns \nthat were raised in good faith. Frankly, it is important to have \nreciprocal good faith in the workings of the Senate. Over the next 6 \nweeks, I encouraged Senators to contact Senator Lugar and me with their \ncomments on a draft resolution of ratification. In discussions with \nSenator Lugar, Senator Corker, Senator Isakson, I made it clear we \nwelcomed and needed their input and, indeed, we got their input.\n  At the same time, the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees were \nwrapping up their work on the treaty. Senators Levin and McCain each \nwrote to the Foreign Relations Committee with their views on the \ntreaty, as did Senators Feinstein and Bond from the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  We received the answers to several outstanding questions Senators had \nposed to the administration. In all, over the past 7 months, Senators \nformally submitted some 900 questions to the Obama administration, and \nthey have received thorough responses to every one of them.\n  By mid-September, our bipartisan work produced a resolution of \nratification we should all be able to support. Our review process was \nnot designed to cheerlead for the treaty. It was designed to probe \nevery aspect of the treaty and to come up with a resolution that \nprovided the Senate's input and protected the prerogatives of the \nSenate and, indeed, of individual Senator's points of views. That is \nwhat we have done. At 28 pages, the resolution of ratification--\nincluding 13 conditions, 3 understandings, 10 declarations--addresses \nevery serious topic we have discussed over these months. If a Senator \nwas worried about the treaty and missile defense, then condition (5), \nunderstanding (1), and declarations (1) and (2) addressed those issues.\n  If they were worried about modernization of our nuclear weapons \ncomplex and strategic delivery vehicles, then condition (9) and \ndeclaration (13) addressed those concerns.\n  If they were worried about conventional prompt global strike \ncapabilities, then conditions (6) and (7), understanding (3) and \ndeclaration (3) addressed those.\n  Worried about tactical nuclear weapons? Well, that is in there. \nVerifying Russian compliance? It is in there. Even the concern that was \nraised about rail-mobile missiles was fully addressed in the resolution \nof ratification.\n  In short, the resolution is the product of careful, bipartisan \ndeliberation and collaboration intended to address each of the concerns \nthat was raised. That does not mean the resolution is perfect. It does \nnot mean it could not possibly be further improved. But in the past \nweeks, I have been reaching out to colleagues to get additional ideas. \nI will be happy to consider any germane amendment that colleagues might \npropose. But the only way to do that is by having the floor debate on \nthis treaty.\n  With the Senate now back in session, there are 33 days before the end \nof the year. All of us would obviously not like to repeat what happened \nlast year and not be here right up until Christmas Eve. But there is \nplenty of time in the next 3 weeks for debate.\n  Look at the record. The original START agreement was a far more \ndramatic treaty than the New START because its cuts were sharper and \nbecause the Soviet Union had just collapsed, leaving tremendous \nuncertainty in its wake. Yet the full Senate needed only 5 days of \nfloor time before it approved that treaty, by a vote of 93 to 6, a far \nmore complicated and far more provocative, if you will, treaty at that \ntime.\n  The START II treaty took only 2 days on the floor in the Senate \nbefore it was approved by a vote of 87 to 4.\n  So leave the precedent aside for a moment. When it comes to \nprotecting our national security, the American people expect us to make \ntime. That is exactly what we are prepared to do.\n  We are prepared to work around the clock. If time is the only \nconcern, then we have no concerns. Given the time that it took to \nconsider past treaties, it is clear we can do this. We are not new to \nthis business. We are not new to this treaty. We could get this done if \nthere is a will to do so. I know some Senators still worry about the \nadministration's plans with respect to modernization of the nuclear \nweapons complex. That is not directly within the four corners of the \ntreaty, but I understand their concern. So let's review the work very \nquickly that has been done there.\n  The Obama administration proposed spending $80 billion over the next \n10 years. That is a 15-percent increase over the baseline budget, even \nafter accounting for inflation. It is much more than was spent during \nthe Bush administration's 8 years. Still some Senators have concerns.\n  On September 15, the Vice President assured our committee that the \n10-year plan would be updated and a revised 2012 budget figure would be \nprovided this fall. In the meantime, because I believed that the \nnuclear weapons program ought to be adequately funded, I worked with \nother colleagues--with the leader and Senators Dorgan and Inouye--to \nguarantee that an anomaly in the continuing resolution that we passed \nin October provided an additional $100 million for the past 2 months. \nIt ensured that we would get the updated figures from the \nadministration. The administration has now provided those figures. It \nis asking for an additional $5 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I remind colleagues that according to the resolution of ratification, \nif any of this funding does not materialize in future years, the \nPresident will be required to report to Congress as to how he is going \nto address the shortfall. But if the Senate does not now approve the \nratification of the New START, it will become increasingly difficult \nwithout\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nany requirement for a report, and it will become increasingly difficult \nto provide that funding. That is a solid reason why we ought to get \nthis done now.\n  Ultimately, bottom line, we need to approve this treaty because it is \ncritical to the security of our country. It is better to have fewer \nnuclear weapons aimed at the United States. It is better to have the \nright to inspect Russian facilities. It is better to have Russia as an \nally in our efforts to contain Iran and North Korea and in order to \ndeal with the global proliferation challenge. Our military thinks it is \nbetter to have these things. If any of my colleagues disagree, let them \nmake their case to the full Senate. That is the way it is supposed to \nwork around here. Let them make their case to the American people. If \nthe American people said anything in this election year, it is that \nCongress needs to get down to the real business of our Nation. If the \nnational security of our Nation is not the real business, I don't know \nwhat is. They have asked us to protect American interests. By ratifying \nthis treaty, we will do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nSenator Kerry, as chairman of the committee, has done an extraordinary \njob. I also mention Senator Lugar and others who have worked very hard \non the issue of the ratification of the START treaty. I was a member of \nthe Senate National Security Working Group, and the Administration kept \nus informed all along the way during the negotiations with the \nRussians. We had meetings in various locations and were briefed by the \nnegotiators who described to us what the negotiations were about, what \nthe progress was, and so on. Some of my colleagues from this Chamber \nwho were a part of that National Security Working Group came to the \nmeetings. We all had an opportunity to ask a lot of questions. It is \nnot as if someone just dropped on the Senate some package called the \nSTART treaty. We have been a part of that all along and have been a \npart of having discussions and descriptions of the work of this treaty \nfor some long while.\n  I wish to go through a couple of things today. First, some colleagues \nhave decided we should not proceed with the ratification of this new \narms reduction treaty that we have negotiated with the Russians. Some \nhave alleged that there are all kinds of difficulties with it. They say \nit would limit our ability to produce and deploy an antiballistic \nmissile. That is not the case. It is not accurate. They are suggesting \nthat our modernization program of existing nuclear weapons or the \nlifetime extension programs for existing nuclear weapons is not funded \nsufficiently, and that is not the case. They indicate it would not meet \nour national security requirements to go ahead with this treaty.\n  Let me describe what some very distinguished Americans who would know \nabout this have said. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike \nMullen, said: I, as well as our combatant commanders around the world, \nstand solidly behind this new treaty.\n  That is from the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  This is General Chilton, commander of the Strategic Command that is \nin charge of our nuclear weapons. He says:\n\n       The United States strategic command was closely consulted \n     throughout the development of the nuclear posture review and \n     during negotiations on the new strategic arms reduction \n     treaty. . . .\n       What we negotiated is absolutely acceptable to the United \n     States strategic command for what we need to do to provide a \n     deterrent for the country.\n\n  This chart pictures former nuclear commanders who support this \ntreaty: Generals Davis, Welch, Chain, and Butler, Admiral Chiles, \nGeneral Habiger, Admiral Ellis. I have worked with many of these folks, \nand they are very respected. All of them believe this treaty is the \nright thing for this country and its security.\n  Dr. Henry Kissinger says:\n\n       It should be noted I come from the hawkish side of this \n     debate so I'm not here advocating these measures in the \n     abstract. I try to build them into my perception of the \n     national interest. I recommend ratification of this treaty.\n\n  This chart shows America's most prominent national security experts \nwho support this New START treaty, Republicans and Democrats, the most \nsignificant thinkers about foreign policy in this country today. They \nsay they support this treaty and what it means to the country.\n  Some have said there is not enough funding for our modernization \nprogram for existing nuclear weapons or for the lifetime extension \nprogram for existing nuclear weapons, and that would be a problem. They \nare wrong about that. Let me describe what Linton Brooks, the former \nNNSA administrator in charge of these areas, nuclear weapons and the \nmodernization and the lifetime extension programs, says, someone who \nserved under the Bush administration in that role:\n\n       As I understand it, it is a good idea on its own merits, \n     but I think for those who think it is only a good idea if you \n     only have a strong weapons program, this budget ought to take \n     care of that. Coupled with the outyear projections, it takes \n     care of the concerns about the complex and it does very good \n     things about the stockpile. And it should keep the labs \n     healthy.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       I would have killed for this budget.\n\n  This is from the man who headed NNSA during the Bush administration.\n  Let me go through the issue of spending because one of the principal \nconcerns has been we are not spending enough money on the existing \nnuclear weapons stockpile. There are roughly 25,000 nuclear weapons in \nthis world. With respect to our portion of those nuclear weapons, we \nmodernize them. We have life extension programs to make certain they \ncan be certified as workable nuclear weapons, notwithstanding the fact \nthat we don't ever want to have to see that one works because it seems \nto me the explosion of a nuclear weapon in a major city will change \neverything in the future. But, nonetheless, we have a certification \nprogram. We spend a great deal of money modernizing and keeping up to \ndate with lifetime extension programs, the existing stock of nuclear \nweapons.\n  I chair the appropriations subcommittee that funds the nuclear \nweapons stockpile among other things. The Appropriations Committee \nconsidered a request from the President this year for $7 billion for \nthese weapons programs. In my subcommittee, which does a lot of \nthings--energy and water programs and nuclear weapons--almost \neverything else was either flatlined or reduced. But nuclear weapons \nwas increased substantially. The $7 billion the President requested was \na 10-percent increase over the previous year. Some of my colleagues \nhave said that leaves us way short of what we need.\n  That $7 billion was put into the continuing resolution in November. \nThere wasn't much discussion of that. So while virtually all other \nfunctions of government will continue to function at last year's \nappropriations level, the nuclear NNSA, nuclear weapons function, will \nbe able to spend at the new funding level of $7 billion, up 10 percent \nfrom the previous year.\n  Let me also describe what has happened with respect to fiscal years \n2011 to 2015. The President's budget plan for those years provided $5.4 \nbillion above the previous plan. So this President has proposed \ngenerous appropriations to make certain that modernization and the life \nextension programs of existing nuclear weapons is funded well. I \nmentioned it went to $7 billion.\n  Now, in November, the President sent a report to Congress which \nreported that he plans to request $7.6 billion for the year 2012. That \nis a $600 million increase over 2011 which was a $600 million increase \nover 2010. Overall, the request in this new report is a $4.1 billion \nincrease over the baseline during 2012 to 2016. So then we will be \nspending $85 billion in the 10-year period, $85 billion on \nmodernization of our current nuclear stockpile and the life extension \nprogram in our current nuclear stockpile, and even that is not enough. \nWe are told that is not nearly enough money.\n  How much is enough? If we can certify the stockpile works and the \nstockpile provides a deterrent, how much is enough? This President has \nrobustly funded the requests that were needed. Now we are told not \nnearly enough money has been appropriated.\n  By the way, those who are saying this are saying we need to \nsubstantially cut Federal spending and reduce\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\nthe Federal budget deficit. Very interesting.\n  Let me relate, as I have in the past, something that happened over 9 \nyears ago to describe the importance of this subject. On 9/11/2001, \nthis country was attacked. One month later, October 11, 2001, there was \na report by a CIA agent code named Dragonfire. One of our agents had a \nreport that said there was a nuclear weapon smuggled into New York, a \n10-kiloton Russian nuclear weapon stolen and smuggled into New York by \nterrorists to be detonated. That was 1 month to the day after 9/11. \nThat report from the CIA agent caused apoplexy among the entire \nnational security community. It was not public at that point. It was \nnot made public.\n  After about a month, they decided that it was perhaps not a credible \npiece of intelligence. But when they did the post mortem, they \ndiscovered that clearly someone could have stolen a Russian nuclear \nweapon, perhaps a 10-kiloton weapon, and could have smuggled it into \nNew York City. A terrorist group could have detonated it, and a couple \nhundred thousand people could have perished--one stolen nuclear weapon. \nThere are 25,000 of them on the planet--25,000.\n  The question is, Do these agreements matter? Do they make a \ndifference? Of course, they do. The fact is, nuclear arms agreements \nhave made a very big difference.\n  I have had in the drawer of my desk for a long period a couple of \nthings I would like unanimous consent to show.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a piece of metal from a Soviet Backfire bomber. \nWe didn't shoot this bomber down. It was sawed off. They sawed the \nwings off this bomber. They did it because we paid for it under the \nNunn-Lugar agreement in which we have actually reduced nuclear weapons, \nboth delivery vehicles and nuclear weapons.\n  So I have in my desk a piece of a Soviet bomber that had its wings \nsheared off because of a US-Russian agreement, and that delivery system \nis gone. I have a hinge that was on a silo in Ukraine for a missile \nthat had on it a nuclear weapon aimed at this country. Well, that \nmissile is now gone. I have the hinge in my hand. That missile that \nheld a nuclear warhead aimed at America is gone. In its place on that \nfield are sunflowers--sunflowers--not missiles.\n  I have in this desk as well some copper wire that was ground up from \na Soviet submarine that was dismantled as a result of a US-Russian arms \ncontrol agreement. These agreements work. We know they work. We have \nreduced the number of delivery vehicles; yes, submarines, bombers, \nmissiles. We have reduced the number of nuclear weapons. This agreement \nwill further reduce the number of nuclear weapons.\n  Now, if it is not the responsibility of our country to begin \naddressing the ability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to \nreduce the number of nuclear weapons on the face of this Earth, then \nwhose responsibility is it? It is clearly our responsibility to \nshoulder that leadership. One important element of that is when we \nnegotiate these kinds of treaties, arms reduction treaties, that \nvirtually everyone--Republicans and Democrats who know anything at all \nabout national security and about arms reduction agreements--has said \nmakes sense for our country, when we do that, it seems to me we ought \nnot have the same old thing on the floor of the Senate, and this ought \nnot be a part of gridlock.\n  This is a negotiation between our country and Russia with respect to \nreducing delivery vehicles and reducing nuclear weapons. The National \nSecurity Working Group, of which I was a member--and a number of my \ncolleagues were members--met in this Capitol Building, and we were \nbriefed and briefed and briefed again by those who were negotiating \nthis treaty. This is not a surprise. There is nothing surprising here. \nIn my judgment, this Senate should, in this month, do what is necessary \nto have the debate and ratify this treaty.\n  Again, let my say, this President sent to the Congress a budget \nrequest that had ample and robust funding, with a 10-percent increase \nfor modernization and life extension programs for our nuclear weapons. \nI know that because I chaired the committee that put in the money at \nthe President's request.\n  Then, because of those who believed you had to have the extra money \nfor the nuclear weapons program, that money was put in a continuing \nresolution so that program goes ahead with a 10-percent increase, while \nthe rest of the Federal Government goes on at last year's level. I did \nnot object to that. But I do object when they say there is not ample \nfunding here--a 10-percent increase this year, a 10-percent increase \nnext year. Testimony by everyone who knows about these weapons \nprograms, the cost of them and the effectiveness of these treaties, \nought to be demonstration enough for us to do our job and to do our job \nright.\n  We have a lot of important issues in front of us. I understand that. \nBut all of these issues will pale by comparison if we do not find a way \nto get our arms around this question of stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons and reducing the number of nuclear weapons. If one, God \nforbid--one--nuclear weapon is exploded in a city on this planet, life \non this planet will change.\n  So the question of whether we assume the responsibility of \nleadership--whether we are willing to assume that responsibility--will \ndetermine in large part, it seems to me, about our future and about \nwhether we will have a world in which we systematically and \nconsistently reduce the number of nuclear weapons and therefore reduce \nthe threat of nuclear weapons in the future.\n  I do hope my colleagues--and, by the way, I do not suggest they are \noperating in bad faith at all. But some of my colleagues have \ninsisted--insisted--there is not enough funding. It is just not the \ncase. The demonstration is clear. It is the one area that has had \nconsistent, robust increases in funding, requested by this President, \nand complied with by this Congress, and now even advance funding \nthrough the continuing resolution. It seems to me it is time to take \nyes for an answer on the question of funding, and let's move ahead and \ndebate this treaty and do what this country has a responsibility to do: \nratify this treaty, and do it soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8219-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 510, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 510) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety of the food supply.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Harkin) amendment No. 4715, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I do not see Senator Baucus in the \nChamber, so I will go ahead and get started. My understanding is we \nwill be going back and forth. So I will finish my opening remarks, and \nthen if he arrives I will yield to him.\n  In just a few hours Senators are going to have a distinct choice. Two \namendments will be offered to repeal what I think we have all come to \nregard as a very nonsensical tax paperwork mandate that was included in \nthe health care reform bill.\n  There is broad agreement the 1099 repeal is necessary to remove \nFederal roadblocks to job creation. But today we have a choice on the \ntwo amendments. Today's choice comes down to what I regard as a very \nstraightforward choice, a choice relative to fiscal responsibility, and \nit is illustrated by the chart I have in the Chamber.\n  My amendment fully offsets the cost of the 1099 repeal. The \nalternative Baucus amendment piles $19 billion of debt onto the backs \nof future generations. The irony of this is just unmistakable. On one \nhand, we have a provision in the health care law that we have all come \nto regard as crazy, foolishness. Even the President has said it does \nnot make any sense--or words to that effect.\n  On one hand, to repeal it, we are adding to the debt of future \ngenerations.\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\nOn the other hand, my amendment fully offsets that cost.\n  Americans have sounded an alarm regarding Washington's out-of-control \nspending. They demand we address what is a huge $14 trillion debt. They \nlook at their Federal Government in disbelief when they see Washington \ncontinuing to spend money we simply do not have.\n  Yet the alternative amendment proposes to do more of the same. It \ndoes not have a single offset. It simply passes the buck, and in this \ncase it passes the buck to our children and grandchildren.\n  Now, both amendments, as you can see from the chart, repeal the 1099 \nrequirement. But in the case of the Johanns amendment, it repeals the \n1099 requirement without adding a single penny to our deficit or to the \ncost of the health care bill.\n  It also has taken care of the issue of the controversial offsets. As \nmy colleagues remember, I listened in September when many came up to me \nand said: Look, I am with you on repealing this 1099 provision. My \nsmall businesses are asking me to get it repealed. But I just cannot go \nalong with your offsets. Well, my new 1099 amendment uses unspent and \nunobligated funds from Federal accounts to fully pay for the repeal.\n\n  At the end of every year, there is money left in the accounts of \nFederal agencies that is not obligated. As someone who was a Cabinet \nofficial in a previous life, I can tell you that occurs. My amendment \nboils down to using about 5 percent of these funds--5 percent.\n  Additionally, the amendment I am offering gives the Office of \nManagement and Budget the ability to decide what programs to pull funds \nfrom and in what amounts. This approach is far better than an across-\nthe-board cut, and it allows important programs to continue to be \nfunded.\n  Some are probably going to argue: Whoa, this is historic. This has \nnever been done before. But I want to assure my colleagues, it has been \ndone repeatedly.\n  If my colleagues choose the alternative amendment in a few hours, \nthen the public demand for fiscal responsibility will have fallen on \ndeaf ears. In September, when the Senate first voted down my 1099 \namendment, the concern was about the source of the offsets. It was the \nhealth care bill, and many said to me: Look, I am with you, but I \ncannot go along with these offsets. So we changed them. But back then, \nno one--no one--argued that we simply did not need to pay for the \nrepeal. No one argued that. Yet today the Baucus alternative amendment \nproposes no pay-fors, adding $19 billion to the national debt, without \na dime of budgetary offsets.\n  So after all the hoopla about pay as you go, there is not a single \nbudgetary offset to cover the cost of this amendment. So I urge all of \nmy colleagues to vote for the fully offset Johanns amendment. It will \nbe a vote to protect our job creators. It will be a bipartisan vote \nbecause we have all come to agree that this 1099 provision does not \nmake any sense. And, most importantly, when we talk to our constituents \nabout how we did this, we will be able to clearly tell them we paid for \nit, we took care of the cost of repealing the 1099 amendment with \noffsets that were a compromise to try to get this done and get this \nbehind us.\n  Several of my colleagues also want to speak on this issue, so I am \ngoing to yield 5 minutes of my time to Senator Enzi, followed by 5 \nminutes to Senator Thune, 5 minutes to Senator Brown, and 5 minutes to \nSenator Hutchison. So I yield to Senator Enzi.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Johanns \namendment that would repeal a provision in the health care reform law \nthat, if not repealed today, will impose significant burdens on small \nbusinesses across this country.\n  Repealing this provision has the support of many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. Even the President has commented that this \nprovision is onerous on small businesses and warrants immediate \nadjustment.\n  Starting in 2012, the new health care law will require that all \nbusinesses purchasing $600 or more in property or services from another \nentity, including corporations, must provide the vendor and the \nInternal Revenue Service with a tax information return. This new \ngovernment mandate will impose significant burdens on both small and \nlarge businesses, and taxpayers' costs will increase as a result of \naccumulating the information and preparing the tax forms necessary to \ncomply with this expanded mandate.\n  Imagine if you are a freelance writer and you buy a new laptop. Well, \nnow you have to send form 1099 to Apple and to the IRS or be labeled a \ntax cheat. Oh, and you will need the Apple taxpayer identification \nnumber too, so do not forget to ask the salesman for that.\n  This new reporting requirement hits small businesses hardest because \nthey typically do not have in-house accounting departments and have to \nhire outside help. Every penny a small business spends on these \nservices is money they cannot spend on hiring new workers and expanding \ntheir business. Every hour a small business owner spends filling out \nthese new tax forms is time he or she is not making a sale, \nmanufacturing a product, or working with a customer.\n  I understand the challenges this can create for small business. \nBefore I came to the Senate, my wife and I owned shoe stores in \nWyoming. When you own a small business, you have to be the CEO, the \nbookkeeper, the salesman, and the person who cleans the bathroom.\n  Every hour I spent filling out government-mandated paperwork was an \nhour I could not spend selling shoes. Government mandates such as the \nnew 1099 requirement have a real cost, and it is small businesses that \nwill end up having to pay them.\n\n  This new 1099 reporting requirement is just one of many things in the \nnew health care reform law that need to be reexamined immediately. Our \nsmall businesses need to be focused on creating jobs and helping our \neconomy recover, not spending countless hours on new government \npaperwork burdens.\n  We all would do well to remember the claims of the sponsors of the \nhealth care reform law who said this new law would actually reduce the \nFederal deficit. Most Americans didn't believe those claims when they \nwere made, and today they are seeing the first evidence of their \nfalsity.\n  Today, when confronted with the nationwide opposition to this ill-\nconceived expanded information reporting policy, one of the leading \nproponents of the new health care law in the Senate is offering an \namendment that will eliminate it, but it eliminates the revenues it \nproduces. More importantly, his amendment makes no attempt to pay for \nthe lost revenues. That means his amendment will further increase the \nFederal deficit.\n  While this may be the first time we see this, it certainly will not \nbe the last. The funding for the entire health care law was built on a \nfiction of cost estimates and actuarial assumptions. As each of these \nprovisions confronts the harsh reality of the light of day, we will see \nmore and more of these provisions undone in the coming years. When \nmillions of seniors across the country lose existing Medicare benefits \nand face escalating out-of-pocket costs, there will be an urgent push \nto restore these benefits. When hospitals, nursing homes, and home \nhealth agencies begin to close their doors because Medicare payment \nrates cause them to operate at a loss, Congress will move to undo those \ncuts, at a cost to the deficit. When the new insurance benefits are \nslashed as a result of formula gimmicks that will force automatic \nreductions in benefits, I suspect many of the supporters of the new law \nwill argue for the urgent necessity of delaying these cuts.\n  We can make a statement right now to America's small businesses that \nwe want them creating more jobs, hiring new employees, and growing \ntheir businesses--not worrying about what Washington will require of \nthem next. Let's tell our small business men and women that we stand \nbehind them, not on top of their backs, and let's repeal this new tax \npaperwork burden in a fiscally responsible way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at 6:30 this evening, the Senate will vote \non\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nthe motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment to the food \nsafety bill. Under a previous order, once cloture is invoked, there was \nto be up to 60 minutes of debate on competing motions to suspend rule \nXXII offered by Senator Johanns and myself. I understand that the two \nleaders intend to propound an agreement that would provide for the \nSenate to vote on our two motions immediately after the cloture vote \nthis evening. So Senators should be on notice that there may be three \nback-to-back votes beginning at 6:30.\n  The Senator from Nebraska and I share a common goal. We both want to \nrepeal some IRS reporting requirements scheduled to take effect in the \nyear 2012. Each of our two motions would allow consideration of an \namendment to prevent the expansion of those IRS reporting rules. Thus, \neach of our two amendments would help small businesses across America. \nHow? By repealing these burdensome paperwork requirements.\n  But there are two big differences between our two amendments. First, \nmy alternative is especially friendly to small businesses. It takes \nextra measures to permit the IRS to waive certain duplicative reporting \nrequirements that small businesses now must experience; that is, the \nsmall businesses that use credit cards to pay their bills. My \nalternative goes further and gives more relief to small businesses. \nSecond, our two versions differ as far as paying for the change. The \nalternative offered by my colleague from Nebraska would give the \nunelected Director of OMB unprecedented authority to slash spending all \non his own. The Johanns alternative would thus abdicate Congress's \nresponsibility over the budget. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Johanns amendment and support my alternative.\n  First, let me talk about what we have in common. Each of our two \namendments is designed to get rid of a set of rules that requires \nreporting to the IRS. Many have referred to these rules as the ``1099 \nprovision.'' That is because these new rules would require filing more \nIRS forms numbered 1099. These rules would impose new paperwork burdens \nand costs on small businesses, and these burdens would fall on small \nbusinesses just as they are struggling to emerge from the great \nrecession. The new rules expand existing information reporting to the \nIRS to include payments that businesses make to corporations and \npayments they make for goods and property.\n  As I travel around my home State of Montana, I listen to small \nbusiness owners such as Darrell Keck. Darrell owns the Dixie Inn in \nShelby, MT. Darrell and his wife Jeanne run a tight ship. They are hard \nworking. They pay their taxes. Darrell told me that he and his wife \njust do not have the manpower or the software to make the new reporting \nrules work. And Darrell and his wife Jeanne run just one business of \nthe many mom-and-pop businesses in Montana that have told me this. I \ndaresay most of the Members of this body hear the same things I hear as \nthey travel. I have listened to small businesses. I have heard them. I \nam responding to small businesses by offering this amendment. My \namendment would fully repeal the new reporting requirements--fully.\n  My amendment also responds to the concerns of owners of rental \nproperty. Some of these owners were concerned about their ability to \ncomply with new rental expense information reporting rules included in \nthe small business bill which Congress enacted just this last \nSeptember. My amendment would scale back those rules. My amendment \nwould apply the same rules to rental expense reporting as would apply \nto all businesses.\n  Now let me turn to the differences between my amendment and the \nJohanns amendment.\n  First, my amendment includes another feature that would further \nreduce the paperwork burdens on small businesses. My amendment would \ngrant the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue regulations \nto avoid duplicative reporting. The Treasury has issued guidance under \nsimilar authority to allow small businesses that use credit cards to \nforgo reporting expenses they pay with their credit cards. Under this \nnew guidance, to the extent small businesses use their credit cards to \npay service vendors, they would actually have even less compliance \nburden than they did under the old law; that is, before the new \nrequirement.\n  The competing amendment offered by my colleague from Nebraska would \nrepeal the Treasury's authority to make rules to avoid duplicative \nreporting. It would repeal it. Doing so would thus risk placing undue \nand unnecessary paperwork burdens on small businesses that use credit \ncards to pay their bills.\n  So my alternative is especially friendly to small businesses. It \ntakes extra measures to permit the IRS to waive duplicative reporting, \nespecially those requirements for small businesses that use credit \ncards.\n  The second main difference between our two amendments is the offset \nin the Johanns amendment--and this is a big one. The Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates that the tax law changes in the Johanns amendment \nwould cost about $22 billion.\n\n  The Johanns amendment also includes a cut of $39 billion in \nappropriated funds, to be determined by the Office of Management and \nBudget. The Johanns amendment cuts about twice what it needs to do to \npay for the repeal of the reporting requirements. As a matter of \ndollars and cents, the Johanns amendment is mostly about cutting \nappropriated spending. That is what it really is. So it is not about \nrepealing the reporting requirement. To make these spending cuts, the \nJohanns amendment would give the unelected Director of OMB \nunprecedented authority to determine the source of this funding, and \nthat would abdicate congressional responsibility over the budget.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that my amendment would cost about \n$19 billion. That is a little less than the tax part of the Johanns \namendment. But my amendment does not include an offset. These days, \nfinding a $19 billion offset that can get 67 votes is pretty close to \nimpossible. We have spent much of this year haggling over one offset or \nanother. My amendment tries to avoid that.\n  We are talking about a paperwork requirement that has not yet even \ntaken effect and, in fact, will not take effect, if not repealed, until \nthe year 2012. Let's just repeal this reporting requirement. Let's just \nget it done. Let's just repeal it lock, stock, and barrel. Let's just \nget it done and not do all of these extra, other things which really \nare not good policy.\n  The IRS has used form 1099 for decades to better track income, but \nthe new reporting rules just went too far. The time that it spends for \nsmall businesses to comply with the new rules far exceeds any benefit.\n  Especially in these tough economic times, now is not the time to put \nadditional stress on small businesses to meet complicated government \nrules. Rather, now is the time to eliminate this paperwork burden. \nSmall businesses are the backbone of the American economy. That is \nespecially true in Montana. In Montana, a greater share of workers work \nin small businesses than in any other State in the country--a greater \nproportion than in any other State in the country. Business owners need \nto focus their efforts on growing their businesses and creating jobs, \nnot filling out paperwork.\n  Small businesses in Montana and across America want to comply with \ntax laws, but these new rules stretch their ability to do that. It just \nwent too far. I urge my colleagues to support their full repeal. But \nlet's not hand over a blank check to the OMB Director to slash $39 \nbillion wherever he wants. That part of the Johanns amendment also goes \ntoo far. So I urge my colleagues to help small businesses. I urge my \ncolleagues to avoid sweeping delegations of power to an unelected OMB \nDirector. Thus, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Johanns amendment \nand support the Baucus amendment when it comes up for a vote this \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request which I understand \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the agreement with respect to S. 510 be \nmodified as follows:\n  That after the cloture vote at 6:30 p.m. today, and if cloture is \ninvoked, then all debate time with respect to the Johanns and Baucus \nmotions be considered expired; Senator Johanns be recognized to offer \nhis motion to suspend; that once the motion has been\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nmade, Senator Baucus then be recognized to offer his motion to suspend; \nthat once made, the Senate then proceed to vote with respect to the \nJohanns amendment to suspend; that upon disposition of that motion, the \nSenate then proceed to vote with respect to the Baucus motion to \nsuspend; that upon disposition of those two motions, Senator Coburn \nthen be recognized as provided for under the order of November 18 and \n19; that all debate time with respect to the Coburn motion be utilized \nduring today's session; that at 9 a.m. Tuesday, November 30, after the \nprayer and the pledge and any leader time, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of S. 510 with 2 minutes of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Coburn and Inouye, prior to the vote in \nrelation to the Coburn motion regarding earmarks, No. 4697; that upon \ndisposition of that motion, there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that the Senate then proceed \nto vote with respect to the Coburn motion regarding the substitute \namendment No. 4696; further, that any other provisions of the previous \norder remain in effect; provided further that prior to passage of the \nbill, the Budget Committee pay-go statement be read into the record; \nfurther, that after the first vote today and tomorrow, the succeeding \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes each; and that prior to the succeeding \nvotes tonight, there be 2 minutes equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my intention that I be heard tonight \nconcerning some of the amendments to be voted on tomorrow. It is my \nunderstanding further that Senator Enzi from Wyoming has the time \nbetween 5:30 and 6 o'clock. I request that I be recognized for 15 \nminutes during that timeframe.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, may I \nfurther amend that request to provide that after the swearing in of \nSenator-elect Kirk, the time be equally divided until 6:30 p.m. this \nevening, and that the Senator from Oklahoma be recognized to speak for \n15 minutes, and the time to be divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. What time will that be approximately, right after the \nvote or before?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Before.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before. No objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the Johanns amendment No. 4702 to S. 510, the Food Safety \nModernization Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis leadership on this issue. He has done a great job advocating on \nbehalf of small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and all the people to be \nimpacted by this onerous provision in the health care bill.\n  I fear this is something we are going to be doing and repeating quite \nfrequently in the years ahead as more Americans find out what is in the \nDemocrats' health care bill. This is egregious because it requires \nvarious entities to send suppliers 1099 forms if they engage in \nbusiness-to-business transactions totaling more than $600 in a single \nyear.\n  While I believe everyone ought to pay their fair share of taxes, I am \nconcerned that the burden of compliance falls not on the tax \ndelinquents but instead on the countless businesses, churches, local \ngovernments, and nonprofits that pay their taxes on time and in full or \nmay not even have a tax liability.\n  This means these entities will have less time to fulfill their core \nmissions, whether that is building products, administering to the poor, \nhelping students learn or building local infrastructure. Instead, they \nare going to be filling out form after form to become compliant with \nthis measure.\n  Because of the heavy compliance costs associated with this measure, \nits repeal is supported by a wide variety of business organizations and \nagricultural organizations across the country, including the Chamber of \nCommerce, National Federation of Independent Business, and the American \nFarm Bureau, to name a few.\n  It is not just national organizations that I have heard from. In \nnumerous constituent meetings across South Dakota, I have heard from \nthe citizens of South Dakota, whether they be farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinesses, CPAs, and others, about the effect this measure would have \non them, their businesses, and their employees.\n  While this requirement is not set to take effect until next year, I \nbelieve it is important we act now to give these types of entities \ncertainty that they will not have to take steps to comply with this \nmeasure.\n  I add that our government now has a debt that is approaching $14 \ntrillion, and we need to do everything we can to make sure that debt \ndoes not increase. It is a debt that we continue to pile on more and \nmore and hand to the next generation of Americans.\n  Because of that concern, I am pleased this amendment is fully offset \nby rescinding unspent Federal funds. The Senator from Nebraska came up \nwith a way, through rescinding unspent Federal funds, to offset this \namendment in a commonsense way. Of course, it excepts the Department of \nDefense and Department of Veterans Affairs, which will protect our \nnational security interests and those who have served our country. I \nbelieve the rescissions he calls for in unspent Federal funds are a \ngood way to make sure this doesn't add to our debt. This amendment \nperfectly captures that belief, and I think it is a belief that is \nshared by many of my colleagues in the Senate and by citizens across \nthis country.\n  We need to be focused on bringing down our debt, and we will start \ndoing that by eliminating government spending, not putting new, \nburdensome requirements on businesses and charities.\n  Unfortunately, there were numerous other provisions in the health \ncare bill and other bills in the past 2 years which shifted the burden \nonto small businesses and employers. We will have to revisit each of \nthose to ensure they don't slow economic growth and job creation, which \nis what the people want us to be focused on now.\n  I hope we can take this first step and support the Senator from \nNebraska on his amendment, which addresses this critical issue, this \negregious provision that puts a costly burden on small businesses, and \ndo it in a way that is fiscally responsible and doesn't add to the debt \nand burden future generations with more debt.\n  I think the Senator from Nebraska came up with a great solution. I \nhope colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Republicans and Democrats--\nwho have heard, as I have, from their constituents will take this very \ncommonsense amendment and pass it with a big margin. Let's get this \nparticular provision in the health care bill repealed and the negative \nimpact it would have on economic growth and job creation in this \ncountry.\n  With that, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the amendment offered today by Senator \nJohanns proposes to rescind unobligated balances of appropriated funds \nthat are designated for specific purposes in various appropriations \nbills previously enacted by Congress. The Senator offers these \nrescissions in order to offset the loss of revenues resulting from his \namendment.\n  Much like similar amendments offered in the past, this amendment \nsimply provides for a generic rescission of funds, with the authority \nand decision-making for which programs are impacted delegated entirely \nto the executive branch.\n  Consideration of this amendment is the first of two attempts this \nevening to shift the power of and responsibility for the Nation's purse \nstrings from the legislative branch to the executive branch.\n  Rescinding funds in this manner, should this amendment be adopted,\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nmay be politically expedient because it simply cites a dollar figure, \nbut it is also reckless and irresponsible, and hides the accountability \nfor future actions when legitimate programs are shut down.\n  Mr. President, we should make no mistake about it, an across the \nboard cut is the legislative equivalent of performing surgery with a \nmeat cleaver, and Senators would be right to reject the amendment for \nthis reason alone.\n  I can assure my colleagues that if this amendment passes, the impact \nwill be felt throughout this country, and the arbitrary nature of the \ncuts will only intensify the pain.\n  Why do I know this? Because for the past several months Senator \nCochran and I have instructed our staffs to scrub the books of every \nsingle Federal agency in order to fund Pell Grants, while at the same \ntime maintaining the discretionary spending level for fiscal year 2011 \nproposed by Senators Sessions and McCaskill.\n  Even after reviewing in great detail unobligated balances across all \nthe agencies and rescinding those funds that were truly unobligated \nbalances, we still have to cut spending for fiscal year 2011 in order \nto pay for Pell Grants to the level at which almost everyone in this \nChamber desires that it be funded.\n  Consequently, the only unobligated balances remaining are those in \naccounts that have slow spend rates such as construction and \ninfrastructure accounts. To rescind $39 billion from these remaining \naccounts without congressional guidance, and without any analysis of \nthe ultimate costs and benefits, is simply irresponsible.\n  Throughout this past year, every time an amendment similar to this \none has been offered, I and my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee have come to the Floor and provided real examples of real \nprograms that would be impacted by such an amendment. While I will not \ngo into such detail tonight, I will take a moment and give Members a \nsense of which agency accounts have unobligated balances:\n  International narcotics control and law enforcement programs that \nprovide police training and counter-drug programs in Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Mexico and Colombia, among others.\n  Global Health and Child Survival, which impacts global HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, TB, polio and other programs.\n  The State Department's worldwide security program, including funding \nfor requirements in Iraq, again impacting our embassy and personnel \nsecurity costs worldwide.\n  Coast Guard construction of ships and planes, including the National \nSecurity Cutter, the Maritime Patrol Aircraft, and Fast Response \nCutters.\n  Funds to maintain and upgrade the southwest border fence in Arizona \nand California.\n  The FEMA Disaster Relief Fund which is still paying for Katrina, \nRita, Gustav and Ike.\n  Cyber security investments to secure Federal information systems.\n  Funds to procure and install TSA advanced imaging technology and \nother explosive detection systems.\n  Funds to build border patrol stations in Texas, Arizona, California \nand Washington.\n  Funds to build schools and hospitals under the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and Indian Health Services.\n  The $500 million in non-emergency unobligated fire suppression funds \nremaining in the Forest Service and Interior Wildland Fire accounts is \nthe minimum needed to make sure there are enough funds available in \ncase the fire season turns out to be worse than forecast.\n  Section 8 tenant-based and Section 8 project-based rental assistance. \nThese programs receive advanced appropriations to run through the end \nof the calendar year. If these funds were rescinded, there would be no \nfunding to continue to provide housing for low-income families living \nin housing today.\n  In the case of homeless assistance grants, there is a time-consuming \ncompetitive process that communities go through in order to get these \nfunds. Accordingly, these programs have unobligated funds.\n  If these funds were rescinded, existing homeless programs in \ncommunities across the country wouldn't have sufficient funds to \ncontinue serving the homeless--literally leaving people on the streets.\n  And finally, as one would imagine, Corps of Engineers construction \nprojects as well as funding for flood control and coastal emergencies \nhave substantial unobligated balances.\n  Supporters of the Johanns amendment may claim that I and my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee are simply citing the worst \ncase scenario of where unobligated balances may come from. The fact of \nthe matter is that these accounts are exactly where the unobligated \nbalances will come from.\n  Let me also point out to my colleagues that if this amendment is \nenacted, we cannot stop rescissions of unobligated balances from any of \nthe accounts mentioned because the amendment gives sole decision-making \npower regarding where to cut to the executive branch.\n  Unlike the situation with deciding how to fund the FY 2011 ominibus, \nwhere Ranking Member Cochran and I, along with our committee members, \ndecided after much scrutiny of accounts which unobligated balances were \ntruly available for rescission, this amendment places all authority \nwith the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not the way to do business. This is \ncertainly not the way to fund the Federal Government. We need to stop \ntrying to shift our fiscal responsibilities to the executive branch. We \nneed to stop claiming there is an excess in Federal funds where none \nexists. And if we want to cut funds and hamper those critical programs, \nthen we need to stop hiding behind generic rescissions.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nJohanns amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time we have on \nthis side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me address some of the arguments that \nhave been raised.\n  First of all, on this issue of the Baucus amendment simply doing more \nthan the Johanns amendment or that it is especially friendly, here is \nwhat I would tell you. We checked into that and we have an e-mail from \nthe Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and he says the \ntwo amendments do the same thing--they repeal the 1099 requirement. \nThat seems to be especially friendly. As Senator Baucus pointed out, we \nare both going to accomplish the same thing; that is, we are going to \nrepeal the 1099 requirement.\n  To get to the issue of this being an unprecedented grant of power to \nthe executive branch versus the legislative branch, we also researched \nthat. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004 \nbasically gave the Secretary of Commerce the sole discretion to \ndetermine from which accounts and in what amounts funds would be \nrescinded. In other words, the Secretary had sole discretion to decide \nhow to rescind that.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008, when my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle were in control of both the \nHouse and the Senate, rescinded more than $192 million in unobligated \nbalances available to NASA and gave the Administrator sole discretion.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of fiscal year 2008, again when \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle were in sole control of the \nHouse and the Senate, rescinded $33 million in unobligated balances for \nthe National Science Foundation and gave the Director sole discretion.\n  The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas \nGuarantee Loan Act rescinded $270 million of nondefense administrative \nand travel funds and again gave sole discretion to the executive \nbranch.\n  Very simply, the argument that somehow this is new, this is \nunprecedented, and this has never happened before simply doesn't hold \nwater.\n  I then heard the argument of my colleague from Hawaii, a very \nrespected Member. But I look at these unobligated balances--the \nDepartment of Agriculture, $9.6 billion. I ran that Department for \nabout 3 years. He talks about fire suppression. We dealt with fire \nsuppression every year. Yes, some\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nyears were worse than others when it came to fire suppression. If we \nhad a year where literally we had to go find additional funding because \nthe fires were worse, we worked through that and we solved the problem. \nWe dealt with that issue when it was presented to us.\n  Here is what I would say. In September, I came to the floor and I \nsaid: Look, here is how I want to pay for this. It came out of the \nhealth care bill. My colleagues said: Oh, we can't do that, but I am \nwith you on this 1099 repeal. I listened. This repeal is paid for by \nusing money that is literally sitting there in Federal accounts.\n  The other matter I would point to is that the alternative is the \nBaucus amendment, and here is what the Baucus amendment does. Yes, it \nhandles the problem, just like Congress has been handling the problem \nfor way too long. It says to our children and grandchildren: Out of \nthis multitrillion-dollar annual budget--$1 trillion in deficit, with \n40 percent of the money being literally borrowed--we can't find $19 \nbillion. It is too hard. It is too hard, and so our kids and our \ngrandkids are going to have to deal with it. That is exactly what the \nBaucus amendment does. It says it is too hard.\n  It is going to be the President's own Budget Director who is going to \nidentify the funds that will pay for this. Are my colleagues on the \nother side suggesting we can't trust that process? Well, if we can't \nsolve this problem and pay for it, how do we ever solve the \nmultitrillion-dollar deficit this country is facing? Congress has \nallowed the administration to deal with this kind of issue on other \noccasions. To somehow claim that on this occasion it can't simply \nmisses the point.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Hutchison from Texas, who wishes to \nspeak on this issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wish to thank the Senator from Nebraska for \noffering this amendment. Obviously, it has been offered before, but \nevery time I go home it renews my energy to try to stop this from \ntaking effect.\n  Small businesspeople are approaching me and saying: This is crazy. Do \nwe have to report every trip to the Office Depot? Do we have to report \nevery travel voucher for $600 because I am going to a meeting in \nCalifornia? This defies description, except to say it is one more \noverbearing government intrusion on free enterprise in our country.\n  So I hope very much that because of the message of the elections in \nNovember more people will see this is not necessary. It is certainly \nnot a part of health care reform. In fact, when I saw this come out--\nthis little provision tucked in the enormous health care reform bill--\nmy thinking was twofold: One, they are paying for this enormous cost of \nthe government takeover of health care on the backs of small \nbusinesspeople in our country. That would be one interpretation. The \nother would be that all the talk coming out of Washington about new \ntaxes and possibly a value-added tax means they are starting to want to \nget the reports that would be the basis of a new tax system. Neither of \nthose things should be part of health care reform in this country. So I \nam hopeful we can put a stop to this right now.\n  I think the people of America well understand the burdens of this \nhealth care reform bill, passed on Christmas Eve of last year, over our \nobjections on this side of the aisle. So maybe we can start peeling \naway some of the most onerous provisions--particularly this one, which \ntakes effect in 2012--and begin to let people know we are going to try \nto mitigate the damage the health care bill has done, and we are going \nto do it a little bit at a time until we can repeal the whole thing and \nstart all over.\n  It is not that our system doesn't need reform. We all have said we \nneed health care reform. But having to report a trip to the Office \nDepot to buy stationery or a fax machine is not the way to a better \nhealth care system. It is a non sequitur. So I hope Senator Johanns' \namendment to this bill passes. It is a freestanding bill, but it is a \ngreat amendment to this bill. If we can stop this now, that would be \none thing we could take off the table as we are addressing the major \nissues that actually do deal with health care reform. Maybe we can \nbring it down to a level where we would be able to address it in a more \nresponsible way.\n  I might add that even the National Taxpayer Advocate Division of the \nIRS has said they would have significant challenges in processing and \nanalyzing the enormous volume if this piece of the Health Care Reform \nAct goes through. Even the IRS is asking: How could we do it, which \nthen would lead to: What, more employees at the IRS? Well, that should \nscare the people of America. The last thing we need is a bigger \ngovernment created to try to go into the small businesses and see if \nthey are complying with a $600 requirement for every transaction they \nwould make.\n  So I commend the Senator from Nebraska for offering this amendment. I \nam a cosponsor of this amendment, and I hope we will have enough votes \nto stop this provision in its tracks, take it off the table, and then \ndeal with health care reform on issues that actually affect health care \nreform, not issues such as this, which just burden small business in \nour country at a time when we want them to hire people. We want them to \nopen their doors to hiring more workers. But the more restrictions and \nthe more burdensome paperwork we put on them, the less chance there is \nthey are going to hire people. That is what I am hearing from my \nconstituents, and I know it is the same for all of us who have been \nhome listening to what the people are saying.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on \nour side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I will use that 3 minutes just to wrap up \nwith a couple thoughts.\n  The first point I wish to make in wrapping up this evening is that \nthere has been a 21-percent increase in appropriated funding over the \nlast 2 years--21 percent. So every small business out there is asking \nthe question: Why is the cost, at least in part of this health care \nbill, falling on my back, when there has been a 21-percent increase in \nappropriated funding over the last 2 years? Why are you punishing me, \nwhen I am trying to do everything I can to stay afloat?\n  Senator Hutchison said it well. You can't go anywhere in this country \nwithout a small businessperson saying to you: What is it about this \n1099 requirement? They are dreading the fact that they will spend \nvaluable resources on accountants to be in compliance and to deal with \nthis requirement. They are asking the question: Why are you picking on \nus?\n  The second point I wish to make is, the money from unappropriated, \nunobligated accounts--again, excluding the Department of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs--is 5 percent. It is 5 percent of the total. I look at \nthat massive Federal budget, I look at what we are dealing with, and I \nget down to the same point--$19 billion. Why would you add that to the \nFederal deficit? That is exactly what the Baucus amendment does.\n  You simply will not find offsets that are better equipped to deal \nwith this problem than the one I am proposing. Again, I just wish to \nemphasize, in September, when we were arguing this on the floor and my \ncolleagues were coming to me and saying: Mike, look, I am with you, I \nwant to repeal this, this doesn't make any sense, and my phone is \nringing off the hook, but I can't go along with these health care \noffsets, we changed the offsets. We are paying for the Johanns \namendment.\n  The Baucus approach simply does not pay for it. So what does it do? \nIn the end, it hampers the next generation. It adds to the national \ndebt. If we can't find $19 billion to solve this problem, how are we \never going to solve the problem of this massive deficit we are passing \non to our children and grandchildren?\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to support the Johanns amendment and \nto oppose the Baucus amendment. My hope is that we can get the votes \nnecessary, pass this amendment, and move on to the next issues we face.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time during the quorum call be equally charged to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 510, I \nam very disappointed that I cannot support tonight's cloture vote or \nthe final passage of this bill.\n  Since the bill's introduction and throughout the HELP Committee mark-\nup process, there has been strong bipartisan cooperation to craft \nlegislation that strikes the right balance between industry practices \nand FDA oversight to ensure the safest food supply possible.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate will not have the opportunity to vote for \nS. 510 as it passed the HELP Committee, nor will Senators have the \nopportunity to offer amendments to improve the bill. Compounding my \nconcerns is the uncertainty about the opportunity to-have an open, \ntransparent conference with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives at this late hour of the legislative session.\n  Instead, we are faced with voting for S. 510 with new language that \nwas added at the llth hour which creates a loophole in the Federal food \nsafety system. The newly added language, referred to as the ``Tester \namendment,'' creates an exemption for small farms and business \noperations through an arbitrary size and distance threshold--neither of \nwhich have any basis in science or risk. For example, this new language \nwould exempt a food facility or farm if it has sales of $500,000 or \nless, or sells half of its food to retailers, restaurants, or consumers \nin the same state or within 275 miles.\n  It is extremely important to note that S. 510 as originally \nintroduced and passed by the HELP Committee includes many provisions to \nprotect the rights of farmers and in particular the needs of small \nfarmers. These small farm protections were essential in my decision to \nbe an original cosponsor of the bill, and I fully support them.\n  Specifically, the original S.510 does not subject small entities that \nproduce food for their own consumption or market the majority of their \nfood directly to consumers to new recordkeeping requirements. Also, the \noriginal bill makes no change in definition of ``facility'' under the \nBioterrorism Act of 2002 which requires certain facilities to register \nwith FDA, thus farms and restaurants remain exempted in S. 510.\n  Additionally, small businesses are given regulatory flexibility \nthroughout the original version of S. 510. For example, small \nprocessors are given additional time to comply with new food safety \npractices and guidelines created by the bill, and the FDA may modify or \nexempt small processors based on risk.\n  Finally, regarding risk-based traceability, farms and small \nbusinesses that are not food facilities are not expected to create new \nrecords in the original version of S. 510. Only during an active \ninvestigation of a food- borne illness outbreak, in consultation with \nState and local officials, the FDA may ask a farm to identify potential \nimmediate recipients of food if it is necessary to protect public \nhealth or mitigate a foodborne illness outbreak.\n  Unfortunately, the new language before us tonight goes beyond small \nfarm protections. My concern with the ``Tester language'' is that it \ncreates a loophole for small processing facilities by exempting them \nfrom HAACP and traceability requirements or products entering the food \nsupply in ways other than direct sales to consumers. I am concerned \nthat these arbitrarily exempted products would comingle with items that \nmust follow risk-based preventive controls--such as bagged salads. In \nthe case of a foodborne illness outbreak, this exemption will make \nFDA's job much harder to identify and remove the tainted source from \nthe food chain.\n  To state it bluntly, this new language goes far beyond protecting \nsmall farms and establishes arbitrary factors in determining the safety \nof food--none of which are based on risk or science.\n  I am opposing cloture and final passage of this bill because I have \nbeen denied the opportunity to offer any amendments, especially to \nstrike or improve the Tester language.\n  I would have liked my colleagues to have had the opportunity to \nconsider an amendment which would have limited the exemption only for \nproducts sold to qualified end users as defined in the Tester language, \nsuch as direct sales to consumers, restaurants, or retail food \nestablishments. Without this limit, there is a significant chance that \nexempted products will be commingled with regulated products, thus \nrendering the protections created by S. 510 useless.\n  The full implications of the Tester amendment are unknown. I think it \nwould be wise for the Senate to take a closer look at the potential \nimpact before we pass this legislation. The Senate should have had the \nopportunity to vote on S. 510 as it was passed by the HELP Committee \nwithout this loophole. All Senators should have the opportunity to \noffer and consider amendments, but we do not.\n  Again, I also want to voice my concern regarding the opportunity to \nhave an open, transparent conference with our colleagues in the House \nof Representatives at this late hour of the legislative session. For \nthese reasons, I am voting no on cloture and no on final passage of S. \n510.\n  I would also add, for the reasons I have expressed, virtually every \nprocessor, food processor in the country has now come out and changed \ntheir opinion regarding their support of this bill, and they are \nopposing the bill because of the extended loopholes that are provided \nby the Tester amendment that are going to take the safest food supply \nin the world, which we have in the United States of America, and we are \nnow going to offer loopholes and exceptions in the chain from the farm \nto the restaurant, from the farm to the grocery store, from the farm to \nthe consumer's table, and we are going to render the potential for \nunsafe products to enter the market, and FDA is going to have no \nopportunity to regulate those.\n  That is wrong. That is not what we started out to do with S. 510. \nSenator Durbin and I talked about this, now, it is almost years ago, \nwhen we initially started the process of reforming the food safety \nsystem in this country. Unfortunately, we have gotten way away now from \nthe original intention of this bill, to a point where it is not going \nto accomplish the results we started seeking to accomplish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to address the issue that has been talked about by \nmy friend from Georgia; that is, the Food and Drug Administration Food \nSafety and Modernization Act. I commend my colleagues and those who \nhave been involved, as we have been, for weeks and weeks on end now to \nproduce this bill, which I am hopeful our colleagues will support.\n  We have enjoyed a few days off to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, \nthe centerpiece of which is, of course, the great meal with family and \nfriends. It is fitting at the wake of that, that we gather to deal with \nthe issue of food safety, a bill that is intended to help ensure the \nsafety of the food we feed our families and loved ones each and every \nday in this country.\n  One of the great things about being in this country is that every day \nwe consume products with a sense of security that what we are ingesting \nor using is not going to cause us any great harm or put our lives in \njeopardy. So it is important, particularly when you deal today with the \nprocessing of food that occurs, that reassurance, that sense of \nsecurity that all Americans would like to have is going to be \nguaranteed to the maximum extent possible. Never perfect, obviously. \nNone of us can engage in casting or creating ideas or legislation that \nis designed to produce perfection. But we have come close with this \nbill to providing that sense of security that all Americans deserve.\n  Before I speak about the substance of the bill, I want to take a \nmoment to highlight the collaborative process that characterizes the \nconstruction of this bill. The bill is a bipartisan effort on the part \nof Senators Harkin, Enzi, Durbin, Gregg, Burr, and myself, along with \n14 of our colleagues in this\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\nChamber and is designed to strengthen the country's ability to address \nand hopefully prevent foodborne illnesses.\n  I realize the bipartisan road is not always easy to follow, but I can \nconfidently say when we approach legislation in this manner we often \nend up with a better, stronger, and more responsive law in the end. I \nthink this bill is an example of that. It was not always easy. We had \nour differences, obviously, but we overcame them in an effort to \nrespond to an issue that impacts all Americans regardless of political \naffiliation and economic circumstance; that is, again, foodborne \nillnesses.\n  This collaborative process is not limited to Members and staff. I am \nincluding outside advocates and organizations. In fact, an impressive \nrange of constituent groups, including the Consumers Union and the \nGrocery Manufacturers Association, have provided valuable input in \nsupport during this process. Looking at the list of groups which \nsupport this bill says a great deal about the product itself. It says \nwe cannot afford to ignore the topic of food safety any longer. It says \nour industries and consumers want to see good consistent policy in \nplace to help prevent, and when they do occur, address these illnesses.\n  We have all heard the statistics. On average, 76 million Americans \nare sickened each year, and 5,000 die each year because of foodborne \nillnesses. But these are not just numbers. These are the lives of our \nfellow citizens in every region and economic group in the Nation. As \nthe recall of a half billion eggs this summer due to Salmonella \ncontamination has shown, foodborne illness is something that can impact \na significant portion of our population at any given time.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more \nthan 1,800 people became ill due to these contaminated eggs. Let's not \nforget that the most vulnerable of our population suffer the most when \nstricken with foodborne illnesses, especially children.\n  One such life significantly impacted by a strain of E. coli was a \nconstituent of mine in Wilton, CT. She survived the contaminated \nlettuce she consumed, but her life has been changed as a result.\n  There is a lot in this bill we can be proud of. I want to focus on \none particular area that I have a concern with and have been involved \nin for years and years--it is food allergies.\n  Long before I had a family of my own, I got involved in the issue. \nBut with the arrival of my first child, Grace, in 2001, we discovered \nshortly thereafter that she had serious food allergies. She had been in \nanaphylactic shock four or five times by the time she was 4 or 5. This \nis a great concern to her parents, obviously, as it is for millions of \npeople in this country. Twelve million of our fellow citizens have food \nallergies, many with life-threatening ones, and we are watching the \nnumbers grow.\n  According to those who keep these statistics, from 1997 to 2007 the \nprevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent. \nToday, approximately 3 million children in the United States are \nsuffering from one kind of food allergy or another. While food \nallergies were at one time considered relatively infrequent, they now \nrank third among chronic diseases in children under the age of 18. \nPeanuts are among the several allergenic foods that can produce life-\nthreatening allergic reactions in children.\n  With this bill, what we have done here, is to develop a voluntary \nfood allergy management guideline for preventing exposure to food \nallergens and ensuring a prompt response when a child suffers a \npotentially fatal anaphylactic reaction. It also provides for school-\nbased food allergy management incentive grants to local educational \nagencies to assist with the adoption and implementation of food allergy \nmanagement guidelines in grades K through 12.\n  My State of Connecticut is one of eight that has already done this on \ntheir own. But a lot of other States, obviously, 42 have not. This bill \nvoluntarily provides small amounts of grant money to States to help \nthem develop these procedures that will minimize the kind of dangers \nthat occur to children when they are exposed to food that can cause \nthem life-threatening diseases and illness.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is responsible for regulating 80 \npercent of the Nation's food supply. But for too long, the FDA has \nlacked the resources and authorities necessary to adequately protect \nour food. This bill recognizes we cannot underfund this critical agency \nand gives the FDA the tools necessary to protect our food and our \nhealth.\n  In fact this bill establishes, for the first time, a mandatory \ninspection schedule, which was a priority for many who worked so \ntirelessly on food safety. Under the provisions of S. 510 the number of \ninspections conducted by the FDA will increase from 7,400 in 2009 to \nnearly 50,000 in 2015. Mr. President, we need these inspections. We \nneed to pass this bill.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize the importance of \npassing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. Because every family \nsitting down to dinner tonight deserves to know that all reasonable \nmeasures have been taken to ensure the safety of the food they are \neating. It's time we put politics aside for the sake of America's \nfamilies and get this bill passed.\n  I want to comment quickly, before my time expires, on the comments of \nmy good friend from Georgia who just spoke, Saxby Chambliss. This was a \ndifficult bill to put together. I commend my colleague from Montana, \nJon Tester, who represents an awful lot of small farmers, small food \nprocessors.\n  Putting this bill together required compromise. It is what we do in \nthis Chamber every single day, and so had we not included the Tester \nlanguage in this bill I think we would have had a hard time passing the \nlegislation. The argument would have been: Well, you have included the \nsmall truck farmers who, frankly, cannot subject themselves to the kind \nof rules that large produces of food can, and we would have put the \nwhole bill in jeopardy.\n  By adopting the modified Tester language, we have made it possible \nfor this bill to become law. So I commend my fellow Senator from \nMontana for his work. I commend Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for bringing this all together to the point where, despite \nall of the allegations that this body cannot come to a common agreement \non a matter as important as this one is wrong. We can when we work at \nit, and we have done so with this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this very important and \nhistoric piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8227-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8227-S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in about 35 minutes we are going to be \nvoting on cloture on the food safety modernization bill, a bill that \nbrings us forward almost 70 years. Seven decades it has been since we \nhave modernized or changed our food inspection and safety system in \nAmerica. So we are taking that step tonight. Hopefully, we will have a \nfinal vote on it by tomorrow.\n  I just want to take a few minutes now before that vote to again lay \nout why this bill is so important and why we need to invoke cloture \ntonight so we can have a final vote on this bill tomorrow.\n  First of all, the statistics are that Americans are getting sick and \nthey are dying because of foodborne illnesses. You would think in this \nday with modernization and such we would not have this.\n  Madam President, 325,000 Americans every year are hospitalized and \nover 5,000 die. Many of these are kids. I have met them with a group \ncalled Safe Tables Our Priority. I have met some of these kids. They \nwill be damaged for life, I say to my friend from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, who has been such a leader on this bill. In fact, I daresay we \nwould not be here were it not for Senator Durbin's leadership in \ngetting this bill started, how many years ago I do not know.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership \non this issue. The fact is, it was almost 18 years ago when I received \na letter from a woman in Chicago--written to me as a Congressman--named \nNancy Donley. Nancy had a personal tragedy. Her 6-year-old son Alex \ndied from E. Coli from food Nancy literally prepared for him in their \nhome. She wrote to me a handwritten letter, to me as a Congressman from \nSpringfield, IL, 200 miles away, saying we have to do something about \nfood safety.\n  Nancy lost her son, but she never lost her passion for this issue. As \nthe Senator said, she formed the organization Safe Tables Our Priority, \nwhich has been an effective voice for so many others to bring us to \nthis moment.\n  But, for the record, I have worked on this issue for a long time, and \nwe would not be on the Senate floor tonight with this historic vote \nwere it not for the Senator from Iowa who has lead the effort. Senator \nTom Harkin has, with the help of Senator Mike Enzi and a number on the \nother side of the aisle who have stepped up to make this bipartisan. \nThis is a reasonable approach to making our food safer in America. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa for all of his leadership on this issue and \nso many others.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I thank my friend from Illinois, but he is being \nway too generous. Again, I recognize the instigators of this, the ones \nwho started this ball rolling, and Senator Durbin is the one who got us \nstarted many years ago. And it has taken us many years to put this \ntogether. But that is why we have such a good bipartisan bill. We have \nworked on this. We reported this out of our committee a year ago \nwithout one dissenting vote, Republican or Democrat. Since that time, \nwe have been working to get other people, not on the committee, \nobviously, onboard to get the way paved so we could have a bill that \nwould be broadly supported.\n  This bill is very broadly supported, both by the industry and by the \nconsumers. It is one of the few bills where, as a matter of fact, we \nhave a wide range of consumer and industry support, everything from the \nSnack Food Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, \nConsumers Union, Center for Science in the Public Interest, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Anytime you \nget the Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group \non the same bill, you know you have a bill that has broad support. This \nbill does.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, our ranking \nmember on our committee, for all of his help in getting this bill \nthrough and working on it diligently over the past year.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also thank Senator Gregg and Senator \nBurr for being heavily involved in this bill and working through all of \nthe compromises a bill like this entails.\n  The Food Safety Modernization Act enhances our food safety system in \nthree critical ways. It improves the prevention of food safety \nproblems. I always think this is key. We have to get in front of this, \nnot to just sort of catch the food once it is contaminated and try to \nget it done, but to try to prevent it in the beginning. We had success \nin the meat and poultry industry some years ago with a preventive plan \nto look at where pathogens could enter the food supply and stop it \nthere. We have applied the lessons we have learned from those last 20, \nalmost 25 years now of that to this, so now we are going to be able to \nlook to have a better system of preventing food safety problems and \nfoodborne pathogens.\n  It improves the detection or response to foodborne illness \noutbreaks--detect it earlier, stop it earlier, and have a better \nresponse to what is happening. In other words, for example, in the bill \nwe provide that retailers have to in some way notify customers if a \nfood has been recalled. That could be a grocery store putting a sign on \nthe shelf, for example, saying: This food has been recalled, maybe \nputting out a notice in their supplements that they put out in order to \nadvise consumers they may have purchased a food that has been recalled.\n  Third, it enhances our Nation's food defense capabilities. Right now, \nhow many people know that less than 2 percent--about 1.5 percent--of \nall of the food imported into America is ever inspected? That is 1.5 \npercent. Well, this is going to increase those inspections. It is also \ngoing to increase the defense capabilities in case we have a \nproblem. For example, we have stronger trace-back authority so we can \nget to the source of where this happened in a better way than we ever \nhave been able to do in the past.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, it provides the FDA with mandatory recall \nauthority. A lot of people are surprised to know--consumers are \nsurprised to find out that if there is a foodborne illness or outbreak, \nthe Food and Drug Administration has no authority to even recall the \nfood. One may say: Well, the companies have the authority to recall \nit--and they do because, frankly, they don't want to get sued, \nobviously. So why have a mandatory recall? Well, you might have bad \nactors. You might have a company that is located offshore. Maybe they \nhave imported some bad food into this country, and maybe they think \nthey can just take a few bucks and run. The FDA would not have \nmandatory recall authority. Now they would have that to protect our \nconsumers. As I said, it also requires the retailer to notify consumers \nif they sold food that has been contaminated.\n  Now, again, the opponents of this bill have put a lot of rumors out \nthere. Since I have lived with this bill for so long, I am surprised \npeople would be saying things like this. One myth I read is that this \nbill would outlaw home gardens--you couldn't even have a home garden. I \nthink that comes from Glenn Beck, if I am not mistaken, but it is \nfactually incorrect. It said it would do away with family farms. In\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\nfact, the bill states explicitly that the produce standards ``shall not \napply to produce that is produced by an individual for personal \nconsumption.'' There is also an exemption for small farmers, small \nfacilities, as they sell their products at roadside stands, farmers \nmarkets, places such as those.\n  Then there is another rumor that anyone who grows any food will now \ncome under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nheard this myth that Homeland Security agents now will be tromping \nthrough your farms and your pastures and your tomato plants--again, \nabsolutely, totally, factually wrong.\n  I am proud to say this legislation comprehensively modernizes our \nfood safety system and does so without injury to farms and small \nprocessors; otherwise, we wouldn't have all of the industry groups on \nboard if we were adding undue hardship on our processors and farmers. \nOur food safety system will continue to fail Americans unless we \nmodernize our food safety laws and regulations. We should give the FDA \nthe authority it needs to cope with the growing, varied risks that \nthreaten today's more abundant food supply. We need to act, and we need \nto act now. We need to invoke cloture on this bill in just a little \nover half an hour.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I know my friend, Senator Coburn, was on \nthe floor earlier talking about this bill. He has a substitute he is \ngoing to offer. I have worked with Senator Coburn over the months. I \nknow we have a basic philosophical difference about the role of \ngovernment in this area. Be that as it may, we have worked hard, as I \nsaid, on bill compromises between people who do have differences of \nopinion. Again, as with any bill, there may be some things in here that \nI don't particularly like that I think we ought to do differently, but \nin the spirit of compromise, we don't get our way all the time around \nhere; we have to give and take to get something done. That is what this \nbill is.\n  So I say to my friend, Senator Coburn, I know he has some problems \nwith it, but, quite frankly, his substitute--and I wish to say this \nvery forthrightly--his substitute kills our bill in its entirety. It \nkills it in its entirety. In its place, what my friend from Oklahoma \nwould offer would be a few studies to help improve collaboration \nbetween FDA and USDA. There is weaker language on preventive \ncontamination, which I think is so important--to prevent in the first \nplace. The substitute will eliminate all of our prevention control \nprovisions. It would eliminate the provisions that enhance coordination \nbetween State and Federal laboratories.\n  My friend from Oklahoma--and maybe later on we will get into this and \ndebate it a little bit--my friend has always been saying we need better \ncoordination. He is right. I said that earlier. He is absolutely right. \nWe need better coordination between the FDA and USDA and other \nagencies, and that is being done. It is being done in this bill. But at \nthe same time, his substitute would eliminate the provisions in our \nbill that enhance the coordination between State and Federal \nlaboratories, which is exactly what we need to do--have State and \nFederal coordination. His substitute would eliminate the trace-back \nprovisions that are so important to find out where the foodborne \npathogen might be originating from. It would eliminate the important \nforeign supplier verification provisions we put in this bill--that if \nyou are importing food from a foreign country, you have to verify that \nthe food has met the same kinds of inspection standards we have in our \nown country. The substitute of my friend from Oklahoma would eliminate \nthat provision. It would eliminate the requirement that we increase our \ninspection frequencies in this country, and it would eliminate the \nFDA's ability to recall food--the mandatory recall provision we have--\neven when life-threatening contamination is detected.\n  So for all of those reasons, I hope the substitute will not be \nadopted. As I said, I know my friend has some feelings about this bill. \nI understand that. But many of the things Senator Coburn brought up \nearlier and in good faith I worked with him and his staff on--some of \nhis ideas, we appropriated in this bill. Senator Coburn--I say this as \na friend--has a keen eye a lot of times for things that are duplicative \nor things that maybe sound good but don't do what you think they are \ngoing to do. He has a keen eye. I give him credit for that. So a lot of \nthose things we have looked at that in the past he suggested, and we \nhave adopted those things and put them in the bill.\n  Lastly, one of Senator Coburn's objections is that the bill is not \npaid for. Again, I think that is misguided. He knows my feelings on \nthis issue. This is an authorization bill. Any funding that would come \nfor this would have to be appropriated in the future. There would be \nabsolutely no deficit increase at all.\n  This is from the Congressional Budget Office. From our bill, we asked \nthem what would it do to increase the deficit. As my colleagues can \nsee, from 2010 to 2020, there is a zero increase in the deficit because \nof our bill.\n  So, again, while I understand Senator Coburn has problems with the \nbill, I think his substitute really wipes out everything we have done \non a bipartisan basis. Senator Enzi has worked hard, as well as Senator \nGregg, Senator Burr, and others. We have worked with industry and \nconsumer groups for over a year now to make sure we had a good bill, a \ncomprehensive bill--one that was a true compromise between competing \ninterests but one that gets the job done. And what is the job? To help \nreduce the number of foodborne illnesses in this country.\n  I say in closing, is this bill going to stop everybody from getting \nsick while eating food? No, no. It will not be 100 percent. Will it be \nbetter than what we have? You bet. It is going to prevent a lot of \nfoodborne illnesses that otherwise would happen in this country under \nthe present system.\n  Just think about this: We are operating under a food inspection \nsafety system in this country that was adopted 70 years ago. Think of \nhow our food supply--the growing, the processing, and the shipping--\nhave all changed in that 70 years. We go to the grocery store in the \nwintertime and we buy fresh raspberries from Chile or blueberries from \nArgentina. We go to the store in the summertime and we buy produce made \nin this country from all over, commingled and shipped together. A lot \nof times, you don't know where it is coming from. There are so many \ndifferent things that have happened over the last 70 years. Yet our \ninspection system has not kept up with how our food is produced, how it \nis processed, how it is shipped and stored, and we have not updated \nwhat we should do with imported foods. We are getting more and more \nimported foods into this country.\n  So for all of those reasons, I hope we will have a good, strong vote, \na good bipartisan vote on the cloture issue and that the other measures \nthat are coming up--we have an amendment on taxes--if either the \nJohanns amendment or the Baucus amendment is adopted, it will kill this \nbill. It will kill the bill.\n  I happen to be one of those who think we have to change the 1099 \nprovisions for small businesses but not on this bill. We will do that \nbefore the end of the year, but if it is adopted on this bill, it will \nkill our food safety bill because the House will blue-slip it because \nthe Constitution says bills of revenue have to originate in the House, \nnot in the Senate; likewise, the earmark provision Senator Coburn will \nbe offering--we will have a good debate on that too--again, if that is \nadopted, it will kill the bill. There is just no doubt about it.\n  So we worked hard for many years to get to this point. We have a good \nbipartisan bill. We have a bill we believe the House will pass and send \non to the President to keep our people more safe. So I hope this body \nwill reject any extraneous amendments.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to talk about an amendment we\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\nwill be voting on tomorrow concerning earmarks. Since coming to the \nSenate, I have decided I am not going to participate in what I think is \na very flawed process. I don't think it is the right way to spend \npublic money. I am not going to quarrel that some of the projects that \nhave been funded are not meritorious; they are. In my State, some of \nthe projects that have received earmarked funds are wonderful \nexpenditures of public money. But it is the way in which the money is \nexpended that is a problem; the way to decide it is the problem. It is \nthe process.\n  There have been a number of defenses of earmarking. I am going to \nspend a couple minutes debunking the defenses of earmarking. I will \ntell you my favorite one: We are somehow abdicating the power of the \npurse that is delineated in the Constitution. Give me a break. We \ndecide every dime of Federal money. Congress makes the decision on \nappropriations for every Federal program. How is giving up a secretive \nprocess, where nobody is sure how it is decided who gets how much \nmoney--how is getting rid of that somehow removing our constitutional \nauthority to make spending decisions? It is like they want the American \npeople to believe that if we quit earmarking, the appropriations \nprocess is going to go away, that we will no longer pass judgment on \nthe President's budget, that we will not have oversight over Federal \nmoney. It is silly and absurd. In some ways, it is almost insulting.\n  The constitutional powers to decide how Federal money is spent will \nremain with the Congress long after this bad habit has been broken. \nMake no mistake about it, it may not be this year, it may not be next \nyear, but the American people are on to us. They now know and \nunderstand that earmarking is about who you are. It is about what \ncommittee you sit on. It is about whom you know.\n  If this is such a fair process, if this is something we should be \nproud of, then I want someone to come to the floor and explain to me \nhow they decide who gets the money. I ask it at home all the time, and \nI say: If you know, will you tell me because I am a Member of the \nSenate and I don't know.\n  In some committees, the ranking member and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee get more money than everybody else. In other committees, \nthey don't. Where is that decided? In what room? Is there a hearing? \nCan I go and watch? When the money is split, who is in the room? Who is \non the phone? If we are brutally honest with the American people, we \nwill tell them that is a process we don't want them to see. Yes, we are \nbetter because we reformed. I am proud my party led the reforms on \nearmarking right after I came to the Senate. Now your name is on your \nearmark.\n  I will tell you what is not public. Do you know what people at home \nactually believe? They believe the Senators don't pick the winners and \nlosers. They actually think there is some mysterious process, but what \nwe don't know is what are all the earmarks that Senators say no to. \nSenators say no to these earmarks. It is not a committee that says no \nto these. It is not a chairman. Each individual Senator decides winners \nand losers. I don't think the losers know that. I think the losers \nthink that Senator had nothing to do with them being a loser. If we can \nmake all that public, this would be a much less popular activity \nbecause all of a sudden the people who wanted the bridge in this part \nof the State would realize that the Senator thought the bridge on the \nother side of the State was more important. So we take credit for the \nearmarks we get, but we are not willing to own the fact that we have \nchosen winners and losers.\n  Finally, this notion that somehow the bureaucrats are going to \ndecide--most of the money taken for earmarks comes out of programs that \nare grant programs and formula programs and are decided by population \nor by local people. It is not Washington bureaucrats. They are \nsupplanting the judgment of one person for the local planning process \nand the State planning process. That is not the way.\n  I hope people vote for the Coburn-McCaskill amendment. This is the \nwrong way to spend public money. Whether it happens tomorrow or 2 or 3 \nyears from now, make no mistake about it, the American people are tired \nof it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the following \ncloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Harkin \n     substitute amendment No. 4715 to Calendar No. 247, S. 510, \n     the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

Madam President, I come to the floor \ntoday to talk about a provision that was included in the Federal health \ncare reform bill. It is a provision that adversely impacts small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs, both an engine of job growth in \nMassachusetts and across the country.\n  I support Mr. Johanns' efforts and leadership to repeal this \nprovision of the law. I am proud to be a cosponsor of his efforts to do \njust this.\n  The provision that I am referring to--section 9006 of the Federal \nhealth care reform bill--requires that every business, charity, and \nlocal and State government entity submit a 1099 form for every business \ntransaction totaling $600 or more in a given year. It has been \nestimated that this mandate would affect approximately 40 million \nentities across the country.\n  Under the law, businesses will be required to report purchases of \nitems\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nsuch as office equipment, food and bottled water, gasoline, lumber, and \nplumbing supplies if payments to any vendor in the course of a year \ntotal at least $600. They will, in many cases, also have to report \npayments for things such as travel and telephone and Internet service. \nTo comply with the mandate, businesses--especially small businesses--\nwould have to institute new, complex record-keeping data collection and \nreporting requirements that track every purchase by vendor and payment \nmethod. The provision will increase accounting costs, expose businesses \nto costly and unjustified audits by the IRS, and subject more small \nbusinesses to the challenges of electronic filing.\n  So what does all of this really mean? And why does this provision \nneed to be repealed? Well, what it means is that small businesses and \nentrepreneurs will be busy completing paperwork, filling out forms, and \ncomplying with government mandates.\n  The provision needs to be repealed because when small businesses are \nfocused on keeping the government at bay, they aren't creating jobs or \nmaking investments that spur economic growth.\n  This is a policy we can all agree on--from both sides of the aisle. \nIt is a policy that I have supported from the very start and that I \nwill continue to support and fight for.\n  Passing this amendment is the right thing to do--for small business \nowners, for entrepreneurs, and for every business that is eager to hire \nworkers, expand its business, and grow.\n  I commend my colleague's leadership on this issue. My colleague, Mr. \nJohanns has been leading this effort since the Federal health care \nreform passed earlier this year, and I support him fully. And I urge my \nfellow Senators to repeal this job-and investment-killing mandate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska will be recognized to offer a motion to suspend the rules.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I move to suspend the rule XXII, \nincluding any germaneness requirements, for the purposes of proposing \nand considering amendment No. 4702, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, pursuant to the previous order, I move \nto suspend the rules for the consideration of my amendment, which is at \nthe desk, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote will first \noccur on the motion of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand, under the order, each side \ngets to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, if I might take my minute to explain \nwhat is happening tonight, the first amendment we will vote on is the \nJohanns' amendment. It repeals the 1099 requirement in the health care \nlaw. This came before us in September. Many colleagues came to me and \nsaid: I do not like the pay-fors coming out of the health care law. \nThis is paid for. It is paid for out of unobligated funds in the \nFederal system, if you will.\n  The second amendment, the Baucus amendment, simply is not paid for. \nSo you will be adding to the Federal deficit if you support the Baucus \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Nebraska and I both seek to repeal the \nprovisions in the health care reform act referring to 1099. They are \nidentical in that respect, but actually we go further and give more \nrelief to small business than does the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The Johanns amendment would also give the unelected Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget the power to slash $33 billion in \nappropriated spending entirely at his own discretion, taking away the \nresponsibility of the Congress. I do not think that is a good idea.\n  The Johanns amendment, thus, puts at particular risk slower spending \naccounts that fund vital purposes. The Johanns amendment puts at risk \ninternational narcotics control, law enforcement funding, $39 billion \nworth of funding solely in the discretion of the OMB Director, taking \nthat power away from the Congress. I think that is a bad idea. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the Johanns amendment.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. In reference to the argument of the Senator from \nMontana, Congress has allowed the administration to make similar \ndecisions on rescinding funds in 1999, 2004, and twice in 2008, while \nour friends on the other side of the aisle were in control of Congress. \nThat argument simply does not hold water.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the paid-for amendment, the Johanns \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is not the proper way to address this \nissue, to add $19 billion to our deficit. That has to be paid too by \nour children and by small businesses being affected by this 1099 \nproposal. Let's do this the right way. Let's do it the way the Senator \nfrom Nebraska has suggested--pay for it. It should be corrected that \nway, not by adding $19 billion to our debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Two-thirds of the Senators voting not having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is rejected.\n\n\n                           vote explanations\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, unfortunately, I was not able to be \npresent to cast an important vote this evening due to a delayed flight. \nThe vote was for cloture on the substitute food safety bill, which \nincludes my amendment. After widespread foodborne illnesses have \nsickened millions of Americans throughout the country, including in \nMontana, this bill will help restore Americans' confidence in our food \nsupply. With my amendment, it will also recognize that family-scale \nproducers that have immediate relationships with their customers at a \nlocal level have not been at the root of our food safety problems, so \nthey should not and cannot bear the same regulatory burden.\n  Had I been present, on vote No. 252, cloture on substitute amendment \nNo. 4175 to S. 510, Food Safety Modernization Act, 60 vote threshold, I \nwould have voted in the affirmative.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, due to my airline flight delay traveling \nback from Arkansas, I inadvertently missed the vote on Senator Johanns' \nmotion to suspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing and \nconsidering his amendment No. 4702 to repeal the 1099 information \nreporting requirement. I would have voted for Senator Johanns' motion \nhad I been present.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I regret having missed votes to \nsuspend the rules and consider two amendments to the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act. I was unable to be present for these votes due to a \nfamily wedding.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of the motion to \nsuspend the rules to consider Senator Baucus's amendment to repeal the \nform 1099 reporting requirement. This provision imposes an onerous \ncompliance requirement on businesses of all sizes, and Congress should \nact quickly to remove that burden and allow businesses to direct their \ntime, energy, and resources to growing their businesses and creating \nnew jobs.\n  I would have voted against the motion to suspend the rules to \nconsider the Johanns amendment because it would have delegated \nCongress's constitutionally delegated responsibility to make spending \ndecisions to the executive branch, also shifting accountability for \nmaking difficult and unpopular spending cuts from Congress to the \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we have just invoked cloture on the food \nsafety bill, and I think it is important for the American people to \nknow what that means. That means we are going to spend another $1.4 \nbillion of their money. No. 2, we are going to raise the cost of food \nover the next year, and therefore we are at about $200 million to $300 \nmillion. We set $141 billion per year in unfunded mandates on the \nStates if we pass this bill, and we didn't fix the real problem with \nfood safety in this country, according to the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  The other point I wish to make is that we went through this process \nover the last week and a half with no amendments being allowed--no \namendments being allowed--which really violates the spirit of the \nSenate. We could have finished this bill probably the week before \nThanksgiving had amendments been allowed.\n  The thing Washington gets wrong--it is not their intent, it is not \ntheir well-meaning desire to fix problems that are in front of the \ncountry--what Washington gets wrong is they think spending more money \nand setting up a ton more regulations will fix problems, and it \ndoesn't. What it does is it raises costs. So we are going to see a lot \nof small food manufacturers no longer making food. We are going to \nraise the cost of our food and, by the way, see significant increases--\nif I could have my charts on the floor, I would appreciate it--this \nyear in food, and we are going to see that extended, but we are not \ngoing to fix the real issue.\n  Food safety is on the minds of everybody in this country because of \nthe recent 500 billion egg recall in this country. It is important to \nknow what went on there. It is important to note that the head of the \nFDA, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, said had their rule been in existence, we \nwouldn't have had that problem of salmonella with eggs. They \npromulgated the finished rule around the time of the salmonella \ninfection and contamination on the eggs.\n  The problem with that is it took 10 years to develop that rule. \nNobody has asked why it took 10 years. Nobody had a hearing before we \npassed this rule to say: How did we allow this to happen? But we took \n10 years.\n  Senator Harkin has the right idea on food safety. He didn't get it \nproper, that bill, because he couldn't get it through, but his idea is \nthat we need one food safety organization, not three, and we now have \nthree, and we are going to exacerbate that problem with the bill on \nwhich we just deemed cloture.\n  The intent of my colleagues is great, but, as somebody trained in the \nart of medicine, what I see in this bill is different from what you see \nin this bill. You see, I see the problem is not lacking regulatory \nauthority; the problem is not holding the regulators in their expertise \nand carrying out the authority they have. How do I know that for sure? \nBecause it wasn't a week after the recall on the eggs on the salmonella \nscare that we had two FDA inspectors cross-contaminating farms in Iowa, \nnot even following their own regulations. This doesn't do anything for \nthat because the only thing that is going to fix the real problems with \nfood safety in this country is us holding the regulators accountable, \nnot giving them a whole bunch more regulations, and we haven't done \nthat. We have failed to do that.\n  It is not just in food safety. The reason we have a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit is because we don't hold agencies accountable. We are going to \nhave a debate in a minute on earmarks, and we are going to hear it put \nforward that the only way we can control it is to direct money \nourselves. That is just absolutely an untruth. The way you can direct \nwhere money gets spent in this country is having oversight on the \nagencies and them knowing you are going to look every time on how they \nare spending the money and make them justify it. But the fact is, we \nare not looking because we have decided we will take ours and we will \nput our $16 billion over here, and you, administration, can take your \nmoney and put\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\nyour money where you want to put it. That is the real debate on \nearmarks. There is nothing in our oath that says anything about our \nobligation to our State to bring money back to it. And the hidden \nlittle secret on earmarks is that they are used as much as a political \ntool as they are to claim ``I am doing something good for my State.''\n\n\n                           Motions to Suspend\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to move to suspend the rules for the \nconsideration of amendment No. 4696 and amendment No. 4697.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nask the Senator from Oklahoma if he could explain the nature of his \nunanimous consent request. I may not object, but I just didn't \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. COBURN. To the Senator from Illinois, I am just bringing these \nup. I have to bring them up either in the morning or this evening for \nvotes in the morning, so I am just bringing them up to be available for \nconsideration under a suspension of the rules.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it is my understanding the votes will still be \ntomorrow on the two issues the Senator has pending?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, they will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motions to suspend are pending rather than \nthe amendments themselves. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I just want to show my colleagues the \ndifference. One of the motions we will vote on on suspending the rules \ntomorrow is, here is S. 510, 280 pages of new rules and new \nregulations. Here is the alternative, which is one-sixth of that. This \none costs $1.4 billion in direct costs, $400 billion in food increased \ncosts, and $141 million in mandatory new spending, mandates to the \nStates. This one does none of that.\n  What does this bill do? This bill uses common sense to say what \nreally controls our food safety. Our food safety is controlled by \nmarket forces more than anything. And if you look at our history on \nfoodborne contamination, we are by far the safest in the world, and our \nrates have been coming down since 1996. Over the last 14 years, our \nrates have come down in terms of foodborne illnesses.\n  I am not fighting against food safety; I am fighting for common \nsense. What we see in the bill we are going to vote on versus the \nalternative which I am going to offer is one builds and grows the \ngovernment, one raises the cost of government, and ultimately we will \nbe taxed to pay for that. One raises the price of food and one puts \nunfunded mandates on the States.\n  I am saying that we can accomplish exactly the same goal as my \nchairman, the Senator from Iowa, would like to accomplish without 280 \npages of new rules and regulations. So what do we do? We require the \nFDA and the USDA to immediately establish a comprehensive plan to share \ntheir data. They have agreements to share data, but they don't share \nthe data, so we force them to do that. We require a strategic plan for \nupdating their health information technology systems, which the \nGovernment Accountability Office for the last 5 years has been saying \nis their No. 1 problem. We require the FDA to submit a plan to \nexpeditiously approve new food safety technologies and more effectively \ncommunicate those technologies to the industry and consumers. We \nleverage the free market existing food safety activities by allowing \nthe FDA to accredit third-party inspectors, and we provide unlimited \nnew authority without imposing new costs or additional regulatory \nburdens. These new authorities intend to better leverage the free \nmarkets and focus resources on preventing foodborne illness and \ncontamination. They include emergency access to records, clarifying the \nHACCP authority relating to high-risk foods, and allowing the FDA to \ndevelop strategic international relationships.\n  What will this bill do? It will fix the real problem: ineffective \ngovernment, ineffective bureaucracies. What we are going to do when we \npass the food safety bill that is on the floor is we are going to grow \nthe government. We are going to create more barriers. We are going to \nraise the cost, and we are still going to have foodborne illnesses.\n  So I will end with that and move over to earmarks. I know I have \nseveral colleagues who wish to speak about it. I am not going to spend \na long time on it. We have debated it and debated it. The fact is that \nthis country did just fine for the first 200 years without the first \nearmark. And when anybody in the Senate in the first 200 years in this \ncountry tried the earmark, they got shouted down in this body because \nthey were told their responsibility was to the country as a whole, not \nto the privileged, well-connected, well-knowing few who helped them \ncome up here.\n  We have a problem, and the problem isn't earmarks; the problem is the \nconfidence of the American people. They see the conflicts of interest \nassociated with earmarks. It is not wrong to want to help your State. \nIt is not wrong to go through an authorizing process where your \ncolleagues can actually see it. It is wrong to hide something in a bill \nthat benefits you and the well-heeled few without it being shown in \nlight to the American people.\n  If we are to solve the major problems that are in front of this \ncountry over the next 2 or 3 years--and they are the largest we have \never seen, they are the biggest problems we have ever seen in this \ncountry--we have to restore the confidence of the American people.\n  Utilization of an earmark is not our prerogative; it is our pleasure. \nWe claim a power that we have in fact created. We do direct where the \nmoney goes. But we should never do it with a conflict of interest that \nbenefits just those we represent from our States or just those who help \nus become Senators. All we have to do is look at campaign contributions \nand earmarks, and there is a stinky little secret associated with that: \nthe correlation is close to one. That is not something this body should \nembrace, tolerate, or stand for.\n  The American people expect us to be transparent, aboveboard, doing \nthe best, right thing for the country as a whole. The real process is \nthat the Appropriations Committee ignores authorizing committees; $380 \nbillion a year in discretionary funds are appropriated every year that \nare unauthorized. With that rebuff of the authorizing committees, they \nalso put in any earmarks they want or that any other Member wants. It \nis time that stops. It is time we re-earn the trust of the American \npeople.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn. I also express my \nappreciation to Senator McCaskill and Senator Udall for joining in this \nvery important amendment. As the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, this \nissue has been debated many times on the floor of the Senate. There \nhave been efforts to repeal certain most egregious earmarks. A ``bridge \nto nowhere'' in Alaska was one of those that became more famous than \nothers.\n  I have to say to my colleagues that I have seen with my own eyes--and \nI say this with great regret--the influence of money and contributions \nin the shaping of legislation. I have seen that come in the form of \nearmarks. One of the individuals I admired a great deal, a former \nMember of the House of Representatives, now resides in Federal prison \nbecause of earmarking. Another Member of Congress recently got out of \nprison. It was earmarking. We just saw that the former majority leader \nof the U.S. House of Representatives was convicted in court in Texas, \nand earmarking played a major role. The system of rewards for campaign \ncontributions was an important factor in that conviction.\n  So for many years I have been coming to this floor to express my \nfrustration with this corrupt practice. It has been a lonely fight and \nhasn't won me many friends in this body. I understand that. But I also \nwant to point out that my criticisms have not been directed just from \nthe other side of the aisle. Earmarking is a bipartisan disease, and it \nrequires a bipartisan cure. After so many years in the trenches to \neliminate this practice, I am pleased the American people are demanding \nthat they stop this practice.\n  As my colleagues know, earlier this month the Senate Republican \ncaucus unanimously adopted a nonbinding resolution to put into place a \n2-year earmark moratorium. I applaud my fellow\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nRepublicans in the Senate for joining our Republican colleagues in the \nHouse in sending a message to the American people that we heard them \nloud and clear in the election on November 2 that we will get spending \nunder control and we will start by eliminating the corrupt practice of \nearmarking.\n  Mr. President, I have had a lot of communications and relations with \nand even attended tea party rallies across my State. There is very \nlittle doubt that a real revolt is going on out there. I can't call it \na revolution because I don't know how long it is going to last. I don't \nknow how it is going to be channeled. I don't know exactly where this \nmovement will go. But I do know it involved millions of Americans who \nhad never been involved in the political process before because of \ntheir anger and frustration over our practices here, and they believe \nearmarking is a corrupt practice. They believe their tax dollars should \nnot be earmarked in the middle of the night, without any authorization, \nwithout hearings.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma just pointed out $380 billion in earmarks. \nSome of those earmarks are worthy. If they are worthy, then they should \nbe authorized. So what has happened? What we have seen in the last 30 \nyears or so is an incredible shift from the hands of many to the \ndecisions of a few. We don't do authorization bills anymore. We don't \ndo an authorization bill for foreign operations. We don't do an \nauthorization bill for all of these other functions of government for \nwhich there are requirements because, what do we do? We stuff them all \ninto the appropriations bills. Then the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee make decisions that are far-reaching in their consequences, \nwith incredibly billions of dollars, without the authorizing committees \ncarrying out their proper role of examination, scrutiny, and approval.\n  The way the system is supposed to work--and did for a couple hundred \nyears--is that projects, programs, whatever they are, are authorized, \nand then the appropriators appropriate the certain dollars they feel \nnecessary to make this authorization most effective and efficient. So \nwe don't authorize anymore. We only appropriate. That is wrong. That \nreally puts so much power in the hands of a very few Members of this \nbody and, inevitably, it leads to corruption--inevitably.\n  The Heritage Foundation wrote a report I urge my colleagues to read. \nIt is entitled ``Why Earmarks Matter.'' The first point they make is \nthis:\n\n       They invite corruption. Congress does have a proper role in \n     determining the rules, eligibility and benefit criteria for \n     federal grant programs. However, allowing lawmakers to select \n     exactly who receives government grants invites corruption. \n     Instead of entering a competitive application process within \n     a federal agency, grant-seekers now often have to hire a \n     lobbyist to win the earmark auction. Encouraged by lobbyists \n     who saw a growth industry in the making, local governments \n     have become hooked on the earmark process for funding \n     improvement projects.\n\n  There are small towns in my State that feel obligated to hire a \nlobbyist to get an earmark here through the Appropriations Committee. \nThey should not have to do that. They should not be spending thousands \nand thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for a lobbyist to come \nhere to get an earmark. They should have their desires and their needs \nand their requirements considered on an equal basis with everybody \nelse's, not only in their State but in this country. But now they \nbelieve the only way they will get their pork or their project done is \nthrough the hiring of a lobbyist.\n  The Heritage Foundation goes on:\n\n       They encourage spending. While there may not be a causal \n     relationship between the two, the number of earmarks approved \n     each year tracks closely with growth in federal spending.\n\n  Then the Heritage Foundation says:\n\n       They distort priorities. Many earmarks do not add new \n     spending by themselves, but instead redirect funds already \n     slated to be spent through competitive grant programs or by \n     states into specific projects favored by an individual \n     member. So, for example, if a member of the Nevada delegation \n     succeeded in getting a $2 million earmark to build a bicycle \n     trail in Elko in 2005, then that $2 million would be taken \n     out of the $254 million allocated to the Nevada Department of \n     Transportation for that year. So if Nevada had wanted to \n     spend that money fixing a highway in rapidly expanding Las \n     Vegas, thanks to the earmark, they would now be out of luck.\n\n  So what we do is deprive the Governors and the legislators from \nsetting the priorities they feel are the priorities for their States. \nAnd all too often, the earmark is not what the State or the local \ncitizenry or town or county needs as their priorities because they are \ndecided with the influence of lobbyists in Washington. I say, with all \ndue respect to the appropriators, they don't know the needs of my State \nlike I know the needs of my State, and not nearly as much as the mayor, \nthe city council, the Governor, and the legislature. Let them make the \ndecision where these moneys should be spent, and not on a bike path \ninstead of improving a highway.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. I come down here year after year \nand look at the porkbarrel projects and earmarks, and we discuss the \nones that are the most egregious and then I am amused and entertained \nby Members who come down and defend many of these absolutely unneeded \nand unnecessary projects. I will not go into many of my favorites at \nthis time. I know my colleagues are waiting to speak.\n  I ask my colleagues to understand the voice of the people of this \ncountry. I just read today that more seats were gained by the \nRepublican Party than in any election since 1938. Since 1938, there has \nnot been such a political upheaval in this country. That is not because \nour constituents have now fallen in love with Republicans. That is not \nthe case. The message is that all of our constituents are tired of the \nway both Republicans and Democrats conduct their business in \nWashington, frivolously and outrageously spending their hard-earned tax \ndollars. They believe we are not doing right by them, that we are not \ncareful stewards of their tax dollars, that we are engaging in \npractices that need to stop which has disconnected us from the American \npeople. We need to connect again with the American people.\n  I am going to hear the arguments that it is only a few dollars, not \nmuch money, and we don't trust the Federal Government to do it. I have \nheard all of those arguments year after year. I have watched year after \nyear the earmarks go up and up. I have seen the corruption. Senator \nDorgan and I had hearings in the Indian Affairs Committee about a guy \nnamed Jack Abramoff. We saw firsthand the effects of unscrupulous \nlobbyists and the millions and millions of dollars they got in earmarks \nas a result of their corrupt influence. There are many Jack Abramoffs \nin this town; they just haven't gotten famous.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank Senators Coburn, Udall, McCaskill, and \nothers who support this amendment. As I said 20-some years ago, we will \nkeep coming back and back and back to the floor of this body until we \nclean up this practice and restore the confidence and faith of the \nAmerican people--the people who send us here to do their work, not our \nwork.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this evening----\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee speaks we alternate back and \nforth. We are planning to turn in a bunch of our time--to yield back a \nbunch of our time--and I would suggest that Senator Udall be given 8 \nminutes after the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and \nfollowing him Senator LeMieux, with an intervening statement from the \nother side, followed by Senator McCaskill for 10 and Senator Inhofe for \n15 minutes, alternating back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak against the \nCoburn amendment which imposes a moratorium on congressional \ninitiatives for the next 3 years.\n  Mr. President, our Founding Fathers bestowed upon the Congress the \nauthority to ensure that the people's representatives would make the \nfinal decision upon spending, not the executive\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nbranch. They had lived under a monarchy in which the power of the purse \nresided with the Executive, and they had no desire to repeat that \nexperience. In short, our Founding Fathers did not want another King, \nthey wanted a President but a President whose power would be held \nfirmly in check by a coequal Congress.\n  None of us should be surprised that President Obama is expressing his \nopposition to earmarks. A ban on earmarks would serve to strengthen the \nexecutive branch of government by empowering the President to make \ndecisions that the Constitution wisely places in the hands of Congress. \nThis is the exact same reason Presidents Clinton and Bush sought the \nline-item veto during their Presidencies.\n  As I have said many times before, the people of Hawaii did not elect \nme to serve as a rubberstamp for any administration. Handing over the \npower of the purse to the executive branch would turn the Constitution \non its head.\n  So I must admit, Mr. President, I find it puzzling that some \nRepublicans would want to grant all authority over spending to any \nPresident but especially a Democratic President. Make no mistake, that \nis exactly what this amendment will do.\n  We have heard numerous misleading arguments from opponents of \nearmarks, but several in particular seem to be repeated again and \nagain. I cannot allow the misinformation or misrepresentation to go \nunanswered.\n  First and foremost, opponents falsely claim that earmarks contribute \nto the deficit. Perhaps the strongest proponent of this argument is the \njunior Senator from South Carolina who stated the following in a \nfundraising letter he sent out in October:\n\n       I am not willing to bankrupt my country for earmarks.\n\n  It is a fine statement. This is but one example of the many times \nover the past year in which so-called deficit hawks have falsely \nasserted that earmarks are the root cause of our Nation's fiscal \nproblems. This is especially galling when you consider that many of \nthese same individuals supported the policies that led directly to the \ncurrent budget crisis.\n  In the interest of setting the record straight, and as chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, I feel compelled to point out to \nmy colleagues that eliminating earmarks would do virtually nothing to \nbalance the Federal budget. This is a cynical attempt to distract the \nAmerican people from the serious challenges before us and nothing more.\n  The numbers clearly demonstrate just how misleading the arguments of \nearmark opponents are. According to the most recent Congressional \nBudget Office estimate, Federal spending for fiscal year 2010 totals \nabout $3.5 trillion, and revenues for that year total about $2.2 \ntrillion, resulting in a deficit of $1.3 trillion. Congressional \ninitiatives make up less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the total Federal \nspending. If we accept this proposal to eliminate all earmarks and take \nthe second necessary step of actually applying the savings to deficit \nreduction, the total deficit for the United States would still be $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  If opponents were serious about eliminating the deficit and paying \ndown the national debt, they would offer a specific plan for cutting \nthe $1.2 trillion in spending or for increasing revenues. Instead, they \nchoose to mislead the American people by implying that we can balance \nthe budget by cutting a tiny fraction of Federal spending.\n  Calling for the elimination of congressional earmarks is a legitimate \nphilosophical position to take, although not one with which I agree. \nHowever, to suggest that earmarks are the cause of our deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion is irresponsible.\n  Adding to this misleading rhetoric are allegations that \ncongressionally directed spending is an inherently corrupt practice \nthat is hidden from the public eye. That allegation is simply false. We \nall recognize that the practices of the previous majorities led to \nsignificant abuses of the system. However, since we recaptured the \nCongress in 2006, Democrats have instituted a series of major reforms \nthat now hold Members accountable and have made earmarking more \ntransparent than ever. That is the law.\n  I would ask any of my colleagues: Can anyone name another part of the \nFederal budget--and let me remind my colleagues we are talking about \nless than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the budget--that is subject to more \nscrutiny than earmarks?\n  The Appropriations Committee requires every Member to post his or her \nrequest 30 days prior to the committee's consideration of the relevant \nappropriations bill. The committee requires every Member to submit a \nletter that he or she does not have a pecuniary interest in the \nprojects for which the funding is being requested. The committee's Web \nsite provides a link to every single Member's request. These are all \nreforms that were implemented when the Democrats took control of the \nSenate and the House.\n  To pretend and suggest that earmarks are being doled out in a \nbusiness-as-usual manner reflective of previous Congresses is flatout \nmisleading. Reforms have been made that allow great projects that \nprovide benefits to the Nation and to individual States and districts \nto be funded while ensuring that the abuses of the early and mid-2000s \nare a thing of the past. There can be no doubt that we have entered an \nage of real transparency when it comes to earmarks.\n  Moreover, each and every earmark that comes before the Senate today \nis listed in the committee report so that all Members are able to \nidentify them and know exactly what they are voting on. Of course, the \nInternet makes all earmark requests available to the press and to the \npublic. The Internet also makes all campaign contributions over $200 \nequally accessible. So where is the so-called corruption? Where are the \nsecret deals? I would like to know about them.\n  Further, I remind my colleagues that in 2010, funding for earmarks is \nless than half of the $32 billion in earmarks provided in 2006.\n  I have spent considerable time refuting the misinformation being \nspread by those who are opposed to congressionally directed spending \ninitiatives. If I may, I would like to highlight a few examples of why \nthe practice of earmarking is indeed necessary.\n  As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have \nwitnessed the benefits of earmarks firsthand over many years. I have \npreviously discussed the benefits to our troops and our Nation of the \nPredator drone--the pilotless drone that is able to pick up enemy sites \nwithout endangering our troops. I have pointed to the new bandages that \nquickly stop bleeding in serious wounds that have saved countless lives \nof our soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. President, these \nare earmarks.\n  Let me now turn to other areas of the Federal budget. I will start by \nreminding my colleagues that one of the most successful programs for \nlow-income women and infants started out as an earmark. In the 1969 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, Congress earmarked funds for a new \nprogram called WIC to provide critical nutrition to low-income women, \ninfants, and children.\n  Over the past 41 years, this program has provided nutritional \nassistance to over 150 million women, infants, and children, making a \ncritical contribution to the health of the Nation. This vital program \nhas provided much needed assistance to millions, and it came into \nexistence as an earmark.\n  In 1969 and 1970, Congress earmarked $25 million for a children's \nhospital in Washington, DC, despite the objections to and the veto by \nthe President. That funding resulted in what we know today as the \nChildren's National Medical Center. Children's Hospital has become a \nnational and international leader in neonatal and pediatric care, \nproviding health care to over 5 million children since its doors \nopened. Again, I note this was an idea--an earmark--directed by \nCongress and vetoed by the President.\n  In 1987, Congress earmarked funds at the request of Senator Domenici \nfor mapping the human gene. This project became known as the human \ngenome project. This research has led to completely new strategies for \ndisease prevention and treatment, including the discoveries of dramatic \nnew methods of identifying and treating breast, ovarian, and colon \ncancers. No one disputes that these advances will save many lives, and \nit all began with an earmark.\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nThis was a project that was not supported by unelected agency \nbureaucrats in the executive branch, and thus would never have made it \ninto the budget without congressional intervention.\n  In the early 1990s, I pursued, along with my dear friend, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, the late Ted Stevens, an earmark through NOAA to fund a \ntsunami warning system. This earmark came under attack in the late \n1990s and early 2000 by a few Members as wasteful spending. Of course, \nin this particular case, as in many others, time and events would prove \nthis to be a wise investment of tax dollars.\n\n  We all remember that on December 26, 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami \noccurred, killing over 200,000 people in 14 countries. Two years later, \nthe Republican Congress passed and the Bush administration signed into \nlaw the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. This legislation was based \non the foundation established by the 14 years of earmarking for the \nTsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.\n  A congressional initiative that began in 1998 at the behest of \nSenator Gregg would lead to the creation of the National Domestic \nPreparedness Consortium, which is now the principal vehicle through \nwhich FEMA identifies, develops, tests, and delivers training to State \nand local emergency responders. The program began as a series of \nearmarks for several nationally recognized organizations which focused \non counterterrorism preparedness and response needs of the Nation's \nFederal, State, and local emergency first responders and emergency \nmanagement agencies. As a result of the training and expertise \nproviding by NDPC members, thousands of New York City first responders \nhad been through counterterrorism preparedness and response training at \nthe centers prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  There are thousands of other earmarks just like these that, over the \nyears, have made a difference in the lives of Americans, projects the \nbureaucrats in downtown Washington never hear about because they do not \ncommunicate with constituents on a regular basis, programs such as the \nPredator and the Human Genome Project that are so innovative that an \nunelected, unaccountable government official is reluctant to include \nthem in the budget out of fear that he or she will be accused of \nwasting taxpayer funds on an unproven technology.\n  Other Members will be speaking against this amendment and will have \nexamples of why simply stopping all earmarking is wrong and detrimental \nfor government and our citizens. The Founding Fathers bestowed upon \nCongress the responsibility to determine how our taxes should be spent, \nrather than leaving those decisions to unelected bureaucrats in the \nadministration, and obviously with good reason. Certainly we can all \nagree that Members of Congress who return home nearly every weekend to \nmeet with constituents have a much better understanding of what is \nneeded in our cities and towns across rural America than do the \nbureaucrats sitting in Washington.\n  For all these reasons, I will continue to defend the right of \nCongress to direct spending to worthy projects as long as I am \nprivileged to serve in the Senate and call attention to those who \ndistort the facts of the subject.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Coburn amendment. We have \nalready taken significant and forceful steps to ensure the abuses of \nthe past are not repeated. This amendment ignores those steps while at \nthe same time deprives the Congress of essential constitutional \nprerogatives. It does nothing to decrease the debt and is designed to \ngive political cover to those who lack a serious commitment to deficit \nreduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL OF Colorado. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes, if I \ncan, to speak in favor of the bipartisan earmark moratorium amendment \nbefore us. This is the amendment that Senator Coburn, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator McCain, and I have introduced.\n  I wish to specifically start by talking about what I have heard in \nColorado. There is an old saying--I know it is widespread; you hear it \nall over our great country--that if you are in a hole, you stop \ndigging. That sums up what I have heard from many Coloradans who are \njustifiably worried about our Federal deficit. I believe we cannot \nclimb out of that hole we have dug for ourselves unless each one of us \nhere in the Senate--and, frankly, across the Rotunda in the U.S. House \nof Representatives--takes ownership of this problem and agrees to pitch \nin to solve it.\n  I have long pushed for the President to have line-item veto \nauthority, and we ought to restate pay-as-you-go spending which served \nus so well in the 1990s, among other measures. But we can't just \ncontinue to talk about these reforms; we need to take action. That is \nwhy I have joined a chorus, a growing chorus of legislators on both \nsides of the aisle to end the practice known as earmarking.\n  I know many people will argue that earmarking does not significantly \ncontribute to the budget deficit. But, with all due respect, I disagree \nwith that argument, and I believe it misses the point. It is true that \nearmarks are a tiny fraction of money we spend each year--less than 1 \npercent of the Federal budget or $16 billion last year, according to \nnumerous watchdogs. It is also true that some earmarks may be \nworthwhile, even necessary projects. But because earmarks are inserted \nin spending bills by lawmakers, thereby circumventing the budget \nprocess, they are both a symptom and a source of the spending problem \nin Congress and are emblematic of how poor our budgeting habits have \nbecome. Members of Congress have become so focused on protecting their \npet projects that they feel pressure to not speak up about Congress's \nspending habits. In fact, I suggest that earmarks lure Members into \nhabitually voting for increased spending so as not to jeopardize their \nown earmarks.\n  In addition, from a practical standpoint, I believe Congress spends \nits limited time and resources shuffling earmarks when we could be \nconducting much needed oversight, making our Federal Government leaner \nand more responsive to the people. This diversion means earmarks are \npartly to blame for the lack of oversight necessary to ensure that the \nremaining 99 percent of the Federal budget is well spent. If we had \nextra money to spend, that would be one thing, but we are truly in a \ndeep fiscal hole, and we need to stop digging. Earmarks are only a \nsmall part of why we are in that spending hole, but banning them now, \nin my view, will be a small but important step toward fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  Ultimately, I believe that all Colorado families, and Americans, are \nthe ones who will be hurt if we do not begin to reform spending and \ncontrol our debt. We will have many more opportunities to address our \ncrushing deficits in the coming months and years, but banning earmarks \nis the right place to begin down this path of fiscal responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important small step to fiscal \nresponsibility. It is a bipartisan amendment. I look forward to the \nvote tomorrow, and I know many of my colleagues are going to join me \nand this bipartisan group of Senators who believe it is now time to \nreform this earmarking projects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Just a moment.\n  The understanding was to alternate between those who are opposed and \nthose who are supporting.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask if I could have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for \nyielding me 15 minutes of our time.\n  I challenge anyone--even my friend from Colorado who just spoke, a \nnew Member of this body--I challenge anyone to identify any other part \nof the Federal budget that is more transparent, more open, more subject \nto scrutiny, more accessible to the media and the public than \ncongressionally directed funding or earmarks. Every Member who requests \nan earmark in an appropriations bill must post his or her request \nonline at least 30 days before the Appropriations Committee considers \nthe bill. Every Member who requests an earmark must certify that he or \nshe does not have a pecuniary interest in those requests. Each and \nevery\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\nearmark that comes before the Senate is listed in the committee report \nfor all to see, and if you log on to the committee Web site, you can \nfind a link to every single request any Member has made. It is all out \nthere in the open.\n  I remind people of this because one of the misleading arguments \nagainst congressionally directed earmarks is that they are supposedly \ndone in secret, hidden from the public eye. At one time, that may have \nbeen true to some extent but today, thanks to reforms that were \nimplemented by Democrats, by a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate \nin 2007, there is more sunshine on congressionally directed spending \nthan on any other spending decisions in the entire Federal Government.\n  There is more sunshine on congressionally directed funding than on \nany other Federal spending in the entire Federal Government. Why do I \nemphasize that? Let's consider how the executive branch--the \nPresident--directs spending to States and local communities. Make no \nmistake about it, the executive branch earmarks funding, but there is \nvery little sunshine when it comes to those decisions. They are very \nhidden.\n  When a Federal agency announces that a facility should be built in \nNebraska rather than Texas or Alabama or whether a defense contract \nshould go to a company in Colorado or Arizona rather than Rhode Island \nor Ohio, there may be no accountability to voters for those decisions. \nThe employees of Federal agencies are civil servants. They are good \npeople, but they are not elected. They do not meet with constituents. \nThey cannot possibly understand the needs of local communities as well \nas those who stand for election.\n  Most important, no one knows when those civil servants get a phone \ncall from their bosses, higher up, telling them, for example, to \njiggle, to rig a grant competition for political reasons. Does anyone \ndoubt that is done? Every single year it is done.\n  Frankly, Senators and Congressmen do it. What Senator worth his or \nher salt or any Member of the House fighting for their constituency \ndoesn't call up the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development, Secretary of Defense? We all do it. We all do it \nto protect our own constituents. And if you happen to be on the right \ncommittee--for public works, maybe, or for education or for the myriad \nof things the Federal Government does--those Secretaries tend to pay \nattention, and they especially pay attention if they are in the same \nparty you are or they may pay attention if they want your vote for \nsomething else.\n  An example: A few years ago during the Bush administration, I asked \nthe inspector general to examine a program in the Employment and \nTraining Administration called High-Growth Jobs Initiative. It sounds \ngreat, doesn't it--High-Growth Jobs Initiative. This was an executive \nbranch program. The IG reported that, of the 157 grants awarded under \nthe program, 134 had been awarded without any competition.\n  Noncompetitive awards accounted for 87 percent of the total funding, \nand the inspector general found many serious lapses in the award \nprocess. For example, a failure to explain why there was no \ncompetition; the lack of any documentation regarding potential \nconflicts of interest.\n  So was it any surprise when we found out that some of these \nnoncompetitive grants went to organizations that supported President \nBush's reelection campaign or was this just a coincidence? Let's not be \nnaive. This happens. I may have pointed out President Bush because it \nhappened to be an investigation I asked for. It happens under \nDemocratic Presidents too.\n  If this amendment passes, if the Coburn amendment passes, there will \nstill be earmarks. There will be earmarks, but only the executive \nbranch will be able to do it. They will have the power to designate \nwhere those earmarks go, and that flies in the face of the clear intent \nof the Constitution. Article 1 of the Constitution expressly gives the \npower of the purse to the Congress. We are all familiar with the \nprinciple of checks and balances.\n  One way the Constitution puts a check on the executive branch is by \ngiving this branch, the legislative branch, the final say on spending. \nI have said so many times that the President of the United States \ncannot spend one dime that we do not authorize him to, and we can take \nit all back if we want. Oh, they have set up an executive branch but \nonly because Congress gives that power to the President.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the final say on spending. I realize \nthe Constitution may seem like ancient history to some people. I am \nsorry to say it may seem like ancient history to some Members of this \nbody. So let me paint a picture of a world where only the executive \nbranch can decide to direct Federal spending. Let me paint this \npicture. Let's imagine the Coburn amendment passes and a future \nPresident wants Congress to pass a bill. It can be a Democratic \nPresident or it can be a Republican President. It does not matter.\n  The vote on the bill is going to be close. The President calls \nSenator Jones and says: Senator, I would like your support on this \nbill. Senator Jones says: I am sorry, Mr. President, I have thought \nhard about it. I am not going to be able to support that bill.\n  Oh, there is probably a little pause on the phone, and the President \nsays: You know, Senator, I know that replacing that bridge in your \ncapital city is real important to you. It would be a real shame if your \nState missed out when the executive branch is setting its priorities \nfor next year. Now, Senator Jones, would you like to reconsider how you \nare going to vote on that bill?\n  That is executive branch earmarking. Again, as I said, it makes no \ndifference whether the President is a Republican or Democrat. It is a \nmatter of respecting the Constitution and preserving the constitutional \nprerogatives of the legislative branch. Some people say: Well, Harkin, \nwhy do you fight so hard for these earmarks? As Senator Udall says, it \nis \\1/2\\ percent of total Federal spending. I fight so hard because the \nConstitution gives that power to the legislative branch. We should \nprotect the constitutional prerogatives of the legislative branch, not \njust willy-nilly give them to any President of the United States, which \nis what the Coburn amendment does.\n  Read the amendment carefully. See how it defines ``earmarks.'' It \napplies only to ``a provision or report language included primarily at \nthe request of a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives.''\n  There is nothing in the Coburn amendment to prohibit any earmarks by \nthe President. They can earmark anything, and they will because they \nalways do. They will earmark, and guess what. Senators--Senators--will \nstart going to the President and saying: Mr. President, can you, \nplease, I need that bridge. I need that flood control project. We just \nhad a disaster, Mr. President.\n  Well, Senator, I will think about it when we set our priorities next \nyear. Well, now, Senator, how are you going to vote on my priorities?\n  Do you want to be in that position? I do not want to be in that \nposition. I want to be in the position where Congress fulfills its \nConstitutional prerogative. So under the Coburn amendment, if Congress \nrequests, it is an earmark; if the President requests, it is not an \nearmark. How does that make sense? How does that make sense?\n  Well, here is an example again of the double standard. The fiscal \nyear 2011 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations \nbill that the Senate will probably vote on in December includes funding \nfor national education groups such as Teach for America, Reading is \nFundamental, Reach Out and Read, the National Writing Project, and many \nothers. These are successful, proven programs with significant \nbipartisan support.\n  But under the definition of the Coburn amendment, all are earmarks \nand none would be funded. They would all be eliminated. But under the \nterms of the Coburn amendment, if the President wanted to fund those \nprograms, no problem. They would not be considered earmarks at all and \nthey could receive funding, as long as the President wanted to do it. \nAgain, I ask, what sense does that make?\n  My State of Iowa had terrible floods in 2008--a lot of damage. \nLouisiana and Texas have had destructive hurricanes on a regular basis. \nIn the wake of these disasters, typically the Corps of Engineers comes \nup with a plan to mitigate the damage from future possible disasters. \nFor example, the Corps is now\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nworking to improve a flood prevention program in Cedar Rapids, IA, \nwhich was devastated by the worst flood in the history of Iowa in 2008.\n  If the Coburn amendment passes, whatever the Corps plan comes up with \nwill be final, even if local officials strongly disagree with that. \nUnder the terms of the Coburn amendment, a strong case may be made that \nany legislative action by Members of Congress to modify the Corps plan \nwould be an earmark--an earmark. Representing my constituents, it would \ntake an extraordinary two-thirds vote in the Senate to change the Corps \nof Engineers plan--not a majority, not 60 percent but two-thirds of the \nSenate. Again, I again ask you, what sense does that make? How are we \nfighting for our constituents when the President decides it; we cannot.\n  We have local constituents who say: We have better ideas and plans on \nwhat to do. The Corps says no. Well, that is the end of it, unless the \nPresident tells the Corps what to do. I do not want to lose my ability \nto intervene effectively for local or State officials when this kind of \nissue arises, and I do not think Senators from Texas, Louisiana or any \nother State want to lose their ability to stand for the best interests \nof their State. I cannot imagine any Senator who would forfeit this \nimportant constitutional prerogative, give up, give up your \nconstitutional prerogative to the President, so you would not be able \nto fight for your State and your constituents. Is that what you are \ngoing to tell them?\n  Proponents of this amendment say: Forget about article 1 of the \nConstitution. We have to do whatever it takes to cut the deficit. The \nonly way to do that is to ban earmarks.\n  This is grossly misleading. Yes, we do need to cut the deficit. \nBanning earmarks will not do anything to help.\n  Congressionally funded mandates, as I said, are less than one-half of \n1 percent of total Federal spending. As one observer noted: The best \nway to lose weight is to shave. My friend, Senator Udall, said reforms \ncircumvent the budget process. No, it does not. Nothing we do on \nappropriations at all circumvents the budget process.\n  He said: When you are in a hole, stop digging. Well, sure, we can \nstop digging. We can stop the earmarks here. We are just going to shift \nthem to the President. That is all. That is all that is going to \nhappen.\n  Lastly, I had to laugh when I read this quote from Representative \nMichele Bachmann in the House. This was in Congressional Quarterly \nToday. She is founder of the House Tea Party Caucus, one of several \nlawmakers who have pledged not to seek earmarks. But she told the \nMinneapolis Star Tribune she thinks the word ``earmark'' should not \napply to infrastructure projects. ``I don't believe that building roads \nand bridges and interchanges should be considered an earmark.''\n\n  Oh, so she gets to decide what is an earmark. She wants no earmarks \nexcept for what she wants as an earmark. That is it. Congressman Mica \nof Florida said: ``There are some bills that require some legislative \nlanguage to direct the funds, otherwise you're just writing a blank \ncheck to the administration.'' That is a Republican Congressman from \nFlorida.\n  Congressionally directed spending is congressionally directed \nspending whether it is a highway or a hospital, whether it is in \nWyoming or Tennessee. I, for one, am proud of the directed funding that \nI have been able to secure on behalf of my State and for other States \nthat I have worked hard for or other entities such as Teach for \nAmerica. It does not necessarily help Iowa but it helps a lot of \nStates.\n  These fundings have created jobs, trained nurses, built roads, and, \nas the distinguished chairman said, one time I remember when Pete \nDomenici put that money in there for the Human Genome Project, it led \nto the establishment of the Human Genome Institute and a complete \nmapping and sequencing of the human gene. Had that money not been \ndirected, it never would have happened, I say to my chairman.\n  So a lot of times Congressmen, Senators have good ideas on what to do \nto direct some of this funding. I think we ought to be proud of that. \nAs long as the sunshine is on it, it is out in the open, everybody \nknows where it goes, everybody knows who has requested it, to me, this \nis the constitutional prerogative of the Senate and the House, and we \nshould not--should not--give it up to any President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent, to get an order so we know what \nwe are doing after we hear from the Senator from Florida, Mr. LeMieux, \nand then the words from the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nthat I then would get my 15 minutes from this side to run consecutively \nfrom the 15 minutes I would get from the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Before I start my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to be \nadded as a cosponsor to Senator Coburn's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, it occurs to me that when I address this \naugust Chamber tonight--and I follow my colleagues who have served here \nfor a very long time and with distinction; I am new to this Chamber--I \nhave a different perspective.\n  But my comments tonight are not meant without respect because I have \na great deal of respect for those who have spoken in opposition to this \namendment, but I have a differing view. I am new to the Senate, as you \nknow. I came here last year, in 2009. I did not have a specific \nposition on earmarks before I got here. I knew that there was a problem \nwith Federal spending. But I had not yet made a decision as to whether \nI would support earmarks.\n  When you hear about a project for your home State, whether it be for \na hospital or for a road or for a bridge or for a sewage treatment \nplant--and for the folks who are at home who are watching this, if they \nhave not yet found Monday Night Football on their television and may \nhave stumbled across C-SPAN, these projects all sound very good, and a \nlot of them are very good.\n  I hear from a lot of people in my State wanting me to support a \nparticular project via an earmark. An earmark is a Member-driven \nappropriation, where a Member of Congress says: I want this specific \nspending for my home State or for an issue or project that I think is \nimportant.\n  They come to me and they say: We need this project. We need this \nfunding. We need this research. It all sounds good. I think in a world \nwhere our financial house was more in order, there could be a role for \nthose earmarks, if transparent.\n  But I cannot support them in the situation we are in. The chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, just a few moments ago in his speech, \nraised the point that this Congress in last year's budget was $1.3 \ntrillion in deficit.\n  It is our constitutional responsibility to appropriate. That is what \narticle 1 says. The power of the purse lies in the Congress. Congress \nhas not been doing a very good job--$1.3 trillion in debt, in deficit, \nin just 1 year. It took 200 years for this country to go $1 trillion in \ndebt. We just incurred a $1.3 trillion deficit.\n  Those who are in favor of continuing earmarks and who are against \nthis prohibition say: Look, it is just a small percentage; it is $16 \nbillion. In light of a $1.3 trillion deficit, what is a mere $16 \nbillion? Frankly, that argument doesn't ring true with the people of \nFlorida. When one talks to a Floridian and says there is $16 billion in \nspending, that is still a lot of money to regular people.\n\n  But it is more than that. When I came here and started to vote on \nappropriations bills, in the first few months of 2009, I noticed those \nappropriations bills were 5, 10, 15, 20 percent more than the last \nyear's appropriations bills. No wonder the country is so far in debt, \nnearly $14 trillion. It is estimated that by the end of the decade, it \nwill be 26. We spend $200 billion a year on interest now, the debt \nservice on programs we couldn't afford in the past. It will be $900 \nbillion by the end of the decade because the appropriations bills go up \nand up and up.\n  I believe, sitting here, with all due respect, and listening to my \ncolleagues, part of the reason those appropriations bills get support \nis because there are Member projects in them. You can't vote against \nthe bill once your hometown project is in it. It is the engine\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nthat drives the train. So it is not losing weight by shaving, as my \ndistinguished colleague analogized. It is, as Senator McCain said, the \ngateway drug. It enables the spending we can't afford.\n  We have to solve these spending problems. The future is in jeopardy. \nWe can't afford $900 billion in interest payments. What will this \nCongress do when the interest payment alone is $900 billion? This is \nnot 20 years from now. This is not 40 years from now. This is 10 \nyears--really 9 years from now. I contend this government will not \nfunction with a $900 billion interest payment.\n  Maybe this is emblematic, but I believe it is more than that. If we \ncan't do the easy things, how is this Congress going to do the hard \nthings? How is it going to cap spending? How is it going to cut \nspending?\n  The President announced today a moratorium on pay increases for \nFederal employees. That is a good start. But there are 270,000 new \nFederal employees since this administration took over, according to the \nCato Institute, 270,000 new employees with average salaries of about \n$70,000 a year. We can't nibble around the edges, not with a $1.3 \ntrillion deficit this year alone, and not with $26 trillion staring us \nin the face by the end of the decade.\n  The future of the country is at stake. Our Founding Fathers gave this \nCongress the power of the purse, but with that power comes a \nresponsibility not to run the country into the ground with deficit \nspending.\n  This is an important step. It is a first step. It needs to be done. \nWhat needs to be tackled next is much more difficult--the across-the-\nboard spending cuts that will have to come, tackling Social Security, \ntackling Medicare and making sure those programs are there for our \nseniors now but are reformed in a way that will save them for the \nfuture and not run this country into a financial hole it can't get out \nof. My friend from Colorado, who was courageous to talk on this issue \ntonight, said: When you are in a hole, stop digging. This is the first \nstep. If we can't take this easy step, I don't know how in the world \nCongress is going to take the harder steps that must happen if we are \ngoing to save this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 15 \nminutes to make my presentation. I thank Senator Inouye for enabling \nthat.\n  I oppose the Coburn motion to place a 3-year moratorium on earmarks. \nI thank Chairman Inouye for his leadership on this issue. It seems, as \nhas been said over the years, that we have heard this song before. If \nMembers really believe these programs are responsible for our terrible \nfiscal condition, they are wrong. It is make believe. The deficit we \nare wrestling with had its biggest boost during the Bush years when 8 \nyears of tax cuts for the wealthiest among us brought a $2 trillion \nincrease in the national debt. But we never hear about that.\n  Earmarks are a vital investment for our communities. They help build \nlevees, dams that protect coastal towns from flooding. Look at the \nwater shortages across the country. A lot of these are helped by \nearmarks, by congressionally designated programs. We earmark funds for \nwaste and drinking water problems, very serious problems. These are not \nfrivolous ideas. They help police departments, first responders, \nhospital upgrades, and the purchase of new equipment. Look at \ntransportation. It is falling apart. These earmarks, congressionally \ndesignated, build roads, bridges, and rail stations that strengthen our \ntransportation infrastructure. One wouldn't know any of this by \nlistening to the critics of designated funding from those sent here by \nour States to represent them with a special knowledge of their needs \nand requirements. These critics have dismissed earmarks as an example \nof wasteful, runaway government spending. We hear them called dirty \nprograms, et cetera, mocking them.\n  To these critics I say: I would like you to see what happened in \nJersey City, NJ, where an earmark enabled the Metropolitan Family \nHealth Clinic to now screen women for breast cancer for the first time, \nthanks to new equipment funded by an earmark. Or tell it to the \nmillions of people whose livelihoods are connected to the ports of New \nYork and New Jersey. Earmarks permit us to deepen the harbor at our \nport so ever larger vessels can bring the cargo to our ports and help \nstimulate the economy. That means 230,000 jobs and is a critical \ncomponent of our region's economy. Local communities rely upon this \nkind of funding in times like these when so many State and community \nbudgets are stretched thin and revenues shrink and even philanthropy is \ndrying up all over the country.\n  The fact is, hundreds of communities and nonprofit organizations \nacross the country are expecting to receive congressionally earmarked \nfunds for the unfinished fiscal 2011 appropriations bills. The Coburn \namendment would pull the rug from underneath these communities, \nsnatching away the Federal support they are counting on us to deliver.\n  One has only to see the reception of an organization such as Campus \nKitchen, a nonprofit project that recently launched in Atlantic City to \nfeed needy families who flock there over Thanksgiving and at the same \ntime help unemployed workers upgrade their job skills. Campus Kitchen \nis counting on $100,000 worth of congressionally directed funds. If \nthis amendment passes, they will close their doors, and those who need \nthe food and can only get it there will go hungry.\n  What about the resources needed to protect our residents from \nterrorism. Hudson County sits just across the river from New York City, \nright in the heart of one of the most vulnerable areas in the country \nfor terrorism.\n  This year's Homeland Security appropriations bill includes funding \nfor an emergency operations center so that the county can prepare and \nrespond to emergencies and potential terrorist threats. One of the most \nserious problems we saw on 9/11, when 3,000 people perished that day, \nwas because the police departments could not talk to one another, \nbecause first responders could not talk to one another, because firemen \ncould not talk to their leadership and died that day. Thousands more \nare now sick from the dust and the atmosphere that was created as a \nresult of the demolition resulting from the attack. This amendment \nwould eliminate funding for this vital program. Yet those who criticize \nthese projects are the very same ones who were all too happy to provide \nearmarks when they were in charge.\n  I don't want to fool the public. Let them understand what is going on \nhere. We are seeing raw politics at work. Earmarks make up just one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the Homeland Security bill for fiscal year 2011 \nthat was passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee. I was proud to \nauthor that bill as the chairman of the subcommittee, building on the \nwork begun by our recently departed Senator Byrd.\n  Compare this to the fiscal year 2006 bill which was written when our \ncolleagues on the other side controlled the Congress. Under Republican \ncontrol, earmarks in the Homeland Security appropriations bill were 60 \npercent higher than the fiscal year 2011 bill.\n  In addition to funding emergency operations centers, the Homeland \nSecurity bill funds important research that helps our Nation discover \nnew ways to prevent potential terrorist attacks and respond when they \nhappen. Earmarks also help to strengthen the Coast Guard whose mission \nand value continually increase. It is not wasteful spending. Over the \nyears many people have recognized the value of these programs. \nDemocrats and Republicans alike proudly included earmarks for \nworthwhile projects in their States. In fact, earmarks flourished when \nthe Republicans controlled the Senate. In fiscal year 2006, total \nfunding for earmarks was twice the amount included in last year's bills \nwhen Democrats were in charge, and it was Democrats who implemented the \nethics reforms and earmark transparency that has significantly improved \ncongressionally designated programs.\n  Since becoming Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator Inouye has \nbeen a great leader in this office. He has instituted important changes \nthat have made the earmarking process stronger and more transparent. It \nwas an essential factor in our review. At Chairman Inouye's request, \nSenators are now required to post their earmark requests on the \nInternet in advance so\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nthe public can see them. He has brought this entire process further \ninto the light of day, allowing constituents, the news media, and \noutside watchdog organizations to track how taxpayer dollars are spent.\n  But a funny thing has occurred. Some of our Republican friends who \nhave used earmarks to serve their constituents for years suddenly have \nhad a change of heart and jumped on the anti-earmark bandwagon. In \nfact, the Republican leader, who in the past brought home hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to his State of Kentucky, has done an about-face in \ncalling for an earmark ban.\n  The hypocrisy of these new earmark critics is outrageous. Here is \nwhat the critics never mention: Earmarks do not add one cent to the \ndeficit, not a single cent. We heard that from our leader here, from \nSenator Inouye.\n  When Congress includes an earmark in an agency's budget, it is not \nincreasing that budget. It is specifying how a portion of the funding \nshould be spent based on their understanding of their State's needs. \nAfter hearing many requests all of us do, they can evaluate which ones \nthey see as the most important. It is a voice of reason and \nunderstanding.\n  The fact is the Founding Fathers gave Congress the power of the purse \nwhen they wrote the Constitution. Directing funding to specific \nprojects is one way Congress exercises this power.\n  If we eliminate earmarks, we will transfer our funding powers to the \nPresident, and that is not the way the Constitution is structured. It \nundermines the authority the Founders placed on us two centuries ago.\n  The people who work in the Federal agencies here in Washington \ninclude some of America's best and brightest, but they simply do not \nnecessarily know the needs of our States as well as we do. This debate \nover earmarks is nothing more than a distraction from the pressing \nissues on which we should be focused.\n  I call on my colleagues to consider the facts and not the rhetoric. \nDo not be misled. Do not allow the truth to be mangled, misconstrued, \nand misrepresented. Earmarks help create jobs and help millions of \nAmericans through their lives, especially now in this stressful period \nwhere we have people who are afraid they are going to lose their jobs \nafter many years of loyal support or, still, lose their homes because \nthey cannot afford the mortgages they were sold.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the Coburn amendment because it \nwill not solve a single problem we face. I hope we will use our time \nfor more constructive debate. I would suggest that everybody who talks \nin opposition to earmarks, congressionally designated programs, say now \non this floor--take an oath that you will in your own State announce \nthe fact you are opposing the earmarks that were proposed for it. Tell \nthe people back home that you are going to deny their right to accept \nthese things because it is dirty, because it is unclean, and they say \nthat it goes only to those who contribute large sums of money.\n  If you want to look at those who contribute large sums of money, look \nat that side of the aisle. They dwarf what we do in our debate about \nwhere funding goes and where funding stops.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask if I could extend my time by 5 minutes. Is \nthere objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8239-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill I \nrecently introduced: S. 3941, the Combating Military Counterfeits Act \nof 2010. This bill will help protect America's Armed Forces from the \nrisk of defective equipment by enhancing the ability of prosecutors to \nkeep counterfeit goods out of the military supply chain.\n  The safety of our servicemembers and the success of their missions \ndepend upon the proper performance of weapon systems, body armor, \naircraft parts, and countless other mission-critical products. \nUnfortunately, America's military faces a significant and growing \nthreat: the infiltration of the military supply chain by counterfeit \nproducts. These counterfeit products do not meet military standards, \nputting troops' lives at risk, compromising military readiness, and \ncosting taxpayers millions in replacement costs. In the case of \nmicroelectronics, counterfeit parts also provide an avenue for \ncybersecurity threats to enter military systems, possibly enabling \nhackers to disable or track crucial national security applications.\n  Let me give you a few examples from a recent report by the Government \nAccountability Office:\n  The Defense Department discovered in testing that it had procured \nbody armor that was misrepresented as being ``Kevlar.'' Think about \nthat: a criminal sold fake body armor to the military, putting our \ntroops' lives at risk just to make a buck. The law must provide strong \ndeterrence and harsh sanctions for such conduct.\n  And in another example, a supplier sold the Defense Department a \npersonal computer part that it falsely claimed was a $7,000 circuit \nthat met the specifications of a missile guidance system. As my \ncolleagues may know, military grade chips are required to withstand \nextreme temperature, force, and vibration. Chips that don't meet those \nspecifications are prone to fail--for example, when a jet is at high \naltitude, when a missile is launching, or when a GPS unit is out in the \nfield. The possible tragic consequences of such equipment failing are \nunthinkable.\n  And the increasing number of counterfeits has broad ramifications for \nour national security. A January 2010 study by the Commerce Department, \nfor example, quoted a Defense Department official as estimating that \ncounterfeit aircraft parts were ``leading to a 5 to 15 percent annual \ndecrease in weapons systems reliability.'' And the risk is growing. The \nCommerce Department study, which surveyed military manufacturers, \ncontractors, and distributors, reported approximately two and a half \ntimes as many incidents of counterfeit electronics in 2008 as in 2005. \nIt is only going to get worse as the high prices of military grade \nproducts attract more and more counterfeits. Consider, for example, \nthat before fleeing the country, the supplier that sold a counterfeit \n$7,000 circuit for a missile guidance system had been paid $3 million \nas part of contracts worth a total of $8 million.\n  We should also evaluate this bill in the context of the relentless \ncyber attacks America weathers every day. The chip might not only be \ncounterfeit, it might be the carrier for dangerous viruses and malware \nthat may create\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nwindows for enemies to enter to sabotage our military equipment to \nsteal our military secrets.\n  I applaud those of my colleagues who have been working with the \nDepartment of Defense to ensure that it does everything it can to keep \ncounterfeits out of its supply chain. And I am pleased the \nadministration, and particularly the intellectual property enforcement \ncoordinator, Victoria Espinel, is taking on this issue.\n  But I also believe that Congress needs to give the executive branch \nmore tools to address these problems. As a former U.S. attorney, I know \nthe significant deterrent effect criminal sanctions can provide. To \nthat end, the Department of Justice has a vital role to play in using \ncriminal investigations and prosecutions to identify and deter \ntrafficking in counterfeit military goods.\n  Current law is insufficient. The existing counterfeit trafficking \nstatute, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2320, provides for heightened penalties for \ntrafficking in counterfeits that result in bodily injury or death. But \nunlike cases of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, it may not be possible to \nprove that a military counterfeit caused bodily injuries or death, \nsince the faulty part may never be recovered from a battlefield. As a \nresult, traffickers in military counterfeits are likely to face \npenalties that do not reflect the unacceptable risk that counterfeits \nimpose on our troops, our military readiness, and our national and \ncyber security.\n  We must address this flaw in our laws and we must do so soon. \nTraffickers should face stiff penalties if they knowingly sell the \nmilitary a piece of counterfeit body armor that could fail in combat, a \ncounterfeit missile control system that could short-circuit at launch, \nor a counterfeit GPS that could fail on the battlefield.\n  The Combating Military Counterfeits Act of 2010 will make sure that \nsuch reprehensible criminals face appropriate criminal sanctions. It \ncreates an enhanced offense for an individual who traffics in \ncounterfeits and knows that the counterfeit product either is intended \nfor military use or is identified as meeting military standards. It \ndoubles the statutory maximum penalty for such offenses. The bill also \ndirects the Sentencing Commission to update the Sentencing Guidelines \nas appropriate to reflect Congress's intent that trafficking in \ncounterfeit military items be punished sufficiently to deter this \nreckless endangerment of our servicemembers and weakening of our \nnational security.\n  The bill is narrowly crafted. It adds to an existing offense so that \nit only targets particularly malicious offenders--those who already are \nguilty of trafficking in counterfeit goods and know that the goods in \nquestion are intended for military use. As a result, this bill will not \naffect legitimate military contractors who might be unaware that a \ncounterfeit chip has made its way into one of their products. Nor will \nit apply to makers of products that unintentionally fall short of \nmilitary specifications as a result of innocent mistakes. Indeed, this \nbill will help military suppliers by deterring criminals from selling \ncounterfeits to them or to their subcontractors. Manufacturers will \nbenefit from the protection of their intellectual property.\n  To that end, I have received a letter of support from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce which explains that ``[t]his legislation would . . \n. provide an important deterrent to those seeking to profit from the \nsale of counterfeit parts to the military.'' The Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation has similarly weighed in with their support, explaining the \nirresponsible manner in which counterfeit chips are made and the harm \nthat counterfeit chips, most of which are imported into the United \nStates, can cause to the military and to their industry. I am grateful \nfor their early support and I welcome the comments of other \nstakeholders as I work to make the legislation as effective as possible \nin its deterrence of this shameful criminal activity.\n  I of course also very much look forward to working with my colleagues \non what I expect to be bipartisan legislation that we can act on \npromptly. We all have had the privilege of visiting with our troops. We \nall know the sacrifices they make for our country. We all want to do \neverything we can to ensure that their equipment functions properly and \nthat counterfeits do not compromise our nation's military readiness or \nsecurity. By deterring trafficking in counterfeit military goods, the \nCombating Military Counterfeits Act of 2010 is a vital and necessary \nstep towards these important goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8240-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Specialist Dylan T. Reid\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SPC Dylan T. Reid. Specialist \nReid, who was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Division, in Fort Carson, CO, died on October 16, 2010. \nSpecialist Reid was serving in support of Operation New Dawn in Amarah, \nIraq. He was 24 years old.\n  A native of Missouri, Specialist Reid graduated from Desert \nTechnology High School in Lake Havasu City, AZ, in 2005 and entered the \nArmy in September 2008. He joined his current unit in April of last \nyear and deployed to Iraq this past March. He was serving his first \ntour of duty, and quickly showed his commitment and skill.\n  During more than 2 years of service, Specialist Reid distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any job. He was given numerous awards and medals, including the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the \nOverseas Service Ribbon.\n  Specialist Reid worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Iraq. He is remembered by those who knew him as \na consummate professional with an unending commitment to excellence. \nFriends and loved ones remember how proud Specialist Reid was of his \nnew daughter, Avery. They also remember his love for fixing things and \nworking on cars.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' \nSpecialist Reid's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Iraq. And though his fate on the battlefield was uncertain, \nhe pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her safety, and the \nfreedoms we hold dear.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in congratulating the Eastern Shore town of Easton, MD, which is \nconcluding its 300th anniversary celebration.\n  In 1710, the Assembly of the Province of Maryland chose Easton as the \nsite for a new court house to serve the pre-Revolution population of \nsea merchants and farmers. Easton was incorporated as a town in Talbot \nCounty, MD, in 1790 and serves as the county seat.\n  Easton is located on the shore of the Tred Avon River that flows into \nthe Chesapeake Bay. It was a bustling port for Eastern Shore \nagricultural products and seafood for much of its first 200 years. Many \nof the farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland had slaves, and it was in \nTalbot County where Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, was raised. \nBecause of his national leadership in the abolitionist movement, a \nstatue of Mr. Douglass will soon be erected on the court house lawn in \nEaston.\n  Easton remains a cultural and community center for merchants, \nlawyers, bankers, trades people, farmers, and watermen. Weekend \nvisitors, sailors\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nand retirees have been added to the mix and continue to enrich the \ncommunity.\n  Today, Easton is a country town with urbane sensibilities. A 1786 \nsurvey of the town showed that Easton was barely 95 acres, a tiny \ncollection of government offices, residences, and shops surrounded by \nwide expanses of farms and forests. Today, Easton is comprised of 6,866 \nacres, home to an airport, medical centers, schools, museums, music, \nart competitions, the young Chesapeake Film Festival, and the \ncelebrated annual Waterfowl Festival, which fills the closed downtown \nstreets with thousands of bird and art lovers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the town of Easton, MD, on \nits 300th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8241-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NORBERT SEBADE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Norbert \nSebade as he celebrates his retirement after 43 years of extraordinary \nservice in the banking community. Norbert is ending a career marked by \noutstanding community service and longstanding dedication to economic \ngrowth and development in the Black Hills through his numerous \nleadership roles in the banking field and beyond.\n  Norbert began his banking career in Madison, SD, in the summer of \n1967. He quickly distinguished himself as a leader in the industry. \nNorbert has served as the former President of First Western Bank Wall, \nformer chairman of the board of First Western Bank Custer, vice \nchairman of the board First Western Bank Sturgis, former board member \nof South Dakota Bankers Association, SDBA, Insurance Services, former \nchairman of South Dakota Rural Enterprise, and an appointee to the West \nRiver Economic Development Coalition. Additionally, Norbert has focused \nhis attention and energy on the well-being of his communities in other \nways, serving as a trustee and former chairman of the Rapid City \nRegional Hospital, a trustee for the Black Hills State University \nFoundation in Spearfish, and a board member of the South Dakota \nCommunity Foundation. He retires today as the regional president of \nFirst Interstate Bank of the Southern Hills.\n  I would like to thank Norbert for his commitment to South Dakota's \ncommunities and congratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8241-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 5712) to \nprovide for certain clarifications and extensions under Medicare, \nMedicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 6:14 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3689.

Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3982. A bill to amend the limitation on liability for certain \npassenger rail accidents or incidents under section 28103 of title 49, \nUnited States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to raise \nthe cap on rail liability in cases of gross negligence. This bill was \noriginally introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman \nElton Gallegly of the 24th District of California, and I thank him for \nall of his hard work on it.\n  When Congress passed the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act in \n1997, it included a small provision imposing a strict cap on liability \nin railroad crashes. The cap is now contained in 49 U.S.C. Sec.  28103 \nand states that the ``aggregate allowable awards to all rail \npassengers, against all defendants, for all claims, including claims \nfor punitive damages, arising from a single accident or incident, shall \nnot exceed $200,000,000.''\n  What this means is that regardless of the circumstances no matter how \nmany people are killed or injured in a train crash, and no matter what \ncaused the crash total liability for all of the passengers hurt or \nkilled in the crash cannot exceed $200 million.\n  The problem is that when a real catastrophe occurs, this number is \njust not sufficient and there is no way around it.\n  Let me tell you what happened 2 years ago in California.\n  On September 12, 2008, a commuter train in Chatsworth, California \ncarrying more than 200 people crashed head-on into a freight train.\n  The carnage from this crash was unspeakable. Twenty-five people were \nkilled. Their bodies, many torn to pieces, had to be extracted from \nheaps of steel and wreckage.\n  Another 101 people were injured. Volunteers and rescue crews worked \nthat day to help pull them from the wreckage. Emergency response \nagencies transported over 100 people to hospitals. Their injuries \nranged from blood in the brain and collapsed lungs to bone fractures, \ngashes, and scratches.\n  For some people, the crash was a horrible, harrowing experience, but \nthey have been able to return to the lives they had before.\n  For others, the families of the 25 people who died and for those who \nsuffered the most serious of injuries, life will never be the same.\n  According to the final report of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, NTSB, no unexpected equipment malfunction or weather problem was \nresponsible for this crash.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board report states: ``the \nprobable cause of the September 12, 2008, collision was the failure of \nthe Metrolink engineer to observe and appropriately respond to the red \nsignal because he was engaged in text messaging that distracted him \nfrom his duties.''\n  The NTSB found, in other words, that the engineer wasn't paying \nattention, and he sailed through a red signal, crashing head-on into \nthe freight train. In fact, the report finds that he was so busy \ntexting that he never even hit the brakes.\n  According to the report, on the day of the crash, the engineer sent \n21 text messages, received 20 text messages, and made four outgoing \ntelephone calls while he was driving the train.\n  NTSB wrote,\n\n       the investigation further revealed that this amount of \n     activity was not unusual for this engineer. Wireless records \n     for the 7 days preceding the accident showed that on each \n     workday, the engineer had sent or received text messages or \n     made voice calls during the time he was responsible for \n     operating a train. Two days before the accident, he sent or \n     received about 125 messages during the time he was \n     responsible for operating a train. He had also made phone \n     calls during these periods.\n\n  Astoundingly, the NTSB found that ``the content of all of the \nengineer's text messages over the previous 7 days, including those \nduring and outside the times the engineer was responsible for operating \na train, indicated that the engineer and, a teenage boy, had been \ncoordinating to allow, the teenage boy, to operate, Metrolink, train \n111 on the evening of the accident.''\n  Although texting while driving the train was clearly prohibited under \nthe operating rules of Veolia Transportation, who employed and oversaw \nthe engineer under contract with Metrolink, this engineer had been \nviolating these ruled habitually and had not been stopped.\n  The conductor who worked with the engineer on Metrolink train 111 \nobserved him using his cell phone while driving the train a month \nbefore the accident. According to NTSB, ``He said he spoke to the \nengineer about it and he later brought the incident to the attention of \na supervisor.'' But the behavior obviously continued.\n  Bottom line: The report says the engineer wasn't paying attention to \nthe passengers' safety, he was sending text messages on his cell phone, \nand no one else took action to stop this dangerous behavior. As a \nresult, 25 people died.\n  This is unbelievable. And it is unacceptable.\n  Since the Chatsworth Crash, I have worked to improve rail safety. In \nOctober 2008, Congress passed and the President signed the ``Rail \nSafety Improvement Act,'' which included a key provision that I \nstrongly pushed requiring\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\nmandatory collision-avoidance systems on America's major passenger, \ncommuter, and freight lines.\n  But this $200 million liability cap remains in place.\n  That means that under current law, the train operator, Metrolink, and \nthe company that hired and oversaw the engineer, Veolia, believe they \nonly have to pay $200 million total to all of the victims of the \nChatsworth crash and their families.\n  It doesn't matter how tragic the families' losses were. Or how high \nthe survivors' medical bills are. Or how much has been lost in their \nability to work and care for their families. The cap is $200 million \ntotal, regardless of the circumstances.\n  This is terrible public policy, should never have been adopted, and \nneeds to be changed.\n  In a large crash involving hundreds of people and very serious \ninjuries, a court needs to be able to award the damages that it finds \nare necessary to care for the victims and their families--to pay their \nmedical bills and to compensate for wages they will never again be able \nto earn.\n  The bill I am introducing is straightforward. It would raise the \nliability cap in any case where a court finds gross negligence or \nwillful misconduct to $500 million. And it would do so retroactively to \nensure that those who were injured or whose family members were killed \nare not unfairly deprived of the benefits of what was really the right \npolicy in the first place.\n  I understand that the rail industry believes that the cap on damages \nkeeps their insurance costs and risk exposure down, and I appreciate \nall the feedback that has been provided by California's passenger rail \nsystems.\n  I look forward to working with them to make sure this legislation \nwill not have any unintended consequences. I do not expect this bill to \nbe considered and enacted this week. Facing that reality, I will work \nwith the interested parties, including California High Speed Rail \nAuthority and CalTrain, to further refine this legislation. There will \nbe an opportunity to introduce an improved product as a ``first day \nbill'' in the next Congress.\n  But I believe we must do everything we can first to improve safety on \nour rail lines and second to ensure that when the very worst occurs and \npeople are injured or lose their lives in these accidents, they and \ntheir families are fairly compensated.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to amend this law and raise the \ncap in cases of gross negligence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3982\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACCIDENT LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Amendments.--Section 28103 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``The aggregate'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in paragraph (3), the \n     aggregate'';\n       (2) by adding at the end of subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(3) The liability cap under paragraph (2) shall be \n     $500,000,000 if the accident or incident was proximately \n     caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of the \n     defendant.

A bill to amend and extend the Museum and Library Services \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--\nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Enzi, and Senator Burr in introducing \nthe Museum and Library Services Act of 2010.\n  Together our offices worked to craft a bipartisan bill that updates \nmuseum and library services funded through the Institute for Museum and \nLibrary Services, IMLS, to better meet the needs of Americans of all \nages and in all types of locations.\n  The Museum and Library Services Act was first enacted in 1996, and my \npredecessor, the late Senator Claiborne Pell, was instrumental in its \ndevelopment and enactment. This law established IMLS, an independent \nFederal agency, to oversee funding and programs authorized under the \nlaw's two main subtitles, the Library Services and Technology Act, \nLSTA, and the Museum Services Act.\n  Libraries and museums are rich centers of learning, woven into the \nfabric of our communities, big and small, urban and rural.\n  Libraries are not just places to read and borrow books or for parents \nto bring their children for story time. During the economic recession, \neven as libraries are being forced to do more with less, more and more \npeople are also turning to their public libraries for access to \ninformation and the Internet, job search and training programs, and \nbusiness development help.\n  As noted in the new report, ``Opportunity for All: How the American \nPublic Benefits from Internet Access at U.S. Libraries,'' nearly half \nof the 169 million visitors to public libraries over the past year used \na library computer to connect to the Internet during their visit. \nAccessing information on education, employment, and health were most \ncommonly cited for this computer and Internet usage.\n  Museums also provide 21st century learning opportunities, while \nconnecting communities to the culture, science, art, and events that \nmake up humankind's history. The estimated 17,500 museums in the United \nStates reflect the great diversity of our nation. They are large and \nsmall; urban and rural; local, national, and international; and include \naquariums, arboretums, historical societies, nature centers, zoos, \nplanetariums, art museums, and many other types of museums.\n  Museums contribute to the quality of life and the economic \ndevelopment of their home communities. They are key partners in \noffering hands-on, self directed learning for students of all ages. \nThey draw tourism, which contributes to local economies.\n  The Museum and Library Services Act represents our national \ncommitment to these institutions that are essential to building strong \nand vibrant communities. Through a relatively modest federal \ninvestment, this law helps build capacity to support and expand access \nto library and museum services at the state and local level.\n  In Rhode Island, library funding has supported improved online \nresources; literacy initiatives, including a summer reading program; \nand the provision of talking books to residents with visual impairments \nand disabilities. Through museum funding, the Museum of Art at the \nRhode Island School of Design, the Preservation Society of Newport, and \nthe Blithewold Mansion, Gardens, and Arboretum have all received \nsupport this past year.\n  The legislation we are introducing updates the law to reflect the \neducation and workforce development role libraries have been playing, \nincluding helping the out-of-work look for jobs, equipping business \nowners with data to make informed business decisions, and helping young \nand old alike gain critical digital literacy skills--the skills that \nhelp to discern fact from fiction when using the Internet.\n  Our bill will also help enhance training and professional development \nfor librarians and ensure the development of a diverse library \nworkforce, including by authorizing the Laura Bush 21st Century \nLibrarian program, which has been previously funded through annual \nappropriations.\n  It will help build state capacity to support museums by authorizing \nIMLS to support state assessments of museum services and the \ndevelopment and implementation of state plans to improve and enhance \nthose services. Our bill will also strengthen conservation and \npreservation efforts.\n  Additionally, it seeks to fully leverage the role of libraries and \nmuseums in supporting the learning, educational, and workforce \ndevelopment needs of Americans by requiring IMLS to improve \ncoordination and collaboration with other federal agencies that\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nalso have an interest in and responsibilities for the improvement of \nmuseum and libraries and information services.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in this endeavor and urge the \nSenate to take quick action to adopt this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the fact no one \nobjected to my unanimous consent request that I will be taking my 15 \nminutes from this side and 15 minutes from the other side and run them \ntogether. I appreciate that very much.\n  Let me say, before getting into this subject, something really great \nhappened today in a bipartisan nature. We have a new Governor who will \nbe coming in to Oklahoma, Mary Fallin, who used to serve over in the \nHouse. In fact, I flew her around in my airplane and helped her \ncampaign, and she won handily.\n  She made her first--she is still Governor-elect, but she made her \nfirst commitment today, and I was very excited about it. We have a guy \nin Oklahoma named Gary Ridley who has been the highway director and \nthen the secretary of transportation in the State now for years and \nyears and years. I was so proud that today she said she was going to \nreappoint him.\n  I can remember 8 years ago when Governor Brad Henry, who is a \nDemocrat, was elected. I called him up and I said: I only have one \nrequest, and that is you keep Gary Ridley because he's the best there \nis in the Nation, and I really believe that. Now, 8 years later, she \nhas done this.\n  I remember when I was critical of President Clinton in 1998 when he \ntook $8 billion out of the highway trust fund and put it into deficit \nreduction. It was something that was the wrong thing to do, and Gary \nRidley stood by my side for 8 years before we were able to correct \nthat. So we are going to have a great road program and hopefully we \nwill be able to get into some of these things. After all, that is what \nwe are supposed to be doing.\n  In a minute I am going to kind of identify myself as a different type \nof person than you have been hearing from on the floor. I happen to \nhave the distinction of being the only Republican who objected in our \nconference a couple weeks ago to the ban on earmarks, as they define \nit. I just had no problem doing that at all. But it is something that \nis not a fun thing to do.\n  Something happened tonight that went completely by everybody. It was \na total change in the Republican position, and it is a good change when \nSenator McCain and Senator Coburn both talked about authorization. I \nhave often said that authorization is the only discipline on \nappropriations, and I believe that, and that is true. So we have a \nsituation where I have been saying--not for months but for years--that \nif you will just define an earmark as an appropriations that has not \nbeen authorized, I am with you. I heard them tonight say that. \nUnfortunately, that is not what the bill that we are going to have \nbefore us says.\n  I would just like to do away with the whole word ``earmarks'' or else \ndefine it in such a way as I just described it. Now it seems as if \neverybody would be in agreement with it, and maybe that is going to be \nthe road we will be taking.\n  Let me, first of all, before I surprise a lot of people, give my \nconservative credentials. I have always been ranked as one of the most \nconservative or the most conservative Member of the U.S. Senate, the \nNational Journal's most conservative Senator for 2009. That is the last \none they gave out: ``The only Senator with a perfect score on 99 key \nvotes.'' I have also been voted the ``most outstanding U.S. Senator'' \nby Human Events.\n  So I am a conservative. I am a conservative but a conservative who \nloves the Constitution. I have also been waiting for a long time. I \nlove these guys. Certainly the author of this, Senator Coburn, is a \nbrother and I love him. And brothers do fight sometimes. This fight is \ngoing to be over with and we are going to have a happy ending.\n  I have been waiting for years for this Tea Party thing to happen, for \nconservatives, anti-establishment people to come in, and I just get \nvery excited when I see what we are looking at. Yet we have an \nadministration with a majority in both Houses that we have had\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\nnow for quite some time: spend, spend, spend. When they talk about \nGeorge W. Bush, look, it is this administration with the increase in \nthe debt to the amount it is now, which is a greater increase in debt \nthan we have had collectively with every President, every \nadministration from George Washington to George W. Bush.\n  All the time, they have been talking about earmarks that totally \ndistract people from the real problem. That is not the problem. I have \nbeen listening on the floor now for the last 2 years. Every night we go \nthrough the same thing. They talk about earmarks, earmarks, earmarks. \nWhat they do not do is pay attention to the fact that during that \ndiscussion this President, with his majority in both Houses, was able \nto give my 20 kids and grandkids a $3 trillion deficit in 1 year. It is \nmind-boggling that this could happen. But we hear the President say: \nSpend, spend, spend. And he has used the words quite often: We need to \ngive the people what they desire. It reminds me of the story of the guy \nwho went in the department store and there was a beautiful, young, \nvoluptuous saleslady who came up and said: Sir, what is your desire? He \nsaid: Well, my desire is to pick you up after work and go to a fine \nrestaurant, have dinner, and buy a bottle of champagne, go to my place, \nand make mad passionate love. But I need a pair of socks.\n  Now, what we are going to have to understand is, there is a \ndifference between desire and need. That is what I am here to try to \ndo. To think we could actually have said today--now, the bill does not \ndo this, but it was said that authorizing is kind of a lost art. \nSenator McCain said that. Frankly, I do not quite agree with that \nbecause we have an authorization committee in Armed Services of which \nhe is the ranking member, and I am the second ranking member, and it is \nsomething on which we have done a pretty good job. But in other areas \nwe have not. Keep in mind, authorizing is the only discipline that \nthere is to appropriating.\n  Now, I have a family picture I show you in the Chamber. These are my \n20 kids and grandkids. I have to tell the occupier of the chair that I \nwas so proud to have all of them at one table on Thanksgiving. How many \npeople are blessed that way? Not many. But this little guy here--where \nis Jase Rapert. Here he is down there on the picture, the football guy.\n  He came up to me one time--this is some time ago--and he said: PopI--\n``I'' is for ``Inhofe.'' So MomI and PopI. He said: PopI, why is it you \ndo things no one else will? I said: That's the reason, because no one \nelse will.\n  I am reminded of 9 years ago when everybody--I am talking about \nDemocrats and Republicans--all said global warming is coming. The world \nis coming to an end. It is manmade gases that cause global warming. I \nlooked into the science. At that time Republicans were in the majority. \nI was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that \nhas that jurisdiction. I looked at that and I found out they were \ncooking the science, that it was not true.\n  Then we had the McCain-Lieberman bill and all these things that would \npass a cap and trade which would constitute the largest tax increase in \nthe history of this country. We beat them one at a time. The last one \nwas Waxman-Markey. But, again, this has been something that has finally \nevolved, that that one, my voice in the wilderness 10 years ago, is now \nthe prevailing thought. That is why I said to my little grandson, Jase \nRapert, that I do it because no one else will.\n  So let me just say this. How much more fun it would be to come down \nhere and do the politically correct thing and say: yes, earmarks are \nbad, earmarks are bad, earmarks are bad. We are going to do away with \nearmarks, and let everyone applaud before they realize what it really \nis.\n  I hear the staffers right now telling their Members: You know, you \nhave the greatest opportunity. You can vote for this amendment to ban \nthese earmarks and you can make people think you are conservative, No. \n1. No. 2, you can make President Obama happy because he is publicly \nsupporting this. This is what he wants because this means, as has been \nsaid by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Harkin, and several others, if we \ndo not do it, that goes to the President. I want to explain how that \nworks in just a minute.\n  We could also be politically correct, so there would be a lot of them \nthinking: What an opportunity this is. People will think, if I vote for \nthis amendment, I am a conservative. Obviously, I can make our \nPresident happy. That will do me no harm, and I can be politically \ncorrect.\n  Well, it has been demagoging now for so many years. Let me define \nwhat Webster's Third New International Dictionary says about demagogy. \nThe definition of demagogy: ``Political leaders who seek to gain \npersonal or partisan advantage through specious, extravagant claims, \npromises and charges.'' That is what we have been listening to now for \nat least the last 2 years, on a regular basis.\n  The big problem I have with all the demagoging that has been going on \nevery night for the last 2 years is that people are just not paying \nattention to the real problem. The real problem is not earmarks. The \nreal problem is that during that 2-year period--when everyone is \nconcerned about a few dollars--we found out we have increased the debt \nmore than it has been increased in the history of this country, and we \nhave given my 20 kids and grandkids a $3 trillion deficit in just 2 \nyears. I thought that was not possible. I never believed that could \nhappen. But that is what has happened here. They have distracted \npeople. Get this thing behind us so we can start working on this and \nnot make people think we are doing something great for them when we \nreally are not. It would be nothing short of criminal to go through all \nthe trouble of electing great, new anti-establishment conservatives, \nonly to be politically correct and have them cede to Obama their \nconstitutional power of the purse. That is exactly what would happen.\n  I want these new people coming in to tackle the three issues to \nreally save America, in my opinion the deficit, the debt, and \nObamacare, and not be distracted by the bogus issue of earmarks. I say \n``bogus.'' It is kind of a strong word. Why is it bogus? It is bogus \nand unconstitutional, but the bogus part shows the definition of what \nwe are saying. The House of Representatives Republicans--not the \nDemocrats, the Republicans--took a moratorium, a 1-year moratorium \nbanning earmarks in that period of time. How did they define it? They \nsaid:\n\n       Resolved, that it is the policy of the Republican \n     Conference that no Member shall request a congressional \n     earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit, as \n     such terms are used in clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of \n     the House. . . .\n\n  What is clause 9 of rule XXI? It applies to every appropriation or \nauthorization. In other words, they have said: we will neither \nappropriate nor authorize for a whole year. Now, the Democrats are \ngoing to do it. The President is going to do it. But they say they are \nnot going to do it.\n  Of course, the authors of this amendment, they all agreed with and \npraised the House for doing this. But let's go ahead and see what the \nConstitution says, article I, section 9. Several people here have \ntalked about the Constitution. It is times like this that I miss Bob \nByrd. Senator Byrd, talking about the Constitution right now, would be \nreally outraged. It is so plain what we are supposed to be doing here. \nBut article 1, section 9 says:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in \n     consequence of appropriations made by law.\n\n  Law, that is us. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution. That is \nnot the President.\n  I would just say if you are looking at the Senate language, it says \nthe term ``congressionally directed spending'' means a provision \nprimarily at the request of a Senator providing expenditures, and so \nforth, to an entity targeted to a specific State or with any--\neverything is with or to an entity. In other words, they say--again, \nthey are talking about all appropriations, all authorizations. We are \nnot going to do that anymore. We are going to let the President do \nthat. That is what this whole thing is about.\n  I was so excited when I heard for the first time them agreeing with \nme. By the way, it is not appropriate for me to tell this group or to \nsay publicly what goes on inside a conference. In a Republican \nconference, I can say what I said, and I said to my colleagues when \nthey were trying to get us, and they\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\ndid, I went up in 2008 and I went ahead and voted for a ban because I \nwas told they would define it as an appropriation that has not been \nauthorized. Now, all of a sudden--they didn't do it then, and all of a \nsudden they are talking about doing it, and I think I know why and I \nwill tell you in a minute why I think it is.\n  So we are having this situation now where we are saying we are not \ngoing to authorize, we are not going to appropriate. There are two \nreasons to ban Senate spending by either definition. It cedes \nconstitutional authority to the President and also gives cover to big \nspenders.\n  Let's go back to that article I, section 9 chart. The Constitution \nrestricts spending only to the legislative branch and specifically \ndenies that honor to the President. We take an oath to uphold article \n1, section 9 of the Constitution. Now, maybe there is some doubt about \nthis. If you think there is some doubt, let's go back and see what the \nFounders of this country said. Let's see what the authors of the \nConstitution said. Let's look at James Madison. He said:\n\n       The power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people for obtaining redress of every grievance.\n\n  The two reasons he did, if you studied the Federalist Papers, they \nsaid they wanted Congress to do the spending because if they do it \nwrong--first of all, they know the needs of the people of their State \nor their--whatever the unit was at that time. If they do it wrong, they \ncan fire them. Look what happened on November 2. That is exactly what \nhappened. Alexander Hamilton said:\n\n       The legislature not only commands the purse but prescribes \n     the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen \n     should be regulated.\n\n  That is what we are supposed to be doing.\n  Mr. President, I have talked about Alexander Hamilton and James \nMadison. Probably the guy who was most knowledgeable on the \nConstitution was Justice Joseph Story, back in the early 1800s, when he \nactually said in his commentary:\n\n       It is highly proper that Congress should possess the power \n     to decide how and when any money should be applied. If it \n     were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded \n     power. Congress is made the guardian of the Treasury.\n\n  I say all this to impress upon any impartial patriot that the \nlegislative branch--which is us--has the power to spend money. How does \na ban on earmarks cede our authority to the President? This is \nsomething that is heavy lifting, but I think it is very important \npeople understand why and how this happened. This is how it works. This \nis the way things work here and have for many years. The Constitution \nis very clear.\n  The President submits a budget to the House and Senate--us. There is \nan overall budget, but within the budget he says how much is going to \nbe spent to defend America, for roads and highways, for water and \ninfrastructure, all these things. We have these top lines under which \nwe are operating. So let's take this as an example. I happen to be the \nsecond ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. In his budget \nlast year, he had, I think, $330 million set aside for a launching \nsystem called a box of rockets. It is a good program, something we \nneed. But with limited funding, we on the Armed Services Committee--and \nSenator McCain talked about this--have experts who look at our missile \ndefense system and say: How can we best defend America? The President \ndoesn't know this. They can say that comes from the Pentagon, but that \nis not so. That is the reality. Instead of this launching system for \n$330 million, we decide to spend that same amount of money and buy six \nnew, shiny FA-18 fighters or things that we knew we needed at this \ntime. It didn't cost any more money. We are taking that money he wanted \nto spend on something else and we are exercising our constitutional \nprerogative. If we substitute our appropriation for his budget item, it \nwould be an earmark by any definition. If we pass this, that means we \nhave to take whatever the President wants to spend on America, and we \nwould not do anything we wanted to. So we said six new FA-18s were what \nwe needed, and it didn't cost 1 cent more.\n  In other words, we would be letting the President do what James \nMadison wanted us to do. If you look at this in the Armed Services \nCommittee, the unmanned aerial vehicles, right now we have 36 of them \nflying around Southwest Asia over areas where there is combat, feeding \ninformation to our kids in the field there. We would not have unmanned \naerial vehicles if it weren't for earmarks. We took something the \nPresident wanted and put that same amount of money into these unmanned \naerial vehicles. Also, we would not have our improved armored vehicles \nand add-on armor. Why do you think we on the committee spent so much \ntime on Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world on that? We do it to \nfind out our needs. Then we know more than the President knows about \nthe needs.\n  We are doing what Hamilton, Madison, and Story wanted us to do. That \nis what we are supposed to do. I don't know how many of our young men \nand women in uniform would be dead today if it hadn't been for that. We \nwouldn't have Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. That was a \ncongressional earmark. We wouldn't have had $14.2 million for the \ndetection of landmines and suspected bombmakers and IEDs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That was my earmark on the Armed Services Committee. It \ndidn't cost another cent. We merely canceled an equal amount of money \nthat the President wanted to spend on something else and we exercised \nour Constitutional right. It didn't cost anything additional.\n  Eliminating earmarks wouldn't allow us to change anything in the \nObama budget and would allow President Obama to perform our \nconstitutional duties. As I said, constitutionally that is where we are \nand that money would be transferred, for all practical purposes, to \nPresident Obama. Second, it gives cover to big spenders. Under the \ncurrent definition, let's look at two of the four largest earmarks in \n2008. Using the Senate definition ``expenditures with or to an \nentity,'' the following qualified as earmarks. But rather than arguing \nas to whether they are earmarks, I will put them up to get a \nperspective. These are two of them in 2008. The TARP is one that I \nthink--I know people get upset when I say this, but 10, 15, 20 years \nfrom now, historians will say the most egregious vote ever cast by the \nSenate was on the $700 billion bailout. You know where that went--AIG, \nChrysler, and the General Motors bailout. That $700 billion was given \nto an unelected bureaucrat to do what he preferred.\n  Next was the PEPFAR bill, $50 billion. The author of this amendment, \nSenator Coburn, voted for both of these. I voted against them. This is \nsomething I wish all Members would do. This is called the Inhofe \nfactor. I know I am not as smart as a lot of guys around here. When I \nsee billions and trillions of dollars, I have to put it somehow into a \nperspective that I know what this costs my people in Oklahoma.\n  In 2009, $2 trillion in taxes was paid by individuals across the \ncountry, and $18 billion came from Oklahomans, which is about 1 percent \nof the Federal total. The average Oklahoma individual's tax return was \n$11,100 that year. Therefore, the average Oklahoma taxpayer is \nresponsible for providing the percentage shown here of the total \nFederal revenue. For every $10 million in spending, Oklahomans pay \nabout a nickel--not all the State but each taxpayer who files a tax \nreturn in Oklahoma. So that is what we have.\n  Put the next chart up. We see how that works in reality. If you take \nthe amount and use the same factor to those two bills, the TARP bill, \nthe $700 billion bailout, and the $50 billion PEPFAR bill, that is $750 \nbillion, and you apply that factor, each of my tax-paying families in \nOklahoma would have to have an obligation of $3,500 that year. That is \nwhat it would cost. Someone might argue that they didn't spend the \nwhole $700 billion, that some of that came back in. That is true. But \nthey authorized it and said you can do it. They were willing to have \neach taxpayer in Oklahoma spend $3,552 in taxes. The total amount of \nrequests that I had--in other words, earmarks--were some $80 million, \nand that was mostly in the area of defense. Using the same factor for \neach family in\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nOklahoma to get to the $80 million, because we are trying to defend \nAmerica, it would cost them 40 cents. Those are earmarks--40 cents \nversus $3,552 that the author of this amendment we are talking about \nwould have to spend. You know, I think at some point you have to look \nand see what this cost is.\n  If you go back to the chart No. 4 there, several things have been \nsaid today that were not true. I am not saying they intentionally \nmisrepresented the truth, but they did it inadvertently while being \ncaught up in this thing. The statement was made by a Senator--it might \nhave been the occupant of the chair. The statement was made that, as \nearmarks are going up, this is causing spending to go up. That is not \nwhat is happening. If you take the total amount of earmarks in 2010, \naccording to OMB, that would have been $11 billion. If you look and see \nwhat happened each year, it goes down in the amount. It started at $18 \nbillion 5 years ago and went down to $15 billion and then to $12 \nbillion and now to $11 billion. So it is coming down. That is why we \nhave to look at this in reality.\n  I notice my good friend, Senator DeMint, from South Carolina, has \nbeen active in this, and the last time I spoke on the floor I pointed \nout that Senator DeMint had all these different earmarks that he has \nbeen able to get for his State, and I don't know how you can talk about \neliminating earmarks and yet do that.\n  The platitudes that are used--it is interesting when you don't have \nthe facts on your side, you don't have logic on your side, but you have \na population who has been led to believe earmarks are bad--that means \nappropriations are bad, authorizations are bad unless they are done by \nthe President; those individuals say earmarks are a gateway drug that \nneeds to be eliminated in order to demonstrate that we are serious \nabout fiscal restraint. There is only one problem with that. It is not \ntrue.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, again, and the \nFederal spending watchdog groups such as Citizens Against Government \nWaste, earmarks have dramatically decreased over the last several \nyears. I mentioned 2005, $19 billion; 2008, $16 billion; 2009, $15 \nbillion; 2010, $11 billion. So while the total number of earmarks and \nall dollars of earmarks have declined, the Obama deficit has ballooned \nto $3 trillion in 2 years. So obviously they are not a gateway drug, \nbut it sounds good. But these are the platitudes.\n  When they say it is symptomatic of all this garbage, we are talking \nabout real dollars here. And we can't get down to doing something about \nreal spending until we quit demagoguing this issue.\n  I am going to give an easy way to correct this problem in just a \nminute, but if you need further proof, in 2009 the Senate performed a \nrare action of considering many appropriations bills individually \nrather than doing the irresponsible thing we are talking about doing \nnow and lumping them all into one bill to consider at the end of the \nyear. The value of considering these bills individually is that it \ngives Senators the opportunity to exercise some oversight in \ngovernment.\n  In 2009, Senators could offer amendments to both cut spending and \nstrike particular earmarks if they desired, and they did desire. \nBetween the months of July and November of 2009, there were 18 votes \nspecifically targeting earmarks. Now, they failed, but if they had \npassed, it wouldn't have saved one penny. Instead of putting the money \nback into the pockets of the American people by reducing spending or \nshrinking the deficit, these efforts to eliminate earmarks would have \nput the money into the hands of President Obama by allowing his \nadministration to spend the money as it saw fit. At the end of the day, \nnone of the money would have been saved. President Obama wins, the \nAmerican people lose.\n  In another case, Members offered an amendment to strike funding out \nof a program called Save America's Treasures, for specific art centers \nthroughout the United States, but the money was simply shifted to allow \nthe Obama administration to do it. The same thing happened with the \ntransportation projects. Several Members offered amendments to strike a \nvariety of transportation projects in many States, and they were \nunsuccessful. So what happened? That money went back to the bureaucracy \ncontrolled by President Obama. Not one of these actions saved a dime, \nbut it made President Obama happy because it went back to his coffers.\n  We have clearly demonstrated two points. First of all, spending is \nthe exclusive obligation of the Senate and, secondly, killing an \nearmark doesn't save a dime; it merely gives money to President Obama.\n  It reminds me of what I went through 10 years ago when I couldn't get \nanyone to understand how they were cooking the science and why we \nshould not pass a cap and trade. Everybody thought the world was coming \nto an end, and I was that one person. Granted, that was 10 years ago, \nbut now it is the prevailing thought here in Congress. In fact, the \nUnited Nations, which started the whole concept of global warming, is \nhaving their big annual party next week and not even one--none--of the \nmedia is going to show up. Hardly anyone is going to show up to the \nthing because people realize it was a phony issue. It was, in fact, the \ngreatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. I said it, and \neveryone got mad at me and even hated me. So I do not mind being the \nonly one, and I am the only one on this.\n  A couple of good things have happened, though. It has been mentioned \nby several of those who were the most adamant in opposition to \nearmarks. In the case of Rand Paul, from Kentucky, our new Senator--\nwhom I am so happy to have with us--has said he would argue for things \nfor the State of Kentucky. And Senator Mike Lee said:\n\n       I wouldn't say there's a mandate to stop spending for roads \n     or any other general purpose like that.\n\n  Another House Member, Michele Bachmann, said--and I think this has \nalready been stated by one of the other Senators:\n\n       I don't believe that building roads and bridges and \n     interchanges should be considered an earmark.\n\n  Great. I agree. That is my whole point. So we are seeing these people \nnow coming around and saying: Well, we do have a job to do.\n  Senator Chambliss said:\n\n       There are times when crises arise or issues come forth of \n     such importance to Georgia, such as the Port of Savannah, \n     that I reserve the right to ask Congress and the President to \n     approve funding.\n\n  Well, there it is. So I would say those individuals who are on the \nother side realize that is the wrong side. But let me say something \nelse. I am very proud of some of the talk shows. I am on quite a few \ntalk shows. And when you get a chance to talk, the way I am now, and \nexplain to people what the situation is--I am looking now at I think 12 \nmajor talk show hosts in America who now pretty much agree with what I \nam saying tonight: Mike Gallagher, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager, Scott \nHennen, Janet Parshall, Hugh Hewitt, Michael Savage, Crane Durham, Lars \nLarson, Jason Lewis, Rusty Humphries, Jerry Doyle, and quite a few \nothers. And it was not easy for them to say: Maybe Inhofe has a point, \nso let's look at this a little closer.\n  So let me just say there is a solution. And I have to give credit \nwhere credit is due. These are not my thoughts. This is what I did. We \nhave eight great Americans and the conservative groups they head up, \nand I am talking about Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste; Melanie Sloan, director of Citizens for \nResponsibility and Ethnics in Washington; Steve Ellis, Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense; Craig Holman, Public Citizen; Jim Walsh, Rich Gold, Manny \nRouvelas, and Dave Wenhold. Thanks to them, we can put this whole \nearmark issue to rest because they authored ``The 5 Principles of \nEarmark Reform.'' There they are, the five principles of earmark \nreform. These are all the conservatives who said we really need to do \nsomething about this and at the same time preserve our constitution. So \nI introduced, a couple of weeks ago, S. 3939, and what I did is I took \neverything they had and I put that into a bill. And there it is. So \ntake it a section at a time.\n  No. 1 of the five principles: To cut the cord between earmarks and \ncampaign contributions, Congress should limit earmarks directed to \ncampaign contributors--exactly what S. 3939 does.\n  Section 2:\n\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\n\n       No earmark beneficiary shall make contributions aggregating \n     more than $5,000.\n\n  The second principle: to eliminate any connection between legislation \nand campaign contributions. That is the second. The third principle: To \nincrease transparency, Congress should create a new database of all \ncongressional earmarks. And it goes on, and they elaborate and say this \nis all something you can find, but you can't get your hands on it. It \nis too complicated. So consequently we put in our bill, in section 4, \nthe following:\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House \n     shall post on a public Web site of their respective houses, a \n     link to the earmark database maintained by the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n\n  Every one of these things--and I could go through each and every \none--is answered in S. 3939. So if you really want to do something \nabout it, pass that bill and you will have solved the problem and you \nwill have kept our constitutional duties intact.\n  We did one more thing because it goes one more step. This is very \nimportant. There was an oversight, but they all agree with this now. \nThis goes a step further. It says that the administration--President \nObama, the bureaucracies--will have the same transparency as senatorial \nearmarks. So Senator McCain talked about lobbying these bureaucracies. \nSure, they are doing it, because if we don't do the spending or the \nappropriating and authorizing, then the President does it. So the \nbureaucracy is doing that. So we have a section in this bill that \nsubjects them to the same thing.\n\n  Do you remember when Sean Hannity came up with the 102 most egregious \nearmarks? This is just some of them. There were 102, and I read them \nall on the floor from this podium, and I did it to make sure people \nunderstood what he had found out. I said at the end of reading all of \nthese earmarks--look at some of these: $300,000 for helicopter \nequipment to detect radioactive rabbit droppings--that all 102 have \nsomething in common: not one of them was a congressional earmark. They \nwere all bureaucratic Obama earmarks. So that is the reason for that. \nAnd if you want reform, that is how to get it.\n  I know there will be some Members who will not be able to resist the \nfact that they can have a great opportunity with one vote. They can \nmake people think they are conservative and give President Obama what \nhe wants, and they can be politically correct. But, again, we have a \nsolution to the problem. That solution will come.\n  Mr. President, in that conference I mentioned about 30 minutes ago, I \nsaid that if you want to do something to do away with the earmark and \nall this, all you have to do is define an earmark as an appropriation \nthat has not been authorized. Authorizing committees are the discipline \nfor appropriations. A lot of our appropriating friends won't like this \nidea, but that would do it. We heard several of the Senators, including \nmy junior Senator, the author of this amendment, and Senator McCain, \nsaying this is good, we have done away with authorizing. We need to \nauthorize these things.\n  In the Armed Services Committee, we have experts in every field. One \nof the experts is a group of people who look at our missile defense \nsystem. Right now, we are in very serious problems in this country by \ntaking down the site in Poland that would stop the ground-based \ninterceptor site. That is something we should be doing. We need to have \nredundancy. We know we can hit a bullet with a bullet, and we should do \nthat. We have the experts who know how to do that.\n  So I would say we have an opportunity. We can reform this. We can \nsubject the bureaucracy to the same transparency to which we are \nsubjected. We should do away completely with terms such as ``earmarks'' \nas people are thinking of them in their minds and go to having them \nredefined as appropriations that have not been authorized. I know it is \na hard concept and one that not many people want to believe, but it is \nmuch easier to oversimplify it and say that all earmarks are bad. Well, \nif you define them properly, I agree they would all be bad. Anything \nthat is appropriated that is not authorized, in my opinion, is bad and \nshould be done away with.\n  So with that, this one voice in the wilderness, one conservative is \nsaying this is the true story. If you really do want to cede our \nconstitutional authority to President Obama, you can do it by passing \nthis amendment. This allows them to get the authority we have. And if \nyou really believe that is the thing to do, after looking at the \nConstitution and what Justice Joseph Story and Hamilton and Madison all \nsaid we are supposed to be doing here, let's seriously consider that \nand resolve this problem, put it behind us so we can quit distracting \nfrom the big spending going on today that has given us a $3 trillion \ndeficit in 2 years.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "29", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/29/senate-section/article/S8255-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
