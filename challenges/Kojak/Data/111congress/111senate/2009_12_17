Madam President, we are going to finish this health care \nbill before we leave for the holidays.\n  For nearly an entire year, we have reached out to the other side, \noffered Republicans a seat at the table, tried to negotiate in good \nfaith--nearly a whole year. Now we are closer than ever to fixing a \nbadly broken system and doing more to make sure every American can \nafford to live a healthier life than this country has done in decades.\n  The Republicans have made their point. Through obstruction manuals, \nadmissions that they believe stalling is good for electoral politics, \nand gambits like the one we saw yesterday; that is, forcing the full, \nhours-long reading of an amendment they did not like, and then \ncomplaining when that amendment they did not like was withdrawn, they \nhave made their point to the American people. They have made it \nperfectly clear they have no interest in cooperating or legislating.\n  But the families and businesses who are suffering, hurting, and dying \nevery single day have no time for these kinds of games. That is why we \nare going to finish health care whether the other side cooperates or \nnot.\n  But health care is not the only critical issue this body faces. It is \nnot the only critical issue to this country or before this body. Right \nnow we have to complete a bill that supports the fighting men and women \nof this country, whether they are in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Japan--\nall those many bases where tens of thousands of people are stationed. \nIt is as simple as that.\n  Here are some of the good things in the bill that is now before the \nSenate, the message from the House. It funds more than $100 billion for \noperations, maintenance, and military personnel requirements for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Part of that money will also support \npreparations to continue withdrawal from Iraq. There is more than $23 \nbillion for the equipment used by our servicemembers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to do their jobs and stay safe. There is more than $150 \nbillion to train our troops and prepare them for battle. There is more \nthan $30 billion for the health care of our servicemembers, their \nfamilies, and their children. It also gives our brave and valiant \ntroops a pay raise of 3.4 percent this year.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Yesterday, this bill passed the House \n395 to 34. More than 90 percent of Democrats voted for this bill. More \nthan 90 percent of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted \nfor this bill. That is because they know to our fighting men and \nwomen--these brave Americans half a world away, a lot of them--who wage \ntwo wars on our behalf, it is immaterial whether the leaders who will \ngive them all the resources they need to succeed are progressives or \nconservatives. Surely, our troops who are on deployment after \ndeployment after deployment spend more time counting the days until \nthey can see their loved ones again than they do counting the political \npoints scored by either side. They do not care most of the time, Madam \nPresident. They just do their jobs.\n  The House proved as much yesterday. The Senate should do the same \ntoday. We received this bill yesterday at 2 p.m. Are we going to wait \nuntil tomorrow to pass it? This simply is not right. Let's give our \ntroops what they need to succeed, and do it now. Then let's get back to \ngiving all Americans what they need to stay healthy.\n  These two bills--these two pieces of legislation--are about life and \ndeath. Our responsibility is too great to waste time playing political \ngames.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13344-6", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, Senators on both sides acknowledge \nthat the health care bill we are considering is among the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation any of us will ever consider--I \nthink, I would argue, the most significant piece of legislation \ncertainly in my time here. So it stands to reason we would devote \nsignificant time and attention to it.\n  Indeed, some would argue we should spend more time and attention on \nthis bill than most--if not every--previous bills we have considered.\n  The majority, obviously, disagrees. Why? Because this bill has become \na political nightmare--a literal political nightmare to them--as \nevidenced by more and more public opinion polls, including the Wall \nStreet Journal/NBC poll out this morning. They know Americans are \noverwhelmingly opposed to it, so they want to get it over with as \nquickly as possible.\n  Americans are already outraged at the fact that Democratic leaders \ntook their eyes off the ball, rushing the process on a partisan line \nthat makes the situation even worse.\n  Americans were told the purpose of reform was to reduce the cost of \nhealth care. Instead, Democratic leaders produced a $2.5 trillion, \n2,074-page monstrosity that vastly expands government, raises taxes, \nraises premiums, and wrecks Medicare. And they want to rush this bill \nthrough by Christmas? They want to rush this bill through by \nChristmas that does all of these destructive things. One of the most \nsignificant, far-reaching pieces of legislation in U.S. history, and \nthey want to rush it.\n\n  Here is the most outrageous part. At the end of this rush, they want \nus to vote on a bill that no one outside the majority leader's \nconference room has seen yet. No one has seen it. That is right. The \nfinal bill we vote on is not even the one we have had on the floor of \nthe Senate. It is the deal Democratic leaders have been trying to work \nout in private. That is what they intend to bring to the Senate floor \nand force a vote on before Christmas.\n  So this entire process is essentially a charade. But let's just \ncompare the process so far with previous legislation for a little \nperspective.\n  Here is a snapshot of what we have done and where we stand on this \nbill.\n  The majority leader intends to bring this debate to a close as early \nas this weekend--4 days from now--on this $2.5 trillion mistake. No \nAmerican who has not been invited into the majority leader's conference \nroom knows what will be in the bill.\n  The bill has been the pending business of the Senate since last \nNovember--less than 4 weeks ago--but we\n\n[[Page S13345]]\n\nhave actually only started the amendment process 2 weeks ago--just 2 \nweeks ago on the amendment process.\n  We have had 21 amendments and motions--less than 2 a day.\n  So let's look at how the Senate has dealt with previous legislation, \narguably of lesser consequence than this one.\n  No Child Left Behind in 2001: 21 session days over 7 weeks, 44 \nrollcall votes, 157 amendments offered.\n  The 9/11 Commission/Homeland Security Act in 2002: 19 session days \nover 7 weeks, 20 rollcall votes, 30 amendments offered.\n  The Energy bill in 2002: 21 session days over 8 weeks, 36 rollcall \nvotes, 158 amendments offered.\n  Now, Madam President, this is not an energy bill. This is an attempt \nby the majority to take over one-sixth of the U.S. economy--to vastly \nexpand the reach and role of government into the health care decisions \nof every single American--and they want it to be done after one \nsubstantive amendment--one large, substantive amendment. This is \nabsolutely inexcusable.\n  I think Senator Snowe put it best on Tuesday. This is what she had to \nsay Tuesday of this week. ``Given the enormity and complexity,'' \nSenator Snowe said, ``I don't see anything magical about the Christmas \ndeadline if this bill is going to become law in 2014.''\n  And I think Senator Snowe's comments on a lack of bipartisanship at \nthe outset of this debate are also right on point. Here is what Senator \nSnowe said in November of this year--late November:\n\n       I am truly disappointed we are commencing our historic \n     debate on one of the most significant and pressing domestic \n     issues of our time with a process that has forestalled our \n     ability to arrive at broader agreement on some of the most \n     crucial elements of health care reform. The bottom line is, \n     the most consequential health care legislation in the history \n     of our country and the reordering of $33 trillion in health \n     care spending over the coming decade shouldn't be determined \n     by one vote-margin strategies--surely--\n\n  Surely--\n\n     we can and must do better.\n\n  Well, Senator Snowe is entirely correct.\n  The only conceivable justification for rushing this bill is the \noverwhelming--overwhelming--opposition of the American people. \nDemocrats know the longer Americans see this bill, the less they like \nit.\n  Here is the latest from Pew; it came out just yesterday. A majority--\n58 percent--of those who have heard a lot about the bill oppose it, \nwhile only 32 percent favor it.\n  There is no justification for this blind rush, except a political \none, and that is not good enough for the American people, and that is \nnot justification for forcing the Senate to vote on a bill that none of \nus have seen.\n  Americans already oppose the bill. The process is just as bad. It is \ncompletely reckless and completely irresponsible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13345-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, Senators \nare permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the first hour \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the \nmajority controlling the second half.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee lead a colloquy including the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nSenator from Wyoming, myself, and the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  I was thinking as I listened to the Republican leader, I wonder if \nthe Senator noticed the comments of the Governor of California on \nMonday. Governor Schwarzenegger said on ``Good Morning America'' that \nhe supports the idea of overhauling health care, but: ``the last thing \nwe need,'' said Governor Schwarzenegger, ``is another $3 billion in \nspending when we already have a $20 million deficit.''\n  He was referring to one of the unintended consequences of this bill, \nwhich is big State costs for Medicaid being shifted to the States--\nunfunded mandates.\n  So here is Governor Schwarzenegger's advice, following up on the \ncomments of the leader: ``So I would say be very careful to the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  This is from the Governor of California:\n\n       Before you go to bed with all this, let's rethink it. There \n     is no rush from one second to the next. Let's take another \n     week or two. Let's come up with the right package.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator saw it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee who also understands \nthis issue as well as or better than anyone, having been a Governor and \nrecognizing the problems the Governors face.\n  If I could step back a second, Governor Schwarzenegger is a very \nastute observer of the political scene in California. May I point out \nto my colleagues, in this morning's Wall Street Journal: ``Democrats' \nBlues Grow Deeper in New Poll,'' and then: ``Support for Health \nOverhaul Wanes.''\n  There is some remarkable information concerning the mood and views of \nthe American people, following on a Washington Post ABC News poll out \nyesterday that says 51 percent of Americans say they oppose the \nproposed changes to the system; 44 percent approve.\n  Thanks to the efforts of so many people, including our leadership, we \nhave turned American public opinion because we have been informing them \nof the consequences of passage of this legislation.\n  Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       More Americans now believe it is better to keep the current \n     health system than to pass President Barack Obama's plan, \n     according to a new Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll. \n     Findings mark a shift from the fall when the overhaul enjoyed \n     the edge over the status quo. According to the poll, 44 \n     percent of Americans said it is better to pass no plan at all \n     compared with 41 percent who said it is better to pass the \n     plan.\n\n  What they are saying is: Don't do this government takeover; don't \nincrease taxes; don't increase spending; don't increase the costs. It \nis a remarkable shift, thanks to informing the American people.\n  Could I mention a couple of other points made in this poll in the \nWall Street Journal. In September, 45 percent of Americans said they \nwanted the plan passed; 39 percent wanted to ``keep the current \nsystem.'' In December, in polling out today, only 41 percent of the \nAmerican people want it passed, and 44 percent say keep the current \nsystem.\n  Then, of course, we have another interesting statistic:\n\n       Trust that the government will do what is right: 21 percent \n     say always or most of the time; 46 percent say only some of \n     the time; and 32 percent of the American people say almost \n     never.\n\n  Of course, the anger and disapproval of this health care plan right \nnow is the centerpiece of Americans' dissatisfaction of the way we do \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S13346]]\n\n  Let me say finally, because my colleagues wish to speak, we don't \nhave a bill. We don't have a bill. Here we have been debating all this \ntime and we do not have legislation. This was one of the bills we were \npresented with, but we know that significant changes are being made \nbehind closed doors. We don't have a CBO estimate of the cost, do we? \nWe understand they keep sending estimates over to CBO and it comes back \nand so they send them back, which probably is why last week the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the No. 2 ranking Democrat, said to me, I don't know \nwhat is in the bill either. I have the exact quote:\n\n       I would say to the Senator from Arizona that I am in the \n     dark almost as much as he is, and I am in the leadership.\n\n  That is an interesting commentary.\n  Of course, the issue of the protection of the rights of the unborn is \nstill unclear. That is a big issue for a lot of Americans. It is a big \nissue with me, and I know it is a big issue with my colleagues.\n  So here we are back, off of the bill itself, and apparently we are \ngoing to have some kind of vote on Christmas Eve or something such as \nthat.\n  What the American people are saying now is, when they say keep the \nstatus quo, they are saying: Stop. Go back to the beginning. Sit down \non a bipartisan basis and let's get this done, but let's get it done \nright.\n  Americans know that Medicare is going broke. Americans know that \ncosts are rising too quickly, but Americans want us to do this right \nand not in a partisan fashion and not with a bill that costs too much, \ntaxes too much, and deprives people of their benefits.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis comments. We have two physicians in the Senate, Dr. Coburn from \nOklahoma and Dr. Barrasso from Wyoming. I wonder if they would bear \nwith me for a minute or two to reflect on something the majority leader \nsaid--minority leader said--I hope he is the majority leader before too \nlong--and the Senator from Arizona.\n  The minority leader, the Republican leader, talked about a historic \nmistake. There has been a lot of talk around here about making history \non health care. The problem is there are many different kinds of \nhistory, as the Republican leader has pointed out. It seems our friends \non the other side are absolutely determined to pursue a political \nkamikaze mission toward a historic mistake which will be disastrous for \nthem in the elections of 2010, but much more important, for the \ncountry.\n  I did a little research on historic mistakes. We have made them \nbefore in the United States. Maybe we would be wise to take Governor \nSchwarzenegger's advice and slow down and stop and learn from our \nhistory rather than try to top our previous historic mistakes, such as \nthe Smoot-Hawley tariff. That sounded pretty good at the time in 1930 \nwhen the idea was to buy American, but most historians agree it was a \nmistake and it contributed to the Depression.\n  There was the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798. It sounded good at the \ntime. We were going to keep the foreigners in our midst--they were \nmostly French then--from saying bad things about the government, but it \noffended all of our traditions about free speech.\n  In 1969 Congress enacted the ``millionaires' tax,'' they called it, \nto try to catch 155 Americans who weren't paying any tax. That turned \nout to be a historic mistake, because last year it caught 28 million \nAmerican taxpayers until we had to rush to change it.\n  Just a couple more. There was the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. \nThat was well named, but it turned out to be a catastrophe, a \ncongressional catastrophe. The idea was to help seniors deal with \nillness-related financial losses, but seniors didn't like paying for \nit. They surrounded the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in \nChicago and now the leader of that group is a Member of Congress.\n  Then there was a luxury tax on boats over $100,000, another historic \nmistake, because it raised about half the taxes it was supposed to and \nit nearly sank the boating industry and it put 7,600 people out of \njobs.\n  I ask my friends from Oklahoma and Wyoming--it is going to be a lot \nharder for Congress, if they try to fix the health care system all at \nonce, to come back and repeal it than it was to repeal a boat tax. Do \nmy colleagues think we ought to take the time to avoid another historic \nmistake?\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, I would answer my colleague from Tennessee. As a \npracticing physician, what I see as the historic mistake is we are \ngoing to allow the Federal Government to decide what care you are going \nto get. We are going to compromise the loyalty of your physician so \nthat no longer is he or she going to be a 100-percent advocate for you, \nhe or she is going to be an advocate for the government and what the \ngovernment says. Because in this bill--even the one that is going to \ncome--there are three different programs that put government \nbureaucracy in charge of what you can and cannot have. It doesn't \nconsider your personal health, your past history, or your family \nhistory; they are going to say here is what you can and cannot do. That \nis called rationing. That is in the bill. That is coming. That is a \nhistoric mistake because it ruins the best health care system in the \nworld in the name of trying to fix a smaller problem in terms of \naccess, and it ignores the real problem.\n  The real problem is health care in this country costs too much. We \nall know this bill doesn't drive down costs, it increases costs. So \nyour premiums go up, your costs go up, your care is going to go down \nbecause the government is going to tell you what you have to have.\n  I think that is a historic mistake and we have not addressed that. I \nwonder what my colleague from Wyoming thinks.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I agree completely. As a practicing \nphysician taking care of people in Wyoming for 25 years, I have great \nconcerns about this bill, what we know for sure is in it, which is $500 \nbillion of cuts in Medicare to our patients who depend on Medicare, and \nthat is a system that we know is going broke. That is why there is a \nfront-page story in one of the Wyoming papers: ``Doctors Shortage Will \nWorsen.'' It is going to be harder on rural communities and others \naround the country if this goes through, and we know that because the \nfolks who have looked at the parts of the bill we have seen have said \nthat one-fifth of the hospitals in this country will be--if they are \nable to keep their doors open--operating at a significant loss 10 years \nfrom now. That is not the best future for health care in our country.\n  I had a telephone townhall meeting. People from all around the State \nof Wyoming were calling in and asking me questions, and they asked: \nWhat is in the bill? What is coming to the Senate?\n  We don't know yet. We haven't seen it.\n  They said: Well, when you find out, come home and let's have some \nmore townhall meetings so we can have some input.\n  That is what we ought to do as a Senate. We ought to know what is in \nthe bill and then let us go home and share it with our friends so they \nknow. Because right now what the American people have seen of this \nbill, the 2,000-page bill, they rightly believe this will increase the \ncost of their own personal care.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, if my colleague would yield, yesterday I \nasked the chairman of the Finance Committee to agree to a unanimous \nconsent request that, in fact, for at least 72 hours the American \npeople would get to see this bill; the Members of the Senate would get \nto see this bill; that there be a complete CBO score so we can have an \nunderstanding. He denied that request.\n  That comes back to transparency. The American people expect us to \nknow exactly what we are voting on. They expect us to have read what we \nare voting on. His explanation was: I can't guarantee that. It presumes \na certain level of perception on my part, an understanding of delving \ninto the minds of the Senators that they could actually understand. \nWhat does understand mean? That is the kind of gibberish the American \npeople absolutely don't want. They want us to know what we are voting \non when we get ready to vote on this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, isn't that a violation of the commitment \nthat was made that for 72 hours any legislation would be online, not \njust for us to see but for all Americans to see?\n  Could I ask the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader: Is it \nnot\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\nthe perception now that this bill is probably going to be pushed \nthrough? Through various parliamentary procedures, the majority will \ntry to force a final vote on this legislation, no matter what, before \nwe leave? Isn't that in contradiction to what the majority of the \nAmerican people are saying, that they want us to do nothing? Is this a \nresponsible way to govern, to have the Senate in round the clock, 24 \nhours, people on the floor, quorum calls and all this kind of stuff; \nand there would also be no amendments allowed at that time for us to at \nleast address some of the issues of this bill that begins cutting \nMedicare by $500 billion, increases taxes by $500 billion on January 1, \nand in 4 years begins spending $2.5 trillion? Is this a process the \nAmerican people are reacting to in a negative fashion, obviously, by \npolling data?\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle entitled ``Democrats' Blues Grow Deeper in New Poll'' and \n``Support for Health Overhaul Wanes'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 17, 2009]\n\n                Democrats' Blues Grow Deeper in New Poll\n\n                          (By Peter Wallsten)\n\n       Washington.--Less than a year after Inauguration Day, \n     support for the Democratic Party continues to slump, amid a \n     difficult economy and a wave of public discontent, according \n     to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.\n       The findings underscored how dramatically the political \n     landscape has changed during the Obama administration's first \n     year. In January, despite the recession and financial crisis, \n     voters expressed optimism about the future, the new president \n     enjoyed soaring approval ratings, and congressional leaders \n     promised to swiftly pass his ambitious agenda.\n       In December's survey, for the first time, less than half of \n     Americans approved of the job President Barack Obama was \n     doing, marking a steeper first-year fall for this president \n     than his recent predecessors.\n       Also for the first time this year, the electorate was split \n     when asked which party it wanted to see in charge after the \n     2010 elections. For months, a clear plurality favored \n     Democratic control.\n       The survey suggests that public discontent with Mr. Obama \n     and his party is being driven by an unusually grim view of \n     the country's status and future prospects.\n       A majority of Americans believe the U.S. is in decline. And \n     a plurality now say the U.S. will be surpassed by China in 20 \n     years as the top power.\n       Democrats' problems seem in part linked to their ambitious \n     health-care plan, billed as the signature achievement of Mr. \n     Obama's first year. Now, for the first time, more people said \n     they would prefer Congress did nothing on health care than \n     who wanted to see the overhaul enacted.\n       ``For Democrats, the red flags are flying at full mast,'' \n     said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey \n     with Republican pollster Bill Mclnturff. ``What we don't know \n     for certain is: Have we reached a bottoming-out point?''\n       The biggest worry for Democrats is that the findings could \n     set the stage for gains by Republican candidates in next \n     year's elections. Support from independents for the president \n     and his party continues to dwindle. In addition, voters \n     intending to back Republicans expressed far more interest in \n     the 2010 races than those planning to vote for Democrats, \n     illustrating how disappointment on the left over attempts by \n     party leaders to compromise on health care and other issues \n     is damping enthusiasm among core party voters.\n       But public displeasure with Democrats wasn't translating \n     directly into warmth for Republicans. Twenty-eight percent of \n     voters expressed positive feelings about the GOP--a number \n     that has remained constant through the Democrats' decline \n     over the summer and fall. Only 5% said their feelings toward \n     the Republicans were ``very positive.''\n       And in one arena, Afghanistan, Mr. Obama appeared to have \n     some success in winning support for his planned troop surge. \n     Liberals remain largely opposed to the strategy, but in fewer \n     numbers compared with before Mr. Obama made his case in a \n     speech at West Point. Overall, by 44% to 41%, a plurality \n     believe his strategy is the right approach.\n       Still, the survey paints a decidedly gloomy picture for \n     Democrats, who appear to be bearing the brunt of public \n     unease as unemployment has risen from 7.6% to 10% since Mr. \n     Obama took office. Just 35% of voters said they felt \n     positively about the Democratic Party, a 14-point slide since \n     February. Ten percent felt ``very positive.''\n       ``Overall, it's just a depressing time right now,'' said \n     Mike Ashmore, 23 years old, of Lansdale, Pa., an independent \n     who supported Mr. Obama last year but now complained about \n     the president's lack of action on jobs.\n       Julie Edwards, 52, an aircraft technician for Boeing Co. in \n     Mesa, Ariz., said she voted Democratic in the past two \n     elections but wasn't sure how she would vote next time. She \n     wondered why Wall Street firms were bailed out when average \n     Americans needed help. ``We can bail out Wall Street, but \n     everybody else has to suffer in spades for it,'' she said.\n       Democratic leaders, while bracing for losses next year, \n     have argued that unlike the 1994 elections, in which \n     Republicans gained 54 seats and took the House majority, \n     Democrats would survive 2010 in part because they are taking \n     steps to avoid that possibility. Republicans must gain 41 \n     seats to take control.\n       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Democrats \n     ``fully intend to be in the majority'' after November 2010, \n     and she was now shifting to ``campaign mode'' to help \n     candidates. Party officials are leaning on a number of \n     longtime colleagues to fight for their seats rather than \n     retire.\n       The Journal/NBC survey found Ms. Pelosi's presence on the \n     campaign trail could do more harm than good. Fifty-two \n     percent said they would be less likely to vote for a \n     candidate who agreed with the speaker almost all the time, \n     compared with 42% who felt that way about candidates siding \n     with Republican leaders.\n       For Mr. Obama, who has relied on his personal popularity to \n     retain the clout he needs to enact his legislative agenda, \n     the survey pointed to troubling signs.\n       A majority for the first time disapproved of his handling \n     of the economy. And the public's personal affection for the \n     president, a consistent strong suit, has begun to fray. Fifty \n     percent now feel positive about him, six points lower than in \n     October and an 18-point drop since his early weeks in office.\n       Democrats' troubles can be attributed in part to changing \n     feelings among some core supporters. A third of voters 34 and \n     under, a group that turned out heavily for Democrats last \n     year, feel negative toward the Democratic Party. And just 38% \n     of Hispanics feel positive, down sharply from 60% in \n     February.\n       The survey, which was conducted Dec. 11-14, has a margin of \n     error of 3.1 percentage points.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 17, 2009]\n\n                   Support for Health Overhaul Wanes\n\n                            (By Janet Adamy)\n\n       The public is turning against an overhaul of the health-\n     care system, complicating Democrats' effort to pass a \n     sweeping bill in the Senate.\n       More Americans now believe it is better to keep the current \n     health system than to pass President Barack Obama's plan, \n     according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The \n     findings mark a shift from the fall, when the overhaul \n     enjoyed a slight edge over the status quo. They could make it \n     more difficult to get wavering lawmakers on board as the \n     Senate prepares to vote on the measure as soon as next week. \n     Some Democrats expect support will rebound if they can pass a \n     bill quickly and start selling it.\n       According to the poll, 44% of Americans said it is better \n     to pass no plan at all, compared with 41% of Americans who \n     said it's better to pass the plan. In early October, 45% of \n     respondents preferred passing a bill, while 39% preferred \n     passing no bill. Uninsured people were among those who have \n     grown less supportive of the plan.\n       In seeking support for his top domestic priority, Mr. Obama \n     has said the status quo wasn't acceptable because insurance \n     premiums were rising sharply and government insurance \n     programs were headed toward insolvency. Republicans have \n     argued that many Americans could be worse off, particularly \n     the elderly, because the legislation contained hundreds of \n     billions of dollars in cuts to health-care providers through \n     Medicare. The legislation would extend health-insurance \n     coverage to at least 30 million more Americans by widening \n     the Medicaid federal-state insurance program for the poor and \n     providing subsidies to lower earners to help them buy \n     coverage.\n       The idea of creating a government-run health-insurance \n     option still enjoys considerable support. Democrats dropped \n     the idea from the Senate version of the health bill. When \n     asked what they thought of removing the public option, 45% of \n     respondents said that wasn't acceptable, while 42% called it \n     acceptable.\n       Respondents also favored letting people buy into Medicare \n     starting at age 55, another idea Democrats abandoned to win \n     the support of centrists needed to pass the bill in the \n     Senate.\n       Democrats ``clearly have irritated their own base in a way \n     that has dropped their enthusiasm for their own plan,'' said \n     Bill Mclnturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the Wall \n     Street Journal/NBC News poll with Democratic pollster Peter \n     Hart.\n       In September, 81% of liberal Democrats thought the health \n     plan was a good idea, and 6% thought it was a bad idea. In \n     the most recent survey, 66% of liberal Democrats called it a \n     good idea, while 13% called it a bad idea. House Speaker \n     Nancy Pelosi suggested the decline in support for the health \n     legislation was due to ``mischaracterization'' by opponents. \n     She predicted views would turn around when the House and \n     Senate coalesced around a single bill and the president began \n     selling it to the public. ``It's very hard to merchandise \n     health care until you have a bill,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from Arizona, with \nreference to the issue of the process, it\n\n[[Page S13348]]\n\nhas been a bit of a charade--in fact, a whole charade. We have been out \nhere for 2 weeks on the amendment process. We have had 21 votes, many \nof them have been side-by-sides, in order to cover the majority against \nthe potential downside of voting to cut Medicare and voting to raise \ntaxes.\n  But there is no serious effort to engage in any kind of genuine \namendment process, such as the Senator from Arizona and I have been \ninvolved in here for quite a while. Then the bill, which we are \nactually only allowed to have about two votes a day on, is not the real \nbill. The real bill--we know the core of it, but there are a lot of \nthings around the edges being slipped in and slipped out, and they want \nto jam the public before Christmas, as the Senator from Arizona \nindicated.\n  How arrogant is that? They think: We know better than you, we know \nbetter than the Republicans, and we know better than the public. Why \ndon't all of you--the Republicans and the public--sit down and shut up \nand leave it to us and we will take care of it before Christmas.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I say to the Republican leader and the Senator from \nKentucky, I believe there is another bit of history being made. This \nprocess is historic in its arrogance. This isn't very hard to \nunderstand. The proposal is to take 17 percent of our economy, \naffecting 300 million Americans, and nothing could be more personal, as \nthe Republican leader has said, than our health care.\n  But now we don't have the bill. We do not have the bill. It is being \nwritten in secret in another room. If there is any part of this debate \nthat went through to every single household in America, I believe it \nwas when the Finance Committee voted down a motion--the Democrats voted \ndown a motion that the bill should be on the Web for 72 hours so that \nthe American people could see the text, know what it costs, and know \nhow it affects them.\n  Eight Democratic Senators wrote the Democratic leader and said they \nwant to insist that they know what the text is, and that they have the \nofficial score from the Congressional Budget Office, and that they have \nit for 72 hours before we move to vote.\n  We don't have the bill. We don't have the official score from the \nCBO. Seventy-two hours is three more days, and even though eight \nDemocratic Senators and all the Republican Senators said we want to \nknow what it costs, know what it is, and how it affects us, they want \nto run it through before Christmas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I mention to my colleague that maybe the reason why \nthey don't want it to be online for 72 hours is because when they \nexamined what we have--on page 324 in this bill is an $8 billion tax on \nindividuals who have nongovernment approved plans. On page 348 is a $28 \nbillion tax on businesses that cannot afford to offer insurance to \ntheir employees. On page 1979: Raises an almost $150 billion tax on \nmany middle-class workers using so-called Cadillac health insurance \nplans. Page 1997: Will cost families and individuals an additional $5 \nbillion by prohibiting the use of savings set aside for health care \nexpenses through health savings accounts. Page 2010: Will make the cost \nof lifesaving medicine more expensive by taxing pharmaceutical research \nfirms an additional $22 billion. The list goes on and on, including on \npage 2040: Increasing Medicare payroll taxes by $53.8 billion.\n  That may be a reason why it is going to be difficult for them to win \npassage of this after 72 hours of examining this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It makes this bill, in addition to all of the other \nproblems, a job killer. With unemployment at 10 percent, there is a big \ntax increase on a variety of different Americans, as Senator McCain \npointed out, in addition to all of its other problems--substantive \nproblems, process problems. It is a job killer in the middle of a very \ndifficult recession.\n  Mr. COBURN. I say to my colleagues that one of the things President \nObama said he wanted to have was transparency. There has been no \ntransparency in the process. That is why at least if there is not going \nto be transparency in the process, we ought to at least have it \ntransparent to the American people for 72 hours. This is a quote from \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee:\n\n       I think it is impossible to certify that any Senator will \n     fully understand.\n\n  We are going to have a 2,000-plus page bill, and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee says he thinks it is going to be impossible to \ncertify that any Senator will fully understand this bill. That is the \nbest reason I know not to pass this bill, because if we don't \nunderstand it, you can bet the American people aren't going to \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. When more Americans begin to understand it, they don't \nwant it. That is thanks to the efforts made all over this country to \neducate the American people about what the impact of the bill will be.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Following along what the Senators are saying, that is \nwhy the support of the American people for the bill is at an all-time \nlow. It is at the lowest level of support ever. According to this NBC \npoll, fewer than one out of three Americans support this bill. They \ndon't know all that is in it, but they don't like what they see so far, \nbecause they believe, in overwhelming numbers, that the cost of their \nown care will go up, that this will add to the deficit, it will hurt \nthe economy, and their health care would actually be better if we pass \nnothing.\n  So why would the American people support a bill that is going to cost \nthem more personally and when their health care will get worse? That is \nnot the value the American people have ever wanted.\n  That is what I hear from patients at home, and it is what I hear on \ntelephone town meetings. That is what we are hearing in all of our \nStates. This is what the American people continue to say: Do not pass \nthis bill.\n  As our leader said, we do need health care reform, and Dr. Coburn \ncertainly knows that. But it is not this reform that we need.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We come to the floor every day and point out the \nproblems with the bill. We don't have a bill now, we can't read it, and \nwe don't know how much it costs or how much it affects the American \npeople. It raises taxes and premiums. It will increase the debt, \nbecause it doesn't include things such as the physicians Medicare \nreimbursement. It cuts Medicare by $1 trillion over 10 years once it is \nfully implemented.\n  We point out what we think should be done. My colleagues have talked \nabout it many times. Instead of wheeling in another 2,000-page bill, we \nshould focus on the goal of reducing costs, and we should take several \nsteps toward doing that. The Senator from Arizona talks about one of \nthose things, which is reducing the number of junk lawsuits against \ndoctors. I don't think that is in the bill, unless it is secretly being \nadded in the back room today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I don't think that is being added today. Again, I \nalso point out that Americans are now against passage of this \nlegislation. But in that polling data, it is very interesting, also, \nthe majority of seniors, by much larger numbers--the actual \nbeneficiaries of Medicare--are turning against it, and the intensity of \nAmericans against it--which is harder to gauge in a poll--is \nincredible.\n  If the responses that our efforts are getting are anything close to \nindicative of the mood of the American people, and the intensity of it, \nit is probably as great as I have ever seen in the years that I have \nhad the privilege of serving in the Congress of the United States.\n  This polling data says more Americans now believe it is better to \nkeep the current health system than to pass President Obama's plan. \nThat is a message being sent, and the intensity is higher than any I \nhave ever observed in my years of service. I thank them for that.\n  There is a chance that we can stop this, and we start in January. We \nwould be willing to come back and sit down and negotiate, with the C-\nSPAN cameras on--as the President said or committed he would do as a \ncandidate. We would sit down together here, at the White House, or \nanywhere, and we can fix this system that we all know needs fixing.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma said, it is the cost that has to be \naddressed, not the quality.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to bring up an example. We are going to see this \ntime and time again if the bill goes through. We had the U.S. \nPreventive Health Task Force put out a recommendation on breast cancer \nscreening through\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\nmammography on the basis of cost. They said it is not cost effective to \nscreen women under 50 with mammograms, because you have to screen 1,900 \nbefore you find 1 breast cancer. On cost, they are right; but over 50, \nyou have to screen 1,470.\n\n  So what we had was a decision made on cost, not on quality, not on \npatients, but based on cost. We fixed that as part of an amendment to \nthis bill. We actually fixed that. There are three different agencies \nwithin this bill that are going to do the same thing. Every time they \nmake a ruling based on cost, not on clinical outcomes and what is best \nfor patients, are we going to fix it? No. We are transferring the care \nof the American patient to three bureaucracies within the Federal \nGovernment, and they are going to decide what you have to do. If you \nthink about it, this week the wife of a Member of this body was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. She was diagnosed through a mammogram. \nUnder that task force's recommendation, she would not have gotten that \nmammogram.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, would that aspect of \nthis bill come to light if it hadn't been for the recommendation that \nwas made by another similarly acting policymaking body? In other words, \nthat is what triggered the investigation of what was in this bill, \nwhich would have had exactly the same effect. So if we hadn't had that \ninformation of a recommendation by another government policymaking \nbureaucracy, we would not have known about this until the bill would \nhave taken effect.\n  Mr. COBURN. So there is no transparency. What we do know is that we \nare going to have three organizations, the Medicare Advisory \nCommission, the Cost Comparative Effectiveness Panel, and the U.S. \nPreventive Health Task Force that will tell everybody in America what \nthey are going to receive.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This example wouldn't have been known if it hadn't been \nfor the actions of the bureaucracy. Doesn't that bring into question \nwhat else is buried in this 2,000-page piece of legislation?\n  Mr. COBURN. What are the unintended consequences of this that they \ndon't know? What we do know is there are 70 new Government programs \nthat will require over 20,000 new Federal employees, and there are \n1,690 different times when the Secretary of HHS will write rules and \nregulations about your health care in America--the Secretary, not your \ndoctor; your doctor isn't going to write the regulations. The Secretary \nof HHS is going to write the rules.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me point out again that we don't know what the CBO \nestimate is, because we know the majority leader keeps bouncing \nproposals back and forth to CBO. That is why we haven't had CBO \ninformation now for many days. But there is the Commission for Medicare \nand Medicaid, which clearly points out that this legislation would \nincrease taxes dramatically, increase costs dramatically, decrease \ncare, and it would have the effect of forcing people not only out of \nthe system, but even if they are in the Medicare system, they would not \nhave physicians to provide the care, because more and more physicians \nwould fail to treat Medicare patients.\n  Mr. COBURN. So we go back to the 72 hours. We are going to get a new \nbill, but we will not have the opportunity to amend it. We are not \ngoing to be able to read it and study it, nor are the American people. \nWhat do you think the outcome of that will be?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think we know what the outcome will be. We will either \nbe able to reflect the feelings and intense feelings of the majority of \nthe American people about this legislation and say let's go back to \nsquare one and all commit to a bipartisan approach to this issue or we \nwill see jammed through on Christmas Eve legislation that will have the \nmost far-reaching effects and devastating effects, I think, not only on \nour ability to provide much-needed medical care to all of our citizens, \nbut also an impact that would be devastating on the debt and deficit, \nupon which we have laid an unconscionable burden already.\n  We have two choices--to go back to the beginning and enact many \nreforms we can agree on--and there are many we could agree on \nimmediately on a bipartisan basis; as the Senator from Tennessee \npointed out, there has never been a fundamental reform made in modern \nhistory that was not bipartisan--or we are going to see jammed through, \nover the objections of a majority of Americans, legislation that they \nhave never seen, read, or understand.\n  That is the choice we have. That is what it is boiling down to. I \nthink that, frankly, the American people should be heard, not a \nmajority over on the other side.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The American people are saying: Don't cut my Medicare, \ndon't raise my taxes, don't make things worse than they are right now, \nand this bill cuts Medicare, raises taxes, and for people depending on \na health care system in this country this makes things worse.\n  Mr. McCAIN. By the way, could I mention, if you live long enough, all \nthings can happen. I now find myself in complete agreement with Dr. \nHoward Dean, who says we should stop this bill in its tracks; we should \ngo back to the beginning and have an overall bipartisan agreement. Dr. \nDean, I am with you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It has been an \nextraordinary legislative process with a good bit of the calendar year \n2009 taken up with very intensive work to try to pass health care \nreform. At the moment, there is still some doubt as to what will happen \nwith the bill. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet submitted a \nreport on the so-called managers' package.\n  There are still some concerns being expressed by some Senators. I can \nunderstand the frustration that some have had as we have moved away \nfrom a public option. I have been an advocate of a robust public option \nand think it ought to be part of the legislation.\n  The public option is what it says. It is an option. There have been \nefforts made to demagog the issue by saying it is a takeover by the \nFederal Government. It is not. The private insurance industry remains \nin the field, and this is one option.\n  As President Obama has put it, it is an option to try to keep the \nprivate insurance companies honest. We have seen, in the past several \nmonths, very large increases in premiums for small business. The \nreports have been that those increases in premiums have come from Wall \nStreet pressure on the insurance companies to try to increase their \nprofits before there is legislation. The public option would be a \nforceful factor dealing there.\n  When the objections were raised to the public option and in an effort \nto find 60 votes--it is difficult when you have no help at all from the \nRepublican side of the aisle, illustrated by the performance just put \non with their prepared colloquy--it is not easy to find everyone in \nagreement. Then there was an effort to move to expand Medicare. I think \nthat is a fallback position that would have been very helpful.\n  There are some who are contending that people who are disappointed \nwith the lack of a public option and disappointed from the retreat of \nexpanding Medicare say we ought to start over and begin again. I can \nunderstand that frustration.\n  My own view, after thinking it through very carefully, is we ought to \nproceed and do as much as we can this year, realizing that some of the \ntough legislative achievements take a period of time to accomplish. But \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1957 was necessary, although it did not go as \nfar as people would have liked then, to get the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. Again, it did not go as far as people would have liked, but we \ndid find the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We have to find times when we \nhave to build incrementally on these matters.\n  I have been in the Senate following the elections of 1980, and I have \nseen matters take a very substantial period of time. While it is not on \nthe subject, we were trying to provide more than 100,000 jobs in \nPennsylvania by deepening the channel. The authorization\n\n[[Page S13350]]\n\ncame in 1983. It took until 1992 to get the Corps of Engineers to agree \non funding. Now it has $77 million. We are still in court, but it is \ngoing to move forward. I do not expect health care legislation to take \nthat kind of a long term, but it is a matter which does take some time.\n  It is my hope we will yet improve this bill. It is my hope that when \nthe bill goes to conference, we will find a way, perhaps, even to bring \nback the public option in a refined sense. The public option is in the \nHouse bill.\n  One Republican Senator has stated opposition on the ground that there \nhas not been time enough to review the bill. It is complicated. I think \nthere has been time enough to review the bill. But I respect the view \nof the Senator on the other side of the aisle. When the bill goes to \nconference, that Senator will have an opportunity to review the bill \nfurther. That Senator has shown some inclination to support the bill, \nhaving voted it out of the Finance Committee.\n  Another Republican Senator has commented that the bill has been very \ngreatly improved, not sufficiently for the taste of that Senator, but \nperhaps we will find a way to improve the bill. We still do have a \nbicameral legislature. We do have the House of Representatives which \nhas the public option.\n  Comments were made about the fall of the expansion of Medicare on the \nground it was considered in too brief a period of time, not enough time \nto digest it, not enough time to think through. We will have, in the \nmonth of January, some time to consider that further, and in conference \nwe may well find we are able to improve the bill. We cannot get to \nconference unless we pass the bill out of the Senate.\n  I was asked yesterday how will I respond to my constituents if we \nhave the bill which has had so much taken from it. I said: A more \nrelevant question or an equally relevant question is how will I respond \nto my 12 million constituents in Pennsylvania if we go home with \nnothing. If we have 80 percent accomplished, then that is a starting \nachievement.\n  It may well be it will take the campaign in 2010. If this Congress \nwill not pass a bill with a robust public option, it could well be a \ncampaign issue.\n  I believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may well be \nmisreading the American people. I believe the American people do want \nhealth reform. It does take time for the American people to understand \nthe ramifications of it. But this may well be a campaign issue in 2010. \nThe 112th Congress may have a different view as to how we ought to \nproceed.\n  During the month of August, when I was making the rounds of town \nmeetings in Pennsylvania, in accordance with my habit to cover almost \nevery county almost every year, when I got to the first town meeting, \nthe second Tuesday in August, the first week we were in recess, I found \ninstead of the customary 85 or 100 people, more than 1,000 people and \n3 national television sound trucks--CNN, MSNBC, and FOX. There were a \nlot of vituperative statements. One man approached me apoplectic and \nsaid the Lord was going to stand before me. I think he got mixed up. I \nthink he meant to say I was going to stand before the Lord. Senators \nare reputed to have power but not quite that much power. I think the \npublic tenor is considerably more favorable to health care insurance \ntoday than it was then. After the 2010 election, it may be \nsubstantially more favorable.\n\n  We have to move ahead with building blocks, and we do have a chance \nto improve the bill in conference.\n  I point to the provisions of the bill as to what we have. We have \nvery significant insurance reforms. We have eliminating discrimination \nbased on preexisting conditions. We have new health insurance \nexchanges. We have an elimination of a cap. We cover many of the \nuninsured, expanding to some 33 million additional people. We have \nsubstantial more small business assistance, preventive care, increased \nhealth workforce. We have improvements in the health delivery system. \nWe have fiscal responsibility that this bill will not add to the \ndeficit but will, in fact, reduce the deficit in the first decade by \nsome $120 billion and in the second decade by some $650 billion.\n  We have a provision I have pressed in earlier legislation, S. 914, to \nprovide for transformational medicine.\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHealth and Human Services, I took the lead, with the concurrence of \nSenator Harkin, who was then in the minority, to increase NIH funding \nfrom $12 billion to $30 billion and then in the stimulus package to add \n$10 billion more. There has been a gap on what we call transformational \nmedicine, going from the so-called bench in the laboratory to the \nbedside. While I have not seen the final version of the managers' \npacket, I am informed that provision will be a part of the bill.\n  We have very important measures for preventive care, for annual \nexams, which will cut off many chronic illnesses which are so \ndebilitating and so expensive.\n  I have pressed an amendment, which is pending, to have mandatory jail \nsentences for at least 6 months for someone convicted of $100,000 or \nmore of Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Jail sentences are a real \ndeterrent. The experience I had as Philadelphia's DA showed me that \nwhen you have a fine, that is added onto the cost of doing business and \nis passed on to the consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement of \nthe provisions which I briefly summarized which are very favorable in \nthis bill and a statement of testimony at a Criminal Justice \nSubcommittee to show the value of deterrence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n\n                       General Insurance Reforms\n\n       Insurance companies will be barred from discriminating \n     based on pre-existing conditions, health status, and gender.\n       New health insurance Exchanges will make coverage \n     affordable and accessible for individuals and small \n     businesses.\n\n\n                               Uninsured\n\n       With a reported 47 million people without health insurance \n     the status quo is not acceptable. Additionally, there are \n     millions more Americans who are underinsured, with health \n     insurance that is inadequate to cover their needs.\n       In 2007, 1,206,115 Pennsylvanians under age 65 were \n     uninsured for the entire year, which is 11.3 percent of the \n     under 65 population.\n       The analysis found that the legislation would extend \n     coverage to 33 million more Americans, bringing the \n     percentage of Americans with health insurance to 93%.\n       The bill covers 10% more Americans with only a 0.7 percent \n     increase in spending--a change of only 0.1% of GDP in 2019.\n\n\n                       Small Business Assistance\n\n       In the current health insurance market small business are \n     at a distinct disadvantage in providing health insurance to \n     their employees. In a recent study it was found that 58 \n     percent of small employers do not offer health insurance, \n     with nearly 50 percent stating that they can't afford it.\n       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act address \n     health insurance problems facing small businesses by \n     providing more health plan choices, fairness in the \n     marketplace and improving affordability with tax credits.\n\n\n                           Preventative Care\n\n       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will \n     eliminate co-pays and deductibles for recommended preventive \n     care, provide individuals with the information they need to \n     make healthy decisions, improve education on disease \n     prevention and public health, and invest in a national \n     prevention and public health strategy.\n\n\n                       Increase Health Workforce\n\n       Currently, 65 million Americans live in communities where \n     they cannot easily access a primary care provider, and an \n     additional 16,500 practitioners are required to meet their \n     needs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will \n     address shortages in primary care and other areas of practice \n     by making necessary investments in our nation's health care \n     workforce.\n\n\n               Improvements in the Health Delivery System\n\n       The legislation we are considering will establish an \n     Independent Medicare Advisory Board to present Congress with \n     proposals to reduce cost growth and improve quality for \n     Medicare beneficiaries. In years when Medicare costs are \n     projected to be unsustainable, Board proposals will take \n     effect unless an alternative is adopted by Congress. This \n     type of reform is necessary to ensure the financial future of \n     Medicare.\n       Preventable hospital readmissions diminish quality and \n     efficiency in the health care system. Nearly 20 percent of \n     Medicare patients who are discharged from the hospital are \n     readmitted with 30 days. The Medicare Payment Advisory \n     Commission (MedPAC) estimates that Medicare spent $12 billion \n     on potentially preventable hospital readmissions in 2005, \n     which would be more than $15 billion today.\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\n       The bill also begins the payment system reform of bundling \n     Medicare provider payments as a lump sum fee--instead of \n     paying a fee for each service--encourages care coordination \n     and streamlining. It removes the incentive to generate \n     additional services for added reimbursement.\n\n\n                         Fiscal Responsibility\n\n       The legislation is fully paid for and reduces the deficit \n     in the next ten years and beyond.\n       The revenue provisions in the bill focus on paying for \n     reform within the health care system.\n\n\n                          The Cost of Inaction\n\n       In 2000, family health insurance purchased through an \n     employer cost $6,438 and consumed 13 percent of median family \n     income. In 2008, the same family health insurance cost \n     $12,680, a 97 percent increase over the 2000 cost, consuming \n     approximately 21 percent of median family income. In 2016, \n     the same insurance is projected to cost $24,291, nearly \n     double the 2008 cost, which will consume 45 percent of \n     projected median family income.\n                                  ____\n\n       Let's kind of go back to (inaudible). Can you--each one of \n     you, starting with Mr. Perkins, talk about kind of what's \n     the--the impact of criminal prosecutions and prison time \n     versus civil actions and fines.\n       KEVIN PERKINS, Assistant Director, FBI: Yes, Senator. The--\n     it's really a combination of both. We, obviously, are very \n     successful in the health care fraud side, where we have civil \n     remedies that we utilize each day in our investigations \n     there. But again, I'm a--I'm a very strong proponent of \n     criminal prosecutions that involve serious jail sentences for \n     white-collar criminals. That is a huge deterrent.\n       I've seen it over the years, and I--I know--I know that, \n     from my own personal experience, going and interviewing \n     individuals who are--who--white-collar criminals who have \n     been--or are doing jail time, going and talking to them on \n     various occasions--it's--it's a huge deterrent. It's--it's \n     something that we have to have, going forward, to make this \n     work.\n       KAUFMAN: Mr. Khuzami.\n       ROBERT KHUZAMI, Director, Securities and Exchange \n     Commissions Division of Enforcement: (Inaudible), yes, but \n     there's--there's no deterrent that's a substitute for jail \n     time. I miss the cooperation tools, and I--I miss the \n     sentencing guidelines even more. But there is a very \n     significant role for the civil regulators as well, simply \n     because: Because of the standard of proof of beyond a \n     reasonable doubt and the necessity of convincing 12 jurors of \n     the--of the guilt of someone, the criminal authorities, by \n     definition, cannot and should not capture the whole field of \n     wrongdoing.\n       And so what you'll often see is criminal authorities \n     focused on the core wrongdoers, and we may cast a wider net--\n     because we have a lower standard of proof--cast a wider net \n     amongst those involved in the wrongdoing as well. And in \n     particular, there's lots of wrongdoing that goes on that \n     doesn't rise to the level of criminal intent, all sorts of \n     activity across regulated broker-dealers and investment \n     advisors and others where, if you can at least make it \n     unprofitable--so that they have to give back the money they \n     wrongfully got, pay a penalty, perhaps suffer time out or \n     lose their license--that, too, has a significant impact.\n       KAUFMAN: Mr. Breuer.\n       LANNY BREUER, Assistant Attorney General: Senator, \n     obviously, as Rob (ph) says: A comprehensive approach is \n     essential. Civil remedies are essential. But I've had many \n     years in the private practice, and I've had many years when I \n     represented individuals, and I can tell you, Senator: In a \n     white-collar case--I've been in the conference room with my \n     clients--there is nothing--there is nothing like an \n     individual--who feels as if he or she has been sort of the \n     center of their community, is well-respected and has had a \n     comfortable life--realizing that they're facing jail time. \n     The terror in their eyes is like nothing else, and there's \n     simply no deterrent like it.\n       KAUFMAN: You know, I think I know the answer to this, but I \n     think it'd be good to be on the record, and starting with \n     you, Mr. Breuer. Why don't--why haven't we seen more, you \n     know, board room prosecutions?\n\n   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is another very important aspect, in my opinion, \nof the Senate enacting legislation on this bill; that is, we were sent \nto Washington to govern. What we have seen in the recent past has been \nstaggering partisan politics. Partisan politics became a blood sport in \nWashington, DC. It is a blood sport on the floor of the Senate. It \npervades the entire town.\n  The point from the Republican side of the aisle has been very clear; \nthat is, to make this President Obama's Waterloo, to make this ``break \nPresident Obama.''\n  I saw the ramifications when we took up the stimulus package earlier \nthis year. There were only three Republicans--Senator Snowe, Senator \nCollins, and myself--who would even talk to the Democrats. There was a \ndetermination to look ahead to the 2012 elections on the Presidency \neven before the ink was dry on the oath of office taken by President \nObama on January 20. This was the second week of February, the week of \nFebruary 6, as I recall, just a couple weeks, and already the plans \nwere for the next election.\n  As I reviewed the matter, it seemed to me we were on the brink of \ngoing into a 1929 Depression. The 1929 Depression was very hard on the \nSpecter family, living in Wichita, KS, at the time. Both of my parents \nwere immigrants. In the mid-1930s, the family moved from Wichita to \nPhiladelphia to live with my father's sister. That is what happened in \nthe Depression--you moved in with relatives because there were no jobs.\n\n  I sided with supporting the stimulus package and played a key role in \nhaving that enacted. And the political consequences on a personal level \nare not something to be discussed on this floor at this time, but the \nconduct of partisanship on the stimulus package is directly relevant to \nwhat we are doing here today, and that is that we are being \nstonewalled.\n  I think it is harder for a Republican to stand up on health care \nreform and join the Democrats today than it was in January and in \nFebruary when three of us did so. And if I were on the other side of \nthe aisle today, I would be supporting health care reform. I would be \nsupporting, and perhaps, if I were on the other side of the aisle \ntoday, I could bring somebody with me. I don't know. That is entirely \nspeculative.\n  Without revealing any more of the confidence which went on inside of \nthe Republican caucus, when I talk about a Republican Senator's \nstatement that this should be the Waterloo of President Obama and this \nshould break him, those are matters in the public record. But the \npressure over there in the Republican caucus is absolutely intense, and \nwe were sent here to govern.\n  In the Democratic caucus--and the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, was there on Monday evening--when \nmy turn came to speak, I said: I have two sentences. And may the record \nshow a smile on the face of the Presiding Officer. I said: I have two \nsentences. One sentence is, the bill is a great deal better than the \ncurrent system, and the second sentence is, we should not let \nobstructionism prevent us from governing. And that is why I crossed the \naisle to make the 60th vote. I was very surprised to see in the public \nrecord--been in the newspapers--that everybody stood up and applauded, \nand I read in one of the Hill newspapers today that you could hear the \napplause down the corridor. So they knew what was going on. Well, that \nis the role, it seems to me, of a Senator. We are facing a situation \nwhere, if defeated, it will have a significant impact on the tenure of \nPresident Obama.\n  We had a meeting on Tuesday--2 days ago--in the Executive Office \nBuilding, and it was a rather remarkable setting. There was a large \nrectangular table, and in the center on each side--one side was \nPresident Obama, the other side was Vice President Biden, and almost \nall of the 60 Senators were present. I think Senator Byrd couldn't be \nthere because of his ailment, but I believe everybody else was present. \nDuring the course of that session, the President expressed himself--and \nthis has also been publicized--that if action was not taken now, it \nwould discourage anyone from the foreseeable future--any President--\nfrom undertaking health care reform if now, with both Houses and 60 \nMembers of the Democratic Party, you can't get it through the Senate \nand get it conferenced and get it enacted.\n  Some of those who were most vocal in favor of the public option urged \nthose in the caucus who disagreed to reconsider their position, and I \nwould renew that request that they reconsider their position. The \npeople who would classify themselves as most progressive in the \nDemocratic caucus have swallowed hard and have announced publicly that \nthey would support this bill even though it doesn't have a robust \npublic option, doesn't have the Medicare expansion. And that may shift \nyet.\n  It is fair and accurate to say there are more pressing problems \nconfronting the United States today than at any time in our history, \nand we have\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\nto finish health care next year to move ahead to jobs. We have the \nissues of global warming and climate control, and we have the problems \nwith the Mideast peace process and the difficulties in Iran and North \nKorea and Afghanistan. We need a strong President, and we need a \nCongress which has the courage to act and the tenacity and willingness \nto confront tough problems. We need to show the American people that it \nis not all gridlock here, that it is not all desperate, desolate \npartisan politics.\n  So my vote will be in favor of the bill. Although I am, frankly, \ndisappointed and I share the frustration expressed by many people who \nsay go back and start again, this is a significant step forward. We \nhave a great chance to improve it in conference, and beyond that there \nwill be another Congress. And with the analogy of civil rights \nlegislation, we can get the public option and get greater public \ninvolvement for the benefit of the American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 3 minutes on \nanother subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Americans Held By Iran\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has been wide publicity given to \nthree young Americans who were taken into custody by Iran and the \nrecent reports that they are going to be tried in an Iranian court. \nSenator Casey and I, in the Senate, introduced a resolution urging the \nIranians to release those three young Americans--Congresswoman Allyson \nSchwartz, on the House side, did so in the past--and it is my hope Iran \nwill change its view.\n  I was talking to the Syrian Ambassador yesterday, who advised me that \nwhen the five British citizens were taken into custody by Iran, the \nGovernment of Great Britain made a request of the Syrian Government to \nuse their good offices to secure the release of the five British \ncitizens. That request was made via Syria, and they were released.\n  I have written to and contacted the State Department since that \nmeeting yesterday afternoon to find out what is the status of U.S. \nactivity because if we have not asked the Syrians for help, my view is \nthat we should. It would be my hope that with the very difficult \nproblems facing the United States in Iran, that Iran would relinquish \nthe custody of those three young Americans and release them to their \nfamily and friends, especially at this time of the year.\n  I have been an advocate of dialog with Iran for years. I have tried \nto go to Iran since 1989, when the Iran-Iraq war ended. Senator Shelby \nand I got to Iraq and met Saddam Hussein, but as yet we have not had an \ninterparliamentary exchange, which I have sought for a long time with \nthe Iranians.\n  It would be my hope that Iran, for humanitarian reasons, would \nrelease these people and that we would exercise our best efforts--the \nU.S. Government working through Syria or whatever other channel we can \nfind--to secure their release.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before the Senate now is an issue of \nfunding our military, the Department of Defense appropriations bill. \nThis is a bill that is critically important because it provides the \nfunding our men and women in uniform now risking their lives while we \nmeet in the safety of our businesses and offices and homes in America, \nit funds their needs to make sure they will be safe to perform their \nmissions effectively and come home. Without fail, every year this bill \ncomes before the Senate and is a consensus bipartisan bill.\n  Regardless of our debates over foreign policy, we all want the men \nand women in uniform to know we stand behind them. As a consequence, \nthis bill usually passes with an overwhelming number. I asked how this \nbill fared in the House of Representatives when it was considered \nyesterday. The vote was 395 to 34. There were 164 Republicans who voted \nyes on this bill. It was clearly an overwhelmingly positive bipartisan \nvote. There is no reason it would not be the same in the Senate.\n  But there is a problem. The problem is this: Tomorrow the funding for \nour troops runs out. It is the end of our continuing resolution in \nfunding. We are not going to leave them high and dry, but we are going \nto leave them uncertain if we don't act decisively and quickly. Why \nwould we do this to them?\n  Military families across America, as we go into the holiday season, I \nam sure, are saddened by the absence of their loved ones who may be in \nIraq or Afghanistan, saddened by a separation from children and other \nloved ones they would like to avoid in their lifetime but they have \noffered it up for this great country. With this kind of uncertainty and \nsadness and emotion, why would we be uncertain when it comes to funding \nour troops?\n  Here is where we are: We offered this yesterday. We said: Let's vote \nfor it. Let's vote for our troops and get this behind us so the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill was clear.\n  The other side of the aisle said: No. We want you to go through all \nof the hurdles that you have to go through under the procedures of the \nSenate for the most controversial bills. We want you to file a cloture \nmotion which would put an end to a filibuster. We want you to fill the \ntree with amendments so that this bill isn't assaulted.\n  Believe me, the terminology would lose most people, including many \nSenators, but the bottom line is this: Instead of just doing what we \nknow needs to be done and what should be done, Republicans have \ninsisted we delay this process for at least 2 days.\n  Why? Why would we want to delay funding our troops in the middle of a \nwar? Why would we want to say to our troops that the military pay raise \nthey were counting on so their families can get by back home, and for \nthose stationed in the United States, make sure that they have what \nthey need, why would we say to them that we are going to raise a \nquestion as to whether we are going to put $29.2 billion into the \ndefense health program, the health program for our military members and \ntheir families?\n  Why would the Republicans insist on delaying a vote for $472 million \nfor family advocacy programs for military families who are separated, \nmany of whom are going through extraordinary stress because of the \nseparation? Why would they want to delay a pay raise for the military? \nWhy would they want to delay $154 billion for equipment and training \nfor our military?\n  I don't understand it. It would seem to me that we ought to come \ntogether by noon today and say: Let's do this. Let's not waste another \nminute in terms of helping our troops and showing them we stand behind \nthem. But, no, the decision has been made on the other side of the \naisle that we are going to delay this matter until tomorrow.\n  They say in politics, for every decision there is a real reason and a \ngood reason. There may be some good reason they are giving on the other \nside of the aisle for delaying funding our troops, but the real reason \nis their hope that they can stop health care reform in the Senate. That \nis what is behind this. The lengths to which those on the other side of \nthe aisle will go was demonstrated yesterday.\n  We had a defining moment when the leadership on the Senate Republican \nside insisted, through Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, that an 800-page \namendment be read by the clerk. It is the right of a Senator to ask for \nthat. It is an archaic right because people don't sit here hanging on \nevery word to understand an amendment. That never happens. It didn't \nhappen yesterday. But the clerk started reading.\n  Almost 2 hours into it, it was pretty clear that it would take 10 \nhours to finish this 800-page amendment, despite the best efforts of \nthe clerk's office. Why did the Senate Republican leadership want to \ntake 10 hours out of a day for something that was meaningless--the \nreading, word by word, line by line, page by page, of an 800-page \namendment? To stop debate on health care reform.\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\n  During that period, no one could debate it. No one could amend it. \nThe Republicans have conceded that they are finished with the debate \nand amendment phase of health care reform. They have decided now that \nthe only thing they could possibly do is to delay everything the Senate \ncan consider in the hopes that maybe we get tangled up with our desire \npersonally to be home with our families during the holidays and would \nnot do our duty here.\n  They are wrong. We are determined to do this. We are determined \nbecause health care reform for this country is so absolutely essential. \nThe Presiding Officer has an awesome assignment, succeeding the late \nSenator Ted Kennedy whom he counted as a close friend and served as a \nmember of his staff.\n  In our cloakroom is a cover of Time magazine where Senator Kennedy is \nlooking out with that smile on his face saying: We are almost there. It \nwas an article he wrote before he died about health care reform. He, \nmore than any person in the Senate, had the authority to speak to it. \nSenator Kirk told us in a meeting of our caucus the other day that it \nwas 40 years ago when Senator Kennedy took to the floor as a young man \nand talked about the priority of health care reform. Forty years, when \nyou think about it, 40 years of waiting for this moment to vote on \nhealth care reform. If he were here today--and I wish to God he were--\nhe would be back there at that desk--that was Kennedy's spot--\nthundering in this Senate Chamber about this historic opportunity and \nhow if it costs us Christmas Eve or costs us Christmas Day or even \nmore, we cannot let down the people of this country.\n  I see the polls. This complicated issue of health care reform has a \nlot of people confused and even worried. They have heard some of the \nwild charges on the other side. At one point they were arguing about \ndeath panels; that ultimately the government was going to decide \nwhether people would live or die. That was one of the cruelest \ndistortions in this debate.\n  The actual issue was raised by Senator Johnny Isakson, who is a \nRepublican of Georgia, whom I thought raised a serious and important \nconsideration and one that all of us, though we might not want to, \nshould reflect on. He said every person under Medicare ought to have a \ncompensated, paid-for visit to a doctor if they want, voluntarily, to \ntalk about end-of-life treatment. There is hardly a family in America \nwho doesn't contemplate that possibility, doesn't have a husband say to \na wife: Honey, I don't want any of that extraordinary stuff. Don't keep \nme on life support.\n  What Senator Isakson wanted to do was to give Medicare patients an \nopportunity to sit down with a doctor and say: What instruction should \nI leave? If this is what I believe, whom should I tell? That was a \nhumane, thoughtful amendment. But the critics of health care reform \ntwisted and distorted it into a death panel that was going to tell \nGrannie: We are going to pull the plug.\n  Sad. It was sad, when Senator Isakson offered such a good-faith \namendment, to have it distorted. It is no wonder if the critics of \nhealth care reform would go to those extremes to try to defeat this \nbill, why other extreme things have been said about it. If you listened \non the floor of the Senate over the last several weeks while we have \ndebated health care reform and listened to the speeches from the other \nside of the aisle, you would believe that this bill is going to destroy \nMedicare. Many Republican Senators who historically did not support \nMedicare and wanted to privatize Medicare are now its most fervent \nchampions. You might question their sincerity. We don't do that in the \nSenate because we don't question motives of people. But I will question \ntheir accuracy.\n\n  This bill, which is over 2,000 pages, knows the future of Medicare is \nimportant to all of us. If we do nothing today, Medicare will go broke \nin 8 years. We would not be bringing in enough money from payroll taxes \nto pay the Medicare services we promised in 8 years. That is a fact. \nBut this bill is going to change it. This bill will add 10 years of \nsolvency to Medicare. I wish it were more, but it is a step in the \nright direction to say to those receiving Medicare and those about to \ngo into Medicare: This important program will be there when you need \nit; 10 years of added solvency in Medicare; Medicare on sound financial \nfooting for 10 more years because of this bill.\n  There is something else it does. At the end of our conference between \nthe House and Senate on health care reform, we are going to take care \nof a problem in Medicare. It is a serious problem. When we passed the \nMedicare prescription drug program, there wasn't enough money to fund \nit. They created this strange situation where if you were seriously ill \nunder Medicare and receiving medication, this Medicare Part D plan \nwould pay for prescription drugs up to a certain limit and then stop.\n  In the midst of a new calendar year, some could find several months \ninto that year that Medicare Part D was not paying for any more \nprescription drugs. You would be responsible personally to pay for \nthem. After you had paid a certain amount of money, the Part D coverage \nwould kick in again. It was known euphemistically as the doughnut hole, \nthat gap in coverage in Medicare Part D. When this is over, this health \ncare reform is going to fill that gap, close that doughnut hole, give \nto 45 million Americans under Medicare the peace of mind of knowing \nthat their prescription drugs will be paid for and they will not find \nthemselves exhausting savings or going without it when it comes to \nbasic medication.\n  That is why this bill is important. That is why some of the things \nthat have been said in the debate are so misleading.\n  There is something else this bill does which we ought to take pride \nin as Senators. Most civilized and developed countries in the world \nhave a health care system that protects their people. We are the only \ndeveloped country on Earth where a person can die because they don't \nhave health insurance. We are the only one.\n  You might say: Senator Durbin, aren't you getting a little carried \naway? Well, 45,000 people a year do. Let me give you an illustration: \nWhat if you had a $5,000 copay on your health insurance and you didn't \nhave $5,000 and the doctor says: I am a little bit worried about some \nof the things you tell me, Senator. I think you need a colonoscopy.\n  That is something I can understand because my mother had colon \ncancer. I am very careful about this. I have a history in my family.\n  But if you had a policy that said the first $5,000 you have to pay \nfor and went out and asked how much a colonoscopy cost, you would find \nin many places it is $3,000. There have been cases--a man from Illinois \nwrote me. He said: I didn't have the $3,000 so I skipped the \ncolonoscopy.\n  Without health insurance, without coverage, without enough money to \npay for that basic test, this individual is running the risk of \ndeveloping a serious cancer that could claim his life or at least cost \na fortune to take care of. That is what inadequate health insurance \ndoes to you. That is what no health insurance does to you.\n\n  At the end of the day, this bill will say, for the first time in the \nhistory of this great Nation, 94 percent of the people will have health \ninsurance. Thirty million people today who have no health insurance \nwill have it when it is over. Fifteen million will go into Medicaid \nbecause they are in low-income categories.\n  I met one of those people when I was back in my home State of \nIllinois. Her name is Judie. She works at a motel in Marion, IL. She is \na hostess in the morning for their free continental breakfast--a sweet \nlady with a big smile on her face, in her early sixties.\n  She came up to me and said: Senator, I am not sure this health care \nreform is good for me.\n  I said: Judie, do you have health insurance?\n  She said: No, I've never had health insurance, and I'm a few years \naway from Medicare.\n  I said: If you don't mind telling me, how much money do you make?\n  She said: Well, they've cut our hours here at the motel because of \nthe economy. I work about 30 hours a week now, and I make about $8 an \nhour. And she said: There isn't a person here you're looking at, \nworking on this motel staff, who has health insurance.\n  I said: So does that mean your income each year is about $12,000?\n  She said: Well, I guess. It's the only job I have. I get by on it.\n\n[[Page S13354]]\n\n  I cannot imagine how.\n  She said: I get by on it.\n  I checked into it, and I saw her the next morning before I checked \nout, and I said: Judie, under this bill we have, because you make less \nthan $14,000 a year as an individual, you will qualify for Medicaid. \nFor the first time in your life, you will have health insurance under \nan Illinois State Medicaid Program that you won't have to pay for \nbecause you are in a low-income category.\n  Well, she said: That's great because I have diabetes.\n  Think about that: age 60, no health insurance, low income, no doctor \nregularly available to her.\n  And she said: And I've had a few lumps I would like to get checked \nout too.\n  I thought: This poor lady. She is a classic illustration of what we \nare talking about in this bill. She is not lazy. She is a hard-working \nperson. She gets up every day at the crack of dawn to be there to make \nsure people feel right at home at that motel, and she has no health \ninsurance.\n  Ninety-four percent of the people in this country will have health \ninsurance--people like Judie, who, for the first time in her life, will \nhave health insurance. Is that worth something? Is it worth something \nin America for us to take pride in the fact that we are expanding the \npeace of mind which some of us take for granted of having health \ninsurance coverage?\n  I think it is worth a lot. I think it is important for us and the \ncritics to step up and acknowledge they have never come forward with a \nsingle proposal to deal with that issue--not one. We have never heard \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle how they would cover 94 percent \nof the people in America. They have never put together a comprehensive \nhealth insurance plan. They have never talked about submitting it to \nthe Congressional Budget Office to make sure it does as promised, as we \nhave.\n  They come to the floor with criticisms of what we are trying to do. \nIt is their right as Senators to do that. But it is also our right to \nask them the basic question: Does the fact that you do not have a \nRepublican health care reform bill mean that you like the current \nsystem, that you do not want to change it? That is one conclusion.\n  The other conclusion is: This is hard work. Writing a bill that does \nthis takes a lot of time and effort, and they have not put in that hard \nwork. So they come emptyhanded to the floor with good speeches and good \ngraphs and good press releases, but without good amendments to take \ncare of the basic problems.\n  There is one other element in this health care reform bill too. How \nmany times have you met somebody in your family or at work or through a \nfriend who told you about a battle they had with a health insurance \ncompany when somebody got sick in their family? I have run into it a \nlot. A few years back, when I was a Congressman, in Springfield, they \nhad a unique program where the Sangamon County State Medical Society \nwould invite Members of Congress to accompany doctors on their rounds \nin a hospital.\n  The first time I was invited to do that, I called back and said: \nYou've got to be wrong. You don't want me walking into a patient's room \nwhere you are talking about their private health situation.\n  They said: No, no, we ask permission. And it is interesting, people \nare bored in the hospital, and they are amused by politicians. So would \nyou please come?\n  So I accompanied a doctor on his rounds. He was examining a nice lady \nin my hometown of Springfield, IL, who was suffering from vertigo, who \nhad come to the hospital, and as a result of an x-ray, they discovered \nshe had a tumor--a brain tumor--that needed to be removed. She lived by \nherself. She was falling down at home. He wanted to operate on her on \nMonday. This was a Friday. He wanted to keep her in the hospital \nbecause he was afraid if she went home she might fall, hurt herself, \nand he wanted her ready for surgery on Monday.\n  But before he could say to her: Be prepared to stay over the weekend, \nhe had to call her health insurance company. I stood next to this \ndoctor at the nurses station in St. John's Hospital in Springfield, IL, \nas this doctor was arguing with a clerk at a health insurance company \nsomewhere in a distant location about why this woman needed to stay in \nthe hospital, and the clerk was saying: No, we are not going to pay for \nit. Send her home. Bring her back on Monday for the surgery.\n  He said: I'm not going to do that.\n  The clerk said: Well, we're not paying for it.\n  He hung up the phone and turned to me and said: She's staying in the \nhospital. We'll fight this out later on.\n  Fight it out--those battles, those fights take place every day across \nAmerica.\n  I have told the story on the floor here about a friend of mine--a \ngreat friend of mine--whom I have known since he was a young man. He is \na baseball coach at Southern Illinois University. His name is Danny \nCallahan. Danny has been battling cancer for years. Danny is a young \nguy. He has a young family and a good wife, and he is a terrific guy \nfrom a great family. He has been battling cancer--chemo, radiation, \neven surgery, removing part of his jaw and trying to stop this advance \nof cancer.\n  His oncologist came up with a drug that is working. It is called \nAvastin. This drug is experimental. It works on some cancers. It is \ncertified to work on them. But they found it works on others in an off-\nlabel application. The oncologist wrote to the health insurance company \nand said: This is working. We have stopped the spread of his cancer. We \nwant to keep using this drug. And they said: No. It costs $12,000 a \nmonth, and we won't pay for it.\n  What is he going to do? You do not make a fortune as a baseball coach \nat Southern Illinois University. His family pitched in, borrowed some \nmoney to cover a month of treatment. He is going to have a trial in St. \nLouis at Barnes Hospital, connected with Washington University there. \nHe is trying his best to keep this going, but he is battling this \ninsurance company that said no.\n  This bill gives people whom I have described a fighting chance. It \ngives them a chance to fight against the discriminatory, wrong \ndecisions of health insurance companies. Is that worth anything? Is it \nworth it? I have yet to see an amendment from the other side of the \naisle that does this.\n  We used to call this a Patients' Bill of Rights, and it used to be a \nbipartisan issue. Senator John McCain joined with Senator Kennedy and \nthe two of them worked on this, saying that patients in America should \nhave the right to fight insurance companies that turn them down because \nof preexisting conditions, that turn them down because the cost of care \nis so high, that turn them down because they have lost their job or \nturn them down because their child reaches the age of 24. This bill \nprovides protections for those people.\n\n  So when people say: I heard Governor Dean--I like him; Howard is a \nfriend of mine; former Governor of Vermont; former head of the \nDemocratic National Committee--wrote a big article in the Washington \nPost this morning and said: Vote against this bill. It is not \neverything I want it to be.\n  Well, Governor Dean, it is not everything I want it to be either. But \nhow could we in good conscience explain to 30 million Americans who \nwould have health insurance for the first time in their life--such as \nJudie down in Marion, IL--``Judie, I am sorry, we won't be able to get \nyou health insurance this time around. We couldn't get everything we \nwanted.'' That is not a very compelling argument, from my point of \nview.\n  How do we say to people who want to have a fighting chance against \ninsurance companies that say no--and will have the legal right to do \nthat--``I am sorry, you are just going to have to continue to do your \nbest fighting these clerks at health insurance companies who say no \nbecause this bill does not have everything in it that we want.''\n  You learn in this business of life and politics that concessions and \ncompromise are critical parts of achieving a goal. Within the \nDemocratic Caucus there are conservative and liberal or progressive \nmembers, and we have to find that sweet spot, that middle ground, where \nthey come together. I think we have, and I am sorry we do not have any \nRepublican support for this.\n  It is a fact, though, we have spent an entire year debating health \ncare reform on Capitol Hill, and the sum total of Republican support \nfor health care reform by vote comes down to two. One\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\nRepublican Congressman from the State of Louisiana voted for the House \nbill, and one Republican Senator, Ms. Snowe of Maine, voted for a \nversion of health care reform in the Senate Finance Committee. Not a \nsingle vote beyond those two in support of health care reform.\n  In fact, some take great pride in the fact that they are never going \nto vote for health care reform until it comes down exactly as they want \nit. We have invited them into conversation. In fact, my friend, the \nSenator from Iowa, who is on the floor here today, was part of a \nconversation with Senator Baucus and four other Members of the Senate \nthat went on, I am told, for weeks, if not months, in an effort to find \nbipartisan, common ground, and they could not. I am sorry they did not. \nIt would have been a better day if we had a real bipartisan effort \nbefore us. But I thank the Senator from Iowa for his genuine heartfelt \nefforts in trying.\n  But we come here today without a Republican alternative to health \ncare reform. We come here today facing the reality that if we fail this \ntime, we will not address health care reform, I am afraid, in my \npolitical lifetime or in the lifetime of many people following this \ndebate. It took 16 years since President Clinton last offered an effort \nto try. If we wait another 16 or 20 years, I cannot imagine what is \ngoing to happen.\n  We know what is going to happen to health insurance premiums. Ten \nyears ago, for a family of four, the average cost of their family \nhealth insurance premium was $6,000 a year--$500 a month. Pretty steep, \nright? The average cost today, for a family of four, for their family \nhealth insurance premium: $12,000 a year. It has doubled in a 10-year \nperiod of time, and it is going up so fast that it will double in the \nnext 7 or 8 years to $24,000 a year.\n  Imagine working and earning $2,000 a month just to pay for your \nhealth insurance premium. That is it. Imagine how meager that coverage \nis going be because each year you know what happens. The cost goes up \nand coverage goes down. What will it be 10 years from now? If you talk \nto people who are negotiating for contracts, such as labor unions, all \nthey talk about is health insurance. They do not talk about wage \nincreases. They talk about health insurance. Those are the issues that \nbreak down the negotiations and end up in work stoppages and strikes, \nit has become that contentious and that difficult.\n  Are we going to accept that? Is that the best we can do in America? I \ndo not think so. Are we going to accept a strategy which says: We are \ngoing to slow down the business of the Senate to a crawl, or stop it, \nas they tried yesterday, in an effort to defeat even having a vote on \nhealth care reform?\n  Don't we owe the people of this country, at the end of this debate, a \nvote on health care reform? Shouldn't it be in a timely fashion?\n  Shouldn't we first pass this bill that funds our troops that is \nsitting on the floor here that passed the House 395 to 34? Why would we \ndelay that funding of our troops in the midst of a war? Why don't we do \nthat today before we break for lunch and say to our troops: ``We took \ncare of you.''\n  I might add, in here there is a provision that extends unemployment \nbenefits. Is there any doubt on the other side of the aisle that they \nwill vote to extend unemployment benefits in the midst of a recession? \nThe last vote we had was 97 to 0 on the floor of the Senate to extend \nunemployment benefits, and that was a few weeks back. I assume \nRepublican Senators feel as Democratic Senators do, that in the midst \nof a recession, in the midst of the holiday season, we owe it to these \nfamilies to try to help them out.\n  How could we in good conscience go home and celebrate Christmas or \nHanukkah or whatever our holiday might be and say we want to be in the \ncomfort and love of our families, to sit and have a glorious Christmas \nmorning before the tree, and enjoy the blessings of this great Nation \nand the blessings of life, and then turn down the unemployed when it \ncomes to their benefits? We could not do that in good conscience.\n  Why don't we do that today? Why do we wait until tomorrow? Why don't \nwe say: Regardless of what your strategy is on health care reform, \nlet's not shortchange the troops. Let's not leave them with any \nuncertainty. Let's not leave those unemployed with uncertainty as to \nwhether they are going to get benefits they come to expect and deserve. \nI hope we can.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na recent article published in the New York Times relating to the trauma \nof joblessness in the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 14, 2009]\n\n               Poll Reveals Trauma of Joblessness in U.S.\n\n                 (By Michael Luo and Megan Thee-Brenan)\n\n       More than half of the nation's unemployed workers have \n     borrowed money from friends or relatives since losing their \n     jobs. An equal number have cut back on doctor visits or \n     medical treatments because they are out of work.\n       Almost half have suffered from depression or anxiety. About \n     4 in 10 parents have noticed behavioral changes in their \n     children that they attribute to their difficulties in finding \n     work.\n       Joblessness has wreaked financial and emotional havoc on \n     the lives of many of those out of work, according to a New \n     York Times/CBS News poll of unemployed adults, causing major \n     life changes, mental health issues and trouble maintaining \n     even basic necessities.\n       The results of the poll, which surveyed 708 unemployed \n     adults from Dec. 5 to Dec. 10 and has a margin of sampling \n     error of plus or minus four percentage points, help to lay \n     bare the depth of the trauma experienced by millions across \n     the country who are out of work as the jobless rate hovers at \n     10 percent and, in particular, as the ranks of the long-term \n     unemployed soar.\n       Roughly half of the respondents described the recession as \n     a hardship that had caused fundamental changes in their \n     lives. Generally, those who have been out of work longer \n     reported experiencing more acute financial and emotional \n     effects.\n       ``I lost my job in March, and from there on, everything \n     went downhill,'' said Vicky Newton, 38, of Mount Pleasant, \n     Mich., a single mother who had been a customer-service \n     representative in an insurance agency.\n       ``After struggling and struggling and not being able to pay \n     my house payments or my other bills, I finally sucked up my \n     pride,'' she said in an interview after the poll was \n     conducted. ``I got food stamps just to help feed my \n     daughter.''\n       Over the summer, she abandoned her home in Flint, Mich., \n     after she started receiving foreclosure notices. She now \n     lives 90 minutes away, in a rental house owned by her father.\n       With unemployment driving foreclosures nationwide, a \n     quarter of those polled said they had either lost their home \n     or been threatened with foreclosure or eviction for not \n     paying their mortgage or rent. About a quarter, like Ms. \n     Newton, have received food stamps. More than half said they \n     had cut back on both luxuries and necessities in their \n     spending. Seven in 10 rated their family's financial \n     situation as fairly bad or very bad.\n       But the impact on their lives was not limited to the \n     difficulty in paying bills. Almost half said unemployment had \n     led to more conflicts or arguments with family members and \n     friends; 55 percent have suffered from insomnia.\n       ``Everything gets touched,'' said Colleen Klemm, 51, of \n     North Lake, Wis., who lost her job as a manager at a \n     landscaping company last November. ``All your relationships \n     are touched by it. You're never your normal happy-go-lucky \n     person. Your countenance, your self-esteem goes. You think, \n     `I'm not employable.' ''\n       A quarter of those who experienced anxiety or depression \n     said they had gone to see a mental health professional. Women \n     were significantly more likely than men to acknowledge \n     emotional issues.\n       Tammy Linville, 29, of Louisville, Ky., said she lost her \n     job as a clerical worker for the Census Bureau a year and a \n     half ago. She began seeing a therapist for depression every \n     week through Medicaid but recently has not been able to go \n     because her car broke down and she cannot afford to fix it.\n       Her partner works at the Ford plant in the area, but his \n     schedule has been sporadic. They have two small children and \n     at this point, she said, they are ``saving quarters for \n     diapers.''\n       ``Every time I think about money, I shut down because there \n     is none,'' Ms. Linville said. ``I get major panic attacks. I \n     just don't know what we're going to do.''\n       Nearly half of the adults surveyed admitted to feeling \n     embarrassed or ashamed most of the time or sometimes as a \n     result of being out of work. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given \n     the traditional image of men as breadwinners, men were \n     significantly more likely than women to report feeling \n     ashamed most of the time.\n       There was a pervasive sense from the poll that the American \n     dream had been upended for many. Nearly half of those polled \n     said they felt in danger of falling out of their social \n     class, with those out of work six months or more feeling \n     especially vulnerable. Working-class respondents felt at risk \n     in the greatest numbers.\n       Nearly half of respondents said they did not have health \n     insurance, with the vast majority citing job loss as a \n     reason, a notable\n\n[[Page S13356]]\n\n     finding given the tug of war in Congress over a health care \n     overhaul. The poll offered a glimpse of the potential ripple \n     effect of having no coverage. More than half characterized \n     the cost of basic medical care as a hardship.\n       Many in the ranks of the unemployed appear to be rethinking \n     their career and life choices. Just over 4o percent said they \n     had moved or considered moving to another part of the state \n     or country where there were more jobs. More than two-thirds \n     of respondents had considered changing their career or field, \n     and 44 percent of those surveyed had pursued job retraining \n     or other educational opportunities.\n       Joe Whitlow, 31, of Nashville, worked as a mechanic until a \n     repair shop he was running with a friend finally petered out \n     in August. He had contemplated going back to school before, \n     but the potential loss in income always deterred him. Now he \n     is enrolled at a local community college, planning to study \n     accounting.\n       ``When everything went bad, not that I didn't have a \n     choice, but it made the choice easier,'' Mr. Whitlow said.\n       The poll also shed light on the formal and informal safety \n     nets that the jobless have relied upon. More than half said \n     they were receiving or had received unemployment benefits. \n     But 61 percent of those receiving benefits said the amount \n     was not enough to cover basic necessities.\n       Meanwhile, a fifth said they had received food from a \n     nonprofit organization or religious institution. Among those \n     with a working spouse, half said their spouse had taken on \n     additional hours or another job to help make ends meet.\n       Even those who have stayed employed have not escaped the \n     recession's bite. According to a New York Times/CBS News \n     nationwide poll conducted at the same time as the poll of \n     unemployed adults, about 3 in 10 people said that in the past \n     year, as a result of bad economic conditions, their pay had \n     been cut.\n       In terms of casting blame for the high unemployment rate, \n     26 percent of unemployed adults cited former President George \n     W. Bush; 12 percent pointed the finger at banks; 8 percent \n     highlighted jobs going overseas and the same number blamed \n     politicians. Only 3 percent blamed President Obama.\n       Those out of work were split, however, on the president's \n     handling of job creation, with 47 percent expressing approval \n     and 44 percent disapproval.\n       Unemployed Americans are divided over what the future holds \n     for the job market: 39 percent anticipate improvement, 36 \n     percent expect it will stay the same, and 22 percent say it \n     will get worse.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to close by saying that for \nthose who wonder if it makes any difference whether we move forward on \nthe issue of helping the unemployed, they should read this article I \nhave put in the Record. People across this country are not only worried \nabout getting a job and taking care of their families, it has reached a \npoint where it is dramatic. Some of them are making critical life \ndecisions, spending their savings, with no health insurance to cover \nthemselves or their kids.\n  I will ask the Republicans, who will follow me: Please, regardless of \nhow long you want to talk today, agree with us that we should move \nquickly to fund our troops, send the money for those members of the \nmilitary and their families to give them peace of mind we stand behind \nthem. Do not make them part of any political delay and strategy that \nleaves uncertainty. Let's do it today. Let's not wait until the money \nruns out tomorrow.\n  Let's fund our unemployment benefits too. Let's give these families, \nwho through no fault of their own are out of work, the peace of mind of \nknowing that as we go home for Christmas, they will at least have a \nChristmas which has, even if it is small, an unemployment check.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Biodiesel Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise on the issue of jobs and 10 \npercent unemployment and to tell my fellow Senators what we can do to \npreserve maybe 25,000 jobs in an industry that, by the end of the \nmonth, will be otherwise shut down because Congress is not taking \naction. The main point of my remarks is, if we don't extend the \nbiodiesel tax credit by the end of the month, these jobs will be lost.\n  My point is 23,000 jobs will be lost. In fact, right now, on December \n17, companies are making plans to shut down these operations by the end \nof the year.\n  Everybody knows our unemployment rate is 10 percent. Everybody knows \nthe President has spent a great deal of time, over the last 2 or 3 \nweeks, talking about creating jobs and getting us out of the recession. \nBut we have to remember that for those without work, this is not just a \nrecession, it is a depression.\n  We all agree we should take whatever action is necessary to jump-\nstart our economy and get people back to work. President Obama and Vice \nPresident Biden have been talking for months about the need to create \ngreen jobs. Well, green jobs, purple jobs, whatever kind of jobs, jobs \nare jobs. I don't object to the creation of green jobs. In fact, what I \nam talking about is some of these green jobs.\n  President Obama has held three public events in recent days to \nhighlight his concern about the economy and the need to create jobs. \nYesterday, the administration apparently announced billions more in tax \ncredits for renewable energy and energy conservation efforts. I will \nbet when I look at that list I am going to support most of those \nbecause I believe a national energy policy involves capturing whatever \nwe can of petroleum and fossil fuels we have available for a short \nperiod of time because we are never going to get rid of them in the \nshort term. We need conservation, and we need renewable and alternative \nenergy. Those three things make a comprehensive energy program. \nObviously, if I am for that comprehensive energy program, I am for \nrenewable energy and alternative energy.\n  It seems as if nearly everyone, in fact, in the administration is \ntouting the benefits of green jobs and a clean energy economy and I am \ndoing that right now myself. It is astonishing, though, with all this \ntalk about green jobs and clean energy that this Congress right now \nseems to be heading for the holidays while thousands of green energy \nworkers will receive pink slips and furloughs.\n  On December 31 of this year, the current biodiesel tax credit will \nexpire. The biodiesel tax credit provides a $1-per-gallon credit for \nbiodiesel made from soybean oil and yellow grease and animal fats. The \ntax credit is essential in maintaining the competitiveness of this \nclean-burning, domestically produced green fuel and the jobs that are \nconnected with it.\n  The tax credit exists for a commonsense reason and something we have \nbeen using for a long period of time: to offset the higher cost of \nproducing biodiesel--or I could just as well insert the word \n``ethanol''--compared to petroleum diesel. Without the tax credit, \npetroleum marketers will be unwilling to purchase the more expensive \nbiodiesel and demand will vanish. From this standpoint of the tax \ncredit, I hope everybody remembers that whether it is wind, ethanol, \nsolar, biodiesel, biomass, or geothermal, it takes tax credits to get \nthese programs off the ground. Right now, wind energy is a big industry \nin my State, not only from the production standpoint but from the \nstandpoint of manufacturing of components because, in 1992, I got a \nwind energy tax credit passed; otherwise, we would not have wind energy \nand everybody touts wind energy today. It is a little bit like the very \ninfant biodiesel industry we have. One might not think biofuels are an \ninfant industry because ethanol has been around for 30 years, but \nbiodiesel is about where ethanol was 30 years ago. So we want to help \nmove this industry along so eventually it can stand on its own legs. \nThat is the motive behind all these tax credits, to get an infant \nindustry started and then they stand on their own.\n  In 2008, getting back to the jobs in this industry, biodiesel \nsupported 51,000 green jobs. Because of the downturn in the economy and \nthe credit crisis, the biodiesel industry has already shed 29,000 green \njobs. So now what about the rest of those jobs? That is what my remarks \nare all about, and that is what getting the tax credit renewed before \nthe end of the year is all about. Because the industry is currently \noperating at just around 15 percent of capacity. Without an extension \nof the tax credit, all U.S. biodiesel production will grind to a halt. \nPlants will be shuttered and workers will be let go.\n  No one should be surprised by the upcoming expiration of this tax \ncredit. It was extended most recently in October 2008. So we have known \nfor 14 months; hence, nobody should be surprised that it would need to \nbe extended by the end of this year.\n\n[[Page S13357]]\n\n  The Senate has been in session nearly continuously for months. \nEarlier this year, Senator Cantwell and I introduced a bill to extend \nthe tax credit for 5 years and change it to a production tax credit. \nThere is no excuse for inaction on this credit. The Democratic \nleadership is content to leave without doing the necessary work on \nextenders, believing they can extend the tax provisions retroactively \nsometime early next year. Retroactivity does work a lot of times on tax \nextenders that are not extended at the end of the year and extended to \nbe made retroactive. But retroactivity in the case of the biodiesel \nmarket doesn't help bring it from grinding to a halt on January 1, \n2010, because without the incentive, the biodiesel will cost much more \nthan petroleum diesel.\n  While the House and Senate dither, thousands will lose their jobs, \nbut demand for dirty, imported petroleum diesel, however, will \ncontinue. Investments in the domestic renewable fuels industry will \nlose value and possibly disappear--quite to the contrary of what I said \nin my remarks of yesterday, the President announcing various tax \ncredits. So this one has been on the books. All it has to be is \nreauthorized.\n  It is too bad that among all the talk of green jobs and the clean \nenergy economy, Congress is unable to pass a simple extension of an \nexisting tax credit. Once again, the actions of the majority do not \nmatch their words. For all the talk, they will have failed all those in \nthe biodiesel industry working today to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil if we leave without extending this critical tax credit \nbefore the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have conferred with the other side of \nthe aisle, and I think we have reached an agreement. I ask unanimous \nconsent to be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes, and then I believe \ntwo Senators from the other side of the aisle would like to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it just shows we can do some things in a \nbipartisan way around here still, albeit small things.\n  We are talking about the Defense appropriations bill. I think it is \nimportant to point out that the majority leader has waited until the \nvery last minute to bring up this very important bill, which I am sure \nwill pass by a large majority, but it was 2 months ago that the fiscal \nyear ended. The majority leader has now left us here 8 days before \nChristmas with a lot on our plate, a lot yet to do, and, of course, \nthreatening to keep Congress here through Christmas--certainly up to \nChristmas. I would not say we are happy to be here, but this is a great \nresponsibility. These are important issues, and none of us is going to \nshy away from dealing with these issues, albeit 8 days before \nChristmas.\n  It is also appropriate to talk about Christmas because this bill not \nonly funds our troops, it is a Christmas tree on which Members of \nCongress have hung nice shiny little ornaments, provisions that have \nnothing to do with funding our troops and the Defense appropriations \nbill. As a matter of fact, this bill would actually create new \nentitlement spending programs--that is what some of these little shiny \nornaments are--rather than fix the ones we have. It is significant. We \nare talking about our troops. At the same time, we are talking more \ngenerally about health care, because under Federal law TRICARE, which \nhandles the reimbursement rates for health care for our troops and \ntheir families, is required under Federal law to follow Medicare \nreimbursement rates.\n  We know that under the underlying health care bill we will be \nconsidering up until Christmas, it looks like there are actually going \nto be $500 billion in cuts to Medicare. The concern is, if access to \ncare is jeopardized for Medicare beneficiaries, which we know it will \nbe for at least some--particularly Medicare Advantage beneficiaries--\nthen cuts to TRICARE reimbursement rates could follow.\n  We also know this bill includes a 2-month bandaid for the Medicare \nreimbursement rate for doctors, the so-called doc fix. This is the \nsustainable growth rate formula which has never worked since Congress \npassed it in 1997. It shows Congress makes assumptions--this one back \nin 1997--that we are going to cut Medicare, and in this particular \ninstance Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors and that somehow that \nwill not have a negative impact on people's ability to find a doctor \nwho will see them.\n  I know in Travis County in Austin, TX, at last report, only 17 \npercent of doctors will see a new Medicare patient, and it is even \nworse for Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare. So we know the cuts \nthe underlying health care bill will make to Medicare are going to have \na negative impact on access to care for many of our seniors, and \nbecause TRICARE rates are linked to Medicare rates under Federal law, \nthey could well jeopardize our troops' and their dependents' access to \ncare as well.\n  This experience we have had since 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act \nwith the sustainable growth rate which, unless Congress acts, will \nactually cut reimbursement rates for doctors by 23 percent--and this \nbill provides a 2-month--a 2-month--fix--these assumptions have never \nworked. Yet this health care bill, at least the 2,074-page version--we \nhave yet to see the Reid substitute, which will appear, I am sure, \nmiraculously sometime around Saturday as the majority leader tries to \ncram this bill through before Christmas--we know it contains or will \ncontain many other assumptions, such as this SGR formula that will \nprove unenforceable and will never work. Yet those will be used by the \nCongressional Budget Office to provide a cost estimate or score which \nmay meet the demands of politics today but which will bear no \nrelationship whatsoever to the ultimate costs. And the American people \nunderstand that. They understand the budget gimmicks of having a 10-\nyear program and not implementing it until year 4 but starting the \ntaxes to pay for it on day one. They understand that, and that is why \nthey don't trust the Congress to be honest and transparent when it \ncomes to spending their money--because of their unfortunate experience.\n\n  I also want to focus on other promises the President has made about \nhealth care reform which bear on the process by which health care \nreform and these bills are being considered--unfortunately, ways in \nwhich the Reid bill breaks those promises. This is one we have talked \nabout before, but I think it bears repeating because the American \npeople want us to read the bills before we vote on them. They want to \nbe able to read the bills and to have them posted on the Internet so \nthey can understand how this legislation will impact them and their \nfamilies.\n  Here is what the President said:\n\n       I'm going to have all the negotiations [the health care \n     negotiations] around a big table. We'll have negotiations \n     televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making \n     arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making \n     arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance \n     companies.\n\n  I see one of our colleagues on the floor, who is a chief proponent of \nan amendment that had to do with drug pricing. We all know it is the \nworst-kept secret in Washington, DC, that the drug companies have cut a \nspecial deal behind closed doors--not around a big round table on C-\nSPAN but behind closed doors--and many of us don't know the exact terms \nof this deal. We do know that while the big drug companies may be \nprotected, the American people are not at the table while special \ninterests are cutting deals that have not yet fully come to the light \nof day. I think this is a tragedy. There is no reason the President's \npromise cannot be kept, other than to try to run something by Congress \nand the American people before they have had a full opportunity to read \nit and understand what is in it.\n  This is exactly the kind of cynical act that breeds public skepticism \nabout Congress and their elected representatives. We are elected by the \npeople in our States to use our best judgment on their behalf, listen \nto them, and ask: What do you think about this? Tell me, as your \nelected representative, how do you think I should vote on these \nimportant issues? If we hide the substance of these cooked-up deals \nbehind closed doors from the American people, no wonder the \ncongressional approval\n\n[[Page S13358]]\n\nrating is so low. Unfortunately, promises such as this which are broken \nby the Reid bill do nothing but breed skepticism or cynicism on behalf \nof the American people.\n  The Washington Post reported last October that the first Reid bill \nwas written in secret and ``behind closed doors.'' That is the 2,074-\npage bill we have seen stacked up on our tables. That bill, with \nsleight of hand, will be swept off the table and a new one will \nmiraculously appear sometime on Saturday. That is the bill we are going \nto be asked to pass by Christmas--again, without anybody knowing what \nexactly is in it.\n  Of course, there is speculation among the press corps and the \npolitical class in Washington as to whether the majority leader will be \nable to get 60 votes on a bill. People are saying: Yes, I think he will \nget 60 votes. Others say: No, he is missing a few votes; he is not \nquite there yet. And we are talking about a bill most of us haven't \neven seen. How in the world can anybody tell their constituents they \nare for the bill or against the bill before they have had a chance to \nread it? It is mind-boggling. Yet we know these closed-door meetings \nare still going on--8 days before Christmas--to work on perhaps a new \n2,000-page Reid bill.\n  I know some of our colleagues were irritated with our colleague from \nOklahoma, who asked that the Sanders amendment be read before we \nactually considered it. Only in Washington, DC, would people be mad \nabout knowing what is in a bill or an amendment before we are asked to \nvote on it. The American people want to know. They are being excluded, \nas are many of the rest of us who don't get to know what is being \ncooked up behind closed doors.\n  We know these private meetings continue. The President has had \nmeetings with our Democratic colleagues from which Republicans have \nbeen excluded. We don't know what kinds of agreements or discussions \nwere occurring behind those closed doors. Certainly, no C-SPAN cameras \nwere allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we need to have every single Senator look \nat what is in these bills before we are asked to vote on them.\n  Let me close on one last issue. The President has also said:\n\n       First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our \n     deficits--either now or in the future. Period.\n\n  Unfortunately, because of this cynical attitude of Washington and of \nthe political class in Washington toward the public generally, 74 \npercent of voters said they don't believe that. Seventy-four percent of \nvoters, including 82 percent of Independents, are saying: We don't \nbelieve the President of the United States when he says the bill will \nnot add one dime to the deficit.\n  One reason they might think that is because of what this Reid bill--\nat least the 2,000-page variety--says. The Chief Actuary for CMS says \nthat pledge is ``unrealistic and doubtful.'' David Broder, one of the \ndeans of the Washington press corps, said:\n\n       These bills, as they stand now, are budget-busters.\n\n  I don't know what it is going to take before Congress wakes up and \nlistens to our constituents and the American people. I guess it is \ngoing to take another election in 2010 or in 2012 where the American \npeople get to hold us accountable because in the end the American \npeople will get the kind of Congress they want and the kind of Congress \nthey deserve. I hope it will be the kind of Congress that embraces the \ntransparency pledges the President has made and, in reality, lets the \nAmerican people know what we are doing here and asks whether they \napprove.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to the \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate. We hear a lot about what is \nwrong these days. For a moment, let me say that there is a lot right in \nthis country as well.\n  We are in a deep economic recession. I understand that. This is the \ndeepest recession we have seen since the Great Depression. It is a \ndifficult circumstance. But this country has been in tough \ncircumstances before. The American people are a resilient bunch; they \npull themselves up and move forward.\n  I understand the angst and the concern across this country. I \nunderstand the debate in the Chamber about what is wrong. I would be \nthe first to say I don't think either political party is a great \nbargain sometimes. Both of them have their faults.\n  I think of that Ogden Nash poem that goes like this:\n\n     He drinks because she [scolds],\n     He thinks she [scolds] because he drinks,\n     She thinks while neither will admit what's\n     [really] true that he's a [drunk] and she's a shrew.\n\n  Both political parties, it seems to me, have faults, but both \npolitical parties have also contributed to the well-being of this \ncountry.\n  When I hear people say nothing works in America--I answered phones at \nthe front desk yesterday for a while to hear from callers calling in \nabout various things. I heard it on many occasions because a lot of \npeople on the radio and on TV are saying nothing works in America and \nthere is nothing the Federal Government has ever done that works.\n  The Internet--what a wonderful invention in the life of our planet. \nYes, that was created by the Federal Government. Going way back, we \nbrought electricity to America's farms and unleashed a barrage of \nproductivity in American agriculture. When you drive around with a \nlocator on the dashboard of your car, that is a GPS satellite--that is \nthe government as well. The Interstate Highway System that connects \nAmerica--when you drive down big roads that are connecting all of \nAmerica, that is the Interstate Highway System, suggested by President \nDwight D. Eisenhower. What a remarkable thing.\n\n  I also think of the story I read a while back about those two little \ncreatures that are crawling around the planet Mars, one called Spirit \nand one called Opportunity. Five years ago, our country sent both of \nthem to land on the surface of Mars. They landed 1 week apart. They are \ndune buggy-sized mechanical creatures on the surface of Mars. We sent \nthem up by a rocket. They landed encased in a shroud, and they bounced \nand the shroud opened up and these dune buggy-sized vehicles began \ndriving on the surface of Mars. They were expected to last 90 days. \nFive years later, Spirit and Opportunity have been driving on the \nsurface of Mars collecting samples. One of them--I believe Spirit--had \nan arm that looked as if it was arthritic, so it was hanging at an \nangle, almost like a salute. The wheel broke, and so they were dragging \nthe wheel and creating a trench. The arm reached back, and the \nscientist--it takes 9 minutes to send up a signal--the scientist had \nthe arm reach back and dig into the trench so they could get better \nsamples on the surface of Mars. These dune buggies were running on the \nsurface of Mars. Yes, that is the Federal Government and all the \ncontractors.\n  When somebody said to me that the Federal Government has never done \nanything right, I said: If you ever get to the Moon, just check the \nboot prints. They are not Chinese or Russian; they are made by an \nAmerican astronaut--the one who planted the American flag there.\n  There is plenty wrong in this country, to be sure, but there is a lot \nright about this country.\n  About 9 years ago, at the start of this decade, our country had a \nbudget surplus. Poor Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, wasn't able to sleep. He was worried that we were going \nto pay down the debt too quickly. I assured him he ought to go to sleep \npeacefully because that is not a problem.\n  President Bush came to town and said: We are going to do very big tax \ncuts because it is estimated that we are going to have very big \nsurpluses. I was one on the floor who said maybe we ought not do that. \nLet's be a little conservative. These surpluses don't exist for the \nnext 10 years yet. They existed that year for the first time in a long \ntime in the year 2000--a budget surplus. President Bush said: No, we \nare going to begin very large tax cuts right now in anticipation of \nthese surpluses in the future. Some of us said:\n\n[[Page S13359]]\n\nBe careful. The wealthiest Americans got very large tax cuts, \nespecially.\n  Almost immediately, this country went into a recession, and 6 months \nafter that, this country was hit with 9/11, an unbelievable terrorist \nattack. Almost immediately, we went into the country of Afghanistan to \ngo after Osama bin Laden. Then, very quickly, we invaded Iraq. We were \nat war for the rest of the decade without paying for one penny of it. \nNot a penny was paid for those wars or the increased funding to deal \nwith terrorist attacks.\n  Some of us went to the floor of the Senate and said: Let's begin to \ntry to pay for some of this. Why should we send our men and women to \nwar and decide we won't ask anybody to pay for it? They thought we will \njust have the kids and grandkids pay the cost. The President said: If \nyou add this to the bill to pay for it, I will veto the bill. So here \nwe are.\n  Then we see, at exactly the same time, regulators coming to town \nboasting that they were willing to be willfully blind and they would \nnot look or see and they would not care. We had a bunch of big high \nfliers create unbelievably exotic financial industries, such as credit \ndefault swaps and liars loans for mortgages, and they steered this \ncountry right into a ditch while the people at the top were making a \nlot of money, causing economic havoc the likes of which we have not \nseen since the 1930s. Our revenue at the Federal Government dropped \n$400 billion because of the deep recession. Expenditures for \nunemployment, food stamps, and so on, which are caused to go up during \nrecessions, increased substantially, and we have very serious economic \nproblems. There is no question about that. I can recite the problems as \nwell as anybody. But let's also, from time to time, recite the strength \nof this country. It requires leadership from all of us to put this \ncountry back on track. I am convinced we can. I am convinced we will do \nthat. We need a little cooperation here and there. There is not much \nthese days. But I am convinced all of us want the same thing for this \ngreat country, and perhaps we can come together even if we have \ndifferent views of how to get to that common destination. I am \nconvinced one of these days we will make some progress and put America \nfirst.\n\n  I wished to come today to talk about something that is happening half \naway around the world in Copenhagen. That is the issue of climate \nchange and energy. Even as leaders around the world gather in \nCopenhagen to talk about climate change, I wish to talk about the \nenergy legislation that addresses the issue of climate change. The \nenergy legislation that was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee earlier this year is a real energy policy that also \nprotects the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  We are not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because somebody \nsigns a paper. We have a lot of environmental laws. Mexico is a good \nexample. They have a lot of environmental laws on the books. They are \njust not enforced. Signing a paper is not going to mean much unless you \nhave an agreement that makes sense for the planet and an agreement that \nis enforced and an agreement that is agreed to by virtually all the \ncountries that are emitting a great deal of carbon.\n  I will tell you what will make a big difference; that is, for the \nCongress to pass the Senate Energy legislation, which truly does move \nus in the direction of addressing climate change.\n  That energy policy, by the way, is not some secretive policy. This \npast June we passed an energy bill out of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that does all the things I think we need to--or \nvirtually all the things--address the issue of climate change and a \nlower carbon future. But it was not brought to the floor of the Senate \nor the House of Representatives because we are told energy legislation \nmust be married or merged with climate change. I do not agree with \nthat. We are going to have wasted a year, in my judgment, in which we \ncould have debated the energy legislation on the floor of the Senate, \nand passed it into law by the signature of the President. This energy \nlegislation maximizes the use of renewable energy, such as the building \nof the interstate transmission capability that would allow us to \nmaximize renewable energy. The energy legislation would also establish \na renewable electricity standard, the first one in the history of this \ncountry. The energy legislation would also retrofit buildings to make \nthem more energy efficient, which would increase energy savings. I also \noffered an amendment to this legislation, that would also give us the \nability to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by opening oil and gas \nproduction in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\n  All these issues are in an energy bill that passed the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee on a bipartisan vote. Yet the benefits \nto this country from those energy policies that make a lot of sense, \nwill not be available during this year, because those who are pushing \nfor climate change legislation here say you have to do energy and \nclimate change together.\n  I say this: I hope when we turn the corner and start a new year, that \nan energy bill that is bipartisan--Mr. President, I had indicated I \nwished to take 20 minutes today. I ask consent for the 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation that exists and is ready, \nin my judgment, could be signed by the President and already moving \nthis country down the road. The deliverable for the President to go to \nCopenhagen could have been: Look what we have done in energy policy; we \nhave taken the significant step in the right direction. Yet we are told \nthat energy legislation has to move with climate change legislation.\n  I am not opposed to a lower carbon future. I am not opposed to trying \nto do something on climate change legislation. I have indicated I am \nnot supportive of the trade piece of cap and trade. I have no interest \nin consigning to Wall Street the opportunity to have a $1 trillion \ncarbon securities market that they could trade on Monday and Tuesday, \nand then they can tell us on Wednesday and Thursday how much we are \ngoing to pay for our energy. I have no interest in creating a carbon \nsecurities market.\n  There are a lot of things we can do, especially an energy policy at \nthe front end--and I hope early next year--we will advance this \ncountry's energy security, No. 1, and advance this country's movement \ntoward a lower carbon future.\n  I wish to put up a couple charts as I describe this. We must reduce \nour dependence on foreign energy, especially foreign oil. Seventy \npercent of the oil we use comes from off our shores. We sink straws in \nthe planet and suck oil out. We suck out 85 million barrels a day, and \none-fourth has to come to this country because of our appetite for oil.\n  You know what, when 70 percent of it comes from other countries--many \nthat do not like us very much--that means we have an energy security \nproblem. This Energy bill I have described, that has been out of the \nEnergy Committee since June, and was passed on a bipartisan vote, \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil, increases domestic production, \nestablishes a renewable electricity standard, and creates a \ntransmission superhighway. By the way, in the last 9 years, we have \nlaid 11,000 miles of natural gas pipeline in this country--11,000 \nmiles. Do you know how many miles we have laid of high-voltage \ntransmission lines interstate? Mr. President, 668. On this bill, I \nworked on the transmission piece with Senator Jeff Bingaman and others \nand we solved the issue of transmission.\n  We can get about the business of building an interstate highway of \ntransmission lines so you can produce electricity where the Sun shines \nand the wind blows, put it on a wire and move it to where it is needed \nin the load centers.\n  This is not rocket science. This is rather simple. We already passed \na bipartisan bill out of committee to do this. Electrification and \ndiversification of our vehicle fleet is in the bill. The legislation \nalso enhances energy efficiency in a wide range of areas, it expands \nclean energy technology, and the training of an energy workforce for \ntomorrow.\n  Every one of us gets up in the morning and the first thing we do is \nflick a switch and all of a sudden there is light. Then many decide to \nplug in a coffee maker or turn on the stove, turn on the radio, turn on \nthe television set,\n\n[[Page S13360]]\n\nget in the car, put in a key, the engine turns on--all of this is \nbecause of energy, and that is before you get to work. No one even \nthinks about the role energy plays in our life. That is why it is \nimportant for us to understand we have a very serious energy security \nissue in this country. No. 2, we have a serious issue of the need to \nconstruct new kinds of energy and also to use the existing energy \ndifferently or produce energy differently and reduce carbon emissions.\n  I chair the committee that funds most of our energy projects. I chair \nthe Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. It funds the \nenergy and water issues, obviously. There is a lot going on, for \nexample, that I think is so exciting that can unlock our opportunity to \ncontinue to use coal. Some say you cannot use coal. Of course, you can. \nOur science and our technology can clearly decarbonize the use of coal, \nwhich is our most abundant resource. Why would we not want to use coal \nin the future?\n  There are unbelievable things going on Dr. Craig Venter, a scientist \nnot far from here, is working on this issue: developing synthetic \nmicrobes that underground would turn coal into methane. These microbes \nwould consume the coal and turn it into methane. Pretty interesting to \nme.\n  There is a guy in California who has an idea, a patented idea I don't \nknow if it works, but they insist it is the silver bullet. He takes the \nentire flue gas from a coal plant and he mineralizes it through some \npatented process he has. It does not separate CO2. It \nmineralizes all of it and turns it into a product that is harder than \nconcrete and more valuable than concrete and produces, as a result, the \ncost of carbon at almost near zero. Maybe that is the silver bullet. I \ndon't know. There are dozens of examples like it that are very exciting \nand very interesting.\n\n  I started algae research after it had been discontinued for 15 \nyears--single-cell pond scum, that green scum on the pond out on the \nfarm--algae. You take the CO2 that is released from a coal \nplant, feed it to an algae farm and grow algae. It increases its bulk \nin hours. Then you can harvest the algae and produce diesel fuel. Get \nrid of the CO2 and produce a fuel. That is called value \nadded. That is called beneficial use of carbon.\n  There are others now--Dr. Craig Venter is involved in this, along \nwith Exxon--who have projects in which they create algae that excretes \nlipids directly. Instead of harvesting algae and destroying it for the \npurpose of acquiring a diesel fuel, it excretes lipids directly which, \nwith very little manipulation, is a fuel.\n  One of the scientists with the Sandia National Laboratory talked \nabout the development of a solar heat engine in which you put \nCO2 on one side and water on the other and you fracture the \nmolecules and thermochemically recombine them and you have methanol--\nwater, CO2, develop a fuel.\n  All these ideas are opportunities for us to continue to use coal and \nat the same time reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  My point is, I think we ought to be doing a lot of everything with \nrespect to producing a better energy future for this country and with \nrespect to reducing the carbon in our future. I am not somebody who is \na naysayer about climate change at all. I expect to be a part of \ndiscussions about how to reduce carbon in our future. But I do believe \nit will be a profound mistake if we do not advance the very policies we \nhave the opportunity to advance in the Congress, in the Senate, the \nvery policies that move us in the direction of reducing carbon and \nmaking us more energy secure.\n  To date, what we have had is all this breathlessness about you have \nto do a climate change bill right now and you cannot take up energy \nlegislation until you take up climate change legislation. You know \nwhat, I do not agree.\n  I hope that high on the list of the agenda next year for this \nCongress is to say: We have a serious energy security problem and we \nhave a serious issue with respect to carbon. Let's deal with both. If \nanybody believes this country can continue to have a 70-percent \naddiction for oil from foreign countries, they are dreaming. That is \nnot something that will be sustainable in the long term. It undermines \nthis country's economy to have that kind of addiction to foreign oil.\n  So how do we address this issue and fix it? We address it with \nthoughtful policies inside this country--to increase efficiency, \nincrease conservation, increase production, and increase production in \nthe right way that protects our planet. All these things are possible.\n  I guess I have spoken six or eight times on the Senate floor about \nthese issues, not that anybody is listening so much I guess. But it is \nall health care all the time right now. Health care is not unimportant. \nI happen to think among the first things on the agenda is, A, financial \nreform which restores confidence. That was important because a bunch of \nhigh fliers steered this country into the ditch. We have to make sure \npeople think that will not happen again; then, second, restarting the \neconomic engine and putting people to work--jobs; third, dealing with \nenergy which has to do with the very security of virtually everything \nwe do to create jobs in this country. All these are important issues.\n  My hope is, when the calendar turns and January comes, we will have \nthe opportunity to grab and seize the progress that was made in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, now nearly 6 months ago, \nto do the right thing for this country and to do the right thing to \naddress climate change at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor on behalf of over \n10,000 constituents from my home State of Washington who have sent me \nletters and e-mails over the past 6 months to tell me their stories and \ntheir struggles with our health care system.\n  I come to the floor on behalf of the thousands who do not have the \ntime or who do not have the resources to write to me and ask for help \nbut who are struggling as well.\n  I come to the floor on behalf of small business owners, parents, \nsenior citizens, and people with preexisting conditions, people with \ninsurance whose premiums are skyrocketing, and people without insurance \nwho spend their nights praying they do not have an accident or fall \nill.\n  These people are all worried about keeping their jobs or making a \nmortgage payment and for whom the cost of getting sick today or being \ndropped from their health care plan or opening their mail to see \nanother premium increase is too much to bear. Those are the people who \ndeserve a real debate and a real plan, not distortions or silly \ndistractions, such as conversations about how many pages are in this \nhealth care bill. What is more important than the number of pages in \nthis health care bill is the help within those pages for businesses and \nfamilies across this country.\n  I have watched, day after day, as our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have come down to this floor. They have made outrageous \nclaims. They have handed out reams of paper and stacked copies of the \nSenate bill on top of copies of the House bill to try and turn a \nserious debate into a sideshow. But if my colleagues on the other side \nwant to focus on pages, fine, let's focus on pages.\n  Beside me is a photo of a woman named Doreen Kelsey. In front of \nDoreen is a stack of papers. Those are hundreds upon hundreds of pages \nof forms and rejection letters and appeals and denials from her \ninsurance company. These are pages that have taken hours and hours to \nfill out and that have stood between Doreen's husband and the care he \ndesperately needed.\n\n  I met Doreen at a roundtable I hosted in August in Spokane, WA, in my \nState. Doreen told me she is self-employed and isn't able to purchase \nher own health insurance because she has a preexisting condition. Now, \nluckily, she and her family have health insurance coverage through her \nhusband Tony's employer. She told me she and Tony thought their family \nhad good insurance coverage. But when he asked for a colonoscopy, they \nsoon discovered the lengths to which insurance companies will go to \ndeny, to delay, and to dispute the care families such as the Kelseys \nassumed were included in their coverage.\n  Their insurance carrier told them before they would pay for this \npreventive care, it would have to be approved by a primary care \nphysician. After being delayed for more than a month because of\n\n[[Page S13361]]\n\nthat requirement--and this whole stack of papers here--the colonoscopy \nultimately confirmed their fears, and he was diagnosed with stage 4 \ncolon cancer. With that diagnosis in hand, the Kelseys were determined \nto beat this terrible disease together, but rather than focusing on \nfighting cancer they were forced to fight their insurance company.\n  Doreen told me although they had faithfully paid their premiums \nthroughout their entire working lives, now that Tony desperately needed \nlifesaving treatment, he was in a constant struggle of paperwork with \nhis insurance company to pay for even routine care. They weren't asking \nfor anything new, they weren't asking for anything experimental, they \nwere just asking for the care that a lifetime of paid premiums should \nhave entitled them to.\n  The Kelseys assumed what most Americans do when they are paying for \ngood health insurance. They assumed that while their insurance was \nexpensive, it would be there for them when they needed it. Well, Doreen \nand her family, like many other American families and businesses, have \ncome to find out that in our current health care insurance system, \nstability is sometimes nothing more than an illusion.\n  With each procedure and each battle, the Kelseys faced a new fight--\nmore paperwork stacked on more paperwork, another appeal and another \nappeal. At one point, Doreen told me she had to appeal all the way to \nthe State insurance regulator just to get a corrected explanation of \nbenefits form--paperwork--from her insurance company. She told me they \nhad to borrow thousands of dollars to pay doctors while their claims \nwere tied up in what seemed like an endless appeal process--paperwork.\n  The Kelseys' insurance now costs more than their mortgage, and they \nare constantly worried that Tony's employer will drop that coverage. \nBut, thankfully, she told me Tony is working hard and successfully \nbattling his cancer. In the meantime, Doreen has successfully been \nbattling her insurance company. But this isn't how our system should \nwork. When we pass the Senate's health care reform bill we are \ndebating, it will not be.\n  Let me tell everyone--and the Kelseys--how our bill will help them. \nFirst of all, our bill ends insurance company discrimination for \npreexisting conditions, so Doreen will be able to purchase insurance on \nher own and not have to rely on her husband's employer. Doreen would \nalso have access to a number of different plans through an exchange \nthat we are setting up where insurance companies, for the first time, \nwould have to compete for her business. Our plan would inject \ncompetition into the insurance market, and we know that will lower \ncosts and give families such as Doreen's more choices.\n  Our plan also makes it illegal for insurance companies to drop people \nwhen they get sick, so Doreen and Tony wouldn't have to worry about \nlosing their coverage at the moment they need it the most. Since we \nknow that preventive care is critical to saving lives and saving money \non health care costs in the long term, our bill ensures free preventive \nservices under all insurance plans.\n  Our plan invests in prevention and in public health to encourage \ninnovations in health care that prevent illness and disease before they \nrequire more costly treatment. It would have allowed Tony to get a \ncolonoscopy when he first needed it so he could get his treatment \nstarted sooner.\n  Mr. President, we also know families deserve the security and \nstability of knowing that if they or their loved one do get sick, they \nwill not be forced into bankruptcy to pay for the cost. Our bill \nrestricts the arbitrary limits that insurance companies currently place \non the amount of coverage families receive. It caps the total amount \nthat insurance companies can make people pay out of pocket on copays \nand deductibles. And it eliminates the lifetime limits insurance \ncompanies can impose on coverage.\n  In addition to putting in place those important consumer protections \nthat would help people such as Doreen and Tony, it will give families \nthe stability and security they deserve and lower the cost of care so \nAmericans such as Tony and Doreen would not have coverage that costs as \nmuch or more than their mortgage. We do that by putting in place \npremium rate reviews to track increases and crack down on excessive \ninsurance company overhead costs.\n  When our bill passes--and I am confident it will, despite the delay \nand the delay and the delay that we are seeing on the other side of the \naisle--insurance companies will no longer be able to hike up Doreen's \npremiums to pay for a bureaucracy they will then put to work battling \nher claims.\n  We also provide sliding scale premium tax credits--tax credits--for \nfamilies who still can't afford coverage, which would help 450,000 \npeople in my home State of Washington get the coverage they need.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us today--which some of my colleagues \nhave sitting on their desks and they bring out here on a daily basis to \nshow us the pages--will help families such as the Kelseys. That is what \nis within the pages of the bill they keep throwing at us. So I think, \nrather than talking about the number of pages in the bill, our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle might actually want to talk \nabout what is in the bill because right now, instead of debating the \nmerits of bringing down costs or protecting families from losing the \ncoverage when they get sick, our colleagues are actually spending time \ncomplaining this bill has too many pages.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to take a look at this photo of Doreen sitting next to \nhundreds and hundreds of pages of correspondence and appeals and fights \nwith her insurance company. These are the pages we ought to be talking \nabout. These are the pages that impact people's lives, and the Kelseys \nare the people we ought to be talking about.\n  So when my colleagues come down here and complain about the number of \npages in our health reform bill--those pages that will help our \nfamilies and businesses lower costs--I want them to think about the \nnumber of pages right here in front of Doreen. These are pages that \nhave caused the Kelseys unimaginable heartache, and these are the pages \nthat have come between them and the health care they paid for.\n  These are the numbers we ought to be focusing on--the 14,000 people \nwho are losing coverage every day. These are the numbers we ought to be \nfocusing on--the 51 million people who have no insurance. Those are the \nnumbers we ought to be focusing on, not the number of pages in the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we have to end the politics, end the delay and the \npartisanship. We need to end this obstruction because that is what the \nKelseys faced every day, delay and obstruction. They are facing it \nagain on the floor of the Senate. It is time for us to come together on \nthis important bill and bring our businesses and our families the \ninsurance reform they have been asking for. I hope that is what \nAmericans will remember at the end of the day, that the pages in this \nbill are going to change their lives so they don't have to fight their \ninsurance companies again.\n  Mr. President, we are here today in the Senate--nobody on the floor, \njust me talking about what we ought to be doing, and you in the Chair, \nwaiting. Why? Because we have a Defense appropriations bill in front of \nthe Senate. It is a Defense appropriations bill that needs to be passed \nby the end of this year. It needs to be passed so we can get back on \nthe floor and pass our health care reform bill.\n  Some people on the other side of the aisle have decided that delaying \nthis Defense bill will somehow help them delay this from ever being \npassed--the health care bill that would help Doreen and her family. \nWell, Mr. President, it isn't just about making a political point. What \nwe are doing is having our soldiers--who are serving on the ground in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, around the globe and here in our country--wonder \nwhat they are going to get for Christmas--a delay from the Senate?\n  The bill in front of us provides a 3.4-percent military pay increase. \nThis is an All-Volunteer Force we have out there working for us. Many \nof them are away from their families this Christmas. They do not want \nto hear that the Senate is delaying passing this important bill that \nwill give them the security they need because of political obstruction \nin order to delay a health care bill.\n\n[[Page S13362]]\n\n  This Defense bill is critically important. It has very important \nsupport for our military and their families. It has passed through this \nSenate before, and we are ready now to make the final trip to the White \nHouse, which needs to be done, by the way, by tomorrow. So I hope our \ncolleagues will not continue to delay. I hope they will allow us to \nmove to final passage on this bill so our men and women who are serving \nus in the military and around the globe know there is a Senate who is \nworking for them.\n  I have heard some of them on the other side complain that some things \nwere added to the Senate Defense bill--that also need to be done by the \nend of the year, besides the Defense bill--such as making sure our \nfamilies, whose benefits are running out for unemployment, or COBRA for \nhealth care insurance, get a 2-month extension. So should our Christmas \npresent to them be: Sorry, you aren't going to get your small little \nhelp as we end this year. We want to keep that going for another 3 \nmonths during one of the worst economic times we have seen. So, of \ncourse, we put it in this bill.\n  Because of the obstruction on the other side, we can't get it through \nin a timely fashion. It has to be done by the end of this year. We are \ndoing the right thing for our families. We are doing the right thing \nfor our military by putting it in this bill and getting it done and to \nthe President so we can finish our work.\n  Mr. President, these are all critical issues. We are all tired. We \nhave been here day after day after day. It is time to get this done. \nLet me tell you why. Because Doreen and her husband are facing piles \nand piles of paperwork to care for her husband. They are fighting their \ninsurance company. And all we have to do is put these bills in front of \nus, get them done, and provide some relief for America. I hope that is \nwhat we focus on, Mr. President. I hope we stop the deny and delay and \nobstruction that the Kelseys have had to fight with their insurance \ncompany. Let's move these bills and go home to our families for \nChristmas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I also would like to make a few comments \non the issue that is pending before this body and which has been \ndebated and debated and debated, discussed and discussed and discussed. \nIt is time to bring it to a meaningful and final conclusion.\n  As I address this Chamber today, we stand on the cusp of history. For \nmany years, we have known that the American health care system is badly \nbroken. Now, after nearly a century of debate, after 100 years of delay \nand false starts, this body is on the verge of laying the issue of \nhealth reform to a rest.\n  This bill represents the culmination of decades of hard work. Its \ncourse has been shaped by 11 Presidents and countless Members of the \nHouse and Senate. It has taken a long and winding path to reach this \npoint. This legislation is a product of compromise and consensus, of \ngive and take on both sides. It is not perfect; by no means is it \nperfect. But here we stand.\n  We have come further than any Congress in history on this issue. We \nhave worked hard to craft a measure that can accomplish the goals of \nreform without alienating those whose support we need to pass this \nbill. Without a commitment to certain ideals, this bill would be empty \nand ineffective. But without a willingness to work together and achieve \ncompromise, this bill can never become a political reality.\n  As responsible legislators, this is the fine line we must always \nwalk. It is never easy. I applaud my colleagues for the fine work they \nhave done at every step along the way. Still, not everyone is \nsatisfied, so the work goes on. It is the genius of our Founding \nFathers and the rules of this body that allow one Senator to keep \ndebate alive so we can work, debate, write, rewrite legislation \ntogether. One Senator can do that under the rules of this body.\n  Some have suggested that we kill this legislation and start over. \nThey suggest that we stop and come up with something new. They say \nwithout perfection we should give up on reform altogether.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor, Mr. President. You know what my \nposition has been. But giving up on this issue is not an option. So as \nmy colleagues and I continue to move forward from here, I would like to \nmake one thing very clear. After 100 years of debate, we have come too \nfar and worked too hard to turn back now. Too many Americans are \ncounting on us to make a decision on their behalf. They need it now. \nThey don't need it tomorrow or next week or next month or next year or \nnever--they need it now. Killing the bill would ignore those who look \nto us for help in their time of crisis. We cannot abandon them at this \ntime. Leaving tens of millions of people without any health coverage at \nall is also unacceptable.\n  To all those who believe we should kill this bill I would say this: I \nunderstand their frustration, the impulse to say enough is enough. But \nour vote in this body on this bill is not the end of a path for this \nsweeping legislation, only a door to the next step of conference.\n  I have not yet seen the details of the legislation. I have not yet \nseen the CBO score. I have not yet seen the provisions that will earn \nmy vote; namely, cost containment, competition, and accountability. It \nis only through keeping this legislation alive that we can continue our \nwork to make this a more perfect document. I say we must continue to \nwork on this document we have before us. We cannot kill this \nlegislation and start over. We must keep working through this \nlegislation, keeping it alive so we can continue--continue--to make \nthis document what we want it to be. That is what we must do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I speak today about the need for urgent \naction on the Defense appropriations bill. I shouldn't have to speak \nabout urgent action on the Defense appropriations bill because this is \nthe one area that is so important to the country and on which we should \nalways operate as quickly as we can. I urge my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to stop their attempts to derail the health care bill \nand allow the Defense appropriations bill to move forward.\n  As always, I respect that my colleagues have different views. We have \ndifferent views on all kinds of issues. We have all kinds of \nsubstantive differences. I am one of the people in this body who \nbelieve there are basic differences, and a lot of them are not \npolitical, they are about basic differences that separate us from being \nDemocrats and Republicans. We can disagree on tactics and on \nprinciples, but I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsupport our troops, and the support of our troops should never be a \npartisan issue.\n  This bill funds more than $100 billion for operations, maintenance \nrequirements, and military personnel requirements for our armed action \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. It provides more than $23 billion for \nequipment critical for protecting the brave men and women in uniform--\nand they are brave men and women and they deserve this. I know the \nother side of the aisle agrees with that. That is why we should move \nahead on this bill. It funds more than $150 billion for the training of \nour troops, critical to our success. It is incumbent upon the Congress \nto ensure that our troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout the \nworld have the resources they need to be safe, secure, and effective in \nthe war zone.\n  This bill has been operated and worked on by both parties. It puts \nour troops first, with the necessary equipment and improved benefits \nfor the military and their families. This isn't just about our troops; \nthis is about the brave men and women who remain at home, the families \nwho need the benefits--again, issues I know my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle agree with. They deserve our support and they deserve \nit now.\n  In addition to providing a 3.4-percent pay increase for our troops, \nit also improves military health care and research, including for the \nvery important psychological health, which is especially important, \ngiven the startling\n\n[[Page S13363]]\n\nrates of post-traumatic stress disorder. Everybody knows we must train \nand equip our troops, our men and women going into battle, but it is \nequally important--and everyone agrees with this, too--it is equally \nimportant to care for the troops and their families after they return \nhome. That is what this bill does.\n  This bill is necessary, as it demonstrates solidarity with the troops \nand gratitude for the sacrifices they make on our behalf. It is an \ninvestment in our military, in our security, and in our future. That is \nwhy our House colleagues overwhelmingly agreed to it yesterday by a \nvote of 395 to 34 and why we must end these partisan delays to move \nthis bill forward.\n  It is critical we pass the bill, and there is no good reason why our \ntroops and military families should have to wait--especially in this \nholiday season--while the other side of the aisle is playing politics.\n  I support conducting a real debate on Afghanistan with a host of \nother military issues, but the current debate is not about substance, \nit is about politics. Our troops should come first and they deserve \nbetter. We should pass this bill without delay to give the military and \ntheir families the funding they need to do their jobs and to protect \nour Nation.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Fraud\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss health care fraud. \nEarlier this month, I introduced, along with Senators Leahy, Specter, \nKohl, Schumer, and Klobuchar, an amendment that will protect our \nincreased national investment in the health of Americans by improving \nfraud enforcement. Everyone believes in fraud enforcement, and this \namendment does that.\n  It is no secret fraud represents one of the fastest growing and most \ncostly forms of crime in America today. In no small part, our current \neconomic crisis can be linked to financial fraud, starting with \nunchecked mortgage fraud generated by loan originators, through \nsecurities fraud that hastened the eventual market crash and maximized \nits impact on Main Street and average American investors.\n  In response, this body passed the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act, \nFERA, which directed critical resources and tools to antifinancial \nfraud efforts.\n  FERA was passed in response to an unprecedented financial crisis, but \nAmericans should expect Congress to do more than simply react to crises \nafter their most destructive impacts have already been felt. We owe it \nto our constituents to identify and address problems when they arise so \nwe can prevent disaster rather than just trying to figure out how to \nclean up after it happens.\n  In undertaking comprehensive health care reform, we must be proactive \nin combating health care fraud and abuse.\n  It is hard to believe, but each year criminals drain between $72 \nbillion and $220 billion--that is billion dollars--between $72 billion \nand $220 billion from private and public health care plans through \nfraud, increasing the costs of medical care and health insurance and \nundermining public trust in our health care system. We not only lose \nthe money, we lose the trust people have for the system that the system \nworks.\n\n  We pay these costs as taxpayers and through higher health insurance \npremiums. This amendment will provide needed tools to reduce those \ncosts through effective investigation, prosecution, and punishment of \nhealth care fraud.\n  It is pretty clear that as we take steps to increase the number of \nAmericans who are covered by health insurance and to improve the health \ncare system for everyone, we must also ensure that law enforcement has \nthe tools it needs to stop health care fraud.\n  The Finance and HELP Committees, as well as leadership, have worked \nlong and hard to find ways to fight fraud and bend the cost curve down. \nThey have done a great job. However, there is more work to be done, and \nthis amendment is an important additional step.\n  This amendment makes straightforward but critical improvements to the \nFederal Sentencing Guidelines, to health care fraud statutes, and to \nforfeiture, money laundering, and obstruction statutes, all of which \nwould strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat health care fraud.\n  First, this amendment directs a significant increase in the Federal \nSentencing Guidelines for large-scale health care fraud offenses.\n  It is really kind of strange, but despite the enormous losses in many \nhealth care fraud cases, analysis from the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nsuggests that health care fraud offenders often receive shorter \nsentences than other white-collar offenders in cases with similar loss \namounts. So people basically feel you can do health care fraud and get \naway with it and you will not pay a major price. According to \nstatements from cooperating health care fraud defendants, many \ncriminals are drawn to health care fraud because of this low risk-to-\nreward ratio.\n  As we have an incredible expansion of health care that will go \nforward, with more funds, we know criminals out there think this is \neasy. They think: I can go out and commit fraud. It is a very complex \nprocess, but I commit the fraud. My chances of getting caught are not \nthat great, but even more, I have an added bonus that, if I get caught, \nI will not get much of a penalty.\n  That is why we need to ensure these offenders are punished not only \ncommensurate with the costs they impose upon our health care system but \nalso at a level that will offer a real deterrence. These folks believe \nthey can engage in health care fraud and even if they get caught they \nwill not have much of a penalty. Our amendment directs changes in the \nsentencing guidelines that, as a practical matter, amount to between 20 \nand 50 percent for health care crooks stealing over $1 million.\n  In addition, the amendment updates the definition of ``health care \nfraud offense'' in the Federal Criminal Code to include violations of \nthe antikickback statute, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and certain \nprovisions of ERISA.\n  These changes will allow the full range of law enforcement tools to \nbe used against all health care fraud.\n  The amendment also provides the Department of Justice with subpoena \nauthority for investigations conducted pursuant to the Civil Rights for \nInstitutionalized Persons Act, also known as CRIPA.\n  It is hard to believe, but under current law the Department of \nJustice must rely upon the cooperation of the nursing homes, mental \nhealth institutions, facilities for persons with disabilities, and \nresidential schools for children with disabilities that are the targets \nof CRIPA investigations. You can figure out that in most cases these \ntargets will cooperate, but sometimes they may not. The current lack of \nsubpoena authority puts vulnerable victims at needless risk.\n  Finally, the amendment corrects an apparent drafting error by \nproviding that obstruction of criminal investigations involving \nadministrative subpoenas under HIPPA--the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act of 1996--should be treated in the same manner as \nobstruction of criminal investigations involving grand jury subpoenas.\n  As we consider and debate meaningful health care reform, we must \nensure criminals who engage in health care fraud, and those who think \nabout doing so, understand two things: If they engage in health care \nfraud, they are going to be faced with swift prosecution by more \nprosecutors and more folks who enforce the law, and when they are found \nguilty, they will face substantial punishment.\n  These commonsense provisions should be a central part of health care \nreform. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S13364]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the health \ncare bill that is pending. The Department of Defense bill is also \npending. It is the business we have on the floor today. I have no doubt \nthat at the appropriate time there will be a vote in support of funding \nour troops. I know that may come on Saturday after the time for debate \nhas run out.\n  I want to talk about the health care issue because it is the reason \nwe have been here for really most of the last month--voting every \nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday--is to talk about the health care bill, \ndebate the health care bill, ensure the American people know what is in \nthis health care bill, and ensure people start looking at the effect it \nis going to have on their businesses and their families. I can't think \nof anything we have ever voted on in this body since I have been here \nthat will affect people's lives in such a personal way.\n  I have tried to look at what is good in the bill, and then I look at \nwhat I don't like in the bill, and I have to say the scale is very \nheavily tilted toward what I don't like.\n  In fact, I had a tele-townhall meeting, which is a new capability we \nhave to talk to people. It is a wonderful way to be able to reach out \nin your State to people who are interested in asking questions and \nactually call them and let them ask their question. At all times during \nthe tele-townhall I had last night, there were over 6,000 people who \nwere in and out of that tele-townhall meeting. I was very pleased \nbecause every single question was a real question, a real person. One \nman who called is on kidney dialysis treatments. He has very high drug \ncosts and high expenses. Then we had people on Medicare asking how the \ncuts in Medicare would affect their treatment and their care. Then we \nhad small businesspeople who are scared to death of having more \nburdens, more taxes, and more mandates on their small businesses. Some \nwere almost screaming into the phone: But don't people realize how hard \nit is to make ends meet right now for small business? Don't you all \nrealize we are trying to stay afloat while we are in one of the worst \nrecessions of our lifetime?\n  Of course, I assured them I do understand that. That is why I am \ntrying to amend this bill, trying to change it, trying to encourage my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that we should really start \nover and try to have a health care reform bill that does three basic \nthings.\n  We want a bill that actually lowers the cost of health care. Right \nnow, the bill before us will increase the cost of health care. The cost \nof the bill that is before us today, if you start with when the bill \ntakes effect, which is 2014, and you go 10 years out, you are looking \nat $2.5 trillion in costs.\n  We have a debt of $12 trillion in America right now. Those numbers \nare staggering. We used to be worried about $12 billion, $15 billion, \nand $100 billion; now we are talking about trillions of dollars. We are \ntalking about $12 trillion in debt right now. The idea that we would \nput $2.5 trillion more in this health care bill, which mandates taxes, \nto offset some of it, to businesses, employers, and families, is \nunthinkable. It is unthinkable in good times, but in the bad times we \nhave now, it is absolutely unthinkable. Here we are now talking about \nthis bill that will increase the debt and increase taxes and mandates.\n  In talking with the people of Texas, I did a little poll on the tele-\ntownhall. I said: Register in, punch 1 for yes, 2 for no, and 3 for \nundecided. I asked: Do you support the bill that is before us today? If \nyou say yes, press 1; no, press 2. Eighty-one percent instantly started \nregistering against this bill.\n  I was listening to my colleague, Senator Barrasso of Wyoming. He also \nhad a tele-townhall meeting for Wyoming. Many Senators are doing this \nnow. He had a couple of thousand people on the call. Ninety-three \npercent who registered on the poll were against this bill. My colleague \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Johanns, said the polls in Nebraska are \noverwhelmingly against this bill.\n  People are listening to the debate, reading the newspapers, getting \nevery bit of information they can, listening to the tele-townhall \nconference calls, they are asking their questions, and in unprecedented \nnumbers they are registering their interest and their overwhelming \nrejection of this bill.\n  I talked about what is in this bill and what we could have. Instead \nof $100 billion in new taxes, which would start next month, we could \nstep back and say we are not going to put new taxes on businesses and \nfamilies and companies before the bill even takes effect. In fact, \nSenator Thune and I had a motion that was rejected on the floor. It was \ntabled yesterday afternoon. It would have done exactly that. Very \nsimply, if the bill is going to pass, at least don't start the taxes \nuntil there is some program available that is as a result of the bill. \nIt is very simple and clear. That was our motion, and it was tabled, \nwith only 41 Senators saying yes, so we lost the motion.\n  It is of great concern to us that the tax increases in this bill \nstart next month--we will have over $100 billion in new taxes starting \nnext month--and that the 40-percent excise tax on premium health care \ncoverage policies takes effect in 2013 but the bill doesn't take effect \nuntil 2014.\n  That is the bill we are debating today, which an overwhelming number \nof American people are rejecting. They don't want taxes, mandates, and \nthey don't want the government to step between them and their doctors. \nThey want the physician-patient relationship that is the hallmark of \nAmerican health care. It is what makes us different from most other \ncountries in the world--that we don't have government standing in the \nway and most of our private plans don't say: No, you can't have this \ntreatment because you are too old or you are not fit enough, or having \nthe government say: Here is who is qualified for this procedure. That \nis not the health care we have known in America.\n  We are for health care reform that lowers the cost of health care in \nour country, and more people will have affordable options. There is a \npart of this bill that could provide that. It doesn't mean a government \ntakeover. We don't need a government takeover. That is why you have all \nthe taxes and mandates, because it will cost so much that taxes and \nmandates are the way the majority is putting forward to pay for this \nexpensive government takeover.\n  Why not have the health care exchange without all the mandates so \nthere would be a free market on the exchange with no cost that would \nallow people to have choices? The insurance companies would come \nforward and there would be high-deductible plans for people who wanted \nhigh-deductible plans, and there would be low-deductible plans that \nwould be more expensive, but some people would prefer to have that. You \ncould make your choices among the plans that would be put on an \nexchange that would be open, transparent, and competitive. You would \nhave bigger risk pools and, therefore, lower premiums would be the \nresult.\n  Talking about what Republicans wish to see in health care reform and \nasking the majority if we could stop going through every weekend with \none vote on Friday, one vote on Saturday, one vote on Sunday so that we \nare not able to do anything with our families during this holiday \nseason, instead why don't we step back and say we will come back after \nChristmas or whenever the majority wishes to come back and say: Let's \nsit down in a bipartisan way, and let's have three principles in a \nhealth care reform bill. No. 1, we would lower the cost with the \nexchange, bigger risk pools, lower costs. No. 2, how about tax credits \nfor every individual or family who would buy their own policies because \nthey don't have access through an employer or if they are going to go \non this exchange that would not cost anything, they would be able to \nhave a tax credit to buy their own health care coverage. That would \nincrease the number of people insured in our country, much larger than \nwe are looking at today with a big government-run plan, which is said \nto increase the number of insured 31 million, but leave 24 million \nuninsured. We could get 31 million with the free market working.\n  No. 3, what about medical malpractice reform? We could take $54 \nbillion out of the cost of health care by having frivolous lawsuits \ncurbed with some kind of reasonable limits on damages or attorneys fees \nthat would allow\n\n[[Page S13365]]\n\npeople to get some compensation for a transgression, but not something \nthat is going to raise the cost of premiums so high for doctors and \nhospitals that they have to order more medical tests and that raises \nthe cost of health care across the board.\n  Those would be the principles we could support. Let's start again \nafter Christmastime and do a rational proposal that the American people \nwould accept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is it any wonder that people \nare responding negatively when asked, Do you support health care, when \nthey have been bombarded with millions of dollars of TV advertisements \nthat are not telling what this health care bill does?\n  Is it any wonder when they hear comments such as this health care \nbill will not save the American consuming public on their health \ninsurance premiums? What does it do?\n  Can you believe that it is not going to allow insurance companies to \ncancel your policies?\n  Can you believe that it is not going to let an insurance company come \nup with some kind of fictitious excuse that you have had a skin rash \nand, therefore, you have a preexisting condition and they are not going \nto insure you?\n  Can you believe that it is going to bring in 3l million new people \nwho are going to have health insurance who did not have health \ninsurance before, and that all the rest of us paid for when they showed \nup at the emergency room?\n  Can you believe that this health care bill is going to bring down the \ncost of Medicare over the course of time and is going to save Medicare \ninstead of Medicare running out of funds in about 6 or 7 years?\n  Can you believe that by creating a health insurance exchange for the \nprivate marketplace for private health insurance companies to compete \nfor that available exchange of people who want to buy health insurance \nthere, it is going to bring down their health insurance premiums from \nwhat they would otherwise pay?\n  You probably say it is hard for me to believe that because of all the \nnegative I have heard. But that is exactly what the experts tell us \nthis bill is going to do. And, oh, by the way, it is going to do one \nmore thing. Over 10 years, this bill is going to reduce the deficit by \n$130 billion. Can you believe that? Not if you have been listening to \nall the stuff that has been thrown around about how bad the bill is. \nBut that is the tactic. That is the tactic of ``in your face,'' ``oh, \nain't it awful.'' It is time the real story gets out.\n  You know what will happen? When this bill is passed and it is finally \nsigned into law by the President, then the real story is going to get \nout and people will know. In the meantime, I wish that in the Senate we \ncould have closed the doughnut hole. The doughnut hole is the gap in \ncoverage for Medicare recipients where they have to continue to pay \npremiums for Medicare but they receive no drug coverage whatsoever.\n  Under current law, a Medicare beneficiary will pay up to $310 for \ntheir drugs, which is the deductible, and then they pay 25 percent of \ntheir drugs up until they have paid out a total out of their pocket of \n$940. Above that, they hit the dread doughnut hole and they continue to \npay premiums, but they receive no help from Medicare for their drugs \nall the way up to a much higher level. There are 3.5 million people who \nhit that dread doughnut hole.\n  Each year, because of the formulas, the doughnut hole grows bigger \nand it is compounded by higher and rising drug prices. We have seen \nthat the pharmaceutical industry has raised their prices 9 percent. \nThese out-of-control increases in prescription costs are hurting our \nfolks and especially seniors on fixed incomes.\n  It is no secret that I wanted to fill the doughnut hole. It is not \ngoing to happen. But what is going to happen when this gets into \nconference with the House of Representatives--in fact, there has been a \ncommitment by the majority leader, there has been a commitment and a \nstatement by AARP, which has a significant interest in this \nlegislation, there was a pledge on this floor by Senators Reid, Baucus, \nand Dodd to close the doughnut hole. I suspect that what has happened \nis, they have gotten the agreement of the pharmaceutical industry to \nhelp them close that doughnut hole once we get into the conference \ncommittee with the House of Representatives.\n  But first, we have to get the bill out of here. That means we have to \nstand up and push back all of this nonsense and misinformation that is \ncoming about this bill.\n  What does it do, to recapitulate. It lowers the cost of Medicare over \ntime. It gives a reduction of the Federal deficit. It allows insurance \nfor people who do not have it to be available and affordable and they \ncannot cancel or use some flimsy excuse to cancel. It will utilize the \nprivate marketplace in which to make this happen. This is an American \nstory, and it is going to be an American success story.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I contemplate the task ahead of us \nbetween now and Christmas to consider this huge change--some might say \nradical change--in our health care system, I am reminded of an oath \nthat doctors take called the Hippocratic oath, which basically is, \nfirst, do no harm. In other words, you don't want to kill the patient \nwhen you are trying to cure them of cancer. You don't want to disable a \npatient, make their condition actually worse than trying to help them. \nI think it would be advisable if Congress took a Hippocratic oath, and \nnowhere is that more appropriate than when talking about health care.\n  We ought to make sure whatever we do, we don't make things worse. Yet \nthe underlying health care bill, the Reid bill, makes things worse. I \nwill talk about that in detail.\n  We all agree health care reform is needed. Some of us have different \nideas about what reform should look like. We know health care premiums \nhave more than doubled in the last 10 years for American families and \nthat health care costs typically rise at two or three times the rate of \nwage growth. We also know this is all unsustainable. We can't keep \ndoing what we are doing. Republicans and Democrats agree on the nature \nof the problem. The question is, What is the cure? What are we going to \ndo to make it better? Are we, perhaps, due to inadvertence or \nunintended consequences, actually going to make things worse than they \nare now?\n  The Reid bill, the health care bill that will be considered along \nwith a substitute that has been negotiated behind closed doors and \nwhich we haven't seen, the basic Reid bill would actually increase \npremiums by $2,100 for American families purchasing insurance on their \nown.\n  I would like to recall the words of President Obama as he was \ndescribing his bill. He said:\n\n       I have made a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal \n     health care bill into law by the end of my first term as \n     president that will cover every American and cut the cost of \n     a typical family's premium by up to $2,500.\n\n  Yet this bill breaks President Obama's pledge because for an average \nAmerican family buying their insurance on their own, it would raise \ntheir premiums by $2,100. According to the CBO and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, all of the new taxes--the tax on health benefits, if you \nhave so-called Cadillac plans. I had three firefighters from Texas in \nmy office 2 days who said: Please don't let them tax our health care \nplans. We have negotiated those in lieu of wage increases. We accepted \nlower wages because we wanted a better health care plan. Now you are \ngoing to tax our health care plan. That is just not right.\n  We know those taxes on medical devices, on health insurance, whatever \nthey may be--on prescription drugs--eventually will find their way back \nto the consumer. It is sheer fantasy to think these companies are just \ngoing to absorb those taxes and those cuts and they would not have an \nimpact on\n\n[[Page S13366]]\n\nthe price to the consumer. That is why rather than bending the cost \ncurve down, making health care more affordable, this will actually make \nit worse.\n  A new independent study by Oliver Wyman found that the Reid bill \nwould actually increase insurance premiums for people with insurance. \nAgain, I thought the purpose of health care reform was to bring costs \ndown through managed care, medical homes, accountable care \norganizations, delivery reform, medical liability reform, parity of tax \ntreatment, increased competition across State lines. Those are the \nkinds of things this bill does not do which would actually have some \nhope of bending the cost curve down for the average American family.\n  This study by Oliver Wyman found that the Reid bill would actually \nmake people's insurance premiums go up. This study said premiums would \ngo up by 54 percent--in my State of Texas, by 61 percent--for Americans \npurchasing health insurance on their own. In other words, it is not \nemployer provided. They would have to go out in the marketplace, if you \nare a small business man or woman, and buy insurance or if you are an \nindividual buying health insurance, this will make your premiums go up \nby 61 percent in Texas and 54 percent across the Nation. So an average \nfamily of four in Houston would see their premiums more than double to \n$1,352 a month.\n  Is that the kind of health care reform we thought we were signing on \nto when we engaged in this debate? It certainly isn't what I call \nhealth reform. This is not what my constituents in Texas call health \nreform, to double the premiums for an average family of four in \nHouston. That just makes things worse. Premiums could go up 20 percent \nhigher for small businesses struggling to provide benefits for their \nemployees.\n  The worst part about this is that these kinds of so-called reforms \nhave been tried before. They failed miserably. For example, in New \nJersey and New York, both tried the kinds of mandates, community \nratings, guaranteed issue--these other things that sound a little \narcane but which have had the impact of skyrocketing premiums in those \nStates and causing insurance companies to leave the market. Rather than \nbearing these financial and regulatory burdens, many of them say: We \nare out of here--leaving people with less choice and higher premiums.\n  Then there is the Medicaid-Medicare cost shift. For example, Medicare \npays about 80 percent of what private insurance does to a doctor or a \nhospital, Medicaid even less. So these providers have to make it up \nsomewhere else. What they end up doing is charging more to people with \ninsurance. That is what the cost shift is all about. According to one \nstudy, that cost shift means higher premiums of about $1,800 a year for \nthe average family. About half of that comes from Medicaid alone. Yet \nthe Reid bill includes the biggest expansion of Medicaid since the \nprogram was created in 1965. And lest we forget, Medicaid is a joint \nFederal-State program. By expanding the coverage of Medicaid, we are \nbasically imposing an unfunded mandate on the States.\n  In my State, a State of 24 million people, this Medicaid expansion \nwill result in a $20 billion unfunded mandate imposed on State \ntaxpayers that the Federal Government is not going to help them out \nwith, $20 billion over 10 years.\n  The American people intuitively know all of this. A new Washington \nPost-ABC poll came out this week that found that most Americans, 53 \npercent, believe Washington's health care bill will actually increase \ntheir costs. Small businesses know this is true. According to a letter \nI received from the National Federation of Independent Business:\n\n       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is \n     short on savings and long on costs, is the wrong reform at \n     the wrong time and will increase health care costs and the \n     cost of doing business.\n\n  Why in the world would we impose additional costs on small businesses \nat the same time we are trying to get small businesses to create jobs \nto try to get our economy to come back? We know that small businesses \nare the engine of job creation. Now we are just going to impose more \ncosts, more higher premiums on them. What is that going to do? That \nwill discourage them from keeping employees they have in a tough \neconomy and perhaps not hiring new people, when we want to do \neverything we can to bring down the 10 percent unemployment rate.\n  In Houston, TX, according to one small business owner:\n\n       The proposed health care bill is going to have a negative \n     impact on my business because the cost of employee health \n     insurance will go up. I don't believe what some are saying \n     that the costs will go down. This bill does not make economic \n     commonsense.\n\n  One thing about common sense is, as you find out the older you get, \nit is not too common. This bill simply defies the explanation that some \nhave given to it that it will actually make things better rather not \nworse. My constituents, small business owners, everyone understands \nthat the pressures put on premiums and costs is going to make things \nworse.\n  Here is a chart that shows that from the time this bill is passed \nuntil 2016, we will see a huge increase in premiums for businesses and \nindividuals as well--large businesses, small businesses, individuals. \nAmericans know this is going to make an unsustainable status quo even \nworse. Yet the President and the majority----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Alaska, I \nobject.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Alaska, I \nobject.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair, is it the \nintent of the Presiding Officer to prevent any Senator from speaking on \nthe floor on this important bill? I am looking around. I don't see any \nother Senator waiting to speak. I simply would like an explanation of \nthe Chair's ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I release my objection.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has said--\nthis, of course, is the nonpartisan office which is tasked with the job \nof scoring or determining the cost of these bills before us--the CBO \nhas opined that the Reid bill will result in 90 percent of Americans \nseeing the same unsustainable premium increases as they currently do \nyear after year or, in some cases, even higher. If we are going to \nspend $2.5 trillion over 10 years, if we are going to cut Medicare by \nhalf a trillion dollars, if we are going to raise taxes by another half \na trillion just to have no impact for 90 percent of Americans and for \nthe others to actually see premiums go up, it strikes me that this is a \nsolution in search of a problem.\n  The problem is, we know the premiums are too high, costs are too \nhigh, and we need a better answer than is being proposed by the Reid \nbill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that families who get their \nhealth care through small businesses or large employers will see their \npremiums go up under this bill. The new ideas we have seen offered by \nour friends on the other side are designed to score political points \nbut are not aimed at solving problems.\n  For example, one of our colleagues, the Senator from Arkansas, \noffered an amendment to cap compensation for insurance executives and \nargued that it would actually lower premiums somehow miraculously. We \nasked the Congressional Budget Office whether that would have any \nimpact on premiums. It said the impact would be negligible. So what is \nthe point?\n  We have heard a lot about repealing the antitrust exemption for \nhealth insurers. The CBO said while that may be a feel-good sort of \nprovision, that it would actually make premiums higher and make things \nworse.\n  The CBO concluded that by enacting the legislation, it would have no \nsignificant impact on the premiums that private insurers would charge \nfor health insurance. They also noted that to the extent insurers would \nbecome subjected to additional litigation, their costs and their \npremiums charged to consumers might increase.\n  We have also heard from some of our colleagues about their cost \ncontainment ideas, a group of Democratic Senators who offered an \namendment. I\n\n[[Page S13367]]\n\nthink it does have some good ideas in it, but it only saves $200 \nmillion, not an insignificant amount of money, but in a $2.5 trillion \nbill?\n  So the bottom line is, this bill spends $2.5 trillion to increase \npremiums or, at best, maintain the status quo. That is not health care \nreform. We should reject this bill and start over with a step-by-step \napproach that will actually solve the problems confronting the American \npeople.\n  We should not accept, no matter what the crush is before the \nChristmas holidays--these last 8 days of this year--we should not \naccept a bill that cuts $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare, which cuts \nbenefits from Medicare Advantage beneficiaries--one-half million of \nwhom live in Texas; there are 11 million total--we should not accept a \nbill that raises premiums for many Americans, and we should not accept \na bill that puts crushing new taxes on small businesses when \nunemployment is at 10 percent.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Whitehouse--who are on their way to the Chamber--\nto discuss an amendment to strengthen and improve the independent \nMedicare advisory board included in the underlying bill.\n  I firmly believe creating an independent authority to help Congress \nmake informed decisions about reimbursing Medicare, getting away from a \nfee-for-service system, and making it based upon the cost which is \nincurred--but also the quality which now has to be required: evidence-\nbased outcomes--that is the direction Medicare, all of health care, has \nto go.\n  These are not just cost decisions but quality decisions. I think it \nis critical to sustaining our program and the promise we made to \nmillions of seniors that we would do right by them and still keep \nMedicare affordable, keep the trust fund solvent. It is meant to go \nbroke in 2017. That does not help hospitals, doctors, Medicare \nbeneficiaries, or anybody else. So we have to keep that in mind as we \ntalk about this issue.\n  I applaud Leader Reid for his bold leadership in including this \nadvisory board in his underlying bill. It is a very strong step \nforward.\n  In their May report this year, the Medicare trustees determined, if \nwe do nothing, the Medicare trust fund will basically go insolvent in \n2017. In health care terms, that is like next February.\n  It is abundantly clear if we fail to put Medicare on a path of fiscal \nsustainability, this incredible program--and the security it means for \nseniors in my State of West Virginia and in the Presiding Officer's \nState of Alaska and people everywhere; and the disabled, who are, \nunfortunately, often forgotten--it will be in tremendous danger. We \ncannot allow that to happen.\n  So what does this amendment do? If we are serious about protecting \nMedicare's future, we have to be serious how we handle Medicare, how we \nallocate it, and use it as a reimbursement and quality tool. So this \namendment includes a number of changes to do exactly that.\n  The most important change: This amendment eliminates a significant \nloophole in the underlying bill; that is, it eliminates the carve-out \nwhich was created by some for hospitals and other providers. I repeat, \nit eliminates the carve-out.\n  The carve-out now comprises about 60 percent of all Medicare. So it \nis a sham. It has to go or else Medicare is in deep trouble. I wish to \ntalk about this a little bit.\n  We protect the board's integrity. In fact, we give the board \nintegrity and we give them authority. Congress, right now, has the sole \nauthority to change Medicare's cost curve. Yet as the ranks of \nlobbyists grow and prey upon Members of the House and Senate--it is \namazing the relationship between how the cost of Medicare grows and \ntheir activities.\n  Let's be quite honest about it. This is not a politic thing to say, \nbut it is the truth. Probably about 12 percent of the Congress \nunderstands health care down to the wee depth that is needed to be able \nto decide on the reimbursement procedures, the quality outcomes \nprocedures, which we use to reimburse Medicare providers. This means we \nhave made a lot of mistakes, the cost of Medicare has gone out of \ncontrol, and we provide Medicare reimbursement unevenly and unfairly. \nPeople complain when they should not; do not complain when they should.\n  You have to understand, Medicare is such a powerful force it drives \nprices and it drives policies in health care for years and years to \ncome all across the span of health care. It is the elephant in the \nroom.\n  Power represents an opportunity. Medicare's force and clout can also \nbe harnessed in a direction to improve our health care system, improve \nefficiency. That is why I am adamantly opposed to the carve-out for \nhospitals and other providers because it weaves special-interest \ntreatment into the very fabric of a board created to remove them from \nthe process.\n  MedPAC was created by a Republican Congress in 1997. It, in theory, \ndecides how Medicare reimbursement is going to be updated on an annual \nbasis. The fact is, it has no power to do any such thing. That has to \nbe changed.\n  Is this a significant change? Yes, it is. Is it just like people \nchanging their lives in various ways all across America because they \nare facing situations which they have not faced before? People do not \nhave work; people have anxiety over all kinds of subjects; they have \nanxiety over health care, and they should have anxiety over health care \nbecause, particularly if you are a senior, the Medicare trust fund is \nrunning out on us.\n  So the only way you can do that, in my judgment, is to get away from \nfee for service; that is, you provide the service, and whatever it is, \nI will pay you the fee. It is simple. It is what we have used. It is \nwhat has gotten us in trouble because we do not insist upon experts \nmaking these decisions and on demanding evidence-based outcomes in the \nway hospitals, doctors, and others are reimbursed under Medicare. \nMedicare is taxpayers' money. It is not a frivolous matter.\n  As was the intent of my original policy, it is time to change the \nequation and put expert evidence and advice at the forefront of health \ncare decisionmaking. It is time to take the special interests out of \nthe process and create an independent, politically insulated entity \nwith its sole job to be to protect Medicare's long-term quality and \nsolvency. I am sure many will come and object to that, saying we should \ndo that in Congress, but I repeat: Is Congress qualified? Does it have \nthe knowledge to the depth that it can make a decision on how much \nproviders should be reimbursed? My answer is some do, most don't and, \ntherefore, the cost of Medicare keeps rising and the system is more \nendangered.\n\n  I have no doubt that a strong independent Medicare advisory board \nwould be a powerful cornerstone for meaningful health reform in all of \nthe right directions, but if we want the board to succeed, it needs the \ntools for both Medicare reform and genuine private sector cost \ncontainment.\n  Congress cannot do this on its own. We have proven ourselves \nincapable of making efficient, consistent decisions about Medicare's \nfuture, which now amounts to a crisis. We cannot continue standing in \nthe way of progress. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \ntruly transformative policy.\n  I simply repeat: If we are going to make it in health care, if we are \ngoing to make it in Medicare, if we are going to preserve the trust \nfund, we have to change the way we do business. People may not like \nthat. People will complain about it. People will complain if we do \nnothing. People will complain if we do everything. People complain. \nThat is the nature of it. That doesn't matter. What matters is that we \ndo the right thing; that we bend the cost curve by making accurate \ndecisions; that we are tough in our decisionmaking; and that is what \nthis board--and Congress will have a chance to review it but cannot \noverride it except by a very substantial vote--and that is what the \nMedicare advisory board is all about. It is the answer to Medicare's \nfuture, in this Senator's judgment.\n\n[[Page S13368]]\n\n  The security this policy provides for our seniors is too important. \nWe need to fight for them, always. We need to protect them. We need to \nprotect the solvency of the trust fund, and we need to make sure \nseniors are getting the best possible care. The day has ended when \npeople can submit a bill and say: I did this and, therefore, pay me \nthat. That is our system now. It is the wrong system. It has gotten us \ninto trouble. It is not good for health care, and it is very bad for \nthe solvency of the trust fund.\n  I see my distinguished colleague Senator Lieberman has arrived. He \nand I have been working on this for some time together, I am proud to \nsay.\n  I thank the Chair. I say to my colleagues the full text of the \namendment, No. 3240, is printed in the Record of Tuesday, December 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to stand and speak on behalf of this \namendment which I have filed with Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nWhitehouse, and I thank them for their leadership.\n  I wish to speak for a few moments about it. It is not a \nnoncontroversial amendment, but I think it redeems one of the two \ncentral promises or goals of this bill. The fact is that a lot of the \ncurrent health care reform debate in fact is focused on issues that are \nnot central to two big goals that I think most of us share, which are, \nfirst, to expand the number of people who have health insurance \ncoverage in our country; secondly, to lower the costs, because the \ncosts continue to go up way beyond the rate of general inflation in our \ncountry, and that has a very burdensome effect on millions of \nindividuals, families, businesses, our government--indeed, our entire \neconomy.\n  This amendment focuses on the second of those two big shared goals, \nwhich is containing the increases in health care costs. It has become a \nmantra around here--but it is never bad to repeat a mantra--which is \nthat national health expenditures in our country are now well over $2 \ntrillion. It is hard to imagine that amount of money, but let me try to \nget inside it.\n  We spend twice as much per person on health care as the average \ndeveloped country in the world, but I am afraid we are not receiving as \na country the best value for our health care spending. The fact is that \nthe United States provides some of the best health care in the world, \nbut we don't provide it to all of our people and we don't provide it \nefficiently. Medicare and Medicaid account for over 20 percent of the \nFederal budget and over 27 percent of national health expenditures. \nThese two programs are expected to rise to equal 20 percent or one-\nfifth of our gross domestic product by 2050.\n  Here is the animating, motivating fact that brings Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Whitehouse, and me together to file this \namendment: The Medicare trust fund, which provides Medicare benefits to \napproximately 37 million senior Americans that they depend on, that \nthey have depended on in a way that has helped to extend their lives as \naverage life expectancy goes up, the Medicare trust fund is expected to \nbe insolvent, out of money, bankrupt, by 2017--unable to pay the bills \nby 2017. That is 8 years from now. It is to prevent that unacceptable \nresult that my colleagues and I come forth to file this amendment to \nmake sure that by then--we have done a lot of things, but one of them \nis to make the delivery of health care more efficient, the delivery of \nhealth care to seniors through Medicare more efficient, so they can \nlook forward with confidence to having Medicare coverage throughout the \nrest of their lives.\n  As we all know, it is not just the ones on Medicare now; the baby \nboomers are coming of age to get on Medicare, and that will add \nenormously to its responsibilities.\n  I would say that Senators Reid, Baucus, Dodd, and Harkin did a superb \njob, a very good job, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, the underlying bill, to reduce health care spending and \nparticularly to do so while expanding coverage for 30 million more \nAmericans, which is the second great goal that I believe we all share. \nWhile these numbers are encouraging, Senators Rockefeller, Whitehouse, \nand I think we can and should do more, and that is the cost containment \nnumbers.\n  My colleagues introduced earlier this year the MedPAC Reform Act, \nwhich created an independent authority, a separate nonpartisan body, to \nmake critical health care cost decisions or make recommendations about \nthem. In the current Senate health care reform bill, their idea appears \ncentrally as the independent Medicare advisory board. It will bring \ntogether a panel of experts whose mission it will be to extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund by seeking out new efficiencies, \nnew cost containments, and improving the quality of care delivered by \nMedicare in the private sector. The board will have the authority to \nmake recommendations to the President and Congress to reduce Medicare \nspending in particular ways. Those recommendations will be fast tracked \nthrough Congress with strict requirements for the committees of \njurisdiction to review them, report the recommendations to the full \nCongress, and then be subject, those recommendations, to limited floor \ndebate, limited by the underlying legislation. If Congress does not \npass the advisory board's recommendations or adopt other proposals that \nproduce an equivalent amount of savings, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services will be required to implement the board's original \nrecommendations.\n  As Senator Rockefeller said--this is the second time today I have \nsaid this--earlier today the Homeland Security Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held a hearing on efforts to establish a commission to begin \nto turn around the exploding national debt we have. Part of the reason \nwe do that and part of the reason this independent board outside of \nCongress is being created is that we haven't proven ourselves capable \nof controlling costs because we find it a lot easier to say yes to \npeople, for good reasons, for humane reasons, but don't find it so easy \nto pay for the resulting costs of our affirmative answers to their \nrequests.\n\n  The CBO has estimated that the advisory board in the current bill \nwill save $23 billion in the next 10 years. The Obama administration \nand dozens of respected economists have said that the creation of this \nboard is instrumental in lowering costs and literally saving Medicare \nfrom bankruptcy. The amendment I have filed with Senators Rockefeller \nand Whitehouse, I am convinced--certainly our intention is to make this \nindependent board stronger so it will result in larger savings and \ncontain more costs over the long run.\n  There are six provisions in the amendment that I want to denote, \ndescribe briefly. First, this amendment will extend the board's \nauthority to cover hospitals and hospices; sensitive, I know, but the \nboard must have the authority to consider the entire breadth of \nMedicare expenditures in making its recommendations to Congress to \nmaximize savings for the government, for taxpayers and, most of all, \nfor the beneficiaries of Medicare so the program is still there to help \nthem.\n  Second, our amendment makes it easier for the board to make \nrecommendations in the years beyond 2019 than the underlying bill does \nso that it can continue to monitor Medicare over the longer term and \nensure its long-term solvency. We want those on Medicare now, and those \ncoming on Medicare, to be able to depend on it over the course of their \nlives.\n  Third, this amendment will raise the amount of savings the board must \nmeet in years where Medicare growth exceeds the target growth rate set \nin the law, in the proposal.\n  Fourth, we move up the time of implementation of the board's \nrecommendations by 2 months to minimize, frankly, the influence of \ninterest groups who will be in the normal course of the process \nfighting to stop these cost-effective recommendations.\n  Fifth, the amendment allows the board to offer recommendations in \nyears where the Medicare growth rate does not outpace the target growth \nrate. The goal of this provision is to be clear that the purpose of the \nboard is not just to contain costs beyond a certain standard but also \nto search out constantly for inefficiencies, for waste, for the \nexpenditure of Medicare dollars that is not actually benefiting \nMedicare recipients.\n  Finally, our amendment clarifies that the purpose of the board is not \njust to contain costs within Medicare but to look more broadly at \nhealth\n\n[[Page S13369]]\n\ncare spending outside of these publicly supported programs. That is \nvery significant. It will provide an opportunity for broad savings in \nhealth care and health insurance for pretty much everybody in our \ncountry.\n  I am proud to join today with my friends, Senators Rockefeller and \nWhitehouse, to announce the filing of our amendment. These six \nprovisions will make this advisory board stronger and reduce costs.\n  While we disagree on some aspects of health care reform, I hope we \ncan agree across party lines that health care spending is out of \ncontrol, and that we can contain it in a way that doesn't threaten \naccess or benefits. We must preserve and extend Medicare for future \ngenerations, and we must ensure that the new private market we are \ncreating in health care reform is one where health care quality and \nefficiency justifies the cost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Minnesota, I \nobject.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Really. OK. I won't take it personally.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island be recognized for 10 minutes followed by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee who will be speaking on the bill, and that I be recognized to \nfollow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection. I assume that is for 10 minutes each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that for 10 minutes each?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I have been around here 20-some years. It is the \nfirst time I have ever seen a Member denied an extra minute or two to \nfinish his remarks. I must say that I don't know what is happening here \nin this body, but I think it is wrong.\n  It is fine with me that it be 10 minutes.\n  I will tell you, I have never seen a Member denied an extra minute or \nso, as the Chair just did.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I don't object to the unanimous \nconsent request on that condition. I think the same occurred earlier \nthis afternoon for reasons that have to do with trying to get this bill \ngoing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I haven't seen it before. I don't like it, and I think it \nharms the comity of the Senate not to allow a Member at least a minute. \nI am sure the time is urgent, but I doubt if it is that urgent.\n  I renew my unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode Island be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Michigan for 10 minutes, \nand then that I be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know the Senators have been waiting \nlonger than I have. It is a personal courtesy from them to me to allow \nme to join Senator Rockefeller and Senator Lieberman as a cosponsor and \nhave our remarks follow in series. I am grateful to both of them.\n  I am here to speak in support of the amendment offered by Senators \nRockefeller, Lieberman, and myself, which would strengthen the \nprovisions of the reform bill creating a nonpartisan group of experts \nto put the brakes on out-of-control medical spending.\n  One of the first things we can count on in terms of this amendment \nbeing one to protect Medicare beneficiaries is that the prime sponsor \nis Senator Rockefeller, a man who has dedicated his career since long \nbefore I was here--even during his days in West Virginia--to looking \nout for seniors and for the disabled and, since he has been in the \nSenate, looking out for Medicare. That is a credential that deserves \ngreat respect with respect to this amendment.\n  One of the most persistent concerns in this health care debate is, of \ncourse, cost control. I have spoken many times on the floor about the \noverriding importance of cost containment for the future of health care \nand especially the need for innovative delivery system reforms, which \ncan be driven by the way you pay providers.\n  Our Republican attackers complain that Democrats on the bill are just \ndoing more of our usual taxing and spending and that we won't impose \nany discipline on the system. Mr. President, as somebody who has worked \nfor years on health care delivery system reform, I can tell you that is \nsimply not true. This bill undertakes the most comprehensive redesign \nof our chaotic, wasteful system ever attempted.\n  One leading health economist and expert in cost containment, MIT \nprofessor Jonathan Gruber, recently wrote of the Senate Democrats' \nefforts in this bill that he couldn't ``think of a thing to try that \nthey didn't try. They really made the best effort anyone has ever made. \nEverything is in here. . . . You couldn't have done better than they \nare doing.''\n  Many critics talk about cost control as if it were just a matter of \npolitical will, that Congress can come here and cut costs by flipping a \nswitch. Well, that may be true if you want to cut benefits for the \nelderly and disabled or if you want to throw the elderly and disabled \noff of coverage or if you want to pay doctors even less for treating \nMedicare patients. But those would be brutal, callous cuts that would \ncreate human misery and suffering. Better to tackle the waste in the \nsystem, the $700 billion annually in excess costs found by President \nObama's Council of Economic Advisers--a number that may actually be as \nhigh as over $1 trillion every year, according to the Lewin Group and \nto George Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill.\n  By this method, you save money by improving the quality and \nefficiency of care; by tackling the multiple sources of waste and \ninefficiency in the system; by improving quality and access to care and \ngiving doctors, hospitals, employers, and employees all the correct \nfinancial incentives to adopt healthy, cost-saving, efficient \npractices. The complexity of getting those incentives right, aligned \nwith top-flight health care, versus the power of the interest groups \nthat are involved, has historically paralyzed Congress.\n  History teaches that the significant national dialog and debate we \nare now having about health care is a momentary exception rather than \nthe general rule. It is possible this debate will usher in a sustained \nperiod of focus on health reform, but the steepening fall of our health \ncare system toward catastrophe should counsel us to protect against \nthat congressional institutional paralysis.\n  This independent, nonpartisan board of experts to help control costs \nin a way that is smart, humane, and not all politics, is important. The \nindependent Medicare advisory board will force Congress to act by \nissuing recommendations to reduce cost and increase efficiency that \nwill automatically go into effect if Congress does what we so often do \naround here--nothing. If Congress can agree to different ideas, it can \nchange the board's recommendations, but we still have to reduce \nMedicare costs by a minimum savings target. In other words, the board \nwill force Congress to engage thoughtfully and for the public good on \nthe most important fiscal and health issue our Nation faces.\n  Senator Rockefeller's amendment strengthens this board in several \nimportant ways: It expands the circumstances in which the board's \nrecommendations go into effect when Congress does nothing. It raises \nthe maximum level of savings that the board's recommendations must \nachieve. It ensures all providers of health care services, including \nlarge hospitals, are equally responsible for bringing down Medicare \ncosts. It empowers the board to issue recommendations for improving \nMedicare over the long term, even in years where spending is under \ncontrol.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have depicted the board \nas a frightening, Orwellian, all-powerful dictator that will cut \nMedicare benefits. Hogwash. The bill specifically prohibits the board \nfrom doing anything to increase premiums, ration care, restrict \nbenefits, or modify eligibility.\n  The facts no longer seem to matter to our friends on the other side. \nThey have called this group the ``rationing\n\n[[Page S13370]]\n\ncommission.'' If you look at page 1004, lines 3 and 4, it says this:\n\n       The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration \n     health care.\n\n  You are entitled to your own opinion--and we all have one--but not \nyour own facts.\n  It is actually that kind of demagoguery about Medicare that proves \nthe case for creating the board. Thoughtful, smart, technically expert \npeople under congressional oversight but protected from these partisan \nspasms of congressional vitriol, passion, and folly will make careful \nand consistent decisions for all of our benefits, without diminishing \nthe power of the American people and their elected representatives, so \nthat we can preserve and protect Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Rockefeller's amendment, in \nwhich Senator Lieberman and I have so proudly joined him.\n  I yield the floor with my thanks to the Senator from Michigan for \nbeing so gracious in allowing me to join my colleagues in sequence on \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for the few minutes we have \nthis afternoon in support of the appropriations bill that is before us, \nthe Defense appropriations bill.\n  Senator McCain and I and other members of the Armed Services \nCommittee have spent a lot of time each year authorizing important \nprograms to support our troops, protect our troops, and support their \nfamilies in a whole host of ways. Hopefully, it will authorize funds \nthat can help us succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq. That bill is now law, \nand in front of us is an appropriations bill that contains most of \nthose same provisions--not all but most of the same provisions.\n  It is critically important that this appropriations bill be passed. \nThere are differences in this body and between this body and the House \nof Representatives about the policies that are involved in the war in \nAfghanistan and the war in Iraq. That is normal. That is the way it \nshould be. We can have democratic debates inside this great democracy \nof ours. We don't have to agree, and we don't on many of the policies \ninvolved in these two war efforts. Where I believe this body is \nunanimous is that we are determined to support our troops when they are \nin the field regardless of whether we agree with the particular \nstrategy they are supporting or whether we happen to have supported \ntheir mission.\n  It has been the tradition of the Congress, once a decision has been \ndemocratically arrived at to send troops to the field, that we support \nthose troops. This appropriations bill has critically important \nprovisions in it to support our troops. I believe there is unanimity \nand consensus in this body on those provisions. I will focus on a few \nof those provisions.\n  We have added significant funds. One example is the so-called Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected Vehicles or MRAP. These are life-and-death \nmatters we are talking about. These vehicles are a perfect example of \nthat. The faster we can get the advanced MRAPs to the field in \nAfghanistan, the more we can get to the field in Afghanistan, the fewer \nAmericans are going to be killed in Afghanistan. So we have funds in \nhere--more than actually were requested--to send over 6,600 new MRAP \nvehicles, all-terrain vehicles that can function better there than the \nones we sent to Iraq. These all-terrain vehicles have been designed and \ndeveloped in record time in order to get them to our troops. We should \nbe acting in record time on this appropriations bill, and there are \nmany reasons for that. Surely, getting more MRAPs more quickly into the \nfield is one of those reasons.\n  We have an organization called the Joint IED Defeat Organization \nwhose sole purpose and mission is to come up with the strategies and \ntechnologies to defeat these IEDs, these improvised explosive devices \nthat are killing our troops. In order to defeat these devices or train \nour troops who are deployed there in how to identify and protect \nthemselves against IEDs, we have $1.8 billion in this appropriations \nbill for that organization. They have a laser mission to defeat the \nIEDs. We have to get this money to them.\n  This bill needs to be signed. The President has to sign it--and he \nwill--so we can get these funds as quickly as possible to our troops. \nWe need to adopt this appropriations bill.\n  We have pay raises and health programs in the bill. We add $1.3 \nbillion more than the President requested for the Defense Health \nProgram. This covers shortfalls in private sector care, increases funds \nfor medical research, including what is called TBI, which are the brain \ninjuries, as well as PTSD, which has so afflicted our troops in these \nwars. We add additional funds for those programs. The quicker the bill \nis signed, the faster those funds get appropriated and spent, the \nbetter off our wounded warriors who suffer from TBI and from \npsychological health problems are going to be.\n  In Afghanistan now, one of the key issues is going to be whether we \ncan get the Afghan troops trained quickly enough, supported quickly \nenough, given the equipment they need so they, hopefully earlier rather \nthan later, can join with us, partner with us, and take responsibility \nfor their own security. Regardless of people's differences over the \npolicies and strategies in Afghanistan, I believe there is a consensus \nin this body--no matter what the vote ends up being on the bill, \nwhether people vote for the bill or against the bill, I would think all \nof us believe we must quickly provide funds to train, support, and \nsustain the Afghan security forces. We want to fund that effort in this \nbill at $6.6 billion.\n  Counternarcotics in Afghanistan. We all know the narcotics industry \nin Afghanistan is being used to support the Taliban. We want to \ncontinue efforts to train Afghan counternarcotics forces and support \nU.S. counternarcotics and interdiction activities in Afghanistan, so \n$300 million in this bill is going to do that.\n  We have a fund called the Commander's Emergency Response Program or \nCERP. That fund has been used to great advantage. This bill provides \n$1.2 billion for that Commander's Emergency Response Program; $1 \nbillion of that is for that program in Afghanistan and $200 million of \nthe CERP program in Iraq. This represents about twice as much CERP \nfunding for Afghanistan as we had in fiscal year 2009.\n  Those CERP funds are able to provide very quickly support and \neconomic development village by village. Our commanders are able, \nwithout going through a whole lot of red tape, to make relatively small \ninvestments in things which make a difference, in terms of the security \nof our troops and the betterment of the lives of the Afghans. It has \nhad a huge, positive impact in terms of the perception of the Afghan \ncommunity about us, satisfying them that we are there for their \nbenefit, not just for our benefit. We are not occupying Afghanistan. \nWhen we leave Afghanistan, we want to leave Afghanistan in better shape \nthan we found it. The CERP funds are a major contribution to that goal.\n  One of the things we have authorized in the bill, which Senator \nMcCain and I and members of the Armed Services Committee have brought \nto this body, was adopted by this body, and signed into law, was the \nauthorization to use those CERP funds to help reintegrate, where we \ncan, Afghan Taliban fighters into Afghan society--those who will \nrenounce violence against the Government of Afghanistan and make a \ncommitment to participate in civilian life. We are able to actually \nhave the funds that are so essential to make that program work. We do \nnot yet have a program in place. That is being worked on as we speak. \nBut these funds need to be available to support that program of \nreintegration of Afghans, those low-level Taliban people who are with \nthe Taliban not for any ideological reason but because they get some \npay from the Taliban. Not all the members of the Taliban fall into that \ncategory. But for the ones who do, this funding becomes critical.\n  Mr. President, I will only take a few minutes more, but I did want to \nhighlight a few additional points that I believe my colleagues should \nknow about.\n  The first area pertains to three initiatives that originated in the \nDefense authorization bill that relate to the continuing fight against \nal-Qaida and associated terrorist organizations.\n  The bill includes nearly all of the $1.6 billion the administration \nrequested for the coalition support fund, which is used to reimburse \nkey partner nations, particularly Pakistan, for support provided to the \nUnited States in Operation Enduring Freedom and Overseas Contingency \nOperations.\n\n[[Page S13371]]\n\n  It includes $350 million in fiscal year 2010, the full amount \nauthorized, for the train and equip program to build the capacity of \nforeign militaries to conduct counterterrorism operations and support \nmilitary or stabilization operations in which the U.S. participates. As \nclarified in the fiscal year 2010 NDAA, this authority can be used to \nbuild the capacity of ISAF coalition partners to prepare their training \nteams and special operations forces to be available for use in \nAfghanistan.\n  The bill also provides the full $100 million authorized for the \nauthority to transfer funds from DOD to the State Department to support \nState's security and stabilization assistance programs.\n  The other area pertains to missile defense.\n  The bill before us provides important funding for ballistic missile \ndefense programs. It supports the decisions made by Secretary Gates and \nPresident Obama to restructure the missile defense program with a \ngreater focus on regional missile defense against existing missile \nthreats. These changes include the termination of the Multiple Kill \nVehicle Program and the Kinetic Energy Interceptor Program, and cancel \nprocurement of additional airborne laser aircraft. This defense \nappropriations act also supports the decision to cap deployment of the \nground-based midcourse defense system at 30 operational ground-based \ninterceptors in Alaska and California, rather than the 44 previously \nplanned for deployment.\n  The bill supports funding for alternative missile defense systems in \nEurope, to defend against current and future Iranian ballistic \nmissiles.\n  It also includes an additional $57 million, above the budget request \nof $169 million, to procure more standard Missile-3 interceptors for \nour Aegis ballistic missile defense system. This type of interceptor \nwill be at the heart of the new missile defense plan for Europe. The \namendment also provides the full $1.1 billion requested for the \nterminal high altitude area defense, THAAD, system, which is another \nkey element of our regional missile defense capabilities.\n  I believe my 10 minutes is up. I thank my good friend from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, for allowing me to go first. The order of priority was \nthat he go immediately after someone speaking on this side. But as \nalways, his courtesy shines through to me, and I very much appreciate \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Michigan. I thank \nhim for his leadership of the Armed Services Committee.\n  The train is about to leave the station on the last of the \nappropriations bills for 2010 and, unfortunately, nothing has changed. \nEverything is the same--earmarking, porkbarrel, excessive and \nunnecessary spending. Billions in wasteful earmarks again have found \ntheir way into this bill which could otherwise be spent for the \npriorities that our men and women, our military leaders, as well as the \nSecretary of Defense, has asked for.\n  There is in this bill--here we go again: an appropriations bill \nloaded up with earmarks--a 523-page explanatory statement for 1,720 \nearmarks totaling $4.3 billion. Let's do some simple math: $4.3 billion \nin pork, $2.5 billion in unauthorized and unrequested C-17s; $500 \nmillion in unrequested and unwanted funding for the Joint Strike \nFighter alternative engine; and a Presidential helicopter. That is $7.3 \nbillion that neither the military nor the Defense Department requested \nand does not need--$7.3 billion.\n  Some people say that is not a lot of money. It is enough to keep the \nState of Arizonas budget requirements fulfilled for 10 months. States \nacross America are facing great difficulties, as we know, and an \nadditional $7.3 billion would not be so bad.\n  I wish to say, again, this process of earmarking breeds corruption. \nThat is why we have former Members of Congress in Federal prison. It \nwas not inadequate disclosure requirements that led Duke Cunningham to \nviolate his oath of office and take $2.5 million in bribes in exchange \nfor doling out $70 million to $80 million of the taxpayers' funds to a \ndefense contractor. It was his ability to freely earmark taxpayer funds \nwithout question.\n  I wish to point out, again, the President pledged during the campaign \nhe would work to eliminate earmarks. The President, last March, when we \nhad an omnibus spending bill, said they would not do it anymore. In \nSeptember, the President spoke in Phoenix, AZ, to the Veterans of \nForeign Wars. In that speech, the President's words were quite \ncompelling about waste and porkbarrel spending in Defense bills. In \nthat speech, the President promised--promised--an end to ``special \ninterests and their exotic projects'' and reaffirmed he was leading the \ncharge to kill off programs such as the F-22, the second engine for the \nJoint Strike Fighter, and the outrageously expensive Presidential \nhelicopter.\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       If a project doesn't support our troops, we will not fund \n     it. If a system doesn't perform well, we will terminate it. \n     And if Congress sends me a bill loaded with that kind of \n     waste, I will veto it. We will do right by our troops and \n     taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, I can tell you, the President of the United States, \nthat meets your criteria with over $7 billion of unnecessary, unwanted \nspending. Will the President veto this bill? Not a chance. Not a \nchance. But the American people are going to demand this obscene \nprocess stop. The American people are going to demand it be stopped, \nwasting $7 billion of their tax dollars on wasteful and earmark \nspending. I am confident they are aware. They are aware we are spending \n$7.6 million to fund research in Montana on hypersonic wind tunnels, \ncalled MARIAH. This self-licking ice cream cone has been earmarked and \nunrequested since 1998. The Air Force lost interest in 2004, so the \nappropriators moved it to the Army. The Army has no requirement for \nthis capability and published a report in 2005 stating their \ndisinterest in the program. In summary, we spent $70 million for some \nhypersonic wind tunnels nobody wants--$70 million. Unless we demand and \nreceive change, there will be more millions in it next year.\n  There is $5 million going to the battleship USS Missouri Memorial \nAssociation; $18.9 million for a center at the University of \nMassachusetts ``dedicated to educating the general public, students, \nteachers, new Senators, and Senate staff about the role and importance \nof the Senate.'' What does that have to do with defending this Nation? \nWhat does that have to do with providing the men and women who are \nrisking their lives, as we speak, with the equipment they need? Madam \nPresident, $18.9 million to educate the public about the importance of \nthe Senate? Give me a break.\n  There is $9.5 million going to the University of Hawaii for a program \ncalled the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Raid Response System. The \nlist goes on and on. The Air Force is paying for this, and the Air \nForce will not be allowed to be getting much in return, since it will \nonly be allowed to use the telescope 5 percent of the time. In other \nwords, in dollar figures, the Air Force pays $10 million to the \nuniversity and receives $500,000 in return.\n  What is more, the Air Force has not, in the 9-year life of this \nearmark, requested a single dollar for this program. Since 2001, the \nAir Force has been forced to spend more than $75 million of its budget \nallocation on a program it does not want.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these other \nporkbarrel earmark programs, such as $1.2 million for the American \nMuseum of Natural History Infectious Disease Research.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       $7.6 million to fund research in Montana on hypersonic wind \n     tunnels, called MARIAH. This self-licking ice cream cone has \n     been with us, earmarked and unrequested, since 1998. The Air \n     Force, leader in hypersonic testing and technology, lost \n     interest in 2004, so appropriators moved the program to the \n     Army. The Army has no official requirement for this \n     capability and published a report in 2005 stating their \n     disinterest in the program. To date, the Army has no plans to \n     fund the MARIAH wind tunnel effort, as they have stated in \n     their budget documents. But that hasn't kept Congress from \n     pouring more than $70 million into it, with no discernable \n     return. One group has made out particularly well in the deal, \n     however. Of course, I'm referring to lobbyists, including \n     Gage LLC, whose CEO, coincidentally, had been a senior \n     staffer to an appropriator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S13372]]\n\n       $5 million to the battleship USS Missouri Memorial \n     Association. This is a private organization which owns and \n     operates this battleship as a museum in Pearl Harbor. I am \n     aware that the Association plans to put the Missouri in dry-\n     dock and refurbish it, and also aware that it was not part of \n     the donation agreement that the Defense Department would pay \n     for required maintenance.\n       $20 million for the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, to \n     help pay for the construction of new facilities as part of a \n     $300 million expansion. This privately funded museum opened \n     in 2000 and, through the help of the Louisiana delegation, \n     has already received $13 million in Department of Defense \n     funds tucked into previous appropriations bills. This earmark \n     has no benefit to the United States military and will be paid \n     at the expense of equipment and training for our troops, \n     something few WWII veterans would support.\n       $14.8 million for five different earmarks pertaining to \n     nano-tube research. Of the 1,720 earmarks in this bill, \n     hundreds are for high-tech research or devices. I ask my \n     colleagues whether they are capable of weighing the merits of \n     specific technologies that they fund in this bill. The answer \n     is they are not.\n       $18.9 million for a center at the University of \n     Massachusetts ``dedicated to educating the general public, \n     students, teachers, new Senators, and Senate staff about the \n     role and importance of the Senate.'' This center was neither \n     requested in the President's budget nor authorized by \n     Congress.\n       $9.5 million to the University of Hawaii for a program \n     called the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Raid Response \n     System (Pan-STARRS). On the surface, this program seems like \n     a reasonable need for the Air Force as a part of its Space \n     Situational Awareness efforts. Unfortunately, the Air Force \n     won't be getting much return on this investment, since it \n     will only be allowed to use the telescope 5 percent of the \n     time. In dollar figures, the Air Force pays $10 million to \n     the University and receives $500,000 in return. What's more, \n     the Air Force has not, in the nine-year life of this earmark, \n     requested a single dollar for this program. So, since 2001, \n     the Air Force has been forced to spend more than $75 million \n     of its budget allocation on a program it doesn't want--but \n     might be able to use--only to be denied use 95% of the time.\n       $500,000 for the Brown Tree Snake Program.\n       $1.8 million to renovate and upgrade the Historical Fort \n     Hamilton Community Club in the New York City area.\n       $1.6 million to study human genetics at the Maine Institute \n     for Human Genetics and Health in Brewer, Maine.\n       $3.5 million for a Micro-algae Biofuel Project in Hawaii.\n       $5 million for the Presidio Heritage Center, a museum, in \n     San Francisco.\n       $1.6 million for the Center for Space Entrepreneurship.\n       $2 million for National Initiatives for Applications of \n     Multifunctional Materials.\n       $1.6 million for a Virtual Business Accelerator for the \n     Silicon Prairie.\n       $7.8 million to develop key technologies needed for long \n     term operations in ``near space'' conditions for the Orion \n     High Altitude Long Endurance Risk Reduction Effort, Aurora \n     Flight Sciences in Columbus, Mississippi.\n       $2.4 million for Fusion Goggle System.\n       $800,000 for ``Advanced Tactical Laser Flashlight'' in \n     Wyandotte, MI.\n       $2 million for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's Operating Room \n     of the Future, Los Angeles, California.\n       $4.8 million for New Vaccines to Fight Respiratory Disease \n     and Central Nervous Disorders at the Iowa State University.\n       $720,000 to survey epidemiologic health for the University \n     of Iowa.\n       $3 million for the New Jersey Technology Center.\n       $1.2 million for American Museum of Natural History \n     Infectious Disease Research.\n       $1.6 million for Army Plant Vaccine Development Program.\n       $1.4 million for Flight/Hangar Deck Cleaner.\n       $4 million for the Hampton University Proton Cancer \n     Treatment Initiative.\n       $10 million for the Hawaii Technology Development Venture.\n       $3.9 million for Intelligent Decision Exploration.\n       $12 million for Laser Phalanx.\n       $2.4 million for Marine Mammal Awareness Alert and Response \n     Systems.\n       $2 million for a Marine Mammal Detection System.\n       $2.3 million for Marine Species.\n       $1.2 million for the Maritime Directed Energy Test and \n     Evaluation Center.\n       $3.2 million for a National Functional Genomics Center \n     Collaborating Site.\n       $2.4 million for NAVAIR High Fidelity Oceanographic \n     Library.\n       $2 million for Non Traditional Ballistic Fiber and Fabric \n     Weaving Application for Force Protection.\n       $4 million for Smart Instrument Development for the \n     Magdalena Ridge Observatory.\n       $2 million for underwater imaging and Communications Using \n     Lasers.\n       $800,000 for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Submerged Long Range \n     Positioning.\n       $2.4 million for an Unmanned Vehicle Sensor Optimization \n     Technologies Program.\n       $8 million to study oceans at the Center for Excellence for \n     Research in Ocean Sciences.\n       $2 million for an Advanced Laboratory for Information \n     Integration in Hawaii.\n       $2 million for PaintShield for Protecting People from \n     Microbial Threats.\n       $3.2 million for Playas Training and Research Center.\n       $1.2 million for Progressive Research for Sustainable \n     Manufacturing.\n       $1.6 million for Protective Self-Decontaminating Surfaces.\n       $1.5 million for the Institute for the ``Advancement of \n     Bloodless Medicine'' for the Englewood Hospital in Englewood, \n     New Jersey.\n       $1.2 million for the Model for Green Laboratories and Clean \n     Rooms Project.\n       $1.6 million for the Maine Center for Toxicology and \n     Environmental Health at the University of Southern Maine in \n     Portland, Maine.\n       $6 million to study the molecular signatures in tumors for \n     the National Functional Genomics Center.\n       $1.6 million for Multi-Dose Closed Loop pH Monitoring \n     System for Platelets at Blood Cell Storage Inc., Seattle, \n     Washington.\n       $4.8 million for the National Oncogenomics and Molecular \n     Imaging Center in Detroit, Michigan.\n       $800,000 for the Natural Gas Firetube Boiler Demonstration, \n     Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois.\n       $5.8 million for the Rock Island Arsenal Roof Replacement, \n     Rock Island, Illinois.\n       $800,000 for Near Infrared Spectroscopy Military Personnel \n     Assessment at the University Community Hospital, Tampa, \n     Florida.\n       $4.2 million for the Nicholson Center for Surgical \n     Advancement Medical Robotics and Simulation in Central \n     Florida.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the list goes on and on: $2 million for \nthe Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's operating room of the future in Los \nAngeles, CA. That is the second earmark I have seen. The other one is \nfor irritable bowel syndrome. Now we have the operating room of the \nfuture. Remarkable.\n  There is $2.3 million for marine species; $2 million for a marine \nmammal detection system. There is a threat. Also, $2.4 million for \nmarine mammal awareness alert and response system. The list goes on and \non.\n  I know my time is near to expire.\n  Here we are with a deficit of $1.4 trillion for this year, a debt of \nover $12 trillion, unemployment at 10 percent, 900,000 families lost \ntheir homes in 2008, and we are spending over $7 billion on earmarks, \nporkbarrel projects the Department of Defense neither needed nor wants, \nand there are programs not fully funded because of this that are vital \nto defending the lives of the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary.\n  Again, this appropriations bill is a disgrace.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to speak on something else, but I \nwill say very quickly, I have listened to colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle lamenting where we are today. It has been 11 months since \na new President was inaugurated and, obviously, everybody understands \nthis is not a mess he created. The last 8 years of the stewardship of \nthis country, where there was never one appropriations bill vetoed in \nthat entire time, is an extraordinary story of public negligence and \neven malfeasance.\n  We are where we are. We are creating jobs. The economy is turning \naround. We had the least loss in the last 11 months. We are beginning \nto see those changes. We will ultimately have the strength in our \neconomy to deal with this deficit.\n\n\n                        Tribute to David McKean\n\n  Madam President, I rise for a different reason right now. It is a \nbittersweet privilege for me to speak about my friend and my counselor, \nDavid McKean, staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee, who is \nleaving the Senate at the end of this month to become the chief \nexecutive officer of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.\n  I have enjoyed the benefit of David's advice for almost 20 years now. \nHe will be sorely missed. My only consolation is, this son of \nMassachusetts will again be able to vote for me.\n  He has been a part of my life in the Senate since 1987, when I was a \nfreshman and he was a younger and idealistic legislative assistant. \nOver the years, I have drawn significantly on his knowledge and his \nskills. He leaves the Senate now to continue in public life, but he \nleaves it a little bit older but still idealistic and young at heart.\n  When he came to our office, he had already made a mark. He had \ngraduated magna cum laude from Harvard College and received a law \ndegree from\n\n[[Page S13373]]\n\nDuke University and a master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law \nand Diplomacy. He also taught English at the Waterford Kamhlaba School \nin Swaziland, Africa. But he was a crusading soul deeply interested in \npublic policy, with a zeal for investigations and an instinct to hold \nWashington accountable. He was looking for a place to put all those \ninterests to work in the Senate, and he found it.\n  But he also found something more, I might add--much more--that summer \nof 1987. There was a young Kellogg fellow from the University of \nPennsylvania working in my office at that time. Her name was Kathleen \nKaye. She was extraordinarily smart and committed. David did not fail \nto notice those qualities and a lot more. Their marriage and their \nthree wonderful children, who I am pleased to say are with us right \nnow, Shaw, Christian, and Kaye, are a tribute and more to the \nrelationship they share.\n  David has devoted his career to public service. After 5 years of \nworking in my office, he moved across the Capitol as chief of staff to \nanother member of the Massachusetts delegation, Representative Joe \nKennedy. He later became special counsel at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission before returning home to the Senate as deputy chief \ncounsel at the Governmental Affairs Committee and staff director of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  I failed to mention that before going to the Permanent Subcommittee, \nhe worked with my staff early in his career in helping to develop one \nof the great investigative efforts in the Senate in recent memory, \nwhich was the BCCI investigation. That wound up on the cover of Time \nmagazine and was a seminal report--one of the best reports I have seen \nin the 26 years I have been here.\n  In 1999, I was lucky to entice him to come back to my office as chief \nof staff. It turned out to be his longest tenure in any of those public \njobs so far. Earlier this year, when I became chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, he became the staff director.\n  David is the ultimate team builder and a magnet for great talent, so \nhe would be the first to tell you that his success did not come single-\nhandedly. But it is clear David played the essential role in turning \n2009 into a stellar year for the committee and for its new chairman. \nUnder his guidance, we conducted 125 hearings on topics ranging from \nAfghanistan to Zimbabwe. We secured passage of the Enhanced Partnership \nwith Pakistan Act, and we won approval of legislation bringing far-\nreaching reform to our foreign assistance program. He has worked \ntirelessly with the committee members and the White House over the past \nyear, and our record is a testament to his determination and skill. I \nthink our committee has succeeded in going through the nominations of \nmore people and passing them more rapidly to the floor than any other \nin the Senate, and I congratulate him for that effort.\n  Somehow, during his career of service, he has found time to indulge \nin his passion for history and scholarship. He is the author of a \nhighly acclaimed biography of Tommy Corcoran, the ultimate Washington \ninsider. He also wrote a biography of Clark Clifford, which was a New \nYork Times ``notable book of the year,'' and he is the coauthor of \n``The Great Decision,'' which skillfully, and perhaps surprisingly, \ntransformed the story behind the Supreme Court's landmark Marbury v. \nMadison case into what the Washington Post called ``a political \nthriller.''\n  As those of you in this body know, we are--all of us--really only as \ncapable or competent as our staff. Over the years, I have depended on \nDavid McKean at every stage. He has been the consummate adviser--\ntrustworthy, loyal, unafraid of speaking up when I was about to veer \noff in the wrong direction--which, clearly, was very seldom indeed. \nNever was he more valuable to me than in the immediate aftermath of the \n2004 Presidential election. Forty-eight hours after an election night--\nand early morning and early afternoon--that didn't end up the way that \nI had hoped it might, I returned to the Senate for a vote. Back to \nwork. I don't remember what the vote was about, but I do remember that \nDavid was there with a plan to get us through the day and the next 2 \nyears. I will miss that wisdom and guidance.\n  Our loss is the Kennedy Library's gain. In some ways, I think \nsomething like the Kennedy Library is the perfect place for this man \nwho is at heart a scholar and an intellectual. But the Kennedy Library \nis particularly well-suited to David because it is a place Jackie \nKennedy hoped would help turn history into advocacy and activism, and I \nhave no doubt David's vision and experience will help to ensure that \nthe legacy of President Kennedy endures to inspire future generations.\n  Madam President, I want to close by simply saying that my colleagues \nand I are grateful for David's distinguished service. I will personally \nmiss him very much. I wish him, Kathleen, and their children my very \nbest as they return home to Massachusetts to start this next special \nchapter in David's career in public service.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, the majority leader be recognized to make a motion to \nrecess until 12:01 a.m.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, if I might, if the \nSenator would propose her request again.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, the majority leader be recognized to make a motion to \nrecess until 12:01 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak about the position we \nfind ourselves in as we come to the end of the year. Despite the \nincredible successes we have had with the recovery act and equal pay \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program and so many other areas \nwhere we have been focused and working hard to make a difference, every \nstep of the way, as with the current bill, we have been faced with \nstalling tactics, objections, and filibusters. Now with the very \nimportant Department of Defense funding bill, we are in a filibuster \nagain. I had to make the motion I offered because we will have to come \nin at 1 o'clock in the morning and have a vote to stop a filibuster. \nThat is what this is all about, filibustering a bill that has a pay \nraise in it for our troops, that has help for military families, that \nhas the funding for the next year--we are in the middle of two wars--\nessential funding that is needed to support our military. As our \nPresiding Officer knows, having been a leader on this as well, we also \nhave placed into this bill provisions that are incredibly important for \nfamilies, extending unemployment insurance for families across the \ncountry who find themselves in a situation not of their making where \ntheir job has gone away or they have been laid off because the company \ncan't continue to employ them, maybe because of rising health care \ncosts, which is certainly part of the equation. People are finding \nthemselves in a situation where due to nothing they have done other \nthan be a good citizen, care for their kids and follow the rules, they \nare without employment. We have this year extended unemployment \ninsurance--and I am so grateful that President Obama has been willing \nto do this, has helped to lead this in the recovery act and then again \nas we ended a filibuster, a month-long filibuster in October, brought \nthat to an end in November to extend unemployment insurance. We find \nourselves again, because of the unemployment situation, even though we \nsee it getting a little bit better, with a long way to go. We are \nmoving in the right direction, but we have a long way to go. This bill \nwould extend for 2 months unemployment insurance that is critical for \nfamilies. It would also extend help with health insurance. We are \ndebating the larger health reform bill to create a way for families to \nbe able to afford insurance and for us to bring down costs over the \nlong run for businesses and for families.\n\n[[Page S13374]]\n\n  This bill in front of us that is being filibustered by the \nRepublicans would extend help for health care, for health insurance, \nfor COBRA payments--a program put in place that made a lot of sense. If \nyou lose your job, you could pay on your own to continue the coverage. \nBut it is incredibly expensive.\n  So recognizing that, and recognizing how tough it is when you lose \nyour job and you are in a situation--it is either savings or \nunemployment insurance or both--and you are trying to make the mortgage \npayment and care for the kids and put food on the table and pay the \nelectric bill and all of the other things, and then to add a several \nhundred or several thousand dollar payment for COBRA on top of that has \nnot been realistic for families. So we have placed a 65-percent \nsubsidy, to help families get through this tough time, for health \ninsurance. We also have assistance for food for families who, right \nnow, again, have never had to ask for help before in their lives but \nnow have a situation where they cannot put adequate food on the table \nfor their children.\n  This bill is very important, and what we have in front of us, \nunfortunately, is another filibuster, another objection--like we have \nseen all year--to stop us from moving forward to fund our military, to \nsupport our troops with a pay raise, to help military families, and \nthen to do a number of other things that are critical to do in the \nshort run until we get into the new year and are able to focus more \nbroadly on these things.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is not the first time this has \nhappened. We have had from the party of no 98 different objections this \nyear. This is a record, a world's record I think: 98 different times \nthat we have seen them objecting, filibustering, having stalling \ntactics to moving forward on things that ought to be bipartisan.\n  These are not Democratic issues when somebody has lost their job or \nwhen a small business needs help or needs health insurance they can \nafford or when a family finds themselves in a situation where they need \nto be able to have help to continue their health insurance or put food \non the table. This is not a Democratic idea or a Republican idea, this \nis American.\n  We have Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people who do not have \na party, people who are not active politically, people who vote, people \nwho do not vote. They are losing their jobs. They expect us to get it. \nThey expect us to have a sense of urgency around here.\n  The troops who are serving us right now, who are in tougher times \nthan we will ever face, are not saying what matters is whether you are \nDemocrat or Republican as to whether we fund the troops and fund the \nDepartment of Defense and give them a pay raise they have earned and \nneed or to help their families. They are saying: Come on. Come \ntogether. Solve problems. Get things done.\n  But yet, over and over--and we find ourselves tonight where we are \ngoing to be stopping a filibuster at 1 o'clock in the morning on a bill \nto fund the Department of Defense, on a bill that would help families \nget through the holiday season, keep a roof over their head, pay their \nheating bills, and keep food on the table.\n  To dramatize this even more, it is stunning to think about the fact \nthat out of the 40 weeks we have been in session this year--40 weeks--\nfor 36 of those weeks, we have had filibusters or stalling tactics, \nobjections to amendments or objections to bills being put on the floor. \nThat means only 4 weeks out of the entire year we have been in a \nsituation where the Republicans have not been saying no, have not been \nstalling on things that are incredibly important.\n  Even with all of this, by any objective measure, there has been more \naccomplished this year than in any other time since the Great \nDepression. We need to be accomplishing more and faster because people \nhave a tremendous sense of urgency about what is happening in their \nlives right now. So we need to be acting. Think of what we could have \ngotten done. We have all the things that have gotten done and have been \naddressed. Think about what we could have gotten done if we did not \nhave 36 weeks of filibusters that we had to deal with and objections we \nhad to deal with.\n  I hope, as we are going through this new year, there will be a sense \nthat it is time to get things together here and work for the common \ngood and put people back to work and tackle their health care costs and \nmake sure people can afford to have health insurance.\n  Let me close by sharing a story from Annette from Lake Orion, MI. She \nsays:\n\n       After a successful 21-year journalism career, I was laid \n     off in May when my newspaper closed. I will turn 60 in \n     October and am a 12-year survivor of breast cancer. My \n     husband, who is 62, is on my health insurance.\n       Thankfully, the federal government is helping [us] pay for \n     our COBRA, which would be more than $800 a month.\n       Senator, we're not pleading poverty. But it's easy to see \n     the dilemma of many Americans in our shoes: Risk going \n     without health insurance, you risk bankruptcy if someone gets \n     sick. Pay the current price, and watch your life savings, \n     which were supposed to support you in [your] old age, dwindle \n     down.\n       Don't listen to those screaming to maintain the status quo; \n     it doesn't work for too many Americans.\n\n  We have story after story where people are facing an early \nretirement--not by choice--dipping into retirement savings to try to \nkeep their health care going. Young people, old people need us to act \nnow, and I am urging Congress to act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is very distressing that Senator \nStabenow could not finish her remarks and that other Senators such as \nSenator Whitehouse and Senator Levin and Senator Lieberman have been \nshorted of time. Why? Because, for some reason, the majority leader \nfeels we should not go past 5:30 tonight.\n  This is a defense bill, and it is important. We need to be talking \nabout the good things that are in it and the things that have been \nadded to it that are not so good. I do not think working a few extra \nhours is going to hurt anybody.\n  I hear colleagues complain that they cannot work a weekend, they \ncannot work up to Christmas, they cannot work at night. Well, what \nabout our men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan 7 days \na week, 12 hours a day, Christmas and holidays? They are away from \ntheir families so I do not have any sympathy for any Member of the \nSenate who feels this is too hard for them. Also, I do not appreciate \nthe fact that we are shut off from debate tonight to be able to talk \nabout this issue that is before us. I see no reason for that to have to \noccur.\n  I object to the health care bill. The American people object to the \nhealth care bill--sixty-one percent say no. But we are supposed to now \nagree and go along with the majority? And if we do not, we are some \nsort of obstructionists? I do not think so. I believe I am representing \nmy constituency. I believe I am representing the best interests of the \nUnited States of America. I do not believe this health care bill is \npart of that.\n  With regard to the armed services bill--I am a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, and I have been a Member for 12 years; I have been \nto Iraq six times and Afghanistan six times--I believe it is great we \ncan give our soldiers a pay raise and support them. A lot of things in \nthe bill are good. There are some that are cut too much, but there are \na lot of things that are good, and I wish to vote for the bill. But \nthis defense bill has $18 billion in unrelated spending items attached \nit: increased unemployment, COBRA, food stamps, and loan subsidies for \nbusinesses.\n  Two things strike me about this. First, these new expenditures are \nnot paid for. They are not within the budget. They are above the \nbudget. What does that mean? Well, the budget itself has us in deficit. \nSo if it is not paid for in the budget resolution, every penny of this \n$18 billion goes straight to the debt of the United States of America. \nWe need to stop this.\n  Second, why did they put this kind of spending on the defense bill? \nBecause they want to come down here and say: Anybody who is not willing \nto go along with this scheme to pad $18 billion straight to the debt of \nthe United States of America--anybody who objects does not love our \nsoldiers.\n  That is wrong, and people are getting tired of that. This is how the \ndebt of this country is surging out of control.\n\n[[Page S13375]]\n\nThis Congress is irresponsible in our spending. We have increased the \ndebt the likes of which this Nation has never seen, and we are spending \nas if it is going out of style.\n  I would point out one matter here about the interest we pay on the \ndebt. In 2008, the annual deficit was $450 billion--at that time, the \nlargest ever. This past year, the deficit for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30 was $1,400 billion, $1.4 trillion. This puts us on the \nmap, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to double the entire \ndebt of America in 5 years, and triple it in 10. Unbelievable.\n  This is a kind of gimmick--attaching unpaid for, nonbudgeted items to \nthe defense bill, then trying to force it through, so we cannot do \nanything about it. They snicker, I am sure, in their self-confident way \nthat: We got 'em. If they object to the bill, we will say they don't \nlove our soldiers, they don't support America's defense.\n  I am getting tired of it. I think the American people are getting \ntired of it. I saw a poll where the most popular party in America today \nis the tea party--more than Republicans or Democrats.\n  Somebody said: Well, $18 billion, Sessions, that is not too much \nmoney. But it is done on bill after bill. This is not the only bill \nthat has these kinds of gimmicks in it. Let me show you. I figured this \nout one day. I put together a chart here a little bit hastily: Baseline \nIncreases: A Destructive Pattern.\n  When we increase funding in these bills above the budgeted amount and \nincrease the debt, people like to think: Well, it is just $18 billion. \nThat is not much.\n  Look how that works when you do it over a period of ten years. So \nlet's say next year, we go over $18 billion. This adds another $18 \nbillion to the national debt. Well, that is not so much. But wait, it \nis a lot. The State of Alabama's general fund budget is $2 billion. Do \nnot tell me $18 billion in one bill, on top of this defense bill, is \nnot a lot of money. It is a huge amount of money.\n  But it does not work that way. This $18 billion tends to go into the \nbaseline, so the next year, when they talk about increasing the budget, \nthey pad it by another $18 billion. It is not just $18 billion the next \nyear, you see. It is $18 billion on top of what was pumped into the \nbaseline the year before, and that totals out to $36 billion. Then the \nnext year, it is $36 billion, plus $18 billion more. And the next year, \nit is $54 billion, plus $18 billion more. The next year it is $72 \nbillion, plus $18 billion. The next year, it is $90 billion, plus $18 \nbillion. And the next years, it is $108 billion, $126 billion, $144 \nbillion, and $162 billion if you pad the budget. And this bill is just \n1 of 13 accounts: Defense. We have 13 different spending bills. How \nmuch is that? It is $900 billion in additional deficits, just because \nof our inability, our unwillingness, to stay by the numbers that we \nvoted on as our budget limit.\n\n  The budget itself, as presented by the President and passed by the \nDemocratic majority, put us on a road to having $1.4 trillion in \ndeficit last year, and it looks as though this year we are going to \nhave a another $1.4 trillion deficit. But just this one little gimmick, \nif it is replicated each year, can add almost $1 trillion more to the \ndebt of America over ten years. That is why we are concerned about it.\n  By the way, when we talk about the scheme that puts us on the road, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, to tripling the debt of \nAmerica by 2019, that does not include the health care bill. The health \ncare bill has not passed. This outlook only includes the things that \nare in law now. So how much more would those figures be if the debt \ngoes up?\n  I will point to one last thing about the overall financial status of \nthis country: the interest we pay on that debt. This chart shows it.\n  Last year, this Nation paid $170 billion in interest on the \nborrowings we have as a nation. In that 1 year it was $170 billion. \nThat is a lot of money. As I said, not counting the State education \nbudget, for all the other matters of our State of 4.6 million people--\nwhich is almost one-fiftieth of the Nation's population, an average-\nsized State--our general fund is $2 billion. However, $170 billion is \nhow much we paid in interest last year. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, those numbers will increase to where in 2019, as a \nresult of surging debt, $799 billion will be added to our debt because \nof interest we must pay; $799 billion just in that 1 year. That is more \nthan the whole defense budget. That is more than the whole U.S. \ndiscretionary budget from not too long ago. That is a huge amount of \nmoney. It is going to crowd out spending for schools, for highways, for \nhealth care, and for other projects.\n  I am very upset about it. We cannot continue. The President has said \nthis is an unsustainable course. Every economist we talk to says it is \nan unsustainable course.\n  But how do we get there? We get there by taking a Defense bill and \ntacking on $18 billion worth of unfunded spending. Every penny of that \ngets added to the debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I urge my colleagues to send this bill back and reform it so we can \nhave a clean Defense bill. We need to take these unpaid matters out and \nmake sure they are paid for.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to recognize this \nincredible opportunity to dramatically improve the health of our \nNation. Americans face out-of-control health care costs, great \ninequalities in access to care, eroding benefits, and the ever-\nincreasing threat of losing their health insurance. While it is no easy \ntask to fix a system that is both very complex and very troubled, we \ncannot fail to act.\n  I wish today to highlight the challenges faced by approximately 12 \nmillion Americans who buy health insurance in the individual market. \nMany farming and ranching families in South Dakota are forced to \npurchase from this market, where they all too often wind up \nunderinsured with coverage that costs too much and provides too little.\n  South Dakotans have contacted me directly to report health insurance \ndiscrimination that results in increased premiums, refusal of coverage \nfor necessary treatments, and denial of coverage. I have even heard \ncomplaints from people who work in the insurance industry, like Pam \nfrom Sioux Falls, SD. She shared with me the serious barriers people \nencounter when looking for health insurance on the individual market. \n``There are huge loopholes in the individual market. People who are not \nhealthy cannot get insurance. We turn people away every day and they \nwant to buy health insurance.''\n  Insurance companies increase their profits by selling to individuals \nwho will pay premiums but rarely use their benefits, and by avoiding \nindividuals who have health issues. This cherry-picking leaves millions \nof Americans without access to affordable health insurance coverage. \nAnd when families go without health insurance, they receive less \npreventive care and often must undergo more costly medical treatment \nwhen illness progresses undetected. This uncompensated care for the \nuninsured drives health care costs up for all of us.\n  Those who buy insurance on the individual market pay top dollar for \nvery limited coverage. They will benefit immensely from health reform. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will increase the \ninsurance options in the individual market and address injurious \ninsurance industry practices that limit access to care. Immediately \nafter enactment, a new program will be created to provide affordable \ncoverage to Americans with preexisting conditions until insurance \nindustry reforms are fully implemented. The legislation will also form \nhealth insurance exchanges in every State through which those limited \nto the individual market will have access to affordable and meaningful \ncoverage. The exchange will provide easy-to-understand information on \nvarious health insurance plans, help people find the right coverage to \nmeet their needs, and provide tax credits to significantly reduce the \ncost of purchasing that coverage.\n  Pam says, ``People who want to buy individual insurance should be \nable to, regardless of their health status.'' I couldn't agree more. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will ensure that no \nAmerican is denied coverage because of their medical history, and it \nwill provide the security of meaningful, affordable health care \ncoverage for all.\n\n[[Page S13376]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a matter that \nis of concern to the Congress and the Department of State, involving a \nheinous crime that occurred in Nepal and the need for justice.\n  Many people are familiar with the brutal murder of Maina Sunuwar in \nFebruary 2004. At the young age of 15, she was arrested by Nepali \nsoldiers and severely tortured to death at, of all places, the Birendra \nPeace Operations Training Center. After her murder, the army made it \nlook as though she had been shot while trying to escape, and then \nburied her body at the center.\n  According to a United Nations report, in September 2005, after \nintense public and international pressure, three army officers were \nbrought before a court martial and sentenced to a mere 6 months \nimprisonment for failing to follow proper procedures when disposing of \nMaina's body. In spite of many requests, the Nepal army refused to \ndisclose the nature of the charges that led to this sentence, or \nprovide copies of any documents relating to the court of inquiry or \ncourt martial. It also refused to cooperate with police investigations.\n  It is shocking that one of the officers accused in her murder, Major \nNiranjan Basnet, was permitted to participate in a United Nations \npeacekeeping mission in Chad. This speaks volumes about the inadequacy \nof vetting procedures of military personnel for such missions, which is \na separate subject that I intend to take up with officials at the \nDepartment of State and United Nations.\n  To his credit, Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal had Major Basnet \nreturned from Chad, following the issuance of an arrest warrant and in \nresponse to public calls for his arrest. However, when he arrived back \nat the Katmandu airport the army took him under its control and \napparently, despite initial promises and requests from the police and \norders from the Prime Minister, has still not handed him over to the \npolice.\n  This case represents a critical juncture for Nepal. In large measure, \nand as others have pointed out, Maina's death will decide whether a \ncivilian, democratic government and the rule of law will determine \nNepal's future, or it will remain dominated by the interests of the \nNepal army.\n  Just a few days ago, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2010, which includes a prohibition on assistance to \nthe Nepal army unless it, among other things, is cooperating fully with \ninvestigations and prosecutions by civilian judicial authorities of \nviolations of internationally recognized human rights. This provision \napplies squarely to Maina's case.\n  I urge the new Chief of the Army Staff, General Chhattraman Gurung, \nto seize this opportunity to demonstrate that the army is reforming, \nthat it recognizes in a democracy its members are answerable to the \ncivilian courts, and that it will no longer perpetuate the impunity \nthat has undermined the rule of law in Nepal for far too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13376-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13376-S13377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAROLE GUIDELINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long questioned the policy of \ndetaining asylum seekers who present genuine claims for protection \nunder our laws. Asylum seekers who express a fear of return to their \ncountry, and who can establish their identity and show that they are \nneither a flight risk nor a threat to the community, should be allowed \nto pursue a claim for relief in the United States free from custody. \nYesterday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, announced new \nguidelines for release of asylum seekers that override an unduly harsh \npolicy implemented in 2007 by the Bush administration and that are a \nwelcome step toward compliance with our obligations under the Refugee \nConvention.\n  Under current law, an asylum seeker who arrives at a port of entry \nand asks for refugee protection is given a brief interview to ascertain \nwhether he or she has a credible fear of persecution in their home \ncountry. If the asylum seeker passes that interview, they are detained, \npending a hearing on their claim before an immigration judge. That \nhearing may take place weeks or months after the asylum seeker arrives \nin the United States. Unless the asylum seeker can convince the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that they should be released, that \nasylum seeker can spend those weeks or months in immigration detention. \nThis policy is an affront to our ideals as a nation that aspires to be \na beacon of light to persecuted refugees.\n  In 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service developed \nguidelines to determine whether asylum seekers should be released from \ncustody in ``parole'' status while their asylum claims were \nadjudicated. To obtain parole, asylum seekers were required to \nestablish their identity, and show that they were neither a flight risk \nnor a threat to the community. These guidelines were properly \ncalibrated to deter fraud in the asylum system and threats to our \nnational security. They also ensured that those who met the criteria \nfor parole should be released. The 1997 parole guidelines were \nimperfectly implemented, but the policy contained in them was \nreasonable and appropriate.\n  For reasons that were never adequately explained, under the prior \nadministration, ICE issued new parole guidelines that raised the bar \nfor asylum seekers. In addition to the 1997 requirements, under the \nBush policy, an asylum seeker had to demonstrate other factors, such as \na serious medical condition, pregnancy, status as a minor, or that his \nor her release was in the ``public interest.'' The term ``public \ninterest'' was not defined in the 2007 guidelines and it is not clear \nhow a detained asylum seeker could have met such a vague standard. \nMembers of Congress and the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom questioned the need for such a restrictive policy, \nespecially when many asylum seekers have no criminal record and pose no \nrisk to Americans.\n  The new parole policy generally hews to the 1997 parole guidelines, \nbut contains an important improvement. Again, asylum seekers will be \neligible for parole if they demonstrate a credible fear of return to \ntheir country of origin, establish identity, and show that they are \nneither a flight risk nor a threat to the community. For the first \ntime, however, the government will conduct a parole review of each case \nin which the asylum seeker establishes a credible fear of return. Under \nboth the 1997 and 2007 policies, an asylum seeker had to request a \nparole determination in writing. Many asylum seekers arrive on our \nshores with genuine claims for protection, but no English language \nskills and no legal counsel. For these asylum seekers, navigating our \ncomplex immigration system presents an enormous hurdle. It is a \nchallenge for them to even comprehend that they may seek parole\n\n[[Page S13377]]\n\nfrom detention. Therefore, an automatic parole review will assist many \nbona fide refugees in winning release from custody. Our commitment to \nfair and humane treatment of refugees demands no less. This new policy \nwill also save taxpayer dollars spent to detain immigrants, including \nasylum seekers who are otherwise eligible for parole, at an average of \n$100 per person, per day.\n  In 1996, when our asylum laws were rewritten to restrict access to \nprotection for many who requested protection upon arrival, I fought \nhard to preserve our role as a nation that welcomes refugees. I offered \nan amendment to restore basic due process protections to the summary \nexclusion and expedited removal provisions proposed for asylum seekers. \nFormer Senator Michael DeWine of Ohio cosponsored the amendment, which \nprevailed by only one vote. Since that time, I have worked to \nstrengthen access to due process for asylum seekers and ensure that our \ngovernment complies with its international treaty obligations under the \nRefugee Convention.\n  I commend President Obama and Secretary Napolitano for engaging in a \nserious review of our asylum policies and taking steps to bring us \ncloser to full compliance with international law. With the thirtieth \nanniversary of the Refugee Act of 1980 approaching, I will continue to \npress for both legislative and administrative changes to the law that \nwill protect refugees and asylum seekers from harm and provide them \nwith safety and security in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13377-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the most \ndistinguished and recognized organizations for young people in the \nUnited States, the Boy Scouts of America. Specifically, I want to \nrecognize its tremendous efforts to uphold the principle of service to \nothers.\n  Today, the Boy Scouts of America is the largest youth service \norganization with nearly 3 million members. Its teachings of \ncitizenship, character development, and self-reliance are those which \nall Americans should strive to emulate in their daily lives. The \nprograms give participants the opportunity to engage in a wide range of \noutdoor activities, education programs, and career-oriented programs in \npartnership with many community organizations. Boy Scouts of America \ncelebrates 100 years of service on February 8, 2010, with the theme \n``Celebrating the Adventure, Continuing the Journey.'' This motto will \nserve its members as they continue teaching the necessary skills to \nmany more generations to come.\n  I want to recognize the efforts of the Jayhawk Area Council in \nnortheast Kansas. These members are planning for the next 100 years of \nScouting through their ``Building Tomorrow's Leaders'' project. This is \njust one of many projects that will honor the spirit of service in \ncommunities of Scouts across the Nation.\n  Boy Scouts of America recognizes that young leaders are developed \nover time, and has expanded its programs to help young men and women up \nto 20 years of age through Venturing Crews, Explorer Posts, and the \nLearning for Life groups. These programs have been shown to be \nmeaningful and to improve a Scout's likelihood for success as an adult \nand enhance the quality of life in the community where he resides. Boy \nScouts of America has kept up with the evolving and changing needs of \nour Nation, by adding programs in areas such as environmental ethics \nand responsibility. President Dwight Eisenhower recognized the \ncontributions of the Boy Scouts 56 years ago when he praised the \norganization, as it ``yearly enriches our Nation, and contributes \ngenerously to the economic, physical and spiritual resources of the \ncountry.''\n  Mr. President, the Boy Scouts of America have helped shape young \npeople of America for the past 100 years.

Mr. President, from the Marshall Plan to tsunami relief, \nAmerica's arsenal has always been most powerful when we have marshaled \nnot just the force of our arms but the power of our ideals. It is no \nsecret that for 8 recent years, the United States seemed to have broken \nwith some of our best tradition and time-honored values--and it set \nback our security to be so isolated in the world. I have said many \ntimes that even the most powerful Nation needs some friends on this \nplanet. Now, 1 year into President Obama's administration, the time is \nright for a robust public diplomacy to advance our interests in the \nworld and to enhance our national security. That is the conclusion of a \nnew report from New York University's John Brademas Center for the \nStudy of Congress.\n  The center, well known to the Senate for its research and \nrecommendations for new perspectives on public policies, recommends in \nits report that international arts and cultural exchanges be \nincorporated more fully into the planning strategies of U.S. \npolicymakers.\n  Mr. President, this is a timely and important study. I recommend it \nto the Senate and ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Moving Forward: A Renewed Role for American Arts and Artists in the \n                               Global Age\n\n       The 2008 election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of \n     the United States has offered an historic opportunity for the \n     renewal of faith in the American political system and \n     restoration of America's image around the world. In January \n     2009, the John Brademas Center of the NYU Wagner convened a \n     group of experts to explore the public policy implications \n     for American arts and culture of a renewed focus on U. S. \n     public diplomacy and issued a call for an expansion of \n     international arts and cultural exchanges in the service of \n     this new direction. The following report is the result of \n     their expert opinions and deliberations.\n       The mission of the John Brademas Center for the Study of \n     Congress is to increase the understanding of Congress--its \n     role in making policy and its powers, processes, and \n     responsibilities. The Center's nonpartisan work reaches \n     scholars, students, public servants, policy makers and the \n     general public. The Center conducts research, sponsors \n     student internships, organizes academic conferences and \n     public symposia, and hosts policy addresses by Members of \n     Congress. As a part of the New York University's Robert F. \n     Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, the Center strives \n     to help the next generation of public service leaders develop \n     a deeper understanding of how and why Congress makes \n     decisions. It is named for its founder, NYU President \n     Emeritus John Brademas, who served in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives for 22 years (1959-81).\n       The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service of \n     New York University is a leadership school of public policy, \n     urban planning and non-profit management whose faculty \n     members are widely recognized for reframing the way people \n     understand and act on issues of public importance, and whose \n     graduates are bold, well-prepared change makers who expertly \n     navigate real-world complexity and produce results that \n     matter.\n       This report has been prepared and edited by Michael F. \n     DiNiscia and Thomas M. McIntyre of the John Brademas Center \n     and Professor Ruth Ann Stewart of the Robert F. Wagner \n     Graduate School, New York University.\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       Over the past decade, studies have shown that public \n     opinion in other countries--particularly in the Islamic \n     world--has taken an increasingly unfavorable view of the \n     government and foreign policy of the United States. Yet \n     international opinion about the values and culture of the \n     United States, as distinct from government policies, has \n     remained more positive according to the most recent surveys \n     conducted by the non-partisan Pew Global Attitudes Project \n     even in Middle Eastern countries. The inclination to view the \n     fundamental ideals of American society as positive provides a \n     valuable opening for policymakers to utilize the arts and \n     culture both to advance America's international interests and \n     enhance the cultural experience of its citizens and their \n     understanding of America's place in a rapidly changing world.\n       To these ends, this report recommends that international \n     arts and cultural exchanges be integrated into the planning \n     strategies of U.S. policymakers as a key element of public \n     diplomacy. History has proven that a robust public diplomacy \n     is essential to U.S. national security and the promotion of \n     American interests around the globe. The arts community has \n     observed firsthand the value of international artistic \n     exchanges in promoting moderation and tolerance among widely \n     diverse religious and cultural groups.\n       Recognizing the fiscal constraints imposed by the current \n     economic downturn, the report advises policymakers and the \n     arts community to first focus on new and better ways to \n     utilize arts and cultural exchange initiatives that are \n     currently underway in both the private and governmental \n     sectors.\n\n[[Page S13378]]\n\n       As responsibility for America's public diplomacy \n     initiatives is shared among the White House, National \n     Security Council, Department of State, Congress, National \n     Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the \n     Humanities (NEH), Institute of Museum and Library Services, \n     and other Federal agencies, this report offers specific \n     suggestions and recommendations for fostering greater \n     interagency cooperation in the integration of arts and \n     cultural exchanges into their respective strategies.\n       At the same time, American arts groups feel a \n     responsibility for promoting an understanding of the vibrancy \n     of arts and culture in our country that both animates our \n     democracy and nourishes international exchanges and America's \n     image. Thus, the report recommends a national conversation on \n     the arts generally and their centrality to the quality of \n     American life both home and abroad.\n\n\n               A NATIONAL CONVENING ON CULTURAL DIPLOMACY\n\n       We recommend that a National Convening on Cultural \n     Diplomacy be held in Washington, DC to bring together \n     policymakers and leaders in the arts community. Such a \n     meeting would be a way of directly engaging artists, at a \n     time of domestic and international difficulty, in the efforts \n     to tell anew America's story and expand and to deepen our \n     country's understanding of foreign societies and the value of \n     cultural diplomacy to the security and quality of American \n     life.\n       The Convening would attempt to engage the relevant agencies \n     of the Federal Government to make arts and cultural exchanges \n     a strategic part of U.S. public diplomacy. While the meeting \n     could be best organized by one or more nonprofit \n     organizations working in this field, it would benefit greatly \n     from the support and collaboration of the U.S. Department of \n     State as the lead Federal agency promoting international \n     exchanges.\n       We believe that the meeting would be greatly enhanced by \n     the inclusion of representatives from other countries who are \n     leaders of international cultural initiatives.\n       We believe such a meeting, drawing together policy makers, \n     artists, scholars and representatives of professional service \n     organizations, foundations, and other nonprofit as well as \n     for-profit groups involved in the arts, would provide an \n     agenda for Congress and the Administration to build on \n     current resources and programs to expand international arts \n     and cultural exchanges--in both directions--in the service of \n     America's national security and quality of life.\n\n\n                 BUILDING DEEPER AND BROADER EXCHANGES\n\n       We believe it is critical that international arts and \n     cultural exchanges be two-way, person-to-person endeavors in \n     order to promote the human connection and that such \n     connections be sustained over time and not just episodic \n     events, as too often has been the case. As an example, we \n     recommend that visual arts presentations include an \n     educational component and performing arts master classes to \n     strengthen the value of these face-to-face interactions.\n       We believe that given the appropriate level of funding and \n     commitment long term, cultural diplomacy programs can \n     demonstrate--using evidence-based evaluation--their success \n     and effectiveness in promoting the best aspects of America's \n     culture and democracy.\n       American culture is rich in its diversity and demographic \n     make-up. Through the recruitment and exchange of outstanding \n     representatives of all of America's many cultures, we can \n     demonstrate the multicultural nature of American society at \n     its best, presenting a vision of openness and freedom of \n     expression to societies where such opportunities are often \n     lacking. Similarly, we urge a public diplomacy policy that \n     welcomes the cultures of others to our shores.\n       We believe that cultural exchanges must not only be two-way \n     but also sensitive to local needs, practices, and aspirations \n     in selecting the type of American art to promote in a given \n     country or region. The Internet has opened up to the world \n     the rich variety of art and artists the U.S. has to offer and \n     we should seek to meet those expectations and interests \n     including for popular culture and the nonconventional.\n       It would seem that a priority for arts and cultural \n     exchanges would be with countries with which the United \n     States has limited official relations as well as with \n     countries where there is a low level of travel or interaction \n     at the citizen level.\n       We think cultural exchanges that focus on restoration and \n     preservation projects are especially productive as would be \n     the exchange of experts in the areas of performing arts \n     administration, museum policies and techniques, etc. \n     Technical assistance exchanges have a long history of helping \n     other countries to celebrate their heritage and promote \n     tolerance between nations while at the same time giving \n     Americans opportunities to learn about other cultures.\n       In the past, cultural exchanges organized by the Federal \n     Government have on occasion raised suspicions that artists \n     had compromised their artistic integrity. We believe in the \n     importance of government at all levels--federal, state and \n     local--working with nonprofits and NGOs both at home and in \n     foreign countries to avoid the appearance that cultural \n     exchanges are contrived solely to serve U.S. foreign policy \n     interests rather than the intended purpose of furthering \n     mutual understanding. To that end, we urge that the \n     international exchange process not be centralized in or \n     overly coordinated at the national level but instead \n     structured to draw in artists and arts groups directly at \n     all levels.\n\n\n                                RESEARCH\n\n       Policymakers need credible evidence to help them determine \n     the merits and value of expanding international exchange \n     programs. We believe that a National Convening on Cultural \n     Diplomacy would provide the appropriate forum for assembling \n     a body of expert testimony and current and directed research \n     that would facilitate a clear and focused examination of \n     potential outcomes.\n       We believe it would be beneficial to such deliberations if \n     a comprehensive inventory and review were undertaken of \n     current programs by federal, state, and local governments and \n     private groups in the international arts and cultural \n     exchange area.\n       We recommend that a State Dept Working Group on Cultural \n     Diplomacy be charged with responsibility for coordinating the \n     effort to collect, examine and evaluate relevant reports and \n     data generated by both government and civil society \n     organizations as supplemented and supported by the \n     Congressional Research Service, private foundations, and \n     scholarly research efforts sponsored by the National \n     Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the \n     Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum and Library \n     Services (IMLS).\n       We believe that a particularly productive part of the \n     research process would be the opportunity to document actual \n     experiences and impacts of both past and on-going cultural \n     exchanges, especially the person-to-person encounters that \n     have well established track records for generating \n     significant and measurable goodwill toward the United States.\n       We believe that verification of such successes would not \n     only help substantiate the case for international art and \n     cultural exchanges as an important part of public diplomacy \n     but would also enable us to identify and evaluate best \n     practices in the field.\n       It is our hope that private foundations would support the \n     research process and, working in collaboration with the arts \n     community, help to determine a series of metrics for not only \n     evaluating international programs but the adequacy as well of \n     resources and work opportunities for the American artists and \n     institutions who would fuel such efforts.\n       We recommend that the State Department be encouraged to be \n     an active participant in the ongoing efforts by such \n     international organizations as UNESCO and World Monuments \n     Fund to map the world's cultural infrastructure toward the \n     protection of important art objects, artistic forms, sites, \n     and institutions located in disaster and conflict areas. The \n     U.S. Defense Dept and Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     might also be considered as a source of funding and \n     assistance for such undertakings.\n\n\n                   TECHNOLOGY & TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n       In recognition of the borderless nature of the Internet we \n     urge that the latest and most advanced electronic social \n     networking technology be utilized in cultural diplomacy \n     programs.\n       We believe that stronger cultural exchanges would result \n     from government moving beyond the older idea of technology as \n     broadcasting medium to harness the new and most advanced \n     social networking technologies that not only distribute \n     message and art but also encourage civic engagement and \n     social connectivity.\n       Given the effectiveness of the American public/private \n     model, a National Convening on Cultural Diplomacy would \n     explore opportunities to recommend to Government ways of \n     working in association with private nonprofit and for-profit \n     cultural organizations with popular social networking sites \n     in order to expand the range of possibilities for sharing and \n     exchanging cultural experiences.\n       We believe that the pairing of technology and culture would \n     be especially efficacious through the dissemination of \n     hardware and software (e.g., cell phones, wi-fi systems, low-\n     cost computers, hand-crank radios, etc.) to more remote areas \n     of the globe where cultural understanding and exchanges are \n     especially needed.\n       We also recommend cultural exchanges involving scholars and \n     experts in such specialties as performing arts management, \n     conservation and preservation, museology, and curation, \n     especially those with expertise in newer forms of media and \n     technology. For example, we urge the expansion and \n     integration into public diplomacy efforts of the Cultural \n     Preservation Fund which currently sends conservators abroad \n     to provide technical assistance and run education projects,\n\n\n                       PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP\n\n       We believe that the Government should encourage and promote \n     two-way international exchanges, acting in a convening role \n     to bring together private organizers and private funders, as \n     the cost should not be fully assumed by American taxpayers.\n       We urge the State Department to consider ways in which it \n     might utilize its administrative capacity and area expertise \n     to explore possibilities for working with foundations and \n     U.S. corporations to increase grants for international \n     exchanges, as well as to investigate the potential of \n     coordinated activity with the many arts and media industries \n     engaged in the international marketplace of culture.\n       At the same time, we recognize the importance of members of \n     the arts community keeping informed about policy changes and \n     shifts in the national agenda. We believe\n\n[[Page S13379]]\n\n     that over time and in evolving ways, cultural exchanges could \n     render service in partnership with government (as well as \n     foundations and corporations) that would continue to enhance \n     America's public diplomacy process.\n       We believe that through the export of a wide diversity of \n     American arts and artists, and the import (and ready \n     admission through the passage of the Arts Require Timely \n     Service Act [H.R. 1785 and S. 1409]) of a broadly \n     representative group of foreign arts and artists, America's \n     best foreign and domestic cultural interests would be served.\n\n\n                    LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL\n\n       We believe that the effectiveness of American public \n     diplomacy would be advanced by the integration of cultural \n     diplomacy into the policy-making process of the White House \n     and the State Department.\n       We propose that a National Convening on Cultural Diplomacy \n     incorporate into its agenda an examination of the recent call \n     by various nongovernmental study groups concerned with \n     Federal support of the arts generally for the creation of a \n     full time White House post specifically charged with \n     promoting the arts and culture as part of the Domestic \n     Policy Council. Arts and cultural professionals agree that \n     without a strong and healthy cultural sector at home \n     (frequently characterized as cultural vibrancy), the U.S. \n     would not have the rich pool of diverse talents in place \n     and available when selecting art and artists to represent \n     the nation at its best internationally.\n       We further recommend that a National Convening on Cultural \n     Diplomacy be given the opportunity to propose the creation by \n     the President of a position on the National Security Council \n     (NSC) to oversee public diplomacy, including the coordination \n     of relevant arts and cultural exchange efforts with the \n     Domestic Policy Council, State Department, and the Federal \n     cultural agencies.\n       We further recommend the National Convening agenda include \n     a proposal for the creation of a Standing Committee to advise \n     the Secretary of State on ways in which the State Department \n     could begin to renew its diplomatic strength and expertise in \n     the area of culture. Committee members would be persons in \n     the arts world involved in both informal and formal \n     international exchanges.\n       We would also recommend that a Special Envoy for Culture be \n     appointed by the State Department to work on building \n     relationships and partnerships with foreign governments and \n     international bodies such as UNESCO, International Council of \n     Museums, World Heritage Alliance, et al.\n\n\n                       EXPANDING FEDERAL PROGRAMS\n\n       We believe that it is both timely and desirable to urge the \n     creation of a new direction for public diplomacy through the \n     expansion of Federal cultural programming.\n       We believe that key to this new direction is an expansion \n     of the budgetary capacity of the State Department to increase \n     the number of cultural affairs officers stationed at \n     embassies and consulates and their capabilities for carrying \n     out cultural programming as the ones most informed about what \n     exchanges would be best coupled with which country.\n       We recommend that, in addition to increasing its personnel \n     numbers, the State Department further enhance its ability to \n     attract good people by creating parity in career advancement \n     and status between cultural affairs officers and political \n     officers.\n       We believe that the State Department would benefit as well \n     from the creation of a Cultural Diplomacy Fellowship Program \n     that would increase the flow of personnel through the \n     cultural diplomacy system; rotate outside cultural experts \n     through the Department; and enable State Department employees \n     to go for further training at cultural institutions in the \n     U.S. and abroad for fixed periods of time.\n       Additional recommendations that have been proposed for \n     consideration by a National Convening on Cultural Policy \n     include:\n       A publicity campaign coordinated by the State Dept., NEA, \n     NEH, and IMLS to alert more U.S. and foreign artists and \n     cultural institutions about the opportunities available for \n     international cultural exchanges, including Fulbright \n     fellowships.\n       Ways for the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) to support cultural programs that are \n     consistent with their development goals (i.e., cultural \n     preservation projects and arts and crafts programs).\n       Ways for the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps to develop cultural \n     projects and recruit artists into both organizations.\n       Ways for the Commerce Department to promote cultural \n     tourism that would direct Americans to cultural programs \n     abroad and market cultural activities in the U.S. to foreign \n     tourists.\n       Increase funding for arts and cultural exchanges in \n     departments other than State and the Federal cultural \n     agencies (e.g., Defense Department, Commerce Department, \n     etc.) to encourage the sending of artists and technical \n     assistance to localities deemed to be less developed and \n     comfortable.\n\n\n                          CONGRESSIONAL ACTION\n\n       We encourage the relevant committees in Congress, in \n     particular the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees, \n     to hold a series of public hearings on the proposals coming \n     out of the National Convening on Cultural Diplomacy.\n       We believe that congressional hearings are key to the \n     development of new and expanded legislation and programs in \n     support of two-way cultural exchanges, for all the reasons \n     and recommendations outlined above.\n       We offer the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act of 1975 for \n     consideration by the Congress in its deliberations as a \n     legislative model of the time proven success of international \n     cooperation and cultural exchange.\n       We recommend the inclusion in such hearings of a broad \n     representation of knowledgeable parties, especially \n     representatives of state and local arts and humanities \n     councils and agencies and of professional service \n     organizations.\n       Finally, we again urge the reintroduction and passage by \n     Congress of the Arts Require Timely Service Act [H.R. 1785 \n     and S. 1409] as an essential component of cultural exchange \n     and the enrichment and diversity of the cultural experience \n     of the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13379-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LAW STUDENT PARTICIPATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have introduced the Law Student \nParticipation Act of 2009.\n  The bill creates exceptions to Federal conflicts of interest law \nwhich generally prohibits Federal employees from acting as an attorney \nor agent in a matter adverse to the U.S. government. The legislation \ndirects the exceptions to Federal employees attending law school and \nparticipating in legal clinics and employees of the District of \nColumbia who staff legal clinics. Where the Federal employee has \nparticipated personally and substantially in the matter or the matter \nis before the employee's particular agency or department, specific \nconflicts of interest provisions still apply. The current law is over \nbroad and denies learning and teaching opportunities where no real \nconflict may exist.\n  Law schools, including schools in my home State, have voiced concern \nover the present law. Some of these schools include the University of \nMaryland, the University of the District of Columbia, and Georgetown \nUniversity School of Law. The schools have related stories of students, \nwho are Federal employees, regulated to clinics dealing only with state \nmatters. In other instances a student might start working on a client's \nmatter, but will be unable to continue once the matter goes to trial or \nbefore an administrative proceeding. Law schools complain that under \nsuch circumstances the client's right to effective counsel is \ndiminished. Due to a requirement I championed, the University of \nMaryland School of Law faces unique challenges. Each student must \nprovide legal services to the poor or persons who otherwise lack access \nto justice prior to graduation. Federal employees, unlike other \nstudents, must choose from a smaller selection of clinics due to the \ncurrent Federal conflicts of interest law. Finally, if Federal employee \nstudents seek careers in practice areas where Federal law predominates, \nthey likely will obtain no practical clinic experience in law school.\n  It should be noted that the Office of Government Ethics, OGE, and the \nDepartment of Justice are aware of the text of the bill. Both have \nconveyed informally that they do not have problems with this \nlegislation. The OGE released a report in 2006 that was critical of \ncurrent Federal conflict of interest law as being overbroad and \nspecifically pointed out that volunteer work was frequently barred even \nwhen no potential for conflict of interest existed.\n  The current law deprives law students who are Federal employees of \nvaluable practical educational opportunities. Ultimately participation \nin these clinics would result in better attorneys many of whom later go \non to work for the Federal government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13379-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13379-S13380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING SOL PRICE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember Sol Price, \nwho passed away on December 14, 2009, at the age of 93. Sol was a man \nof vision in business, charity, and community. I will remember his \ngreat accomplishments, but I will also remember him as a wonderful man \nand a dear friend.\n  A trendsetter in retail, Sol Price founded FedMart and the Price \nClub, which subsequently sparked the wholesale warehouse industry. He \nenvisioned providing consumers with products at low prices while \nproviding good wages and working conditions for his employees. When \nFedMart opened its first\n\n[[Page S13380]]\n\nstore in San Antonio, TX, in 1957, Sol Price paid double the minimum \nwage. He also succeeded getting a mortgage company to drop its \nrequirement on separate restroom facilities for ``Colored'' and \n``Whites.''\n  Sol Price was a leader in philanthropy and education. In 1991, after \nthe death of his grandson Aaron, he established the Price Fellows \nprogram for young people in San Diego County, with a mission to enrich \ntheir lives and encourage stewardship for their community. The 3-year \nprogram for high school students teaches them about business, cultural \ninstitutions, and government; it also encourages lasting relationship \nacross different ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. This \nprogram has created a new generation of local leaders in government, \nbusiness, and civic life.\n  In 2000, Sol and his wife Helen set up the San Diego Revitalization \nCorporation, which was later renamed Price Charities. The end goal is \nto improve the lives of the urban poor. Among his many commitments, Sol \nworked to revitalize City Heights, a neighborhood in the city of San \nDiego that was a poor, high-crime but diverse community. In partnership \nwith the city of San Diego, he built low-income housing and commercial \nspace for community organizations and attracted businesses that would \nnot otherwise have located in City Heights.\n  Sol was a member of the board of trustees for the Urban Institute in \nWashington, DC, the board of directors for the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, the Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee of the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and the San Diego Financial Review \nPanel.\n  Born in the Bronx, NY, Sol Price grew up in San Diego. He graduated \nfrom San Diego State University in 1934 and earned a law degree in 1938 \nfrom the University of Southern California.\n  Sol will be dearly missed. There is no doubt that his spirit will \nlive on, carried along by the people he helped, the neighborhoods he \ntransformed, and the entrepreneurial path he blazed.\n  He is survived by two sons, Robert and Larry, five grandchildren, and \nfour great-grandchildren. My heart goes out to the family during this \ntime of grief. They are in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13380-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ORVAL ALLEN KELSO\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the accomplishments of Mr. Orval Allen Kelso.\n  Today, deeply engaged in a war on terror, thousands of American \ncivilians are working and serving in harm's way. Like the brave men and \nwomen serving in uniform, these patriotic citizens risk their lives \nevery day in an effort to rebuild a stronger future for the people of \nIraq. However, they are not alone. American civilian contractors have \nbeen operating in combat theatres since as early as World War II, and I \nam here today to tell you about one of those.\n  Hailing from Emmett, ID, Orval Allen Kelso arrived on Wake Island in \nthe North Pacific in June 1941, working as a powerplant operator for \nMorrison Knudsen. Mr. Kelso worked as a powerplant operator until \nDecember 1941, when he was captured and taken as a POW to Camp 18, \nSesabo, Japan. While a POW at Camp 18, Orval helped build the Soto Dam \nthat provides water to Sesabo city today. He, among several hundred \ncivilian POWs, built this dam with hardly the right tools to work with, \nmalnutrition, improper clothing, and daily physical and emotional abuse \nby their captors. Orval later died in Camp 18 on April 8, 1943, just \ndays after his birthday. In 1949, his only child, Walter Richard \n``Dick'' Kelso, reclaimed his father's remains, and brought him back to \nrest on U.S. soil at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in \nHonolulu, HI. I also note that although Mr. Kelson was a civilian \nduring the time I have discussed, after his death, the Department of \nthe Navy awarded him an E4 military status.\n  It is fitting that we honor Mr. Kelso for his sacrifice and also be \nreminded of the many others who were taken prisoner or who paid the \nultimate sacrifice working in harm's way. We often forget about the \nnonmilitary Americans who gave their all for the freedoms we cherish in \nour great Nation. Let us help remedy that today by recognizing Mr. \nKelso and the civilian POWs taken during World War II. They are an \nexemplary example of the selflessness displayed by Americans in an \neffort to bring peace and freedom to millions, and we thank them for \ntheir sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13380-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD R. JENNINGS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Richard R. \nJennings of Wilmington, MA, for the honor he received from the \nSmithsonian Institution at the American History Museum earlier this \nyear. Mr. Jennings was recognized for his long service with the Railway \nMail Service. The 85-year-old Mr. Jennings is one of the last survivors \nof one of the most important innovations in the history of mail service \nin the United States.\n  Mr. Jennings was honored as part of a postal service exhibit at the \nAmerican History Museum last summer. In addition to the recognition he \nreceived, the Smithsonian also recorded Mr. Jennings's memories of his \nyears as part of the Boston-to-Albany and the Boston-to-New York ``mail \nby rail'' routes--part of a network that was so important to U.S. mail \nservice before the airlines took over much of the service.\n  The Railway Mail Service began in the mid-19th century but grew in \nimportance as the railroads became dominant in transportation until the \nmid-20th century. ``Mail by rail'' was quite successful--dramatically \nincreasing the speed of delivery of mail, especially over long \ndistances.\n  Mr. Jennnings and his fellow Railway Mail Service clerks were \nconsidered the elite of the Postal Service's employees. And for good \nreason. Their jobs were exhausting and dangerous. They were required to \nsort 600 pieces of mail an hour in a speeding train that could wreck--\nand occasionally did. The potential for danger certainly added pressure \nto an already difficult job.\n  In addition to changing our postal system, the Railway Mail Service \nwas the source of an expression well known in the United States. Empty \nmail sacks and sacks filled with damaged, misaddressed or otherwise \nunsortable mail were referred to as ``bums.'' And before the trains \nwould leave the stations along their routes, rail clerks would often \nshout ``throw the bums out.''\n  Mr. Jennings served this country in important ways, not only as a \npostman in the ``mail by rail'' network but also as a sergeant with the \nU.S. Army Medical Corps in Italy and North African during World War II. \nThere, as much as with the ``mail by rail'' service, Mr. Jennings \nhelped to ``throw the bums out.''\n  Mr. Jennings deserves our thanks for his unique and great service to \nour country. I congratulate him and his family and I share their pride \nin him and his important role in the history of our country's Postal \nService.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13380-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13380-S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DICK AND CHRISTINE MOODY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, anyone who has served in our Armed \nForces or who has had a loved one in uniform understands just how \ndifficult the holiday season can be--separated from husbands, wives, \nfathers, mothers, daughters, and sons. It can be the loneliest time of \nthe year. Dick and Christine Moody understand that better than most, \nand since 2003 they have worked tirelessly to make the holidays a \nlittle cheerier for the men and women who keep America safe. They have \ndone it with Operation Troop Support, the organization they founded 6 \nyears ago as a way to say thank to those serving in the military.\n  Since its founding, Operation Troop Support has sent more than 25,000 \ncare packages to men and women in the military abroad. These packages \nare sent throughout the year, but during the holidays extra care is \ntaken to see that the season is a little brighter for the troops. And \nit is for that reason that during this holiday season, I would like to \nrecognize and commend Dick and Christine Moody for their efforts--\nefforts that have earned them national recognition and the accolades of \nthe National Military Family Association, the Employer Support to the\n\n[[Page S13381]]\n\nGuard and Reserve, ESGR, and numerous State and local officials.\n  I also want to recognize the hundreds of volunteers who have \ncontributed their time, energy and money to Operation Troop Support. \nThe support the North Shore community has given the organization has \nbeen inspiring. Volunteers have spent countless hours boxing the care \npackages, and they have donated thousands of dollars to ship the \npackages to ensure that each soldier, marine, airman and sailor \nreceives something during the holiday season.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with many of the Operation Troop \nSupport volunteers while attending a St. Patricks Day luncheon hosted \nby the organization last year. During the luncheon, I spoke with a \nsoldier, Thomas Lanzoni, who had recently returned from Iraq. Inspired \nby the volunteers of Operation Troop Support, Sergeant Lanzoni walked \nacross the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to raise money and awareness \nfor the Moodys's organization.\n  Dick and Christine Moody understand the special burden placed on \nmilitary families. Dick spent 23 years in the Air Force and retired as \na lieutenant colonel. Additionally, the Moodys have a son and a \ndaughter who have served abroad in the Air Force. The military has long \nbeen a part of their life. Consequently, Operation Troop Support not \nonly supports the troops in the field but also hosts family support \ngroup meetings for the loved ones of servicemembers deployed or about \nto be deployed overseas.\n  I salute the Moodys and Operation Troop Support for their service and \ndedication to our country. Their gestures of gratitude have reached \nthousands of servicemembers, reminding each of them that we support \nthem and their families while they are deployed and when they \nreturn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13381-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          2009 NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED RHODE ISLAND TEACHERS\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the announcement yesterday \nthat 44 Rhode Island teachers and nearly 9,000 teachers nationwide \nachieved National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \ncertification this year.\n  The single most effective step we can take to raise student \nachievement and turn around struggling schools is to ensure that we \nimprove the quality of our teachers. For years I have worked to improve \nwhat the Federal Government does to help train and develop teachers. \nIndeed, I have worked with National Board on nearly every piece of \nteacher quality legislation I have introduced in the Senate. The \nNational Board has been instrumental in identifying effective teaching \npractices and infusing those practices throughout our Nations schools. \nTheir certification process is rigorous and includes multiple \ncomponents that regularly assess and improve a teacher's ability to \nimprove student learning. Since 1994, 82,000 teachers have been \nNational Board certified, including 383 Rhode Island teachers.\n  Last week, the National Board announced an expansion of their \ncertification process to include principals and other school leaders, \nrecognizing the research that effective leadership is second only to \nclassroom instruction among factors that influence student outcomes. I \nwas pleased that this important expansion was made possible through \nFederal funding provided through the fiscal year 2009 Labor, Health, \nand Education appropriations bill.\n  I congratulate the Rhode Island teachers and teachers nationwide on \ntheir significant accomplishment and dedication to their professional \ndevelopment, and I look forward to continuing to work with the National \nBoard to ensure that our children have the most effective teachers, \nprincipals, and school leaders.\n  I ask that the names of the Rhode Island teachers who achieved \nNational Board certification this year be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          2009 Rhode Island National Board Certified Teachers\n\n       Rhonda Asprinio, Michelle Beaulieu, Karen Bessette, \n     Catherine Boutin, Dawn Brooder, Alison Burke, Jaclyn Cambio, \n     David Clegg, Leila Connolly, Suzanne Costa, Lilly Coustan, \n     Cheryl Degnan, Stephanie Desmarais, Amy Devault, Jonathan \n     Dune, Kerri Gendice, Michael Gendice, Andrea Hainey-Turcotte, \n     Carolyn Higgins, Michaela Holmes, James Hovey, and David \n     Kearsley.\n       Denise Ledoux, Jeanne Maggiacomo, Treva Mcelroy, Karen \n     Mchenry, Maryelizabeth Melillo, Bonnie Morency-Lima, Lisa \n     Narcisi, Kerry Perschau, Margaret Pouliot, Mary Roberts, \n     Elizabeth Ruest, Lynn Rzemien-Plotkin, Marilyn Salisbury, \n     Elyse Scherza, Denise Sherman, Nicole Tetreault, Jennifer \n     Theroux, Julee Thomas, Christa Thompson, Jennifer Walker, \n     Lynn Warila, and Amy Weigand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13381-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANDREW SAMWICK\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I congratulate Professor \nAndrew Samwick for being recognized for his dedication to and his \nexcellence in teaching. Professor Samwick is the winner of the 2009 New \nHampshire Professor of the Year Award, one of the most prestigious \nawards for undergraduate teaching. Honorees are recognized for their \ninfluence in the lives and careers of their students.\n  Mr. Samwick has taught at Dartmouth College since 1994 and is a \nprofessor of economics and the director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller \nCenter for Public Policy and Social Sciences. He is a well-known expert \non the economics of retirement and social security reform, and has \ntestified several times before Congress and has served as chief \neconomist on the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisors. \nHe is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch where he cochairs the Social Security Working Group.\n  Professor Samwick graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College and \nreceived a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology. He has won numerous prizes, grants, and fellowships for his \nwork. His articles frequently appear in prestigious economics and \nfinance journals and he often provides commentary and opinion for \nnational public radio and national newspapers.\n  The U.S. Professors of the Year program acknowledges the most \nexceptional undergraduate instructors in the country--those who stand \nout in their teaching and positive influence on the lives and careers \nof their students. It is important that we recognize the critical work \nand contribution that our talented professors make in educating the \nnext generation of young people. I am extremely proud that Professor \nSamwick has been honored by this prestigious distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13381-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13381-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/17/senate-section/article/S13381-5", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13381-S13382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1472.

    By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2895. A bill to restore forest landscapes, protect old growth \nforests, and manage national forests in the eastside forests of the \nState of Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce critical forest \nlegislation for my home State of Oregon.\n  For too many decades, Oregon has been at war with itself over the \nfate of one of our most abundant--and most threatened--resources, our \nforests.\n  Nowhere has the negative impact of this battle been greater than in \nOregon's eastside forests.\n  Over-logging and disastrous fire suppression policies of the past \ngave way over time to excessive litigation and gridlock.\n  With each passing month, our inability to take action, our inability \nto address the needs of Oregon's declining forests means that they are \ngrowing more at risk of preventable fire and disease.\n  With each passing month and each attempted timber sale and threatened \nlawsuit, the relationship between the environmental community and the \ntimber industry has grown increasingly bitter.\n  Each side in these disputes has thoroughly armed itself politically \nenough to survive, but never enough to succeed.\n  The end result is that today, across Oregon's Federal forest \nlandscape, we have around 9.5 million acres of choked, at-risk forest \nin desperate need of management, and millions of acres of old growth, \nspecies habitat, and watersheds face an uncertain future.\n  Unless something fundamental changes, that number and that peril will \ngrow, not shrink, in coming years.\n  Today, good and decent people on both sides of these difficult issues \nhave come together with me to craft legislation that will bring peace, \njobs, and a healthier tomorrow to 8.3 million acres of Federal forest \nin eastern and central Oregon.\n  Today, for the first time in memory, timber executives are standing \nshoulder-to-shoulder with leaders of the Oregon environmental community \nto take shared responsibility for saving our endangered forests.\n  These folks have been a part of negotiations with my office for over \n8 months, and have made difficult concessions in order to save our \nthreatened Eastside forests.\n  Today in eastern Oregon we are down to only a small handful of \nsurviving mills. Without far greater certainty of supply and an \nimmediate increase in merchantable timber, more mills will close.\n  If that happens our Eastside forests will pay the price.\n  Without mills to process saw logs and other merchantable material \nfrom forest restoration projects, there will be no restoration of our \nEastside forests.\n  The folks my office worked with to come to an agreement set aside \ntheir differences and found common ground that will prevent that from \nhappening.\n  The legislation that we are rolling out today, the Oregon Eastside \nForests Restoration, Old Growth Protection and Jobs Act of 2009, will \nprovide an immediate supply of logs in the short term to jump-start \nrestoration efforts and keep our timber mills alive.\n  Job One must be saving our remaining forest management infrastructure \nin central and eastern Oregon while preserving our old growth and \nwatersheds.\n  Over the long term--in 3 years from its passage to be precise--this \nlegislation will also provide the long-term certainty required to \nrestore each of the six Eastside national forests, protect our most \nsensitive environmental assets, and restore countless jobs to rural \ncommunities.\n  I want to make clear that the road ahead is likely to see some \nchallenges. Our coalition will be tested. But I have great faith that \nthe decent people who helped to put this bill together will honor the \ncomponents of this agreement and will fight to preserve its many \nelements as we move through the process.\n  I also want to point out that none of our efforts will succeed unless \nOregon Federal forests are also adequately funded to properly manage \nand restore these valuable Federal assets.\n  Together, we have entered a partnership that goes beyond the four \ncorners of this legislation. Together, as a team, we will fight for the \nfunding to put our people back to work and restore the health of our \nforests.\n  Together, we have demonstrated something that I think my colleagues \nhere in the Senate will appreciate: working together on a difficult \nissue is not only possible, it yields far greater results than working \napart.\n  Later today, and tomorrow, I will be sitting down with key members of \nthe Obama administration and the timber industry so that the \nadministration can better understand the peril and opportunity in \nOregon's Eastside forests. This is a united front that has not been \nwitnessed by a White House since the onset of the timber wars.\n  It is my hope we will learn to work together, we will develop real \ntrust, and that we will use these new experiences to tackle the \ndifficult issues that await us on the west side of the Cascades.\n  I also want to single out a few individuals who have endured \nthousands, of hours of difficult work and negotiations to reach this \npoint: John Shelk, president of Ochoco Lumber; Andy Kerr; the American \nForest Resource Council, represented by Heath Heikkila and Tom Partin, \nwho spearheaded negotiations.\n  I also want to recognize others that joined me earlier today to \nrollout this legislation Tim Lillebo with Oregon Wild; Tom Insko with \nBoise Cascade;\n\n[[Page S13386]]\n\nMary Scurlock, with Pacific Rivers Council; Randi Spivak, with the \nNational Center for Conservation Science and Policy; Ben Bendick with \nthe Nature Conservancy; and Bob Irvin with Defenders of Wildlife.\n  I also want to recognize back in the State, their colleagues that \ncould not join me earlier today; Rick Brown with Defenders of Wildlife, \nJoseph Vaile of Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center, Steve Pedry with \nOregon Wild, and Michael Powelson with the Nature Conservancy, as well \nas the other members and mill owners of AFRC.\n  I want to thank my staff, Michele Miranda, Mary Gautreaux, and Josh \nKardon, who gave their nights and weekends to get us to this point.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation today, and I am going to \nkeep working with all the folks in my State who are willing to talk in \ngood faith about restoring our eastside forests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2899. A bill to amend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for \nthe development of solar energy; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Renewable \nEnergy Incentive Act of 2009, which is cosponsored by Senator Jeff \nMerkley.\n  This act would extend, expand, and improve existing tax incentives \nand grant programs for renewable energy, especially for solar energy.\n  Provisions of this act are widely supported by public power \nutilities, environmental groups, renewable energy companies, renewable \nenergy industry associations, and labor unions.\n  These include, for example: the American Public Power Association; \nthe Solar Energy Industries Association; the Los Angeles Department of \nWater and Power; the Northern California Power Agency; the Southern \nCalifornia Public Power Agency; the Large Public Power Council, LPPC; \nsolar companies including Brightsource, Solyndra, Tessera Solar, and \nStirling Energy Systems and many others.\n  First, the bill would allow renewable energy companies to claim \ngrants from the Treasury department, in lieu of renewable energy tax \ncredits, through 2012 instead of 2010.\n  Second, it would permit public power utilities to claim these same \nTreasury Grants.\n  Third, it expands the solar investment tax credit to include \nmanufacturing equipment and solar water heaters for commercial and \ncommunity pools.\n  Finally, it establishes a new tax credit for solar companies who \nconsolidate and develop disturbed private land instead of developing \nour more pristine public lands.\n  The most significant provision in this bill would extend the Treasury \nGrants Program established in the stimulus by two years, allowing \nrenewable energy developers to continue claiming these grants.\n  Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nestablished ``payments in lieu of tax credits for specified energy \nproperty'' in order to support renewable energy development.\n  The program allows renewable energy developers to take grants, or \npayments, from the Treasury department instead of claiming tax credits \nin order to help build projects that require a great deal of capital \nupfront.\n  The provision has reduced the impact of the financial crisis on \nrenewable energy development.\n  Before the grants program was established, most renewable energy \ndevelopers had to partner with profitable banks, or ``tax equity \npartners,'' in order to take advantage of renewable energy tax \nincentives.\n  These big financial institutions would apply tax credits against \ntheir large profits, taking a cut for themselves along the way.\n  But in 2008, when financial sector profits sank, the $8 billion ``tax \nequity'' market largely evaporated.\n  Renewable energy development ground to a halt because developers \ncould not find tax equity partners.\n  Major players in the space, such as AIG and Lehman Brothers, \ndisappeared. The banks that still had profits began demanding a much \nhigher cut.\n  That's when Congress stepped in.\n  The stimulus created the Treasury Grants, which allow developers to \nclaim their tax benefits directly, instead of partnering with \nprofitable banks.\n  The U.S. wind industry installed 1,649 megawatts of new capacity in \nthe third quarter of this year alone, a boost from the previous two \nquarters and in excess of 2008 levels. Experts credit the Treasury \ngrants program.\n  Solar is also getting back on track. For instance, SunEdison used a \nTreasury grant in lieu of tax credits to accelerate construction of an \n18 megawatt photovoltaic array--one of the largest in the U.S.\n  The firm's CEO told the press: ``That could not have been done \nwithout this program.''\n  The Treasury program is also allowing renewable energy developers to \nattract significantly more debt backing for projects than would \notherwise be possible, according to recent statements by the managing \ndirector of energy investments at J.P. Morgan Capital.\n  But the grants program is set to expire in 2010, far before most \nutility scale solar projects will begin construction or financial \nanalysts predict tax equity markets will recover.\n  If the grant program is not extended, bank profits will again become \nthe limiting factor on renewable energy development in the U.S., and \nthat makes no sense.\n  That is why I propose to extend the program two years.\n  This legislation would also level the playing field between public \npower and for-profit companies by allowing public power utilities to \nreceive Treasury Grants for renewable energy projects.\n  Public power utilities serve 45 million American consumers, but they \nare currently prohibited from receiving grants for their renewable \nenergy development.\n  The basis for this prohibition is that public power utilities are tax \nexempt, non-profit corporations owned by local governments, who \ntherefore have not been able to claim tax credits directly on their \nincome tax returns.\n  But excluding public power from the grants program does not make \nsense.\n  Congress created the Treasury grants program specifically to assist \nfirms that lacked the ability to claim the full benefits of renewable \nenergy tax incentives.\n  If we are going to allow for-profit companies to claim these direct \ngrants, why would we exclude our non-profit public power utilities?\n  So leveling the playing field for public power is fair.\n  This provision is also necessary to protect our local community \nutility companies who want to deploy renewable energy.\n  The federal grants make building renewable energy projects cost \neffective for rate payers.\n  Because public power utilities lack access to these grants, they are \nnow frequently establishing complex financial arrangements with private \ndevelopers in order to build renewable energy projects that qualify for \nfederal help.\n  This is in direct conflict with public power's historic, proven \nbusiness model as a vertically integrated, non-profit.\n  It requires our cities and towns to negotiate unnecessarily complex \ndeals with Wall Street.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  Turlock Irrigation District, TID, a public power utility in my state, \ndecided to build a 137 megawatt wind farm in 2007.\n  They wanted to build and own.\n  But to make it cost effective, Turlock signed a contract to buy the \npower, but a tax equity partner would ``own'' the project and receive \nthe benefit of the federal production tax credit.\n  The contract was extremely complex and costly, requiring the \nparticipation of an investment bank to find a tax equity partner, an \nequity group to be the tax equity partner, legal counsel for the equity \ngroup, experts to provide risk advice and engineering advice to the \nequity group; bond counsel to provide renewable asset specialists; an \noperator to run the plant for the equity group; and an asset manager, \nto advise the equity group on the performance of the operator.\n  After 2 years and millions of dollars spent trying to finalize this \ndeal,\n\n[[Page S13387]]\n\nTurlock learned that the supposedly profitable equity partner, American \nInternational Group, AIG, wasn't profitable at all.\n  AIG backed out and the entire deal collapsed.\n  After much analysis, Turlock Irrigation District decided to own and \noperate the wind farm, giving up on receiving any Federal support.\n  Larry Weis, the General Manager, explained in a letter to me:\n\n       The bottom line is that TID made a business decision to \n     forego working with a private developer to develop a project, \n     because the complexity of the deal and the dollars spent to \n     arrange it meant that much of the value of the tax credit \n     would go to the equity partners and not pass through to our \n     consumers. Given the facts and the absence of a comparable \n     incentive for consumer-owned utilities, TID made the best \n     choice it could under the circumstances, even though it means \n     our customers will pay more.\n\n  This legislation is necessary to prevent other public power utilities \nfrom being forced to make this difficult, unnecessary choice.\n  Public power utilities deserve access to renewable energy incentives \ncomparable to those awarded to the private sector, and this legislation \nwill assure that happens.\n  This legislation also expands the solar investment tax credit to \ninclude manufacturing equipment and solar water heaters for commercial \nand community pools.\n  The bill would allow equipment that makes solar panels to qualify for \nthe 30 percent solar investment tax credit.\n  Solar panel manufacturing is moving offshore, to Germany and Asia, \nwhere support is considerable.\n  This financial incentive could jumpstart solar manufacturing in this \ncountry, and could lead to thousands of new jobs, such as those being \ncreated at Solyndra's new factory in Fremont, CA. Or those proposed by \nApplied Materials at their proposed facility near Los Angeles.\n  The bill would allow commercial pool solar hot water heaters to \nqualify for the solar tax credit.\n  Approximately 189,000 commercial pools nationwide--at hotels/motels, \nhealth clubs, and schools--use fossil fuel or electricity to heat an \nestimated 27 billion gallons of water.\n  If the heating systems were replaced with solar hot water systems, \nthere would be 1.23 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions \navoided annually.\n  That is the equivalent of taking 237,000 cars off the road.\n  In California, which has 26 percent of all commercial pools in the \nU.S., this provision could significantly reduce pollution.\n  Finally, the legislation would establish a new tax credit for the \npurchase, consolidation, and use of multiple, 100 acre or less blocks \nof high solarity, disturbed private lands for solar development.\n  Solar developers have focused development proposals on pristine \npublic land because it is very difficult, costly, and time intensive to \nconsolidate large blocks of disturbed private land from many different \nowners.\n  This tax credit will financially reward those firms that are willing \nto go through the trouble of land consolidation, thereby making the \nincreased burden of private lands development more appealing.\n  Over the last few years, the renewable energy industry has grown \ndramatically.\n  Last year the U.S. added more new capacity to produce renewable \nelectricity than it did to produce electricity from natural gas.\n  A great deal of this growth can be attributed to our renewable energy \ntax policies.\n  This legislation, I believe, would continue this growth into the \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2901. A bill to improve the acquisition workforce through the \nestablishment of an acquisition workforce fellows program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with Senators McCaskill and \nBennett, I rise to introduce two bills that would lay a strong \nfoundation to improve the Federal acquisition system.\n  The first bill, the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2009, \nwould create a federal acquisition management fellows program to \ndevelop a new generation of acquisition leaders with government-wide \nperspective, skills, and experience.\n  The second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of \n2009, would institute much-needed organizational clarity to enable the \nFederal Acquisition Institute, FAI, to fulfill its mission of \nfacilitating career development and strategic human capital management \nfor the federal acquisition workforce.\n  The federal acquisition system is under tremendous stress. Between \nfiscal years 2000 and 2008, acquisition spending by the Federal \nGovernment expanded by 163 percent, from $205 billion to $539 billion. \nThe rising costs of military operations, natural disasters, homeland \nsecurity precautions, and other vital programs will drive those \nexpenditures to even higher levels in the years ahead.\n  This prodigious level of purchasing creates abundant opportunities \nfor fraud, waste, and abuse. We have seen far too many outrageous \nfailures in government contracting, such as unusable trailers for \nhurricane victims, shoddy construction of schools and clinics in \nAfghanistan, or the installation of showers in Iraq for our troops that \npose electric-shock hazards. These and other failures demand strong \nsteps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition \noutcomes.\n  As a long-time advocate for stronger competition, accountability, and \ntransparency in government contracting, I recognize and appreciate the \nsteps the administration has taken recently to improve Federal \ncontracting. Many of these initiatives originated from legislation I \nco-authored with Senator Lieberman during the last Congress.\n  But no matter how many laws we pass or OMB guidance documents are \nissued, the effectiveness of our Federal acquisition system depends on \na vital human component--the acquisition workforce.\n\n  While contract spending has risen dramatically, the number of \nacquisition professionals who help plan, award, and oversee these \ncontracts has been stagnant. With roughly half of the current \nacquisition workforce eligible to retire over the next decade, the \ndifficulties of strengthening that workforce will become increasingly \nacute. A well-trained and well-resourced acquisition workforce is \ncritical to keeping pace with increased Federal spending and much more \ncomplex procurements of services and goods.\n  The two pieces of legislation I am introducing today would help to \naddress these important long-term problems that we must solve to make \nour acquisition system healthy again.\n  First, the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2009 would create \na centrally-managed Government-wide Acquisition Management Fellows \nProgram that combines both a Master's degree-level academic curriculum \nand on-the-job training in multiple federal agencies. By partnering \nwith leading universities that have specialized government acquisition \nprograms, the government can attract top-caliber students who are \ninterested in pursuing both academic advancement and public service.\n  Compared to the several existing agency-specific intern programs, \nthis government-wide program would provide a unique and much-needed \nskill set that we currently do not have in sufficient number, that is, \nacquisition professionals with multi-agency and multi-disciplinary \ntraining who can understand and manage government-wide acquisition \nneeds and perspectives.\n  Considering that interagency acquisition now accounts for \napproximately 40 percent of the entire contract spending and that GAO \nhas designated the management of interagency contracting a high-risk \narea since 2005, it is without question that we need to develop future \nacquisition leaders who can understand government-wide needs and \nperspectives.\n  Specifically, the program would include the following: one academic \nyear of full-time, on-campus training followed by 2 years of on-the-job \nand part-time training toward a Masters or equivalent graduate degree \nin related fields; and a curriculum that would include rotational \nassignments at three or more executive agencies covering, among other \nissues, acquisition planning, cost-estimating, formation and\n\n[[Page S13388]]\n\npost-award administration of ``high risk'' contract types, and \ninteragency contracts.\n  Upon graduation, participants will have completed all required non-\nagency-specific training courses necessary for a basic contracting \nofficer warrant.\n  In addition, participants would be required to enter into a service \ncommitment appropriate in length to ensure the Federal Government \nreceives a proper return on its investment. The service commitment \nwould be no less than one year for each year in the program, and would \nrequire reimbursement of funds for those who do not successfully \ncomplete the program or do not fulfill the minimum service \nrequirements.\n\n  It is also important to note that this program would be less \nexpensive than its current alternative. Typically, existing agency \ncareer intern programs like those run by DHS or GSA hire interns at GS-\n5, -7, or -9 level, which pays between $33,000 and $66,000, for \nWashington, DC area. These interns also receive benefits and free \ntraining during this internship period.\n  The proposed program would not pay salaries during the training, but \nunlike the other programs, would award a graduate degree. Based on \nmarket research, this alternative money-saving arrangement would be \nable to attract top-notch candidates with both public and academic \ninterests.\n  Second, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of 2009 \nwould strengthen the Federal Acquisition Institute, FAI, whose key \nresponsibilities are to promote career development and strategic human \ncapital management for the entire civilian acquisition workforce.\n  In part due to the lack of organizational clarity and the \ndisproportionate funding compared to its counterpart in the Department \nof Defense, the FAI has remained largely underutilized.\n  The proposed legislation would establish a clear line of \nresponsibility and accountability for the Institute by requiring that \nthe Federal Acquisition Institute, through its Board of Directors, \ndirectly reports to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy; the \ndirector of FAI be appointed by the OFPP Administrator and report \ndirectly to the Associate Administrator for Acquisition Workforce at \nOFPP.\n  All existing civilian agency training programs fall under the purview \nof FAI. This would ensure consistent training standards necessary to \ndevelop uniform core competencies; and the OFPP Administrator would be \nrequired to report annually to Congressional committees of jurisdiction \nprojected budget needs and expense plans of FAI to fulfill its \nstatutory mandate.\n  With respect to its core government-wide functions, FAI would be \nrequired to provide and keep current government-wide training standards \nand certification requirements including--ensuring effective agency \nimplementation of government-wide training and certification standards; \nanalyzing the curriculum to ascertain if all certification competencies \nare covered or if adjustments are necessary; developing career path \ninformation for certified professionals to encourage retention in \ngovernment positions; and coordinating with the Office of Personnel \nManagement for human capital efforts.\n  The administration has identified acquisition workforce development \nas a pillar for improving acquisition practices and contract \nperformance. While I fully agree with this goal, we need specific and \nconcrete action to solve this problem. It is also important to remember \nthat it took the better part of two decades for the acquisition \nworkforce to reach its current state and that it will likely take a \nsimilar amount of time to rebuild.\n  My legislation would prompt the sustained effort necessary to rebuild \nthe acquisition workforce. While this will take time and investment, I \nam confident this is a wise investment that will yield substantial \nreturns. Just think about it, if our better-trained acquisition \nprofessionals can prevent one failed procurement, it can save the \ntaxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars. If they can avoid overpaying \none percent of our contract spending, it will save the taxpayer more \nthan 5 billion each year. The numbers speak for themselves.\n  The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act and the Federal Acquisition \nInstitute Improvement Act are critically needed and both enjoy \nbipartisan support. I encourage my colleagues to support them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mr. Schumer);\n  S. 2904. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require \nemergency contraception to be available at all military health care \ntreatment facilities; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the Compassionate Care for Servicewomen \nAct, which I am introducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator \nSnowe, is a straightforward but vital piece of legislation. It would \nensure that servicewomen in our military have reliable and timely \naccess to emergency contraception when they need it.\n  Emergency contraception, or Plan B as it is more commonly known under \nits brand name, is Food and Drug Administration-approved medication \nthat prevents pregnancy. It is safe and, if taken shortly after \npregnancy, highly effective. Since 2006, the FDA has approved it for \nover-the-counter sale. Currently, women 17 years old and older may \npurchase emergency contraception over the counter, while those younger \nrequire a prescription.\n  Emergency contraception is widely available at pharmacies throughout \nthe U.S.\n  The problem this legislation is meant to address is that there's no \nguarantee that emergency contraception be available to our servicewomen \nin the military. The military health care system includes what is \ncalled a basic core formulary, which lists the medications that must be \nstocked at all Department of Defense medical facilities, including \nthose overseas. Emergency contraception is not currently on the basic \ncore formulary.\n  Consequently, emergency contraception is not systematically and \nreliably available at all medical military facilities. It is allowed to \nbe stocked at such facilities, so it is available in some places. In \nthat regard, the bill that Senator Snowe and I are introducing today is \nnot a dramatic departure from existing practice.\n  But there is no guarantee that a servicewoman will have access to it. \nImmediate accessibility is especially important in the case of \nemergency contraception because it is only effective if taken within a \nshort window of time. Once a pregnancy is established, it doesn't work.\n  There is no good reason why servicewomen shouldn't have the same \naccess to emergency contraception that civilians here in the U.S. have.\n  That is just what this legislation would do. It would guarantee that \nall military health care treatment facilities stock emergency \ncontraception by placing that medication on the basic core formulary.\n  All servicewomen should be able to have access to emergency \ncontraception in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy. The fact that \nmore than 2,900 sexual assaults were reported last year in the military \nonly heightens the need to ensure emergency contraception is always \navailable.\n  This is legislation that has been endorsed by a wide range of \norganizations both in Minnesota and nationally.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense \nlegislation. I thank Senator Snowe for joining me in introducing this \nbill, and I thank all my colleagues who have signed on as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2904\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nrepeal the current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent \nfor all taxpayers. In 1986, the Congress reduced the allowable tax \ndeduction for business meals and entertainment from 100 percent to 80 \npercent. In 1993, the Congress again reduced the deduction to 50 \npercent. Restoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood \nof small and independent businesses as well as the food service, \ntravel, tourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United \nStates. These industries are being economically harmed as a result of \nthe 50 percent tax deduction.\n  At a time when the nation is getting back on a stronger economic \nfooting, the legislation is particularly critical especially for the \nsmall businesses and self-employed individuals that depend so heavily \non the business meal to conduct business. Small companies often use \nrestaurants as ``conference space'' to conduct meetings or close deals. \nMeals are their best, and sometimes only, marketing tool. Certainly, an \nincrease in the meal and entertainment deduction would have a \nsignificant impact on a small businesses bottom line. In addition, the \neffects on the overall economy would be significant.\n  Accompanying my statement is the National Restaurant Association's, \nNRA, State-by-State chart reflecting the estimated economic impact of \nincreasing the business meal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 \npercent. The NRA estimates that an increase to 80 percent would \nincrease business meal sales by $6 billion and create an $18 billion \nincrease to the overall economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na State-by-State chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF REDUCTION IN BUSINESS MEALS AND \n                   ENTERTAINMENT TAX DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274(n)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to only 50 percent of meal and \n     entertainment expenses allowed as deduction) is amended by \n     striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``80 percent''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 274(n) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking paragraph (3).\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The heading for section 274(n) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``Only 50 Percent'' and inserting ``Portion''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n

           ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S.J. Res. 23. A joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by \nthe Federal Election Commission with respect to travel on private \naircraft by Federal candidates; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the very first bill debated on the floor \nof the Senate after the 2006 elections was S. 1, the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act of 2007, HLOGA. About 9 months later, President \nBush signed that bill into law as Public Law Number 110-81. It was the \nmost sweeping ethics reform legislation since Watergate, and it passed \nboth houses of Congress by a wide margin--the final votes were 411-8 in \nthe House and 83-14 in the Senate.\n  The new law contained, among many other provisions, significant \nreforms to the lobbying disclosure laws, a tough new prohibition on \ngifts from lobbyists, improvements to the revolving door rules, and new \nrestrictions on privately funded fact-finding trips. It also contained \nnew rules on personal, official, and campaign travel on non-commercial \naircraft, often known as ``corporate jets.'' Prior to HLOGA, members \nwho flew on corporate jets, often accompanied by corporate lobbyists, \nwere required to reimburse the owner of the aircraft only the amount \nthat they would have paid to fly first class between the origin and \ndestination of the flight. HLOGA provided that Senators and \npresidential candidates would have to reimburse such travel at the \ncharter rate. House members were prohibited from flying on non-\ncommercial aircraft altogether.\n  Because Senators travel in different capacities, HLOGA addressed the \nissue in separate sections. Section 544(c) of the bill amended the \nSenate Rules XXXV and XXXVIII to address official and personal travel \nby Senators. The House had already amended its rules at the very \nbeginning of the year. Section 601 dealt with campaign travel for both \nHouse and Senate candidates by amending the Federal Election Campaign \nAct, ``FECA''.\n  Both the House and the Senate have been living under these new rules \nfor over two years. No House member has flown on a corporate jet, as \nfar as we know. Senators, whether they were traveling in personal, \nofficial, or campaign capacity, and regardless of who was paying for \nthe trip, have flown on them only if they were prepared to pay the \ncharter rate for these trips. Presidential candidates in the last \ncampaign abided by the new rules as well.\n  Because HLOGA made amendments to the FECA on this issue, the FEC \nstarted a rulemaking shortly after its enactment to implement the new \nprovision. But at the end of 2007, just as the agency was poised to put \nnew regulations in place, the terms of several recess-appointed \nCommissioners expired. A stalemate ensued that left the agency without \na quorum to do business until the summer of 2008. Once a full slate of \nCommissioners was in place, the agency deadlocked on issuing final \nregulations. The three new Republican commissioners refused to sign off \non the rules that the Commission had been prepared to adopt in December \n2007. The deadlock was resolved only a few weeks ago, when a Democratic \nCommissioner reluctantly agreed to go along with modifications that the \nRepublicans proposed. See Statement of Chairman Steven T. Walther, \nCampaign Travel Regulations, Nov. 19, 2009. The new rule was published \nin the Federal Register on December 7, 2009. Federal Election \nCommission, Notice 2009-27, Campaign Travel, 74 Fed. Reg. 63951, Dec. \n7, 2009.\n  I will put this as simply as I can. The new FEC rule relating to \ntravel on non-commercial aircraft is an outrage. Rather than respecting \nthe intent of Congress in HLOGA to address all travel on corporate jets \nby members of Congress and presidential candidates, the FEC has carved \na loophole in the statute for travel by candidates on behalf of someone \nother than their own campaigns. No one in the House or the Senate \ncontemplated this exception when the bill was passed. No one discussed \nit. No one considered it. The FEC just made it up. Now we in Congress \nhave no choice but to take action to correct it if the FEC refuses to \ndo so.\n  We cannot let a lawless agency undermine our effort to police \nourselves, to end a practice that exposed Congress to public criticism \nand even ridicule. Some Senators and House members may have agreed to \nkick the corporate jet habit reluctantly, but they have learned to live \nwith it. There is no need for the loophole the FEC has opened. It is \ncontrary to the statutory language and to the legislative history. It \nmust be closed.\n  So today, I will introduce, along with my colleagues from Arizona, \nConnecticut, and New York, Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Schumer, all \nof whom played a key role in the enactment of HLOGA, a resolution of \ndisapproval under the Congressional Review Act. This resolution, if \npassed by the House and signed by the President, will send the FEC back \nto the drawing board. After a rebuke of this kind, one can only hope \nthat the Commission will craft a regulation that does not so completely \nignore the letter and spirit of the provision we passed in HLOGA.\n  Let me take a minute to explain what the FEC has done and what it \nmust do to correct its error. The new regulation takes the position \nthat the key fact in determining what rate must be paid for a corporate \njet flight is not who is flying, but who is paying for the flight. The \nexplanation and justification, ``E'', adopted by the commission \nstates:\n\n       [W]hen a presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate \n     candidate, or a representative of the candidate, is traveling \n     on behalf of another\n\n[[Page S13391]]\n\n     political committee (such as a political party committee or \n     Senate leadership PAC, rather than on behalf of the \n     candidate's own authorized committee, the reimbursement for \n     that travel is the responsibility of the political committee \n     on whose behalf the travel occurs. If the political committee \n     is other than an authorized committee or House candidate's \n     leadership PAC, then the appropriate reimbursement rate for \n     that political committee is set forth in new 11 CFR \n     100.93(c)(3), discussed below. In such cases, the \n     presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate candidate or \n     candidate's representative, is treated the same as any other \n     person traveling on behalf of the political committee.\n\n  74 Fed. Reg. at 63955. That rate for such a trip, under an FEC \nregulation promulgated in 2003, is the first class rate unless \nregularly scheduled commercial air service is not available between the \norigin and the destination of the flight. The E also reiterates that \nleadership PACs of Senators and Presidential candidates can continue to \npay the first class rate, even for the candidates themselves.\n  In addition, although House leadership PACs are prohibited from \ntaking advantage of this loophole, the E makes clear that House \ncandidates can do so if they are traveling on behalf of a political \nparty committee or a Senate or presidential candidate, even though they \nare otherwise completely prohibited from traveling on a corporate jet. \nThe loophole seems to apply to House members even if they are traveling \non behalf of a corporate PAC.\n  In a recent article in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, FEC \nCommissioner Matthew Peterson attempted to explain the FEC's decision. \nHe argues that the loophole is compelled by the statutory language, \nwhich is structured to prohibit an expenditure for any flight by a \nSenate candidate or the candidate's authorized committee unless the \ncharter rate is paid for that flight. This interpretation ignores \nspecific language in section 601 that requires payment of the charter \nrate by ``the candidate, the authorized committee, or other political \ncommittee'' and the lack of any language in the statute or the \nlegislative history suggesting that Congress meant to leave open a way \nfor Senators to travel on corporate jets without paying the charter \nrate.\n  Moreover, it ignores the clear intent of the two provisions of HLOGA \nconcerning travel on private aircraft--to prohibit all corporate jet \nflights by Senators unless the charter rate is paid. There are \nliterally more than a dozen statements by supporters of the bill that \nmake this intent clear. The FEC chose to ignore the clear purpose of \nthe bill in favor of a strained interpretation of the statutory \nlanguage that flies in the face of that purpose. That is unacceptable. \nThe FEC's duty is to implement the statute as Congress intended it. Its \njob is to give guidance to candidates and others who want to follow the \nlaw, not to provide a roadmap for evading it.\n  For the convenience of my colleagues, my staff has collected \nstatements from the floor debate on HLOGA that show beyond any doubt \nthat the corporate jet provisions were intended to apply to all travel \non corporate jets by Senators without regard to who is reimbursing the \njet owner. One Senator said the following:\n\n       I understand that for many Members, these jets are an issue \n     of convenience. They allow us to get home to our \n     constituents, to our families, and to the events that are \n     often necessary for our jobs. But in November, the American \n     people told us very clearly they are tired of the influence \n     special interest wields over the legislative process. The \n     vast majority of Americans can't afford to buy cheap rides on \n     corporate jets. They don't get to sit with us on 3-hour \n     flights and talk about the heating bills they can't pay, or \n     the health care costs that keep rising, or the taxes they \n     can't afford, or their concerns about college tuition. They \n     can't buy our attention, and they shouldn't have to. And the \n     corporation lobbyists shouldn't be able to either. That is \n     why we need to end this corporate jet perk if we are to pass \n     real, meaningful ethics reform.\n\n  Cong. Rec. at S263, Jan. 9, 2007. The speaker of those words, which \nmake plain that the intent of the provision was to completely eliminate \nsubsidized travel on corporate jets, was then-Senator Barack Obama. \nThis strongly suggests that the President of the United States will \nsign the resolution of disapproval once we pass it.\n  Notwithstanding my strong feelings about the part of the FEC rule I \nhave just discussed, significant portions of the rule are \nunexceptional. The intent of this resolution of disapproval under the \nCongressional Review Act is solely to reverse the FEC's decision to \nopen a loophole in the requirements for corporate jet travel by members \nof Congress and their staffs. So we do not intend to disable the FEC \nfrom putting out a new regulation, only from including a gaping \nloophole in it.\n  I note this because the Congressional Review Act only allows Congress \nto disapprove, and therefore make ineffective, an entire regulation. It \nstates that the agency may not promulgate a rule that is \n``substantially the same'' as the old one without new congressional \nauthorization. I want to be clear that the loophole created by the \nFEC's recent rule is so significant that a rule that is otherwise \nidentical to the entire campaign travel regulation, but that does not \ncontain the loophole that this resolution is designed to disapprove, \nshould not be considered to be ``substantially the same'' as the \nprevious rule, even though other portions of that rule may be re-\npromulgated unchanged.\n  The Congressional Review Act has only once been successfully used to \noverturn an agency regulation. Thus, there is little experience to fall \nback on to determine the consequences for future agency action of a \nsuccessful disapproval resolution. Morton Rosenberg, a long time \nanalyst at the Congressional Research Service, includes the following \nuseful analysis in his 2008 assessment of the CRA:\n\n       A review of the CRA's statutory scheme and structure, the \n     contemporaneous congressional explanation of the legislative \n     intent with respect to the provisions in question, the \n     lessons learned from the experience of the March 2001 \n     disapproval of the OSHA ergonomics rule, and the application \n     of pertinent case law and statutory construction principles \n     suggests that (1) It is doubtful that Congress intended that \n     all disapproved rules would require statutory reauthorization \n     before further agency action could take place. For example, \n     it appears that Congress anticipated further rulemaking, \n     without new authorization, where the statute in question \n     established a deadline for promulgating implementing rules in \n     a particular area. In such instances, the CRA extends the \n     deadline for promulgation for one year from the date of \n     disapproval. (2) A close reading of the statute, together \n     with its contemporaneous congressional explication, arguably \n     provides workable standards for agencies to reform \n     disapproved regulations that are likely to be taken into \n     account by reviewing courts. Those standards would require a \n     reviewing court to assess both the nature of the rulemaking \n     authority vested in the agency that promulgated the \n     disapproved rule and the specificity with which the Congress \n     identified the objectionable portions of a rule during the \n     floor debates on disapproval. An important factor in a \n     judicial assessment may be the CRA's recognition of the \n     continued efficacy of statutory deadlines for promulgating \n     specified rules by extending such deadlines for one year \n     after disapproval.\n\n  Congressional Research Service, Congressional Review of Agency \nRulemaking: An Update and Assessment of The Congressional Review Act \nafter a Decade, RL30116, May 8, 2008, at 30. Rosenberg notes that the \nfact that Congress specifically provided in the CRA for a one year \nextension of any statutory deadline for a rule that has been overturned \nby the CRA shows that Congress did not intend to disable an agency from \nissuing regulations on the same topic. Indeed, a Joint Explanatory \nStatement by the principal sponsors of the CRA in the House and Senate \nstates the following:\n\n       The authors intend the debate on any resolution of \n     disapproval to focus on the law that authorized the rule and \n     make the congressional intent clear regarding the agency's \n     options or lack thereof after enactment of a joint resolution \n     of disapproval. It will be the agency's responsibility in the \n     first instance when promulgating the rule to determine the \n     range of discretion afforded under the original law and \n     whether the law authorizes the agency to issue a \n     substantially different rule. Then, the agency must give \n     effect to the resolution of disapproval.\n\n  Joint Explanatory Statement of House and Senate Sponsors, 142 Cong. \nRec. E 571, at E 577, daily ed. April 19, 1996; 142 Cong. Rec. S 3683, \nat S 3686 daily ed. April 18, 1996. It is the intent of this resolution \nof disapproval to invalidate the loophole that the FEC created in the \nE, but not to disable the FEC from issuing a new rule that properly \nimplements Congress's intent in passing HLOGA.\n  My displeasure with the actions of the FEC over the past 7 years is \nwell known. The agency has repeatedly failed to properly implement \nprovisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, BCRA, leading to its \nregulations being overturned by the courts numerous times. Indeed, \nbecause of the\n\n[[Page S13392]]\n\nagency's dismal record in the courts, some important BCRA regulations \nare still not in place 7\\1/2\\ years after BCRA's enactment. But the \nFEC's recent action on corporate jets may be its worst yet. Congress \npassed HLOGA with wide bipartisan support and clear intent. Because of \nthe FEC's failure to issue rules promptly, members of Congress have \nbeen living under the terms of the statute alone with no \nmisunderstanding of what it means. And yet, over two years after its \nenactment, the FEC has now created an unnecessary and wholly \nunjustified loophole in the statute. Congress must act to correct this \negregious mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a collection of \nquotations concerning corporate jet provisions of HLOGA be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Selected Statements Concerning Travel on Corporate Jets From 2007 \n                            Debate on HLOGA\n\n     Sen. Reid, 1/4/2007\n       Another critical aspect requiring reform is the ability of \n     a Member to travel on a corporate jet and only pay the rate \n     of a first class plane ticket. This bill requires Senators \n     and their employees who use corporate or charter aircraft to \n     pay the fair market value for that travel. While I appreciate \n     that such a change is not popular with some of my colleagues, \n     the time has come to fundamentally change the way we do \n     things in this town. Much of the public views our ability to \n     travel on corporate jets, often accompanied by lobbyists, \n     while only reimbursing the first-class rate, as a huge \n     loophole in the current gift rules. And they are right--it \n     is. I have no doubt that the average American would love to \n     fly around the country on very comfortable corporate-owned \n     aircraft and only be charged the cost of a first-class \n     ticket. It is a pretty good deal we have got going here. We \n     need to face the fact that the time has come to end this \n     Congressional perk. [Cong. Rec. S186]\n     Sen. Obama, 1/9/2007\n       The second area in which we need to go further is corporate \n     jets. Myself and Senator Feingold introduced a comprehensive \n     ethics bill that, among other things, would close the \n     loopholes that allow for subsidized travel on corporate jets. \n     Today, I am very pleased to see the majority leader has \n     offered an amendment that would serve the same purpose. I \n     fully support him in his effort.\n       Let me point out that I fully understand the appeal of \n     corporate jets. Like many of my colleagues, I traveled a good \n     deal recently from Illinois to Washington, from Chicago to \n     downstate, from fundraisers to political events for \n     candidates all across the country. I realize finding a \n     commercial flight that gets you home in time to tuck in the \n     kids at the end of a long day can be extremely difficult. \n     This is simply an unfortunate reality that goes along with \n     our jobs.\n       Yet we have to realize these corporate jets don't simply \n     provide a welcome convenience for us; they provide undue \n     access for the lobbyists and corporations that offer them. \n     These companies don't just fly us around out of the goodness \n     of their hearts. Most of the time we have lobbyists riding \n     along with us so they can make their company's case for a \n     particular bill or a particular vote.\n       It would be one thing if Congressmen and Senators paid the \n     full rate for these flights, but we don't. We get a \n     discount--a big discount. Right now a flight on a corporate \n     jet usually costs us the equivalent of a first-class ticket \n     on a commercial airplane. But if we paid the real price, the \n     full charter rate would cost us thousands upon thousands of \n     dollars more.\n       In a recent USA Today story about use of corporate jets, it \n     was reported that over the course of 3 days in November 2005, \n     BellSouth's jet carried six Senators and their wives to \n     various Republican and Democratic fundraising events in \n     the Southeast. If they had paid the full charter rate, it \n     would have cost the Democratic and Republican campaign \n     committees more than $40,000. But because of the corporate \n     jet perk, it only cost a little more than $8,000.\n       There is going to be a lot of talk in the coming days about \n     how important it is to ban free meals and fancy gifts, and I \n     couldn't agree more, but if we are going to go ahead and call \n     a $50 lunch unethical, I can't see why we wouldn't do the \n     same for the $32,000 that BellSouth is offering in the form \n     of airplane discounts. That is why I applaud Senator Reid on \n     his amendment to require Members to pay the full charter rate \n     for the use of corporate jets.\n       As I said, I understand that for many Members, these jets \n     are an issue of convenience. They allow us to get home to our \n     constituents, to our families, and to the events that are \n     often necessary for our jobs. But in November, the American \n     people told us very clearly they are tired of the influence \n     special interest wields over the legislative process. The \n     vast majority of Americans can't afford to buy cheap rides on \n     corporate jets. They don't get to sit with us on 3-hour \n     flights and talk about the heating bills they can't pay, or \n     the health care costs that keep rising, or the taxes they \n     can't afford, or their concerns about college tuition. They \n     can't buy our attention, and they shouldn't have to. And the \n     corporation lobbyists shouldn't be able to either. That is \n     why we need to end this corporate jet perk if we are to pass \n     real, meaningful ethics reform. [Cong. Rec. S263-4]\n     Sen. Feingold, 1/9/2007\n       When I introduced my lobbying reform bill back in July \n     2005, it included a provision addressing the abuse of Members \n     flying on corporate jets. At that time, I have to say, it \n     seemed like a fantasy that we would actually pass such a \n     provision. I heard complaint after complaint about it, that \n     we shouldn't do it.\n       Slowly but surely, many people have come around to where \n     the public is: Corporate jet travel is a real abuse. Sure, it \n     is convenient, but it is based on a fiction--that the fair \n     market value of such a trip is just the cost of a first class \n     ticket. And when that fiction is applied to political travel, \n     it creates a loophole in the ban on corporate contributions \n     that we have had in this country for over a century. Any \n     legislation on corporate jets must include campaign trips as \n     well as official travel because one thing is for certain--the \n     lobbyist for the company that provides the jet is likely to \n     be on the flight, whether it is taking you to see a factory \n     back home or a fundraiser for your campaign.\n       Our bill does that. It covers all of the possible uses of \n     corporate jets, and amends all of the Senate rules needed to \n     put in place a strong reform, and the Federal election laws \n     as well. From now on, if you want to fly on a corporate jet, \n     you will have to pay the charter rate. And these flights \n     shouldn't be an opportunity for the lobbyist or CEO of the \n     company that owns the jet to have several hours alone with a \n     Senator. Our bill prohibits that as well. This is what the \n     American people have been calling for. There are no loopholes \n     or ambiguities here. Politicians flying on private planes for \n     cheap will be a thing of the past if we can get this \n     provision into the bill. Senator Reid's amendment includes \n     a tough corporate jet provision. I am pleased to support \n     that portion of the amendment. This is a big deal, and I \n     commend the majority leader for taking this step. [Cong. \n     Rec. S267]\n     Sen. Lieberman, 1/10/2007\n       I am also very pleased that the majority leader has \n     included in this amendment that I referred to an additional \n     amendment, a strong provision on the use of corporate jets. \n     This is a controversial, difficult matter. It is an issue \n     that Senators McCain, Feingold, Obama, and I wanted to pursue \n     last year when we took this up essentially in its predecessor \n     form, but we were unable to do so once cloture was reached on \n     the bill because the amendment was determined to be \n     nongermane.\n       Under current law this is the reality. When a Member of \n     Congress or a candidate for Federal office uses a private \n     plane instead of flying on a commercial airline, the ethics \n     rules, as well as the Federal Election Commission rules, \n     require a payment to the owner of the plane equivalent to a \n     first-class commercial ticket. The current rules undervalue \n     flights on noncommercial jets and provide, in effect, a way \n     for corporations and individuals to give benefits to Members \n     beyond the limits provided for in our campaign finance laws. \n     The Reid amendment would eliminate that loophole by requiring \n     that the reimbursement be based on the comparable charter \n     rate for a plane. [Cong. Rec. S320]\n     Sen. Sanders, 1/16/2007\n       Members of Congress do not need free lunches from \n     lobbyists. Members of Congress do not need free tickets to \n     ball games. And they do not need huge discounts for flights \n     on corporate jets. Congress does need transparency in \n     earmarks and holds, and we do need a new policy regarding the \n     revolving door by which a Member one year is writing a piece \n     of legislation and the next year finds himself or herself \n     working for the company that benefited from the legislation \n     he or she wrote. In other words, we need to pass the \n     strongest ethics reform bill possible. But in passing this \n     legislation, we need to understand this is not the end of our \n     work but, rather, it is just the beginning, and much more \n     needs to be done. [Cong. Rec. S553]\n     Sen. Reid, 1/16/2007\n       Let me say a word about corporate jets. The State of Nevada \n     is very large areawise. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno are \n     separated by about 450 miles. There is good travel between \n     those two cities. But to get around the rest of the State is \n     not easy. When you travel from Las Vegas to Reno, I again say \n     it is easy. But then let's say you want to go to Elko. By \n     Nevada standards, it is a pretty large city. Going on a \n     commercial airplane, it is very, very, very difficult, and to \n     go to Ely is next to impossible. These two cities, both \n     important in their own right, have required on a number of \n     occasions calling upon people you know who have an airplane \n     to take us up there.\n       Under the old rules, you could pay first-class travel. An \n     example of that is Senator Ensign and I, last August, had to \n     go to Ely. It was extremely important. We were working on a \n     piece of legislation that has since passed. We wanted to sit \n     down in person and talk to the people in Ely about what we \n     were doing.\n       For us to get there was very difficult. The time factor was \n     significant. To drive up and back is 2 days, 1 day up, 1 day \n     back. It was\n\n[[Page S13393]]\n\n     complicated by the fact that Senator Ensign had a \n     longstanding engagement in Reno. To go from Ely to Reno--it \n     is hard to get there. If you drive very fast, you can make it \n     in 6 hours. So I called a friend of mine, Mike Ensign, \n     Senator Ensign's father. This good man has done very well in \n     the business world. He is a man with limited education but a \n     great mind. He started out working in somewhat menial jobs in \n     the gaming industry. He worked his way up. He became a \n     dealer, a pit boss, a shift boss, and then Mike Ensign moved \n     into the corporate world and became an executive and then \n     ultimately started buying hotel properties himself and has \n     done very well. He is the principal officer and owner of \n     Mandalay Bay, a huge company. It is the second largest hotel-\n     casino operator in the country. I called him and I said: \n     Mike, with one of your airplanes, can you fly me and your son \n     to Ely?\n       He is a wonderful man, just the greatest guy. He said: \n     Sure, I will be happy to do that. And he did that. He is an \n     example of the type of people we have called upon for these \n     airplanes.\n       I tell this story. I have used these airplanes a lot \n     because I live in Nevada and because of other duties I have \n     here. The reason I tell the Mike Ensign story is because Mike \n     Ensign doesn't want anything from me. There isn't a thing in \n     the world I can give this man. He is famous, he is rich, he \n     has a wonderful family. I can't do anything to help Mike \n     Ensign. He did this because he is my friend.\n       Most every--I should not say most. For every airplane I fly \n     on, of course I don't have the relationship with them that I \n     have with Mike Ensign, but I want everyone who has allowed me \n     to use their airplanes to know I am not in any way \n     denigrating them. They have done this out of the goodness of \n     their heart. I have never had anyone say: I will give you an \n     airplane ride if you give me something, or, I have a piece of \n     legislation pending, will you help me with that? That has \n     never happened. I want all these people to know that I am \n     certainly not in any way disparaging these good people who \n     have allowed me and others to fly on their airplanes.\n       What I am saying, though, is that in this world in which we \n     live, because of all the corruption that has taken place in \n     the last few years here in America, that you not only have to \n     do away with what is wrong but what appears to be wrong. I am \n     confident I have never been influenced by anyone who provided \n     me with the courtesy of a private airplane, but I have come \n     to the realization that this practice presents a major \n     perception problem. It is a major perception problem because \n     the American people have the right to insist that we do what \n     seems right as well as what is right. Does it appear it is \n     OK? For us to fly around in these airplanes doesn't appear to \n     be the right thing, no matter how good-hearted these people \n     are, just like Mike Ensign. So because a perception isn't \n     right, this amendment is pending, and it means Senators \n     should pay the full fare when they fly on someone's \n     private airplane. [Cong. Rec. S548-9]\n     Sen. Levin, 1/25/2007\n       Strong travel restrictions are also an essential component \n     of this bill. The new rules will ensure that Members \n     traveling on corporate jets would have to reimburse at the \n     charter rate, not as is now the case merely at the level of a \n     first class commercial ticket. [Cong. Rec. S1185]\n     Sen. Reid, 6/26/2007\n       The American people responded at the polls last November \n     with a clear message that they wanted a new direction, and \n     we, the Democrats, responded by passing the most sweeping \n     ethics and lobbying reform in a generation. We did it with \n     the help of the minority. I do not say that lightly. But \n     let's see what is in this bill. Let's review it for a bit to \n     find out what this bill does.\n       It prohibits lobbyists and entities that hire lobbyists \n     from giving gifts to lawmakers and their staffs. It prevents \n     corporations and other entities that hire lobbyists from \n     paying for trips for Members or staffs. And it prohibits \n     lobbyists from participating in or paying for any such trips. \n     It requires Senators to pay fair market value prices for \n     charter flights, which put an end to the abuses of corporate \n     travel.\n       Many people in this Chamber flew in corporate jets and paid \n     first-class airfare. That did not corrupt any Members of \n     Congress, but it was corrupting. It didn't look right, and \n     therefore it is important it be stopped. And I hope it \n     stopped. We need legislation to make sure it is stopped. \n     [Cong. Rec. S8400]\n     Sen. Klobuchar, 7/31/2007\n       This ethics bill, as many outside groups have stated, is \n     the most sweeping ethics reform we have seen since Watergate. \n     It is about banning gifts and free meals. It is about not \n     allowing people to take advantage of corporate jets. It is \n     about bringing transparency to the earmark process. [Cong. \n     Rec. S10401]\n     Sen. Obama, 8/2/2007\n       In January, I came back with Senator Feingold, and we set a \n     high bar for reform. I am pleased to report that the bill \n     before us today comes very close to what we proposed. By \n     passing this bill, we will ban gifts and meals and end \n     subsidized travel on corporate jets; we will close the \n     revolving door between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street; and \n     we will make sure the American people can see all the pet \n     projects lawmakers are trying to pass before they are \n     actually voted on. [Cong. Rec. S10692]\n     Sen. Levin, 8/2/2007\n       Strong travel restrictions are also an essential component \n     of this bill. The new rules will ensure that Members \n     traveling on corporate jets would have to pay for them at the \n     charter rate, not at the current level of a first class \n     commercial ticket, which is but a fraction of the cost. \n     [Cong. Rec. S10703]\n     Sen. Feinstein, 8/2/2007\n       Section 544 includes a separate provision relating to \n     flights on private jets. This provision requires Senators to \n     pay full market value--defined as charter rates--for flights \n     on private jets, with an exception for jets owned by \n     immediate family members (or non-public corporations in which \n     the Senator or an immediate family member has an ownership \n     interest).\n       In general, the changes made by section 544 go into effect \n     60 days after enactment, or the date that the Select \n     Committee on Ethics issues the required guidelines under the \n     rule, whichever is later. Until the new rules take effect, \n     the existing rules for travel will remain in place. In light \n     of the transition to the new rule relating to reimbursement \n     for flights on private jets and the lack of experience in \n     many offices in determining ``charter rates,'' the Select \n     Committee on Ethics may treat reimbursement at current rates \n     as reimbursement at charter rates for a transition period not \n     to exceed 60 days.\n       Section 601 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to \n     require that candidates, other than those running for a seat \n     in the House of Representatives, pay the fair market value of \n     airfare when using non-commercial jets to travel. Fair market \n     value is to be determined by dividing the fair market value \n     of the charter fare of the aircraft, by the number of \n     candidates on the flight. This provision exempts aircraft \n     owned or leased by candidates or candidates' immediate family \n     members (or non-public corporations in which the Senator or \n     his or her immediate family member has an ownership \n     interest). The bill prohibits candidates for the House of \n     Representatives from any campaign use of privately-owned, \n     non-chartered jets.\n       Many candidates are not accustomed to determining charter \n     rates. The FEC may, during a transition period of no more \n     than 60 days, deem reimbursement at current rates to be \n     charter rates while committees determine how to calculate \n     charter rates.
