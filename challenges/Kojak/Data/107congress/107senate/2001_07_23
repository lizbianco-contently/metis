Mr. President, when we first came back and began this \nCongress in January, there was a lot of talk about bipartisanship at \nthat time due primarily to the fact that the Senate was equally divided \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, and we knew we better act in a \nbipartisan way or not a lot would get done.\n  Since that time, of course, the Democratic Party has taken the \nmajority, by virtue of the transfer from a Republican to an independent \nstatus, and we now have 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and one \nindependent in the Senate; therefore, the Senate is under the control \nof the Democratic Party as the majority party. But we have a Republican \nadministration and no less of a requirement to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  The distinguished President pro tempore chairs a committee which, by \nits very nature, requires bipartisanship. I think I was presiding in \nthe chair the day the distinguished President pro tempore and his \ncounterpart, the ranking member, the Senator from Alaska, talked about \nthe fact that without the kind of bipartisan cooperation in that \ncommittee that has characterized its work, it would be hard for the \nSenate to get its work done.\n  That is also true of some other things, some housekeeping, if you \nwill, that the Senate has to do as part of its constitutional \nresponsibilities and, frankly, are among the most important of its \nresponsibilities. That includes the advice and consent that we provide \nwith respect to nominees from the executive branch.\n\n  When a new President comes into power, there is also a certain \ntransition that takes place because the new President nominates his own \npeople for his executive branch department, his Cabinet officers and \nsubcabinet officers, and also, of course, judicial nominations.\n  In order for those departments to be fully staffed and up and \noperating, it is necessary for the Senate, as quickly as possible, to \nhold hearings on those\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nnominees, to act on them one way or the other, and then those that it \napproves--the vast majority--can join the President and begin work in \nthe executive branch of Government. Ordinarily, that is a somewhat \nlengthy process but not a particularly difficult process.\n  Most of the nominations are relatively routine. After they finish \ntheir FBI check, there is a hearing. There is almost never any \ncontroversy and therefore it is not difficult for the Senate to confirm \nthose nominees. In fact, for the benefit of a lot of folks who would \nnot be aware of the process, we do not take time in this Chamber to \ndebate each and every nominee and hold a rollcall vote on each and \nevery nominee. Instead, most of them are not controversial, and the \nleader will ask that a group of them be considered in a group, at the \nend of the day; and if no Senator objects to the nominations, they are \nall approved, and they are approved unanimously.\n  That is the way it is done for most of the nominees. There are well \nover 600--I don't know the exact number--that we have to confirm. The \nproblem is, this year, because of the election difficulties in Florida, \nthe administration did not have as much time during the transition to \nget these people selected. As a result, we started out about a month \nbehind in terms of the nominations from the Bush administration. \nFortunately, the administration has worked very quickly and has \nactually caught up and even surpassed some previous administrations in \nthe number of nominations that have been sent to the Senate.\n  But the Senate has not acted very quickly either. Part of that was \ndue to the fact we had this change from an equally divided Senate to a \nSenate controlled by the Democratic Party, and there was a period when \nthe reorganization resolution had not yet been adopted.\n  People might say: Why is all that important? Let's just get these \nnominees approved. Sometimes there are certain steps the Senate has to \ntake before it can do things. The fact is, now we have had quite a \nperiod of time within which to act on these nominees, and we are \nbeginning to act on some of them, but, frankly, they are not occurring \nas fast as I think they should occur and many of us believe should \noccur.\n  There are still far too many nominees we have not confirmed, and we \nare afraid will not be confirmed by the beginning of the August recess, \nin less than 2 weeks from now. That means it would not be until after \nLabor Day that the President would have his full complement of Cabinet \nofficers in place, and subcabinet officers. That is far too long.\n  As of this month, over one-eighth of the Bush administration term is \nnow gone, and many of the people he would have working for him are not \neven confirmed. The Senate has, so far, confirmed 210 Bush \nadministration nominees, and that includes the 77 that we have \nconfirmed just in the last 11 days. But even with that progress, it is \njust 58 percent of the nominees that President Bush has sent to us so \nfar.\n  This chart represents the 58 percent of nominees confirmed by the \nSenate from George W. Bush. At this same time during the Bill Clinton \nadministration, the Senate had confirmed 74 percent; and in the Reagan \nadministration, 72 percent. These are administrations that took over \nfrom a previous party.\n  Ronald Reagan took over from Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton took over \nfrom George Bush. And George Bush, of course, took over from Bill \nClinton--each changing parties in the process.\n  So as we can see, the Bush nominees have not been approved, have not \nbeen confirmed at the same rate as the Senate confirmed previous \nPresidents' nominees. That is putting a real burden on this White \nHouse.\n  Incidentally, even though it wasn't a change from Reagan to the first \nGeorge Bush in terms of party, the percentage was exactly the same as \nwith regard to George W. Bush. Clearly, the Senate has to do a better \njob getting these nominations heard, getting them to the Senate floor, \nand getting them approved.\n  The same thing is true with respect to judicial nominations. We are \ngoing to need to hold hearings and confirm judges at a much faster \npace, or we are going to be way behind in terms of judgeships. I will \ntalk about that in just a little bit.\n  The bottom line, the first point I am trying to make is that we would \nliterally have had to confirm about 83 nominations last week to match \nthe nominations that we confirmed for the Clinton administration. We \nconfirmed only 23. We were literally 50 nominations behind as of last \nweek.\n  The Bush administration has nominated 365 people to date. With the \n210 confirmed, that leaves 155. We have less than 2 weeks before the \nAugust recess. We would have to do about 75 per week to get these all \nconfirmed. The fact is, 27 of those are judicial nominees. There is no \nway we can hold all of the hearings on them. So let's subtract the 27 \njudicial nominees; that still leaves 128 nonjudicial nominees. Those \nare the people the President needs to help run his Cabinet and his \nCabinet agencies. That would mean we would have to do about 65 per \nweek, this week and next week, in order to be done.\n  We are hopeful the Democratic leadership will cooperate in a \nbipartisan way to get these nominees confirmed. Because of what I \nexplained earlier, it is not difficult to accomplish this. We can walk \nand chew gum at the same time. We can do both appropriations bills and \nnominations because nominations usually don't require a lot of time for \ndebate on the Senate floor, and they don't require rollcall votes in \nmost cases. In most cases, they are bundled together because they are \nnot controversial. The leader asks unanimous consent at the end of the \nday that they be approved. That consent is given. They are approved, \nand it doesn't take very much time at all.\n  The good news is, the Senate can do both things at the same time. It \ncan both pursue legislative business, which in the case of the next 2 \nweeks is going to consist mostly of appropriations bills, and at the \nsame time we can do these nominations. That is the good news.\n  Let me try to give you a little bit of an idea of some of the \nagencies that have nominations pending and why these are important. As \nI said, there are 27 judicial nominations pending, 26 or 27. Everybody \nunderstands the importance of the judiciary. Tomorrow, the Judiciary \nCommittee is going to hold a hearing on three nominees, but only one of \nthem is a judge. The other two are nominees for the Department of \nJustice.\n  We have only confirmed three judicial nominees this entire year for \nPresident Bush. There is now a vacancy rate that is far higher than it \nwas at the end of the last administration. In fact, there are today 108 \nvacancies in Federal courts. This is about 45 or so more than there \nwere at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  Just to quote a couple of my colleagues to illustrate the \nsignificance of these judicial nominees, Senator Leahy is the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee and has always been a very strong \nadvocate for filling these judicial positions. When Bill Clinton was \nPresident, this is something Senator Leahy said:\n\n       Any week in which the Senate does not confirm three judges \n     is a week in which the Senate is failing to address the \n     vacancy crisis. Any fortnight in which we have gone without a \n     judicial confirmation hearing marks 2 weeks in which the \n     Senate is falling further behind.\n\n  Senator Leahy is right about that. He said this in January of 1998. \nWhen he made that statement, there were fewer than 85 vacancies. Today \nthere are 108 vacancies. As lawyers would say, a fortiori, it is \nimportant for us to begin confirming these judges. Moreover, as he \npointed out, you can't confirm them until you have had hearings, and we \nare not having hearings on these judges.\n  We are supposed to have a hearing this week, but only one judge is on \nthe panel. I remember the last three or four hearings of last year, we \nhad five or six judges per panel. To have only 1 judge on the panel \nwhen there are 26 others on which we could have a hearing--their FBI \nclearances have been done; they are ready to have their hearing--is \nsimply to slow down the process. There is no reason why we can't add \nmore judges to the hearing calendar. We should be doing that.\n  I respectfully request that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nget on with the scheduling of these hearings.\n  Our majority leader, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \nlast year said:\n\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\n\n       Today there are 76 vacancies on the Federal bench. Of those \n     76 vacancies, 29 have been empty so long they are officially \n     classified as judicial emergencies. The failure to fill these \n     vacancies is straining our Federal court system and delaying \n     justice for people all across this country. This cannot \n     continue.\n\n  That was in March of 2000. When he made that statement, there were 76 \nvacancies, 29 of which were categorized as ``judicial emergencies.'' \nToday there are 108 vacancies, 40 of which are classified as ``judicial \nemergencies.''\n  It is clear the Judiciary Committee needs to begin holding more \nhearings, that we need to get these judges to the Senate floor for \nconfirmation, and that the Senate needs to act more quickly on these \nvery important judicial nominations, 40 of which are classified right \nnow as ``emergencies.'' In other words, according to the administrative \noffice of the U.S. courts, these are the positions which need to be \nfilled immediately or the administration of justice will suffer. It \nrepresents 12.6 percent of the judicial positions in our country today. \nThat is the vacancy rate, and of those, just under 40 percent, are \nclassified as ``judicial emergencies.'' Clearly, we have to get working \non these nominations.\n  I note that my colleague, Senator Craig, has arrived. I was going to \nbegin discussing some of the specific nominees who are not judicial \nnominees that have been pending for a long time that we want to get \ncleared. Before I do that, perhaps my colleague is ready to make a \npresentation. I am happy to wait and go into some of the specific names \nafter a little bit.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. How much time does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. As much time as the Senator takes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for as much time \nas he consumes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding. Most \nimportantly, let me thank him for coming to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about what, without question, is a critically important issue to \nour country. That is that a President, once elected and sworn in by a \nNation, has the right to govern the executive branch of the Government.\n  We all know that takes a good many hands at the tiller, talented \npeople from all walks of life who can help a President in all of the \nagencies of the Government make the right determinations and decisions \nas they relate to how policy ultimately gets implemented into law. We \nhave watched over the years as this has become a most cumbersome \napproach. It has become increasingly involved, a combination of \nlegislative action on the part of the Congress--the Senate playing a \nrole--executive orders on the part of the President, all coming \ntogether in a critical mass. That takes the process a very long while \nto work. I am talking about simply the selection of, the vetting of, \nthe background checking of an individual whom a President is going to \nnominate prior to that individual getting to the Senate, and then for \nthe committees of jurisdiction to hold the proper hearings that are \nnecessary to look at all of the material and ultimately to pass \njudgment on this individual for recommendation before the full Senate.\n\n  The reason I talk about that at the outset is that we are not talking \nabout that today. We are talking about the second step--the Senate \nprocess, the responsibility we have as Senators to review, confirm, \nand/or reject these nominees, based on cause, whom a President sends \nbefore us.\n  We are in a situation where the Senate has confirmed about 210 Bush \nnominees so far this year, including the 77 we have confirmed in the \nlast 11 days. During the Fourth of July break, I was home in my State \nof Idaho and I was hearing from many constituents who were saying: \nLarry, when are we going to get this person? Senator, when are we going \nto get that person?'' Or they would say: Senator, do you realize that \nClinton people are still in power at the regional levels of the \nNational Marine Fisheries--or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or the \nEPA--and those decisions are still being made, based on, if you will, \nthe philosophy and attitude of that administration versus the one the \nAmerican public has just elected to power? When are those things going \nto happen or change? We elected a new President; we want a new \ndirection. We expect that. That is why we did what we did last \nNovember.\n  It was during that time, in listening to my constituents and trying \nto explain, that I began to examine the second phase--this phase, the \none we are in now as Senators, doing our responsible job and \nconstitutionally mandated job to review and confirm or reject \nappointments, nominations made by a President.\n  Coming back from the Fourth of July break, I began to examine the \nnumbers involved to see what the problem was, why we had not moved \nmore. Yes, there was a time when we had a change of power and that took \ntime. I don't argue that. But clearly, if you examine the amount of \ntime involved with all of the nominees who are before us, there were a \ngood many languishing before committees who had not had hearings, nor \nwere hearings scheduled. As a result of that, I began to look at it in \nthe context of how do we make this system work to accelerate itself, to \ndo what it should do responsibly, but to do so in a timely fashion, so \nthat our President can have the people he sent forth to help govern our \ncountry at the executive level.\n  It was at that time that my colleague from Arizona and I teamed up, \nusing the rules of the Senate appropriately, to discuss this issue and \nto cause the Senate to work in a more expeditious fashion. Even with \nthe recent progress we have made--those 11 days and 77 confirmations--\nthat is just 58 percent of all of the nominees President Bush has sent \nto us so far. How does that compare with past Presidents' transitions? \nAs of July 20, the Senate had confirmed, as I say, about 58 percent of \nthe Bush nominees. As of July 20, 1993, the Senate had confirmed, as \nthe chart shows, about 74 percent of President Clinton's. As of July \n20, 1981, the Republican-controlled Senate had confirmed 72 percent of \nPresident Ronald Reagan's nominations. So somewhere in the seventies is \nprobably a figure that is right and reasonable--if there is a ``right \nand reasonable''. Or should the Senate operate clearly in a more \nexpeditious fashion? To keep pace with the record we have shown by the \nchart this afternoon, we would have had to have confirmed 83 nominees \nlast week to match the Clinton record, instead of the 23 for whom we \nfought hard to get the majority to work with us on, to ultimately get \nbefore the Senate in confirmation.\n\n  The transition in power in the Senate, as I mentioned, caused some \ndelays. I accept that, and I am willingly able to talk about that, and \nI should because that is right and that is fair. The uncertain outcome \nof a Presidential election stalled any President or President-elect out \n36 days before they could begin to actually move in any fashion. Yet \nthe Bush administration has recovered from its delays, and it had sent \na record 365 nominations as of last week. I think the Senate now must \nstep up the pace if we are going to deal with this matter in a timely \nfashion.\n  As important as all of that is, as my colleague from Arizona knows so \nwell, to allow this President to govern, to set the course in the \npolicy direction that is set by these key people, and also to establish \nthe kind of relationships and esprit de corps that occurs within an \nagency between administrators of that agency and the rank-and-file \ncivil servant, our goal--the goal of the Senator from Arizona and \nmyself, working with the leadership of Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate--is to get the Bush administration fully staffed with qualified \npeople as quickly as possible.\n  A week and a half ago I told the majority leader, Tom Daschle, that \nour goal was, if you will, to cleanse the Senate of nominees by the \nAugust recess. Why? Because we are going to be gone for a month. If \nthere is anyone languishing without cause simply because committee \nchairmen could not act or would not act, then shame on them, shame on \nthe Senate, and shame on the leadership of the Senate for simply not \nmoving the process along in the next 2 weeks to get the hearings done, \nto vet these people, to get them voted on, and get them to the floor.\n  As we know, it is only in a rare case that a nominee actually brings \nabout aggressive debate on the floor of the Senate. Why? Because, in a \nbipartisan manner, all of us believe that a President has the right to \nchoose, to select.\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\n While it is our responsibility to confirm, very seldom does the Senate \nactually reject. So why should there be delay, as long as the process \nis thorough, responsible--and it should be timely. Based on the \nworkload of the Senate today, there is really no reason for a lack of \ntimeliness.\n  There are 499 positions in the executive branch requiring Senate \nconfirmation, not counting judicial nominees. As the Senator from \nArizona knows, while he was tackling the judicial nominees, I looked at \nall the other agencies as my target, believing that those were the ones \nwe could get out to the administration most quickly. Of those, \naccording to the Brookings Institution, there are 313 positions \ncurrently vacant. That is 6 out of 10 positions in Government today. In \nother words, 6 out of 10 people are not ``on the ground,'' not working \nwith the President and the Vice President to govern our country.\n  That is what we are talking about--making critical decisions about \nhow policy gets implemented. For those who are the victims of the lack \nof people being in place, it is the rank-and-file citizens out there in \nArizona or in Idaho who find themselves in contests with or in conflict \nwith a given rule or regulation and having someone outside the system \nmake a judgment, or someone who has a given philosophical bent, instead \nof this administration. That is why what we do here and what the Senate \ndoes in the next 2 weeks is so absolutely critical to the American \npeople.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the Senator just hit the nail on the head. This \nisn't an abstract proposition, the fact that the President needs to \nhave his team in place; I think everybody recognizes that. But it has \nreal ``on the ground'' meaning for everyday decisions that are made \naffecting all Americans. Maybe we can talk for a little bit about some \nof the specific positions that are vacant, the people who have been \nnominated for those positions, why they are important for the American \npeople, and what can happen if these positions are not filled.\n  Would the Senator like to initiate discussion on that? I can \ncertainly do the same.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me give an example. I thank my colleague. I will \nreclaim my time and give an example. Some weeks ago, an acting regional \nadministrator of National Marine Fisheries told the largest utility in \nIdaho, which is a hydro-based utility, that they had to dump their \nwater; they could not generate with it. It just so happens that Idaho \nand the Pacific Northwest are in a drought at this moment. The 320,000 \nacre feet of water impounded for the purpose of generating power for \nBoise, ID, and the surrounding area was being ordered to be dumped in \nthe name of fish and fish recovery. The power company thought it was \ninappropriate to do and unnecessary under the law, even recognizing the \nneed to protect the fish.\n  When they refused, that acting agent sent a letter to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission asking they order the water be dumped. At \nthat time, I and other members of the Idaho congressional delegation \ngot involved. We began to examine it. Frankly, we found an individual \nwho was operating and making decisions in a manner that we thought \ninconsistent with the law, much more consistent with their \nphilosophical bent than the legal responsibility and the right \nadministration of the law. We asked for a conference. We asked that all \nthe parties be brought to Washington to solve this problem.\n  Under the law, it was decided that the utility could continue to \noperate normally, and in so flowing the water through its pin stocks \nand turbines, it could not only generate power--and we know what has \nhappened in the Pacific Northwest, with a real absence of power.\n  To make a long story short, but a very dramatic example for Idaho, \ninstead of following the edicts of someone whom I felt was \nphilosophically driven by a past administration's attitudes of how that \nagency ought to operate, under a negotiated settlement and within the \nlaw, this utility was allowed to operate, manage the water accordingly \nso there would be no blackouts in Boise, ID, and the surrounding area \nthis year, save the fish, and solve the problem.\n  I do believe that if the regional director for National Marine \nFisheries had been in place, the request to spill or dump water would \nnever have occurred. That problem could have been solved at the \nregional level through reasonable negotiation. That is an example, and \nthere are a myriad of others going on out there at this moment.\n  Let me give another example, and while this one cannot be blamed on \nthe Senate at this moment, it is a perfect example of not having people \nin place at the right time. It really cannot be blamed on the \nadministration, either. I am talking about our Ambassador to the United \nNations, Negroponte, and the stalled nomination and the unwieldy system \nthat impacts this. With no permanent Ambassador, the United States \nmission at the United Nations has had to rely on a career diplomat, Mr. \nCunningham, who was the acting Ambassador in January when Richard \nHolbrooke resigned.\n  What happened in the meantime? The problem became a public one \nbecause of the unwillingness, in my opinion, to be aggressive in \nholding the Nation's position as it relates to our role in the United \nNations and in the General Assembly.\n  The problem became public on May 3 when the United Nations lost two \ninfluential U.S. Commissioners: one for human rights and one for \nnarcotics control.\n  According to a source close to the U.S. Commission, diplomats were \nunaware that positions on either panel were in jeopardy until the final \nhour. In other words, somebody was not doing their homework and \nsomebody was not watching and dealing with it. It appeared that a last-\nminute campaign effort would have secured the United States one of the \nthree open Western seats in the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The \nU.S. diplomat had expected to get a 43-53 vote in favor.\n  They did not get it, and we know the rest of that story. For the \nfirst time since the Commission's inception in 1947, the United States \nhas lost positions. That speaks to the problems and complications of \nthe system.\n  I cannot lay the blame at the feet of the Senate on that issue, but \nthe reason I bring it up, I tell the Senator from Arizona, is to \nexpress the dramatic consequences that can occur when we do not act \ntimely to get the right people in the right place to make the decisions \nand to administer the role of Government as we would want it done.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  (Mr. REED assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may pursue this, it is an excellent \nexample of one of the nominees who has been pending for a long time. \nJohn Negroponte was nominated on May 14. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho pointed out, it was very shortly thereafter that this \nproblem in the United Nations occurred. Many people had said if John \nNegroponte had been there, this would not have happened. We do not \nknow, as the Senator said.\n  I do know about a month ago Secretary of State Colin Powell was on \nnational television, on one of these Sunday morning talk shows. He was \nasked about the nomination of John Negroponte, and Secretary Powell \nmade an eloquent plea to the Senate to please confirm John Negroponte. \nHe said the United States needs him at the United Nations, that we \nneeded to get him confirmed. That was, I believe, over a month ago.\n  His nomination has been pending since May 14. It is now July 23. The \nPresident is going to be speaking to the United Nations this fall, I \nbelieve in September. He is going to be addressing the United Nations. \nFor the United States not to have our Ambassador in place would be a \nbreach of significant diplomatic protocol, as well as an important loss \nto U.S. interests.\n  I note that because the Senator from Idaho brought up the name of \nJohn Negroponte, another perfect example of someone we have had plenty \nof time to confirm, and we have not yet taken up his nomination for \nconfirmation, and we need to do so.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I talked about what could have happened in Idaho if, in \nfact, we had not been able to move the issue to Washington and those \nwho had been left to administer at the regional level had won.\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n  What the Senator from Arizona and I just talked about is an \ninternational problem and clearly an image problem on the part of the \nUnited States. How does it look for the United States not to be able to \nact in a timely and responsible manner to put key diplomats in place to \ndo the work of our country? What does it say to the rest of the world? \nWhat does it say to the United Nations as it relates to how we \nprioritize the value of the U.N. and these very important commissions, \nthe question of drugs being trafficked internationally, the question of \nhuman rights that this Senate has spent a great deal of time on over \nthe years--human rights in this country and human rights around the \nworld--and we have now lost key positions because we did not have \npeople in place to lobby effectively for the position of this country, \nto make sure we had a voice on these key commissions.\n  It speaks volumes about not only our inability to operate but the \ncumbersome nature of the system we have allowed to be created.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Idaho to yield again, \nprimarily to make a point.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Idaho was instrumental at the end of the \nweek in getting an agreement from the Democratic leadership to take up \nthe nomination of Jack Crouch, sometimes known as J.D. Crouch, a \ndistinguished expert in, among other things, missile defense. I had \nbreakfast a couple of months ago, along with other Senators, with \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He pleaded with us at that time: Please \nsend me my troops. Please confirm the people we have nominated for the \nCabinet and subcabinet positions for the Department of Defense.\n  Now the President is busy in negotiations with the Russians, with \nPutin, and with others regarding missile defense, and the nomination of \na distinguished member of his subcabinet, Jack Crouch, has not been \ntaken up. He was nominated on May 7. He was nominated even before John \nNegroponte. Still no confirmation.\n  I ask the Senator from Idaho, since the Senator was instrumental in \ngetting the agreement of the Democratic leadership to have a vote on \nJ.D. Crouch sometime before the end of the August recess, does the \nSenator think it is important in this case to get this vote scheduled \nas soon as we possibly can so we can send Secretary Rumsfeld the team \nhe needs to help provide for the national security of the United \nStates?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Certainly, I agree with the Senator from Arizona. There is \nnothing more important to our country; now that these men and women \nhave gone through their background checks and have been thoroughly \nvetted and sent to us, we ought to act in the most timely fashion.\n  Where there are objections--there happen to be a few on our side and \nsome on the other side. Let's solve those, bring them to the floor. If \na Senator objects, let he or she come to the floor and defend their \nposition. There is nothing wrong with that. I say that for Republicans \nand Democrats alike. They can express their opposition; they can vote \nno. There is nothing wrong if you feel passionately about one of the \nnominees, in telling the President, who happens to be your President: \nMr. President, I vote no.\n  Why openly and aggressively deny the President the right to select \nthe people he thinks are necessary to work with him in the governance \nof this country?\n  I know the Senator went through the list of those key and important \nindividuals still languishing in committee. I understand there are a \ntotal of 127 nominees who have had no hearings and no markups, as close \nas we can determine. There were 48 who came up this month; 46 came up \nin June; 27 came up in May; 6 came up in April. That is the time that \nthese names have been before the appropriate committees.\n  The question is, where is that chairman? And why can't we hold \nhearings and give these people an opportunity to testify? Hector \nBarreto was nominated to head the SBA on May 1, just Friday. He was \nplaced on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The Executive Calendar is at \nthe desk. It is the calendar that nominations reside on before they are \nconsidered by the Senate as a whole. He was reported out of committee \nby a unanimous vote. This is the head of the Small Business \nAdministration. He got a unanimous vote out of committee, but he came \nthere May 1.\n  The most modern phrase I can come up with is, ``duh.'' It is kind of \na ``duh'' issue to the chairman of the committee why this man has been \nbefore them since May 1, and got a unanimous vote coming out of \ncommittee. We will now, I trust, take up Hector Barreto this week. \nCertainly the Senate, I hope, can act timely. This is the man who will \nrun the Small Business Administration of our country, which we rely on \nheavily in dealing with the small businesses of our State, those \nstarting up, the problems they might have in trying to create start-up \nbusinesses.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I know first hand, as his is a border \nState, and border States by definition are oftentimes caught in the \nbacklash of drug trafficking that flows across their borders and into \nthe United States, John Walters was nominated on June 5 to be the \nNation's drug czar. We know that problem. We are extremely pleased the \nBush Administration is reemphasizing the drug problem as an enforcement \nproblem for the citizens of our country. The Judiciary Committee has \nneither held hearings nor reported out this Cabinet-level appointee. \nThey have had him since June 5. I don't know if it meets the ``duh'' \ntest. I am not sure what it meets.\n  The Judiciary Committee does not appear to be functioning well. We \nhave had changes in chairmanships, but the new chairman has had plenty \nof time. Just send out a notice, bring down the gavel, listen to this \nman and question this man about what he will do as the new drug czar \nfor our country at a time when drug use is high, lives are being \ndestroyed, and we as a country want to put special emphasis on control \nand detection and certainly all of the counseling, and the remediation \nefforts involved in helping our citizens cope.\n\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee gets the message that they need to act \nexpeditiously to allow this man the right to begin to administer the \nantidrug programs of this country.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding. There are other \npoints that can be made. We will continue to make the points as we work \nwith Democrat and Republican leadership to recognize and deal in a \ntimely fashion with all of these nominees. My test, the test of my \ncolleague from Arizona, is to move as many as possible before the \nAugust recess so we do not then wait clear until September to see the \nmen and women on the ground managing and doing what they have been \nasked to do on behalf of this administration.\n  There is a lot of work to be done. But there are 2 weeks left. In 2 \nweeks' time, these committees can clearly convene and hold the \nhearings, make their recommendations, and allow the men and women \nnominated by President Bush to get to the floor for the purpose of our \nconsideration and our constitutional responsibility of confirming or \ndenying these nominations.\n  I thank my colleague for the effort he has put forth in the last \nseveral weeks. We have worked together as a team to assure that many of \nthe nominees have been moved in a timely manner. In all fairness, I \nthink part of our message and concern is getting out. I have had two \nchairmen this week in Agriculture and in Veterans' tell me they will \nattempt to move expeditiously. Hearings are being scheduled.\n  When I see 127 nominees who have not had hearings, and there are 2 \nweeks left, that says there is an awful lot of work to be done in the \nnext 2 weeks. I hope our chairmen are up to it. I think the committees \nand the committee staffs have had adequate time to do the necessary \nwork to prepare for appropriate and necessary hearings.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for securing the time and yielding \nto me on this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for being \ninstrumental in bringing this issue to this Chamber. He helped to prove \nwe can do more than one thing at once. We can do our legislative work \non the appropriations bills that come before the Senate, and at the \nsame time have the committees meeting on the nominees and holding \nhearings and bringing them to the Senate floor, in most cases for a \nquick unanimous consent vote that does not require a lot of Senate \ntime.\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\n  I know he and I will continue to work to see we complete this list of \nnominees for confirmation before we leave for the August recess. It \nwould be a shame to leave here with that unfinished business, leaving \nthe President without the team he needs to help in the important \nresponsibilities he has.\n  The Senator from Idaho pointed out he has visited with different \ncommittee chairmen--for example, the Agriculture Committee chairman. \nThere are 10 nominees pending before the Agriculture Committee. They \nneed hearings and need to be acted upon. There are 9 pending before the \nArmed Services Committee, and in addition to that, J.D. Crouch, on whom \nwe need to vote.\n  In the Banking Committee, there are 7 pending; in the Commerce \nCommittee, there are 8; in the Energy Committee, there are 3; before \nthe EPW Committee, there are 8; before the Finance Committee, there are \n12; Foreign Relations has 41, many of whom are important nominees to \nAmbassadorial positions to various countries. What do these countries \nthink when that we sit on these nominations for so long before \nconfirming them and sending them on to serve the United States abroad?\n  There are 4 pending before the Governmental Affairs Committee, 6 \nbefore the health committee; as I said, before the Judiciary Committee, \nthere are 27 judicial nominees and either 12 or 13, depending on my \ncount of positions, to other judicial branch appointments, and 3 before \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, and another before the Judiciary \nCommittee, since the Senator from Idaho singled out the Judiciary \nCommittee out.\n  I am on that committee and the Judiciary Committee has not done its \njob either with the executive branch nominees or the judiciary, the \njudges. John Gillis was nominated in April to head the Office of \nVictims of Crime. He would be the Director of the Office for Victims of \nCrime at the Department of Justice. He has had no hearing. John Gillis \nis an extraordinary man. He is an African American, former police \nofficer from the Los Angeles police force. His daughter was killed, \nmurdered.\n  John Gillis became a very strong advocate for victims' rights. He is \na national hero in this regard. He is a man of great character, of \npassion for the cause of victims of crime.\n  President Bush has also strongly advocated the rights of victims of \ncrime. My colleagues know that has been one of my passions, as it has \nbeen of Senator Feinstein from California.\n  In April, John Gillis was nominated. It is critical that he join the \nteam at the Justice Department--no hearing. He has not been approved by \nthe Senate.\n  Mary Sheila Gall, this is another interesting nominee, interesting in \nthe sense of the position she would hold. She was nominated back on May \n8. Apparently there may be a hearing for her on July 25. But she would \nchair the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This is only the \nCommission that is responsible for the regulations and enforcement of \nregulations that protect the public against unreasonable risks of \ninjuries and deaths associated with consumer products--a very important \nposition for children as well as adult men and women in our country. It \nis an independent, Federal regulatory agency, and it has jurisdiction \nover about 15,000 different types of consumer products. Let me give you \na couple of examples of things they have been doing:\n  This past month, the month of July, a Columbus, OH, firm voluntarily \nrecalled 32,000 hand trucks with faulty tires that can explode under \nintense pressure and injure bystanders or users. A Los Angeles company \nvoluntarily recalled 600 baby walkers that will fit through standard \ndoorways but are not designed to stop at the edge of a step. A \nPennsylvania firm announced a voluntary replacement program providing \nfree parts and labor to replace faulty sprinkler heads that relate to \nthe ability for firefighting equipment to work, and so on and so on.\n  I could go down a long list here.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield? I am pleased he is mentioning this \none because at times I have been at odds with the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission as it relates to some of the work they have done. One \nof the most significant findings they made, and one of the largest \nrecall/replacement efforts was just mentioned by the Senator from \nArizona and that was the sprinkler head that you see in new code \nbuildings around the country that fire professionals will tell you is \nthe single greatest way to put out a fire. What they found was that \nover a period of time a rubber gasket that controlled the release of \nwater would simply rot away. This company that makes them, because of \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission's oversight and review, is \nvoluntarily replacing these faulty sprinkler heads all across the \nNation.\n  Why can't we hold a hearing in Judiciary to get the head of this \nCommission in place? How long has that person been before the \ncommittee?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Mary Gall was nominated as chair of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission on May 8. She is pending before the \nCommerce Committee to this day.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May, June, July--3 months now--that person has languished \nbefore the committee. Both the Senator from Arizona and I have openly \ndiscussed the time we lost through the transition when we had one of \nour colleagues become Independent and the leadership of the Senate \nchanged. At the same time there is no excuse, because staffs didn't \nchange dramatically. We really just passed the gavel over and the total \nnumber of members on the committee changed. Yes, we had to wait for \nan administrative process that allowed a new regulation to be written--\na resolution of the Senate, what we call an organizational resolution--\nbut still, that committee could have gone on, and many did, to hold \nhearings. They could have voted them out immediately, then, after the \nhearing record was established because none of us were calling for \nvotes on key committees. But some committees did function. And here, \nnow, we have this critical position languishing because of failure to \nact.\n\n  I thank my colleague for bringing that point forward.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me mention a couple more before my time \nis up. One would think we would want to have in place the Solicitor for \nthe Department of Labor to ensure the Nation's labor laws are fairly \nand forcefully adhered to. Eugene Scalia was nominated back in April--\nApril 30--to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor. There have been \nno hearings for his nomination. Yet that person is responsible, at the \nDepartment of Labor, for monitoring agency activities, providing advice \nand opinions to ensure Department of Labor employees and agencies fully \ncomply with laws and regulations, and to assist in the development of \nregulations and standards to protect workers in this country.\n  This is another very important position, Eugene Scalia. We need to \nhave a hearing on him and he needs to be brought to the Senate floor \nfor confirmation before we leave here for our August recess.\n  Brian Jones, general counsel of the Department of Education: We all \nlike to talk a good game when it comes to education. This is for the \nchildren. We need to help them. We need to staff up the Department of \nEducation. It needs to be able to do the work we have asked it to do. \nBrian Jones was nominated back in April as well, April 30. He has had \nno hearing. Yet his responsibilities as the general counsel for the \nDepartment of Education are to help support equal access to education \nand education excellence around the country by providing sound, \nunderstandable, and useful legal services and effectively managing the \nDepartment on all of the ethics and legal issues that come before it as \nwell as to serve as the principal adviser to the Secretary on all legal \nmatters affecting the Department's programs and activities.\n  I mentioned another individual who was nominated more recently but \nwhose name has really been before the Senate for a long time: Otto \nReich. This is one of the key priorities for President Bush because, as \neveryone, I think, knows, the President has paid special attention to \nMexico and the countries of Central and South America. Otto Reich would \nbe the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. It \nis an extraordinarily important position to manage and promote U.S. \ninterests in that region by supporting democracy, trade, and \nsustainable economic development in dealing with a whole range of \nproblems from drug trafficking to crime and poverty reduction and \nenvironmental protection. Otto Reich deserves to have a\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\nhearing and deserves to be considered by the Senate before we go out in \nAugust.\n  The Senator from Idaho and I could go through each of these names, \nwell over a hundred. In every case, we are dealing with an important \nposition and we are dealing with people whose lives have basically been \nheld in abeyance. They do not know whether or not to move their \nfamilies or to do what is necessary to prepare to serve the President. \nThe Senator from Idaho told me of a meeting he had with people who were \nabout ready to give up because their nominations had simply been \nlanguishing for so long. I think the Senator from Idaho said: \nPersevere; the Senate is going to do its work.\n\n  I might ask the Senator to recount that brief experience.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Arizona for mentioning that \nsituation. I did visit with a gentleman who was slated to go to \nJustice, and will in time. But you know there is an image problem here. \nOftentimes, or at least sometimes, the public thinks these people who \nserve a President and are nominated are wealthy people or people of \nsubstantial means who can do as they wish. That is not true. They come \nfrom all walks of life and all experiences. They fit the situation and/\nor the responsibility they are going to undertake. A lot of them are \nyoung, family people with children in school.\n  The question is, Are we going to be confirmed and can we bring our \nkids to Washington and get them into the schools here in the area \nbecause remember what happens at the end of August? Kids go back to \nschool. I understand the other day in this city there was a breakfast \nof about 20 of them, trying to make up their minds whether to tough it \nout, wondering when the Senate might operate, or if they were going to \nhave to pick up the phone and call the President and say: Mr. \nPresident, I am sorry; I really did want to serve you and I wanted to \nserve the American people, but I have to get on with my life. I have \nbeen 3 or 4 months in limbo now, and because of the risk of conflicts \nof interest, I cannot continue in my current job or my current capacity \nand I have kids to get in school this fall. I have a home I have to \nsell and/or a home to buy. What do I do? That is the practical, human \nside of this very real problem that the Senate of the United States has \ncreated.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for mentioning that.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me mention one other very practical \nproblem. The Attorney General, John Ashcroft, told me of a situation \nwhich I hope by now has been corrected. But he literally was at his \nfarm in Missouri after he became the Attorney General and I think he \nwas the sole executive person at the Department of Justice. An aide had \nto literally bring a warrant out to Missouri, fly on an airplane from \nWashington, DC, out to Missouri so he could sign it because he was the \nonly one who had the authority at that point to sign this particular \ndocument.\n  I believe since then we have confirmed some people who also have that \nauthority. But the point here is we have to get the executive team in \nplace. We have 155 people who need to be confirmed; at least about 130 \nof them need to be confirmed before we leave for the August recess. In \nthe name of bipartisanship, for the good of the American people, for \nthe sake of doing the important jobs we have outlined here before, and \nfor the sake of filling our judiciary, I urge my colleagues to work \nwith us to get these people to the floor and to get them confirmed \nbefore we leave for the August recess.\n  Mr. President, might I inquire, do I have another minute or so left? \nWhat is the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is informed it is 3 o'clock, when \nMr. Byrd is to be recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I conclude by urging all of my colleagues to work with us so we can \nget these people to the Senate floor and get them confirmed before the \nAugust recess. If we do, we will feel better about doing our job and \nthe country will feel better because we will have served the interests \nof the American people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8039-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8039-S8041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. IMMIGRATION POLICY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in his delightful work ``Democracy in \nAmerica,'' Alexis de Tocqueville begins his thoughts on the origins of \nAnglo-Americans with these words: ``The emigrants who came at different \nperiods to occupy the territory now covered by the American Union \ndiffered from each other in many respects; their aim was not the same, \nand they governed themselves on different principles. These men had, \nhowever, certain features in common, and they were all placed in an \nanalogous situation. The tie of language is, perhaps, the strongest and \nthe most durable that can unite mankind. All the emigrants spoke the \nsame language; they were all children of the same people.''\n  For generations, the United States has had the good fortune to be \nable to draw upon not only the talents of native-born Americans but \nalso upon the talents of foreign-born citizens. Immigrants from many \nnations built our railroads, worked in our factories, mined our coal, \nmade our steel, advanced our scientific and technological capabilities, \nand added literature, art, poetry, and music to the fabric of American \nlife.\n  Of course, many of these new Americans struggled with our language \nand customs when they first arrived, but they learned our language, \nthey absorbed our constitutional principles, they abided by our laws, \nand they contributed in a mighty way to our success as a nation.\n  Indeed, I believe that, particularly in the case of those who came to \nour shores fleeing tyranny, there has existed a unique appreciation for \nthe freedom and opportunity available in this country, an appreciation \nwhich makes those special Americans among our most patriotic citizens.\n  In other words, do not go to Weirton, WV, and burn the flag. No, not \nin Weirton. We have at least 25 or 30 different ethnic groups in that \nsmall steel town in the Northern Panhandle.\n  Mr. President, the United States today is in the midst of another \nimmigration wave--the largest since the early 1900s. According to the \nlatest numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau, immigrants now comprise \nabout 10 percent of the total U.S. population. That is about 28.4 \nmillion immigrants living in the United States.\n  During the 1990s, an average of more than 1 million immigrants--legal \nand illegal--settled in the United States each year. Over the next 50 \nyears, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will \nincrease from its present 284 million to more than 400 million. \nImmigration is projected to contribute to two-thirds of that growth.\n  These are unprecedented numbers. When I was born in 1917, there were \nabout 102 million people in this country. When I graduated from high \nschool in 1934, there were about 130 million people in this country. \nAnd today, there are 284 million people in America. This nation has \nnever attempted to incorporate more than 28 million newcomers at one \ntime into its society, let alone to prepare for an additional 116 \nmillion citizens over the span of the next 50 years.\n  Although many of the immigrants who have entered our country over the \nlast ten years are skilled and are adjusting quickly, others have had \nproblems. Last year, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, \n41.4 percent of established immigrants lived in or near poverty, \ncompared to 28.8 percent of natives. The situation had completely \nreversed itself from 30 years before, when, in 1970, established \nimmigrants were actually less likely than natives to have low incomes, \nwith about 25.7 percent living in or near poverty compared with 35.1 \npercent of the native population.\n  The deterioration in the position of immigrants can be explained, in \npart, by a significant decline in the education of immigrants relative \nto natives and by the needs of the U.S. economy. In 1970, 7.1 \npercentage points separated the high school completion rate of \nestablished immigrants versus natives. By 2000, established immigrants \nwere more than three times as likely as natives not to have completed \nhigh school, with 34.4 percent of established immigrants and 9.6 \npercent of natives lacking a high school diploma.\n  The less skilled the immigrants, the worse their employment \nprospects, the\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nbigger the burden on schools, and the greater the demand for social \nservices. The National Research Council recently estimated, in December \n1999, that the net fiscal cost of immigration ranges from $11 billion \nto $20.2 billion per year. That is enough money to fund the operations \nof the State of West Virginia for nearly 3 to 6 to 8 years.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee and as a member of the \nBudget Committee, I well know of the extreme shortage of money to meet \nthe needs of own population today. Because of the 10-year tax cut that \nwas enacted earlier this year, I am wrestling mightily with trying to \nprovide enough money to educate our children, meet our health care \nneeds, provide transportation to our population, and battle crime in \nour streets.\n  And, so, Mr. President, I grow increasingly concerned when I read \nmedia reports about discussions within the administration to grant \namnesty to 3 million Mexican immigrants who illegally reside in the \nUnited States.\n  I am very concerned that an open immigration policy only makes it \nmore difficult to adequately meet the needs of our Nation. I have found \nthe attempt to fund critical needs for America to be among the most \nfrustrating challenges that I have ever undertaken. I have implored \nthis administration to take into account these critical needs.\n  In many school districts overcrowding is already a major problem. As \nour classrooms fill to the brim, they are becoming breeding grounds for \nviolence. Economic growth in some regions of the country, and the \nresulting influx of workers, has created a surge in the number of \nschool-aged children. A less stringent immigration policy will only \nmake this problem worse.\n  This country's personal and commercial highway travel continues to \nincrease at a faster rate than highway capacity, and our highways \ncannot sufficiently support our current or projected travel needs. \nBetween 1970 and 1995, passenger travel nearly doubled in the United \nStates, and road use is expected to climb by nearly two-thirds in the \nnext 20 years. This congestion will grow even worse as immigration \ntraffic increases.\n  And, how will we provide for health care costs of these new citizens? \nWhether or not they arrive here legally or illegally, immigrants can \nreceive federally funded emergency health care service. As the \nimmigrant population continues to increase, so will health care \nexpenditures to the Federal Government.\n  We also have an obligation to ensure the safety of the residents \nliving in the United States--both native citizens and immigrants. Yet \nthe Attorney General must soon release from jail and into our streets \n3,400 immigrants who have been convicted of such crimes as rape, \nmurder, and assault because their own countries will not take them \nback. We cannot protect our residents if our country is used as the \ndumping ground for the criminals of other nations.\n  We are struggling with ways to preserve and protect our environment. \nBut population growth only exacerbates the increasing demands on our \naging water and sewer systems, and further threatens the safety of our \ndrinking water. Our ``green spaces'' are diminishing as more and more \nhomes are being built to house our growing population. We lament the \nloss of and the damage to our natural resources, yet we seem unable to \nsee the connection to our loose immigration policy.\n  We have a weakening economy, an increasing unemployment rate, a \nproblem with adequately educating our people, a congested \ntransportation infrastructure, a lack of adequate health care, and an \nadministration that certainly is not totally unsympathetic to these \nneeds. We cannot afford to take on more. I understand the desire to \nhelp the millions of people around the world who crave the blessings of \nfreedom that we, as Americans, enjoy. At this time in our history, I do \nnot know how we can possibly afford to provide for additional people \nwho may need assistance with education, health problems, and job \nskills.\n  If we invite new masses to citizenship, we have an obligation to \nadequately provide for them. Yet we are presently frustrated with an \ninability to even provide for those who have come before and those who \nhave been born in this country.\n  Mr. President, an interdepartmental group formed by the White House \nto suggest reforms of immigration policy is expected to include the \noption of granting legal residency to undocumented Mexican immigrants \nwho have been working in the United States. The report raises the \npossibility of these illegal immigrants ultimately becoming citizens. \nSuch a proposal would take this Nation's immigration laws in the wrong \ndirection.\n  The Immigration and Nationality Act, our primary law for regulating \nimmigration into this country, sets out a very specific process by \nwhich immigrants may live and work in this country. To capriciously \ngrant amnesty to 3 million immigrants who circumvented these processes, \nwho have resided and worked in this country illegally, sends exactly \nthe wrong message.\n  Such an amnesty suggests that it is possible to gain permanent \nresidency in the United States regardless of whether you are an alien \nwho arrived here legally or illegally.\n  That is the message that was sent in 1986 when President Reagan \nproposed a blanket amnesty to 2.7 million illegal immigrants based \nlargely on the mere fact that they had lived in this country at least \nsince 1982. I supported that amnesty, after accepting the arguments of \nthe Reagan administration that such an amnesty would reduce illegal \nimmigration when combined with tougher sanctions on employers who hire \nillegal aliens.\n  What happened instead, was that the United States sent a message to \nthe world that illegal immigrants could gain legal status in the United \nStates without having to go through the normal processes. Consequently, \nillegal immigration jumped from an estimated 5 million illegals in 1986 \nto somewhere between 7 million and 13 million illegals today--and these \nestimates do not even include the 2.7 million illegals who were granted \namnesty in 1986.\n  So, Mr. President, we should not repeat our earlier mistakes.\n  If amnesty is given to a class on the basis of their having broken \nthe law, then we are rewarding breaking the law, we are rewarding a \ncriminal act.\n  This is not the message that we should send to those who would \nconsider illegally entering this country. What is worse, such an \namnesty undermines our present immigration laws and suggests that these \nlaws mean nothing if, to those who break them, the Federal Government \nsimply grants amnesty with a wink and a nod.\n  Millions of potential immigrants are waiting patiently for a chance \nto come to the United States legally. Why should illegal aliens have \npreference over these aliens who are waiting patiently? Amnesty sends \nthe message that it is far easier and faster to become a U.S. citizen \nby immigrating illegally than it is to wait for legal approval.\n  Now, Mr. President, American citizenship should mean something. It \nshould not be something merely handed out as a means of political \nexpediency. It should not be something that one can achieve as some \nkind of squatter's right, particularly when access to the soil they \nclaim was gained illegally.\n  Being an American is something to be cherished, something to be \nrevered. Citizenship in the United States brings with it certain \ninalienable rights. Those who would come to our country to try to \nestablish citizenship are often enticed by the promise of those rights.\n  The notion that each citizen is guaranteed certain protections is \npowerfully alluring. But what many fail to understand is that those \nrights are protected only so long as Americans are willing and able to \ndefend them. Our populace must be constantly vigilant for those things \nthat threaten to endanger our rights, our Constitution, and our form of \nGovernment. Such threats go well beyond military invasion. They include \nthe preservation of ideals such as liberty and equality and justice, \nwhich can be so easily chipped away.\n  In order to become a citizen, most aliens are required to devote time \nto a study of our country and its history. They receive, at least, \nelementary guidance to help them appreciate the precious title of \n``citizen'' and all that it entails. What goes all too often unspoken \nin this debate is that U.S. citizenship entails much more than rights. \nIt entails responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n  Our citizenry should be instilled with at least a basic understanding \nof the precepts that formed the foundation for this country. Lacking \nthat, they are ill-prepared to be guardians of our future.\n  We Americans are justifiably proud of their history as a melting pot. \nIf we go back far enough, we are all products of that melting pot, at \nleast most of us. But the melting must be done in a way that ensures \nthat these new citizens are ready to be productive, functioning \nAmericans. We owe it not only to today's citizens but also to future \ncitizens, including those who come to our shores expecting the \nopportunity for which America is so renowned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8041-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8041-S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESIDING OVER THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, every class of Senators seems to have \ncharacteristics or qualities that make it distinguishable from other \nclasses. The Senate class of 1946, for example, has been considered the \n``post-New Deal Republican Eightieth Congress.'' The Senate Class of \n1958, my own class, had qualities to which I devoted an entire chapter \nin Volume I of my history of the United States Senate. The class of \n1974 has been referred to as ``Kennedy children'' because of the \ninfluence that President John F. Kennedy had on so many of them, and as \nthe ``Watergate Babies'' because so many of them owed their victories \nto the fallout from the scandals of the Nixon Administration. The \nSenate class of 1980 was certainly an integral part the ``Reagan \nRevolution.''\n  I daresay that the Senate class of 2000 may well become known for, \nand distinguished by, a renewed dedication to the Senate as an \ninstitution. That is what they have brought to the Senate. I have never \nseen a freshmen class of Senators demonstrate more pride in \nunderstanding the rules, customs, and traditions of the Senate as has \nthe class of 2000.\n  They first grabbed my attention early in this session when three of \nthem--namely, Senators Mark Dayton, Bill Nelson, and Hillary Clinton--\ncame to me and asked for my advice not only on how the Senate works, \nbut also what makes it work, and what they could do to make it work \nbetter.\n  I have seen and witnessed so much in my lifetime that few things ever \nimpress me any more, but that did. I was impressed by their eagerness \nand their sincerity, and their interest, not only in their individual \nSenate careers, but their interest in the Senate as an institution, as \nwell. These new Senators wanted to know how they could contribute to \nthe Senate, how they could be good Senators in the context of being \nuseful, of being efficient, of being Senators who develop and retain an \ninstitutional memory, how they could best serve their States in this \ninstitution.\n  At about that same time, our Majority Leader, Mr. Daschle, asked me \nif I would conduct a session with new Senators to discuss some of the \nelemental rules that would be important to new Members, especially when \nthey are called upon to preside.\n  I began meeting with these new Senators and discussing Senate rules \nand Senate traditions and how the Senate operates, how it should \noperate, how it has operated in the past. These meetings have been well \nattended.\n  Now I have enjoyed watching members of the class of 2000 preside over \nthe Senate, and the attentiveness and the pride with which they perform \nthis duty.\n  I realize that presiding over the Senate is often regarded as a \nchore. The limitations of the position keep it from being seen as an \nexciting or glamorous assignment. For example, Senators are restricted \nin what they can say from the Chair. Even when criticisms are directed \nto the Chair, the Chair is not supposed to respond. The Chair is only \nto respond when called upon by way of a parliamentary inquiry or to \nmake a ruling on a point of order, or to restore order in the Senate \nChamber or in the galleries.\n  Perhaps this is why, over the years, I have detected a tendency among \nsome Senators not to take the position of Presiding Officer seriously. \nThis is why, no doubt, some Senators have shied away from serving in \nthe position, and why, when they did preside, they could be seen \nreading a newspaper or magazine, or reading their mail or writing out \ntheir checks--anything but paying attention to what was happening on \nthe floor.\n  But I want to take this opportunity to stress that the Presiding \nOfficer has a most important, most fundamental responsibility to the \nSenate and to the people of the United States. The Presiding Officer is \nthe person who maintains the rules and the precedents of the Senate, \nand from these rules and precedents come the order, civility, and \ndecorum in the Senate. In his farewell speech to the Senate, in 1805, \nAaron Burr, who was Vice President, referred to the Senate Chamber as a \n``sanctuary.'' He said:\n\n       This House is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and \n     of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrenzy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.\n\n  This is the place where we, the Nation's lawmakers, come together to \ntalk to one another, to listen to one another respectfully, to learn, \nand to make our best case to the best of our ability.\n  Order and decorum are needed so that Senators may be properly \nrecognized, the clerk can hear and record the votes, and the people in \nthe galleries--the people who watch silently over our shoulders--can \nhear the debate. As I was sitting in the chair earlier today and \nwatching the people in the galleries, I thought: Here are the silent \nauditors. These are the people; sovereign rests in them. They come \nhere; they listen; they watch us; they watch over our shoulders.\n  And then my imagination carried me from the Atlantic to the Pacific, \nand I thought: Here are 284 million people represented in this body by \n100 men and women. What an honor, what a responsibility, what an \nopportunity. Order and decorum are needed if our different political \nparties are to work together in the best interests of our Nation and \nits people.\n  So as we conduct our business in front of the galleries and in front \nof the television cameras, we must keep in mind that the American \npeople are watching. They are watching us. They are the people who send \nus here. They are the people who pay our salaries. They are watching \nus. They are evaluating what we do and what we say, and they are \npondering not only what is being said but also the way we act. They are \nlooking over our shoulders. They are judging us.\n  Calling the U.S. Senate the ``citadel of liberty,'' Senate President \npro tempore-elect William King of Alabama pointed out that it is ``to \nthis body''--this body--``[that] the intelligent and virtuous, \nthroughout our widespread country, look with confidence for an \nunwavering and unflinching resistance to the encroachments of power.''\n  Think of that. The people look to us--the Senate in particular--to \nguard them, to guard their liberties, to guard their freedoms against \nthe encroachments of power from an overweening Executive.\n  Senator King then proceeded to explain:\n\n       To insure success . . . in the discharge of our high \n     duties, we must command the confidence and receive the \n     support of the people. Calm deliberations, courtesy toward \n     each other, order and decorum in debate, will go far, very \n     far, to inspire that confidence and command that support.\n\n  Now with the televising of Senate proceedings, we are being observed \nby teachers, by students around the country, by judges, by coal miners, \nby farmers, by members of legislatures, members of city councils, \nobserving and studying the legislative process. They are watching us. \nWe are being observed by millions of taxpayers in the kitchens, in the \nliving rooms. We are also being viewed by people around the world.\n\n  The U.S. Senate is the premier upper Chamber in the world today, and \nwe ought to keep it that and be proud of it. There are over 61 nations \nin the world that have bicameral legislative bodies. All the others \nhave unicameral legislatures. But the U.S. Senate and the Italian \nSenate are the only bicameral legislative bodies in the world today in \nwhich the upper chamber is not dominated by the lower chamber.\n  Furthermore, developing democracies are watching us for guidelines on\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\nhow a legislature operates in a representative republic, in a \ndemocratic republic.\n  It is imperative, therefore, that the U.S. Senate be seen as a model, \nand that the Presiding Officer be seen as a model Presiding Officer; \norder and decorum are essential to that objective. Order and decorum \nare established in the Senate rules. Of the 20 rules that the Senate \nfirst observed in 1789, many of them regulated order and decorum. Yet \nSenate rules, like order and decorum, I fear, are taken too much for \ngranted.\n  I am not the first Senator to express that concern. In 1866, Senator \nCharles Sumner of Massachusetts cautioned his colleagues that they had \nbecome so ``accustomed'' to the parliamentary rules that ``govern \nlegislative proceedings'' that they failed to recognize their \n``importance in the development of liberal institutions.'' These rules, \nhe maintained, ``are among the precious contributions which England has \nmade to modern civilization. . . . [They] have become a beautiful \nmachine by which business is conducted, legislation is molded, and \ndebate is secured in all possible freedom.'' These rules, he said in a \nphrase that I have always held dear, are ``the very temple of \nconstitutional liberty.''\n  Some years later, Vice President Adlai Stevenson reminded his \ncolleagues ``that the rules governing this body [the U.S. Senate] are \nfounded deep in human experience; that they are the result of centuries \nof tireless effort in [the] legislative hall, to conserve, to render \nstable and secure, the rights and liberties which have been achieved by \nconflict.''\n  Our English forebears wrested from tyrannical monarchs the power of \nthe purse and vested it in a body made up of the elected \nrepresentatives of the people, the House of Commons.\n  The parliamentary rules that ``govern legislative proceedings'' serve \nmany purposes. They perform many vital functions not only here in the \nSenate but also in our Government.\n  Arthur Onslow, whom Thomas Jefferson considered the ``ablest among \nthe Speakers of the [British] House of Commons,'' maintained ``that \nnothing tended more to throw power into the hands of administration . . \n. than a neglect of, or departure from, the rules of proceeding.''\n  We have seen that right here in this Senate.\n  ``By its rules the Senate wisely fixes the limits on its own power,'' \ndeclared Vice President Adlai Stevenson.\n  I have said this time, time, and time again, but this is Vice \nPresident Adlai Stevenson saying it this time: ``The right of amendment \nand of debate.'' The right of amendment and of debate, and how often in \nrecent years have we seen Senators denied these fundamental, basic \nrights: the right to debate and the right to amend?\n  ``Great evils often result,'' continued Vice President Stevenson, \n``from hasty legislation; rarely from the delay which follows full \ndiscussion and deliberation. In my humble judgment, the historic \nSenate--preserving the unrestricted right of amendment and of debate, \nmaintaining intact, the time-honored parliamentary methods and \namenities which unfailingly secure action after deliberation--possesses \nin our scheme of government a value which cannot be measured in \nwords.''\n  I would add, Mr. President, that it is the Senate rules which \nestablish the basis for order and decorum in the Senate.\n  In his ``Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate \nof the United States,'' Thomas Jefferson laid out strict rules for \nmaintaining order and decorum, including a provision that read:\n\n       No one [Senator] is to disturb another in his speech by \n     hissing, coughing, spitting, speaking, or whispering to \n     another, nor to stand up or interrupt him, nor to pass \n     between the Speaker and the speaking member, nor to go across \n     the house, or walk up and down it, or take books or papers \n     from the table, or write there.\n\n  That was Jefferson speaking.\n  The Senate has remained ever attentive to the need for order and \ndecorum, Mr. President. According to the Senate Historian's Office:\n\n       Persistent concern for the chronically disordered state of \n     floor activity in the early 1850s moved the Senate to \n     authorize construction of a new and larger chamber. The \n     chamber--\n\n  This Chamber into which the Senators moved in 1859--\n\n       included ample galleries and floor space, and--for the \n     first time--cloakrooms to which members could retire for \n     private conversation and writing.\n\n  Ergo, Mr. President, order and decorum are needed because in this \nChamber we are dealing with important, often controversial, national \nissues. We are dealing with precious issues that mean so much to the \npeople we represent and to the Nation's values.\n\n  Pressure is constantly building upon us with so much at stake in \nnearly everything we say and do. As tensions rise and pressures mount, \nit is essential that we maintain order and decorum as well as mutual \nrespect for one another. Only with respect for and obedience to the \nrules, especially those governing order and decorum, can the Senate \nfunction properly and effectively.\n  Without observance of these rules, events in the Senate can escalate, \nand have escalated, out of control. During the decade in which the \ncountry approached the Civil War, for example, antagonisms over the \ndifficult issues of the period flared, and so did tempers, and so did \ndisorder in the Chamber.\n  During a heated argument in 1850, Senator Henry Foote of Mississippi \nin the Old Senate Chamber just down the hall drew a pistol on Senator \nThomas Hart Benton of Missouri. In that same Chamber in 1856 came the \ncaning of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. In 1859, Senator \nWilliam Gain of California challenged Senator Henry Wilson of \nMassachusetts to a duel. In 1863, in this Chamber, William Salisbury of \nDelaware threatened to shoot the Sergeant at Arms. Several decades \nafter the Civil War, in a heated debate over a treaty, two South \nCarolina Senators got into a fight. Senator Benjamin Tillman and \nSenator John McLaurin, both of South Carolina, traded punches on the \nSenate floor.\n  We no longer draw pistols on each other, engage in fist fights, or \nthreaten to shoot the Sergeant at Arms, but for a long while I was \nseriously concerned about the decline of decorum in this body. In \nDecember 1995, I came to the floor and expressed my deep concern at the \ngrowing incivility in this Chamber. Senators were using what I call \n``gutter talk'' and ``fighting words'' that once could have led to fist \nfights or even duels.\n  Just last year, I complained of the lack of decorum that had \ndeveloped over the past few years. Having served in both Houses of the \nWest Virginia State Legislature, I pointed out that the decorum, the \norder within the House of Delegates of West Virginia and the West \nVirginia Senate, were far more to be desired than we would find in the \nUnited States Senate Chamber.\n  I was beginning to regret my role in helping to arrange the \ntelevising of Senate proceedings. I could not help but believe that the \ndecline in order and decorum fell to a large extent upon the Presiding \nOfficer, the burden of maintaining order and decorum. It is the Chair's \nresponsibility to maintain order in the Senate when disorder arises. It \nis the duty of the Chair, without being asked from the floor, without a \npoint of order being made from the floor, to maintain order and decorum \nin the Senate Chamber and in the galleries. When the Presiding Officer \nfails in the mission, he fails the Senate.\n\n  I often say to these new Members: Don't be afraid to use that gavel. \nHit the desk hard. Use that gavel. It is made of ivory. It won't crack. \nOnly once has the gavel been broken in more than two centuries of \ndebate in the Chamber. Just tapping is all right. It is all right just \nto tap the gavel if the pages are being a little noisy or if there are \ntwo or three Senators making a noise up here close and if the Chamber \nis not crowded with Senators. But when there are many Senators in the \nChamber, one needs to use that gavel.\n  I have been very proud of the way these new Senators use the gavel. \nThe Senate ladies here--I am an old-fashioned Senator; I still refer to \nmen as gentlemen and women as ladies--these female Senators use that \ngavel and they make themselves heard. And they are firm when they ask \nfor order. When they are presiding and they ask for order, they get it. \nThey make that gavel sound. They make the rafters ring with the sound \nof that gavel. When they ask for order, they get it. I daresay that \nmuch of the indecorous ways of the Senate from time to time\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\ncome about when the Presiding Officer is not paying attention to the \nfloor, is not enforcing the rule.\n  My how things have changed in the last few months with the Senate \nclass of 2000. I no longer see the Presiding Officers reading \nnewspapers or signing mail at that desk. They don't do it. They pay \nattention to the Senate. I have said to the Senators, if you are called \nupon to preside and you have letters to sign, beg off presiding for \nthat time. We can supply a new Presiding Officer. Don't go to the desk \nand sign your mail. People are watching you. What are they going to \nthink of you? What do the people in the galleries think of a Presiding \nOfficer who sits up there and reads the newspaper or looks at a \nperiodical?\n  Our new Senators, when presiding, are not reading the mail. They are \npaying attention to what is happening on the floor, and they are keenly \naware of what is going on. One quick look at them and you realize that \nthey take the responsibility of presiding over the Senate very \nseriously. They perform very professionally.\n  To these Senators who are presiding, the class of 2000, it is not \njust a chore that they must undertake as freshmen. It is a way to learn \neven more about the Senate, to watch and study the way it works and to \nlearn from it. And perhaps even more importantly, they recognize the \nimportance of the position in keeping the Senate operating and \nfunctioning properly.\n  These Senators are determined to keep order. They are not afraid to \npound the gavel to get order in the Senate. Even though they are \nfreshmen Senators, they will pound that gavel against more senior \nMembers when it is called for.\n  Just the other day I watched as one of the freshman Senators hammered \naway until he got absolute silence. That is the way it ought to be. I \nknow that sometimes a freshman Senator may hesitate to pound the gavel \nor to insist that a Senator of great seniority here takes his seat or \nstops talking. I know just how a freshman Senator feels because I once \nwas in that position as a new Senator. The Chair should pound that \ngavel. Make it crack. Make it be heard. Make it be heard until it is \nthe only noise in the Chamber.\n  Because of the efforts of these Presiding Officers to maintain order \nand decorum, I believe I have detected a Senator or two who would \nrespond with a rather shocked expression.\n\n  I have been in that chair and sought order, and I have had a few \nSenators look at me as though they wondered, who does this fellow think \nhe is? They will give the Chair an impudent stare, but as long as they \ncease their talking, perhaps the Chair will be done with that. But it \nis evident. We owe that Chair respect. We owe the gavel, the Presiding \nOfficer, respect. And the leaders can go a long way in helping to get \norder in this Senate if they, too, listen to the Chair; if they, too, \nwhen the Chair asks that the well be cleared, if they, too, will clear \nthe well, they will set a good example to other Senators.\n  This crop of Senators has not budged. They are not intimidated. They \nare determined to do their job. They are making a difference. They are \nrestoring a decorum to the Senate that was on the decline for too long. \nI thank them for their efforts.\n  Much to the surprise of many Senators, I am sure, there is a \nresolution No. 480 of the standing rules of the Senate. For those who \ndo not know this order, it requires Senators to vote from their \nassigned desks. It is there. It is not often enforced, but it can be \nenforced. I constantly vote from my chair. I try always to vote from my \nchair. Only a few vote from their desk. That is what Senators are \nsupposed to do, vote from their desk. I constantly observe Senators \ngoing into the well and milling around. As I have stated before, this \nmakes the Senate look more like the floor of the stock exchange than \nthe world's greatest deliberative body.\n  When I came here, there were giants in the Senate. I did not see the \ngiants of the Senate--Senators Everett Dirksen of Illinois, Styles \nBridges of New Hampshire, Richard Russell of Georgia, Stuart Symington \nof Missouri, Norris Cotton, George Aiken--get into the well and mill \naround. They may have walked through the well or they may have walked \nup to the desk and asked something about a vote, but they did not \ngather in the well and carry on long conversations. They sat in their \nseats or they moved to the back of the Chamber or moved outside the \nChamber. There are plenty of places where Senators can go to converse.\n  I know how it is. You come to the floor, we have been in committees. \nIt has been a while since you last saw a Senate colleague and we greet \nother Senators and we sometimes begin talking about the business of the \nSenate and we become oblivious to the fact there is being business \ntransacted. We become oblivious to the fact we are making a noise. I \nhave been the culprit in many instances. But once that Chair sounds the \ngavel and asks for order, I try to obey that Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there are plenty of places where Senators \ncan converse. Think how different it is on those occasions when \nSenators do vote from their seats. There is less noise and less chaos \nand voting goes so much faster. Think how impressive it is when the \nUnited States acts and votes in accordance with the standing rules and \norders of the Senate.\n  I want the American people to revere the Senate. If they respect this \nbody, they will have more respect for the laws that we enact. I am not \nsuggesting that it is the fault of the Presiding Officer when Senators \nfail to vote from their seats, but I must say that when I first came to \nthe Senate I watched the Senate. And even in escorting the Chaplain to \nthe podium at the opening of the Senate, daily, the way those \nSenators--the way the President pro tempore did that in those days was \nvery impressive. I watched Senator Richard Russell of Georgia escort \nthe Chaplain to the dais. Senator Russell did not walk up on that \nplatform with the Chaplain. Senator Russell paused on the step just \nbelow the platform, allowing the Chaplain to stand alone on the \nplatform.\n  I was really moved by this act. Senator Russell did not stand behind \nthe Chaplain. He did not stand beside the Chaplain, thus crowding the \nspace. He was not hovering over the Chaplain like an old hen watching \nover her chicks. Senator Russell remained out of the picture until the \nChaplain had finished. I kept thinking how proper that was. He was \ngiving the Chaplain the platform. This was God's moment, God's moment \nbefore the Senate, and the Presiding Officer was honoring and \nrespecting God's moment. That was class. By Senator Russell's actions, \nhe, too, was according proper homage to the Supreme Being. And people \nliked that. People liked that.\n  Nothing we do here in the Senate is more important than seeking the \nLord's blessing and paying our respects to the Creator. When the \nChaplain is before us--he may be a guest Chaplain of whatever faith--it \nis God's time. We should respect it. We should cherish it. We should \nhonor it as did the Presiding Officers in that day. The memory of how \nthat impressed me has been with me through the years so that always \nwhen I open the Senate I do it the way those Senators did it in those \ndays, now so long ago.\n  Back in 1990 I pointed out that:\n\n       [I]f something seems wrong with the Senate from time to \n     time, we, the members, might try looking into the mirror; \n     there, in all probability, we will see where the problem \n     lies. Those who weaken the Senate are members who, in one way \n     or another, bring discredit on the institution.\n\n  Those Members, I said, are the ones:\n\n       . . . who never quite understand the Senate [and lack] an \n     appreciation of its customs, its traditions, its rules and \n     precedents, and a pride in having been chosen to serve in it.\n\n  Only 1,864 men and women have served in this body. Today, more than a \ndecade later, I want to rephrase that point. Let me say that it is the \nMembers who try to understand the Senate, who try to gain an \nappreciation of its customs and traditions, its rules and precedents, \nand who take a pride in having been chosen to serve in the Senate--they \nare the ones who bring credit to the Senate. They are the Senators who \nwill keep the U.S. Senate as a model to the people of America and the \nworld.\n  In the few months that they have been here, the class of 2000 is \ndoing that. And, again, I salute them for it.\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator suspend?

Mr. President, the subject of election reform has been \ntalked about and discussed a great deal during the past 6 or 7 months. \nIn fact, there have already been more than 60 hearings this year in \nWashington and in the States.\n  I appreciate the attention that has been paid to this important \nissue, and commend my colleague on the Senate Rules Committee, Chairman \nDodd, for his attention to this issue.\n  I think we can all agree that America needs, wants, and demands \naction on election reform.\n  The Senate is in a strong position to act on this issue of tremendous \nnational importance, and in a refreshingly bipartisan manner. On \nelection reform, Republicans and Democrats agree on far more than we \ndisagree.\n  In fact, 90 senators agree that we need meaningful election reform.\n  Ninety Senators are cosponsoring either the bipartisan McConnell-\nSchumer-Torricelli election reform bill leading the election reform \npact with 70 Senators on board--38 Republicans, 31 Democrats, and one \nIndependent; the Democrats-only Dodd bill which has all Democrats and \none Independent as cosponsors but no Republicans; or the McCain bill--\nwhich has 2 cosponsors.\n  That means 90 Senators are cosponsoring legislation authorizing \nfederal funding to assist the 50 States in improving their election \nsystems. The McConnell-Schumer-Torricelli bill, the Dodd bill, and the \nMcCain bill all have funding in them for election reform. Federal \nfunding is the common denominator which brings the Senate together on \nthis critical issue and makes election reform possible for the American \npeople.\n  But no money has yet been appropriated for election reform. No \nelection reform money at all--not one thin dime--is yet in any \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  I think we can all agree that is unacceptable. We must have election \nreform money appropriated for fiscal year 2002. Otherwise, any \nauthorization which is passed later this fall will be all-show and no-\ngo, until subsequent appropriations are enacted.\n  If we do not appropriate election reform money in this round of \nappropriations--for fiscal year 2002--then election reform will be \ndelayed. Election reform would either be postponed until fiscal year \n2003, or be contingent upon an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill at some point.\n  Election reform delayed is election reform denied.\n  The Republican Leader, Senator Lott, had planned the election reform \ndebate in the Senate to occur during June. Senators Schumer, \nTorricelli, and I were ready to press ahead. The organizations \nsupporting our bill--including Common Cause and the League of Women \nVoters--were ready to do an all-out push for our election reform bill. \nObviously, that floor debate did not happen.\n\n  It is not clear now when election reform will pass the Senate in the \nform of an authorization bill. In any event, any authorization for \nFederal funding for new voting machines and other enhancements in \nelection systems will require that money be appropriated.\n  That is why I take the floor today, to announce my plan to pursue a \nmeaningful appropriation for election reform.\n  The McConnell-Schumer bill authorizes $500 million annually. The Dodd \nbill authorizes such sums as many be necessary.\n  While it may be nearly impossible to appropriate several hundred \nmillion dollars for the upcoming fiscal year, I do believe that we can \ncome together on both sides of the aisle to find an election reform \nappropriation that is possible and meaningful. Today, I am pledging my \ncommitment to do just that and calling on my colleagues on the Rules \nand Appropriations Committees to help me make this happen.\n  There will have to be an authorization mechanism later on to \ndetermine precisely who will administer the funds, how, to whom and for \nwhat. But we do know that the sum is substantial. And that time is \nrunning out to make a difference for the 2002 elections.\n  Senators on the Appropriations Committee have already demonstrated \ngreat enthusiasm for election reform with nearly all the Republicans \nand half the Democrats on my bill and all the Democrats on the Dodd \nbill.\n  If not successful at the committee stage in the appropriations \nprocess, I will offer an amendment on the floor at a suitable time.\n  One way or another, we need to make sure that the Senate will have \nthe election reform issue before it--sooner rather than later--in the \nform of the funding that is absolutely essential to make the McConnell-\nSchumer-Torricelli election reform bill, the Dodd bill, or the McCain \nbill work.\n  Let's appropriate election reform money for 2002. We can decide later \nwhich election reform bill will become law, who will hand out the \nmoney, and whether there will be Federal mandates.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Dodd on the Rules Committee \nand Senators Byrd and Stevens and my fellow members of the \nAppropriations Committee to ensure that this appropriations season does \nnot pass without setting aside funds for election reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8044-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nH.R. 2299, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2299) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Murray/Shelby amendment No. 1025, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Murray/Shelby amendment No. 1030 (to amendment No. 1025), \n     to enhance the inspection requirements for Mexican motor \n     carriers seeking to operate in the United States and to \n     require them to display decals.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1030\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the pending business is an \namendment by the Senator from Washington; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment. I will \nnot take very much time because I just discussed with the Senator from \nWashington an amendment we would have which we would propose, perhaps, \nas a second-degree amendment to the first-degree amendment of the \nSenator from Washington. But more importantly, we hope perhaps we can \nwork out an agreement in the areas in which we are in disagreement.\n  Over the weekend, I examined the language in the Transportation \nappropriations bill and our concerns about it. I do not think those \nconcerns are unbridgeable. So I would like to speak for just a few \nmoments. And hopefully we can discuss this issue and debate it and \nthen, if necessary, vote on the Murray amendment. If not, hopefully we \ncan work out some agreements which will achieve the goal we all seek.\n  The goal we all seek is simple: That Mexican trucks that are allowed \nto come into the United States of America, according to the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement--this is in compliance with the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. The United States has already been \nfound, by a panel, to be out of compliance with the North American Free \nTrade Agreement because of our failure to allow trucks\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\nthat originate in Mexico to come into the United States. What we need \nis a way they can come into the United States but that the American \npeople and the Mexican people will have the total and complete \nconfidence that every reasonable safety measure has been employed to \nprevent needless death on the highways of America. That is the goal we \nall seek.\n  As we know, the House has taken action, as part of the 2002 \nDepartment of Transportation appropriations bill, that would absolutely \nprevent the President of the United States from abiding by our NAFTA \nobligations. It stripped the bill of all funding intended to address \nmotor carrier safety issues along the southern border.\n  Second, it adopted an amendment to prohibit the approval of any \nMexican carriers to operate in this country. That amendment is a \nblanket prohibition. It is in direct violation of NAFTA, and it is \nwrong. It is discriminatory, and it must not prevail.\n  The Senate appropriations subcommittee, under the leadership of the \nSenator from Washington, has taken a different approach and one that I \nthink is very supportable in part but perhaps not entirely. The bill \nprovides significant funding to enable the Department of Transportation \nto hire and train more safety inspectors and investigators and to build \nmore inspection facilities at the southern border. I commend the \ncommittee for this action.\n  I have concerns, however, over a number of requirements included in \nthe bill that, if enacted without modification, could effectively \nprevent the opening of the border indefinitely. My concerns are shared \nby other colleagues, and those concerns are shared by the \nadministration.\n  The administration estimates that the Senate provisions would result \nin a further delay in opening the border for another 2 years or more. \nThis would be a direct violation of NAFTA. It effectively provides a \nblanket prohibition against allowing any Mexican motor carrier from \noperating beyond the commercial zones. And this is a view shared by a \nnumber of us, as well as the President's senior advisers.\n\n  By the way, the present state of play is that if the Mexican \nGovernment chose to--since the United States has been found to be in \nviolation of NAFTA--they could impose billions of dollars of sanctions \non United States goods. I hasten to add, I have seen no indication that \nthe Mexican Government wishes to take such action. Their object is to \ntry to get their carriers into the United States of America as agreed \nto under the NAFTA agreement.\n  As a leading sponsor of the 1999 legislation creating the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration, I strongly support proposals to \nadvance truck and bus safety. I recognize the Senate provisions are \nlargely intended to address safety concerns. Unfortunately, some of the \nprovisions' mandates simply are not achievable. The provisions are \noverly rigid and burdensome. The modifications, I believe, could go a \nlong way toward promoting motor carrier safety in a nondiscriminatory \nmanner.\n  At a later time, I will discuss a number of the concerns that I and \nothers and the administration have about the bill. I have some very \nspecific ideas as to how we can address these concerns. But at the \nmoment, since I believe we are in some active discussions, I will not \ntake the time of the Senate in going through all these specifics.\n  I will again point out that the administration, last Thursday, sent \nover a letter saying that the President had no choice but to veto the \nbill with the present provisions as contained in the Senate \nTransportation appropriations bill. I do not think the President wants \nto veto the Transportation appropriations bill. I do not want the \nPresident to do that, nor do a majority of the Members of the Senate.\n  But let me make it perfectly clear, the House action is totally \nunacceptable. I hope we can work with the Senator from Washington, and \nother interested Senators, particularly, I might say, with those who \nrepresent border States.\n  The majority of this traffic, initially, will be crossing, obviously, \nour southern borders. Already, our Canadian borders are open. Clearly, \nthat is not the issue. So those of us--Senator Gramm of Texas and I, \nand my colleague, Senator Kyl--and others who represent border States, \nwhere the majority of this commercial activity would take place, feel \nvery strongly about this issue.\n  I might say, also, we are the last ones--the last ones--who would \ncountenance a situation to prevail that would place the lives and \nproperty of our citizens in danger. It is across the southern border \nwhere most of this activity initially will take place, although I \nbelieve I will live to see the day when we will see basically open \ntransportation between Canada and Mexico.\n  As it has been a boon to the economy in Canada, so it can be across \nour southern border.\n  I hope we can deal with this issue in the ensuing hours. I understand \nthe Senator from Washington may be discussing this issue with the \nSecretary of Transportation. We encourage all Members to get involved \nin this issue. It is a very important one. We are not talking about a \npolicy dispute. I emphasize, we are talking about a solemn agreement \nthat was entered into between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. \nThat agreement called for certain safety conditions--which I believe we \ncan satisfy, in the view of most objective observers, satisfy the \nsafety issues--to come into compliance with the North American Free \nTrade Agreement and have the same situation prevail on our southern \nborder as prevails on our northern border, as the Senator from \nWashington has with Canada on her border.\n  The Senator from Texas and I would like to see the same situation \nprevail on our border that prevails on the border of the Senator from \nWashington with Canada.\n  I hope we can work it out. We believe this is a very serious and \nimportant issue because we are talking about treaty violations, \npossible sanctions against the United States of America. I am firmly \nconvinced that we can come to a reasonable conclusion and not have to \nhave this thing spill over into a very unfortunate situation where the \nPresident of the United States may have to veto it. I hope to avoid \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see my friend from Texas. I am going to \noffer an amendment so we have something to vote on this afternoon. If \nthe Senator from Texas wanted to speak first, how long is he going to \nspeak?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wasn't planning on speaking more than 5 \nor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I think it would be more convenient, because I need to talk \na little bit longer than that, if I yielded the floor to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as usual, our colleague from Nevada is kind \nand courteous and helpful to everybody. I appreciate his letting me \nspeak.\n  I wanted to come over today to join my friend and colleague, Senator \nMcCain from Arizona, to raise a concern about the provision in the \nTransportation appropriations bill that we believe will have the \npractical impact of making it impossible for a long period of time for \nus to conform to the agreement that we made with Mexico in NAFTA.\n  Let me make it clear that the Senator from Washington, the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, dramatically improved the \nwork done by the House. Even those of us who believe that her amendment \nwould be harmful and would abrogate our agreement with Mexico are \nconvinced that her work is a dramatic improvement over that of the \nHouse.\n  What we are trying to do is to simply work out an agreement where we \ncan meet legitimate safety standards with regard to Mexican trucks, do \nit in a way that allows us to meet the obligations that we have under \nNAFTA, and do it in such a way to try to keep out any provisions that \nmay be cloaked in some garb of safety, when in reality they represent \nan effort to prevent the implementation of our agreement.\n  I understand Senator McCain has given the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman a copy of the amendment. I don't see any reason that this \nshould be or has to be a partisan issue. I am hopeful we can work out \nan agreement.\n  Let me explain why it is so important that such an agreement be \nreached and why I feel so strongly\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nabout it. We entered into the most far-reaching trade agreement of the \nlast 20 years when we signed a free trade agreement that encompassed \nNorth America--Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Part of that free \ntrade agreement had to do with the ability of trucks to operate within \nthe free trade area. President Clinton was very slow in implementing \nthe agreement, and many people believe that politics was behind that \nslowness in implementation.\n  We are now on the verge of seeing the agreement implemented. We are \nhearing great protests about safety. In that debate, a lot of points \nhave been made that, when you actually look at the facts, are not borne \nout by the facts.\n  Let me give an example. First of all, the good news story with regard \nto Mexican trucks is that a significant amount of inspection is already \noccurring so that when we supplement that to deal with trucks that will \ncome to the interior of the country, we have something on which to \nbuild.\n  For example, there are 8 million U.S. registered trucks. Last year, \nthere were 2.3 million inspections and so, therefore, about 29 percent \nof all American trucks were inspected. There are 63,000 Mexican trucks \ncurrently operating in the United States, and 46,000 inspections took \nplace last year involving Mexican trucks. Therefore, roughly 73 percent \nof Mexican trucks were inspected last year, over twice the percentage \nof American trucks that were inspected.\n  Some people have used the number, in sort of scare tactics, that only \nabout 1 percent of Mexican trucks were inspected. In trying to figure \nout where on earth that number could have possibly come from, the best \nI can figure out is that the people who made up that number simply took \nthe number of border crossings, 4.6 million, and used that as a measure \nof Mexican trucks.\n  The plain truth is, Mexican trucks are now operating within a 20-mile \nlimit, 20 miles from the border. They often cross the border many times \nduring the day. That is the only place I can figure this number came \nfrom.\n  Let me make it clear that Senator McCain and I are concerned about \nsafety. First of all, both of us already have Mexican trucks operating \nin our States. Our States are working now to see that those trucks are \nsafe. The commitment of the President to get the Federal Government \ninvolved in the process is welcomed from our point of view. We believe \nit is important that Mexican trucks be safe, that they have trained \ndrivers, that they have good equipment, and that that equipment be well \nmaintained.\n  We are for safety. We are not for protectionism. We are not for using \nsafety concerns as a ruse for not living up to the commitment that we \nmade in NAFTA.\n  In addition, we are concerned about a process whereby this provision, \nboth the House provision and the Senate provision, is occurring on \nappropriations bills, not in the committees that have jurisdiction over \nthis area. It is a very dangerous precedent when we are starting to \namend trade agreements as riders to appropriations bills.\n  Having said all that, Senator McCain and I and others have put \ntogether an amendment that we believe deals with legitimate safety \nconcerns. We have put together an amendment where every truck coming \ninto the United States from Mexico would be inspected. But it is not an \namendment that will guarantee that for at least 2 years we will not be \nable to implement the trade agreement. Basically what we are trying to \ndo is to implement a workable program where the level of safety \nrequired at the border, at least initially, with regard to Mexican \ntrucks will be far greater than the requirements we currently have for \nCanadian trucks.\n  Not every truck coming into the United States from Canada is \ninspected. We proposed that we have an inspection of every Mexican \ntruck, that that inspected truck then be licensed with a decal, and \nthat it be periodically inspected. I believe the Senator from Arizona \nhas given us a workable way of dealing with legitimate safety concerns \nwithout effectively abrogating our trade agreement with Mexico.\n  I know there are strong special interests that don't want to \nimplement this agreement. But it is very important for us to remember \nin the Senate that all over the world today other legislative bodies \nare debating whether to live up to agreements they have made with the \nUnited States of America. Other legislative bodies are meeting at this \nvery moment, trying to decide whether to implement an agreement they \nmade with the United States that may not at that very moment, or this \nvery moment, be politically popular in their country.\n  It seems to me that since we are the world's biggest beneficiary of \ntrade, we are the world's largest exporter and importer of goods and \nservices by a huge margin, it is important we live up to the letter and \nthe spirit of our trade agreements so that we can have moral standing \nin dealing with countries that do not live up to their agreements with \nus.\n  So, in a time when all over the world similar agreements are being \ndebated, it is very important in dealing with our neighbor to the south \nthat we live up to the agreement we have made. I do not believe the \nHouse provision lives up to that agreement. I think there are very real \nproblems with the current bill. I think Senator McCain has offered an \namendment that provides safety but does not create problems that will \ndelay implementation beyond legitimate requirements of safety. I hope \nthis can be worked out. But the NAFTA agreement is an important \nagreement. It is vital to my State, vital to the country, and I cannot \nimagine, if we can't work this out, that we would want to move forward \nwith this bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at the language that has been \nproposed. We are not saying this is the only way it has to be done or \nwe are not going to be satisfied. We have simply raised some concerns \nwith the current bill. I am hopeful in working together with the \nadministration that we can reach a compromise. It will hardly serve \nanybody's purpose to pass a bill that the President will veto and we \nwill have to start all over again.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Some propose significantly increasing \n     radioactive material transport.\n       (4) Approximately 261,000 people were evacuated across the \n     Nation because of rail-related accidental releases of \n     hazardous chemicals between 1978 and 1995, and during that \n     period industry reported 8 transportation accidents involving \n     the small volume of high level radioactive waste transported \n     during that period.\n       (5) The Federal Railroad Administration has significantly \n     decreased railroad inspections and has allocated few \n     resources since\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\n     1993 to assure the structural integrity of railroad bridges. \n     Train derailments have increased by 18 percent over roughly \n     the same period.\n       (6) The poor condition of highway, railway, and waterway \n     infrastructure, increases in the volume of hazardous chemical \n     transport, and proposed increases in radioactive material \n     transport increase the risk of accidents involving such \n     chemicals and materials.\n       (7) Measuring the risks of hazardous chemical or \n     radioactive material accidents and preventing such accidents \n     requires specific information concerning the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes contemplated \n     for such transport to inform and enable investment in related \n     infrastructure.\n       (8) Mitigating the impact of hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transportation accidents requires \n     skilled, localized, and well-equipped emergency response \n     personnel along all specifically identified transportation \n     routes.\n       (9) Accidents involving hazardous chemical or radioactive \n     material transport pose threats to the public health and \n     safety, the environment, and the economy.\n       (b) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall, in \n     consultation with the Comptroller General of the United \n     States, conduct a study of the hazards and risks to public \n     health and safety, the environment, and the economy \n     associated with the transportation of hazardous chemicals and \n     radioactive material.\n       (c) Matters To Be Addressed.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall address the following matters:\n       (1) Whether the Federal Government conducts individualized \n     and detailed evaluations and inspections of the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes for the \n     current, and any anticipated or proposed, transport of \n     hazardous chemicals and radioactive material, including \n     whether resources and information are adequate to conduct \n     such evaluations and inspections.\n       (2) The costs and time required to ensure adequate \n     inspection of specific transportation routes and related \n     infrastructure and to complete the infrastructure \n     improvements necessary to ensure the safety of current, and \n     any anticipated or proposed, hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transport.\n       (3) Whether Federal, State, and local emergency \n     preparedness personnel, emergency response personnel, and \n     medical personnel are adequately trained and equipped to \n     promptly respond to accidents along specific transportation \n     routes for current, anticipated, or proposed hazardous \n     chemical and radioactive material transport.\n       (4) The costs and time required to ensure that Federal, \n     State, and local emergency preparedness personnel, emergency \n     response personnel, and medical personnel are adequately \n     trained and equipped to promptly respond to accidents along \n     specific transportation routes for current, anticipated, or \n     proposed hazardous chemical and radioactive material \n     transport.\n       (5) The availability of, or requirements to establish, \n     information collection and dissemination systems adequate to \n     provide the public, in an accessible manner, with timely, \n     complete, specific, and accurate information (including \n     databases) concerning actual, proposed, or anticipated \n     shipments by highway, railway, or waterway of hazardous \n     chemicals and radioactive materials, including accidents \n     involving the transportation of such chemicals and materials \n     by those means.\n       (d) Deadline for Completion.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall be completed not later than six months after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report.--Upon completion of the study under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     study.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just left a hearing of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure. In fact, the hearing is still going on. Senators \nVoinovich and Inhofe are there completing the hearing.\n  At the hearing today, we had four mayors of very important cities in \nAmerica--the mayor of New Orleans, Mayor Marc Morial; the mayor or \nAtlanta, Mayor Campbell; the mayor of Las Vegas, Mayor Goodman; and the \nmayor of the District of Columbia, Mayor Williams. The purpose of the \nhearing is to talk about the decaying infrastructure of our country, \nespecially in our urban areas.\n  It is tragic--``tragic'' is not too powerful a word to describe what \nthey have talked about. We have all kinds of problems. The mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia--the Federal city--talked about water pipes that \ncarry water that are over 100 years old. Some of them are wooden. The \nmayor of Atlanta said they have pipes over 100 years old. He said most \nmayors are term limited, and their desire is: Please, let me make it \nthrough my term and leave the problem to somebody else. They do not \nhave the money to handle the problems facing American cities.\n  The tunnel we have all seen so often in the news in the past 5 days \nor 6 days--actually, it was Wednesday at 3 o'clock that the derailment \ntook place in the tunnel in Baltimore. That tunnel is a mile and a half \nlong. It is 100 years old. So that tunnel was created through that area \nin about 1900. What kind of equipment did they have then? Most of it \nwas done by hand; very little machinery was available for digging a \ntunnel around the turn of the century. That tunnel has had almost \nnothing done to it since then. It is the same tunnel.\n  This amendment is on behalf of myself, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator \nMikulski. It is an amendment to protect against the dangers posed by \nthe transportation of hazardous substances. The amendment requires the \nSecretary of the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the \nComptroller General of the United States, to study the risk to the \npublic health and safety associated with the transportation of these \ndangerous substances.\n  My amendment requires the Department of Transportation and the \nGeneral Accounting Office to study whether our transportation system \ncan safely transport these dangerous substances and ask how it might \nimprove the safety track record.\n  If you read my amendment, you will see a number of interesting \nthings. The volume of hazardous chemical transport has increased by \nover one-third in the last 25 years and is expected to continue. \nApproximately 261,000 people were evacuated across this Nation because \nof rail-related accidents during the past 20 years--no, that is not in \nthe last 20 years. It is from the period of 1978 to 1995--less than 20 \nyears. So 261,000 people were evacuated from their homes because of \nrail-related accidents.\n  During that period, the industry reported eight transportation \naccidents involving small volumes of high-level radioactive waste \ntransported during that period.\n  The Federal Railroad Administration has significantly decreased \nrailroad inspections and has allocated few resources since 1993 to \nassure the structural integrity of railroad bridges.\n  One of the mayors today testified that 70 percent of the bridges in \nAmerica won't meet basic safety standards--70 percent of the bridges. \nMaybe he is 10 percent wrong. Maybe it is only 60 percent; maybe it is \n80 percent. We know there are bridges in America today where \nschoolbuses stop and let the kids walk across, and the bus will come \nover and pick them up. We have all kinds of trouble with our \ninfrastructure in America today. We need to do something about it, and \nthat is what this amendment is all about.\n  It is saying let's at least have some knowledge of what is out there \nwhen we are seeing these treks of very hazardous materials. As you \nknow, in Baltimore, which we all saw, the substance there was \nhydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is extremely dangerous. One of the \nimportant things was that it was far enough away from people that it \nwasn't an immediate danger. Had the accident occurred closer to the \npopulated area, of course, it would have been.\n  I can remember a number of years ago being in Ely, NV, a rural part \nof the State of Nevada. One of the men I went to high school with was a \npolice officer there. I always tried to stop him when I came through \nEly. He has since retired. I was in the police station and a teletype \ncame through and he looked at it and said: Why do they even send me \nthis stuff? They were telling him there was a transport of hazardous \nmaterials coming through Ely. His point was: So what. I could not do \nanything about it. The only thing that telling me about it does is \nfrighten me. We have no ability to respond to a chemical accident \nspilled in Ely, NV.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important question: How can the \nDepartment of Transportation and the General Accounting Office--we know \nhow they can and they should--study the ability of personnel to respond \nto transportation accidents involving dangerous substances?\n  My friend, the police officer in Ely, NV, did what most police \nofficers in rural America would do: They throw the report away. They \ncannot do anything about it. In fact, Rick said he would rather not \nknow. All it does is frighten him.\n  While emergency response teams might be equipped and available in\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\nurban areas such as Baltimore--that was interesting. That occurred so \nthey had the ability--and we may hear further from Senators Sarbanes \nand Mikulski--that was a great deal of teamwork among county, city, \nState, and Federal officials in one of our metropolitan areas. They did \npretty well from what I can tell.\n  How prepared are the small rural communities in Nevada? How well \nprepared are the small rural communities in Nebraska, the State of \nWashington, all over America? They are not very well prepared.\n  What resources do they need to protect against the danger of a \nhazardous accident? I have to say candidly that this is not just a \nrural America problem; it is a major city problem also. But I guess the \nanswer to both my questions is, we really do not know. We have no idea. \nThat is why this study is important.\n  Finally, my amendment instructs DOT and GAO to evaluate the way we \ncommunicate with the public about accidents involving dangerous \nsubstances. As chairman of this subcommittee I talked about earlier, I \nam confident we are going to have to develop information, as I told the \nfour mayors, and we also had the manager of the port authority there \nand somebody from the General Accounting Office--I told those people \nassembled today that we need to be aware of what is wrong with our \ninfrastructure. It is time they were more forceful and told us what is \nwrong with our infrastructure.\n  I also told them this is the first of a number of hearings. We have \nto start identifying what is wrong with the infrastructure. Senator \nVoinovich talked about a 1981 study which showed the problems with our \ninfrastructure. Shortly after that, there were statements about the \nproblems of our decaying infrastructure, but we have done nothing about \nit. Literally, we have done nothing, except as a Federal Government \ngiving cities and States more responsibilities, these unfunded mandates \nthey talked about today. We give them the responsibility, but we do not \njoin with them in true partnership to help pay for these things.\n  Some will say these are not national problems; why should the Federal \nGovernment be involved? They are national problems. Our decaying \ninfrastructure is a national problem. Our water systems--the mayor of \nNew Orleans indicated that the city of New Orleans is basically in a \nbasin and they are pumping every minute of every day to keep the water \nfrom inundating this beautiful city. They have 100 pumping stations in \nNew Orleans. The pumps are 100 years old--100 years old. Those pumps \nwere put there at the beginning of the last century. The mayor of \nAtlanta said the life expectancy of modern pumps is about 40 years. \nThis is a patchwork network, to say the least, in one of our great \ncities of America, pumping every day, every hour, with pumps 100 years \nold.\n  As events in Baltimore over the last few days have shown us, the need \nto have an investigation about whether we can transport these dangerous \nsubstances is something we certainly need to talk about. I expect my \ncolleagues from Maryland will provide accounts of the train derailment \nthat crippled Baltimore.\n  I have an article from the Baltimore Sun which gives a day-by-day \nblow of how this terrible accident played out in the Baltimore area. It \nis very scary that more people were not hurt and there was not more \ndamage done. The damage is significant. I do not know how much it will \nwind up costing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Baltimore Sun, \nJuly 21, Saturday, Final Edition, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 21, 2001]\n\n                          Chemical Train Fire\n\n                           (By Dan Fesperman)\n\n       The first sign of trouble was an unsettling rumble from \n     beneath the streets, a trembling, grinding sensation that \n     lasted several seconds.\n       Dan Stone felt it on the fifth floor of the cast-iron \n     building he owns at 300 W. Pratt St. In a tavern downstairs, \n     manager Christine Groller felt it, too, believing it was an \n     earthquake.\n       It wasn't like that for Chad Cadden, but he was in a tunnel \n     some 30 feet underground, the engineer of a thrumming diesel \n     hauling 60 freight cars of paper, chemicals, wood pulp, soy \n     oil, bricks and steel north to New Jersey.\n       Cadden felt the train lurch, then a light flashed on the \n     instrument panel--the pneumatic control indicator--signaling \n     that the emergency brakes were on. The train groaned to a \n     halt in the darkness. Something had gone wrong.\n       It was 3:07 Wednesday afternoon, and an exhausting drama of \n     fire, flood, worry and disruption had begun to unfold beneath \n     the heart of Baltimore. At its south end, thousands of \n     baseball fans sat unaware, watching the final innings of an \n     Orioles loss. At its north end, more than a mile and half \n     away, the manager of a high-rise apartment building watched a \n     plume of black smoke unfurl past the 11th floor, wondering if \n     her longtime fears were about to be confirmed.\n       Soon, both ends of the tunnel would be cloaked by rolling \n     black smoke. Because of it, the fire would yield its secrets \n     stubbornly, and for an entire night there would be just \n     enough mystery to trigger Civil Defense sirens and fears of a \n     toxic disaster, while fire companies fought a two-front war \n     against an enemy they could neither see nor understand.\n       But that wasn't all. A water main just above the tunnel \n     would burst three hours after the derailment, gushing so much \n     water that the level of Druid Hill Reservoir would drop 3 \n     feet in four hours.\n       Only by sundown of the next day would the consequences seem \n     clearer--a derailed tanker car leaking hydrochloric acid, \n     several downtown buildings flooded by a torrent of 60 million \n     gallons, enough broken telecommunications lines to disrupt e-\n     mail around the world, two postponed Orioles baseball games \n     (and another yesterday), and enough downtown gridlock to \n     produce a year's worth of headaches and missed appointments.\n       Yet, for all the smoke and bother, not a single life would \n     be lost, pending the unforeseen discovery of anyone who might \n     have hopped aboard an empty boxcar. In this disaster, for \n     once, every member of the cast would come out alive. But not \n     without a few second thoughts about what might have been, had \n     their luck turned for the worse.\n\n\n                         3:07: The earth moves\n\n       It takes only a crew of two to run a freight train. The \n     engineer mans the controls of the diesel engines while the \n     conductor generally operate the brake, calls out passing \n     signals and maintains the waybill, which carries the \n     information of what's on board.\n       Cadden, 27, of Stewartstown, Pa., and conductor Edward \n     Brown, 52, of West Baltimore, had just boarded the train a \n     few minutes earlier, six miles short of the tunnel during a \n     crew change at Curtis Bay. If there was trouble ahead you \n     wouldn't expect to encounter it in the tunnel, as straight a \n     stretch of railway as you'll find on the CSX route through \n     the city.\n       A signal just before the tunnel indicated the track ahead \n     was clear, so the train continued. It was 3:04, and the train \n     was lumbering along at just over 20 mph, black exhaust \n     snorting from three engines at the front.\n       Looming to the left were the grandstands and warehouse of \n     Camden Yards. The train entered the tunnel, its four \n     headlights on, accelerating on a slight downgrade to about 23 \n     mph before beginning the long, slow climb on the gradual rise \n     beneath Howard Street.\n       That's when Stone and Groller were at work, in the building \n     just above the tunnel at Howard and Pratt streets. And at \n     3:07, the earth moved.\n       ``It seemed to be a grinding noise and a grinding \n     sensation,'' Stone said. ``I've been here for 11 years, and \n     I've never felt anything like it.''\n       ``It lasted maybe 10 seconds,'' Groller said. ``I honestly \n     thought it was an earthquake.''\n       Cadden and Brown weren't sure what to think, according to \n     federal transportation officials who interviewed them. There \n     was the lurch, then the flashing indicator, then the stopping \n     of the train. Black fumes were everywhere, but that's often \n     the case when three engines are running in a tunnel.\n       They tried to radio the CSX dispatcher, but no luck, \n     probably because they were underground. Cadden used his cell \n     phone, reaching the train master. It was 3:15. They were \n     still unaware of the brewing disaster to their rear.\n       With the fumes growing worse. they shut down two engines, \n     then uncoupled all three from their cargo. and drove them out \n     the tunnel's north end underneath the high roof of the old \n     Mount Royal Station at the foot of Bolton Hill. Now the \n     radio worked and they reached the dispatcher. It was 3:25.\n       By then they'd begun checking the waybill, reviewing what \n     they'd left behind. And that's what troubled them when they \n     began to notice the black smoke pouring out of the tunnel. \n     Something was on fire, and it might be anything from paper to \n     toxic chemicals.\n\n\n                          4:15: no false alarm\n\n       Seven blocks away, on the other side of Bolton Hill, Capt. \n     James Smith, 34, sat in the firehouse for Engine Co. 13, at \n     405 McMechen St.\n       A call came in: smoke pouring from the train tunnel. Ho \n     hum. Probably yet another panicky person who'd seen diesel \n     fumes, a common concurrence. But when the truck pulled \n     beneath the Mount Royal shed at 4:15 p.m., Smith said, the \n     volume of smoke made it clear this was no false alarm.\n       ``That,'' Smith said, ``knocked it up a notch.''\n\n\n                          ``it's the tunnel''\n\n       A block away, Elaine Macklin wondered what all the fuss was \n     about. As resident\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n     manager for 21 years of the high-rise Sutton Place \n     Apartments, it's been her job to find out such things, and \n     the sirens were blowing. She, too, was familiar with the \n     frequent false alarms, but she'd read enough newspaper \n     stories about the sort of cargo that came and went on those \n     tracks to wonder if one day a call might be for real.\n       ``I just had a feeling,'' said Macklin, 72. Years ago, \n     she'd told her three scoffing children, ``Someday, something \n     will happen in that tunnel.''\n       Now, after more than two decades of living and working next \n     door, that day had come. But she didn't know until she rode \n     an elevator to an empty apartment on the 11th floor for a \n     better look. She was joined by her longtime assistance, \n     Patricia Stanitski, who said: ``The school's on fire,'' \n     referring to the old Mount Royal Station, which houses part \n     of the Maryland Institute, College of Art.\n       ``No,'' Macklin said, watching the smoke rise part the top \n     floor. ``It's the tunnel.''\n       She hoped there was nothing hazardous burning.\n\n\n                         a foray into darkness\n\n       Chief Terry Ryer wondered the same thing when he heard the \n     call go out to Engine Co. 13.\n       Ryer, 49, was listening to the radio at the firehouse in \n     Brooklyn, where he commands the 6th Battalion, with its \n     hazardous materials squad.\n       It was a later part of the call that sent him into action. \n     Not only had a train possibly derailed, but hazardous \n     materials might be involved. Ryer opened his office door and \n     told the firefighters relaxing in the bay to stand ready. \n     Less than a minute later they got the call.\n       The son of a city firefighter, Ryer, like his dad, signed \n     on for duty at age 18, so he's been around long enough to \n     know that some fires aren't the sort that should be rushed \n     into, and this sounded like just such a fire.\n       Captain Smith was discovering that firsthand. He and three \n     others were the first to enter the tunnel. Within a few feet \n     they were submerged in darkness. Each wore 80 pounds of \n     equipment, picking his way across rail ties, chunky stones \n     and the rails themselves. They talked to each other, \n     touching, anything to keep from separating in the blackness, \n     while wondering what would happen if the fire suddenly \n     intensified. They weren't even sure what was burning.\n       A situation like this ran counter to almost all their \n     training, which teaches them to constantly be aware of \n     ``escape routes'' and ``safety zones.''\n       ``In a dwelling fire,'' Smith said, ``you're usually never \n     more than 12 feet from a window or some stair, a door, a \n     ladder. This really played with your mind. . . . We were \n     concerned it may have been a caustic (substance).\n       They made it a hundred yards, at most, before agreeing to \n     back out. A second attempt also failed.\n       By then, news media were gathering at both ends of the \n     tunnel, and the word going out wasn't good. Chemicals, \n     including three types of acid, were on board, and no one knew \n     yet what was in all that black smoke. The Orioles had just \n     canceled the second game of their day-night doubleheader.\n       At Sutton Place, Macklin tried to calm the tenants, though \n     most didn't seem too concerned. Then, in walked seven \n     firefighters in full gear, fanning out floor by floor to tell \n     everyone to shut their windows and stay indoors.\n       Miles to the southeast, somewhere near the Bay Bridge, \n     Mayor Martin O'Malley was on his way home from the annual J. \n     Millard Tawes Crab and Clambake in Crisfield, talking on the \n     phone with officials who were trying to assess the situation. \n     Police had shut down Howard Street, rerouting traffic, with \n     cars stacked up all over downtown. Civil Defense sirens \n     sounded the alarm, blasting like some warning from the Cold \n     War.\n       But what was burning? Nobody had the answer. Nor did anyone \n     know that the city's problems were about to get worse.\n\n\n                       6:15: Howard Street flood\n\n       It was 6:30 when Dan Stone, who'd felt that first troubling \n     rumble beneath his feet more than three hours earlier, \n     noticed something new happening outside his office at Pratt \n     and Howard Streets.\n       Water was coming down Howard Street. Buckets of it. Barrels \n     of it. Rivers of it. Something else had erupted underground, \n     and on meters at city reservoirs the event announced itself \n     like a blip on a seismograph.\n       It had happened at 6:15, almost certainly due to the fire. \n     A water main nearly 3\\1/2\\ feet in diameter burst, blowing \n     open a jagged hole several feet long. Darrell Owens, 41, a \n     supervisor for west-side maintenance with the city's \n     Department of Public Works, was the first to arrive at the \n     scene.\n       Owens thought he'd seen it all--burst mains creating huge \n     sinkholes that devoured city blocks; urban streets raging \n     like canyons in a flash flood. But this was a new one--a \n     flood on top of a fire.\n       ``It was a swimming pool, two, three and a half feet \n     deep.'' Fire hydrants were submerged. A block away, the \n     torrent swamped the first floor of the Prudential Securities \n     Building.\n       Deb and Paul Pelaia, meanwhile, had left Lombard and Howard \n     streets a few minutes earlier.\n       As guests from Thomasville, Pa., staying at the Holiday \n     Inn, they were beginning to wonder what they'd gotten into by \n     visiting Baltimore. Deb had come for a three-day nursing \n     conference. Paul came along for a boat cruise and an Orioles \n     game.\n       What they got instead was a front-row seat at an urban \n     disaster. The Holiday Inn overlooked the flood, itself \n     perhaps 30 feet above the derailed and burning train. \n     Already, Paul's baseball game had been canceled. The bus that \n     was to take them to the harbor cruise got stuck in traffic. \n     So, they walked to the Inner Harbor, wondering at the smoke \n     pouring from manholes.\n       During their cruise on the Bay Lady, word of the flood \n     spread. Someone said they'd heard the Holiday Inn was closed. \n     The boat returned to find the Coast Guard had closed the \n     Inner Harbor, and docked instead at Pier 5. It was 10 p.m., \n     but traffic was still bumper to bumper, and the bus had to \n     drop them off short of the hotel--still open after all--\n     because of the river in the street. They returned to their \n     room to find water in the tap running brown, at low pressure. \n     Welcome to Charm City.\n\n\n                        white smoke raises fears\n\n       At the ends of the tunnels, where news of the water main \n     break was a little slower in arriving, the first effects of \n     the flood were cause for alarm.\n       One thing firefighters always pay attention to is the color \n     of the smoke, and suddenly the smoke had gone from black to \n     white. Did it mean something toxic was on fire? The answer \n     was the same as before. No one knew.\n       However, readings taken by the Maryland Department of the \n     Environment soon put fears to rest. It was steam, caused by \n     water from the burst main. Fire crews asked Owens to leave \n     the line open. Used to simply shutting things off as soon as \n     possible, he was now faced with an unenviable assignment akin \n     to that of a basketball player asked to guard a high-scoring \n     superstar: You can't stop it, you can only hope to contain \n     it. He said he'd do what he could.\n\n\n                        third try, first contact\n\n       Within a few hours more, it was time for firefighters to \n     make a third attempt to reach the train from the north end. \n     The south end was out of the question due to flooding. \n     Captain Smith and Chief Ryer were on the team of six men. So \n     was Dan MacFarlane, 32, another member of Smith's Engine Co. \n     13.\n       By now, their faces were blackened by soot and they knew \n     what to expect. This time they rode in slowly on a CSX truck \n     equipped with railway wheels. Each man took two oxygen \n     bottles, a 70-minute supply. After a while, the truck stopped \n     and four of the six set out on foot, flashlights pointed at \n     their feet to light the way. Over the radio, someone at the \n     mouth of the tunnel called out the elapsed time every five \n     minutes. It took a half-hour to go 2,200 feet, Ryer said.\n       MacFarlane was ready to give up. ``We're going to pull \n     out,'' he radioed. But they took two more steps, and \n     firefighter Pat Hoban, just in front of MacFarlane and Smith, \n     touched the first boxcar. Contact. It wasn't much, but they'd \n     take it. Now the work of removing the train cars could begin.\n\n\n                        ``Mom, you were right''\n\n       Fourteen floors above, in her apartment at Sutton Place, \n     Elaine Macklin was ready to turn in at midnight after an \n     uneasy night of watching TV news accounts, windows shut \n     tight.\n       All of downtown was sealed up. You could leave, but you \n     couldn't come back. Police had closed every major road. \n     Helping lessen the sense of isolation, Macklin had heard by \n     telephone from friends and family, some of whom called after \n     radio and TV stations reported that Sutton Place was being \n     evacuated. Officials were standing by to move residents to \n     cots in the Baltimore Convention Center, but never did.\n       The most satisfying call came from her son Victor, 45, a \n     television producer in California. He'd seen the news on CNN. \n     ``He said, `Mom, you were absolutely right. You told us 21 \n     years ago something would happen in that tunnel.' ''\n       Perhaps by morning, she hoped, everything would be fixed. \n     But she arose Thursday to see white smoke still rising from \n     the tunnel. When she walked close to her living room window, \n     she could smell it.\n\n\n                          thank mother nature\n\n       A few blocks south, at the Holiday Inn, the Pelaias and \n     other lodgers saw that the impromptu hotel ``swimming pool'' \n     was finally under control. Owens and public works crews had \n     contained it, digging a hole in the street that exposed the \n     ruptured pipe. Water was still dumping into the tunnel.\n       Overnight, a new guest had checked into the hotel. It was \n     Dan Stone, who hadn't wanted to desert his building at Pratt \n     and Howard streets. Water in the basement had peaked at 9 \n     feet by 11 p.m., when city workers began pumping it out. He \n     hadn't reached the hotel until 4:20 a.m.\n       Other workers, meanwhile, were just beginning to head home \n     as the new day's rush hour began, ending shifts that had \n     continued while the rest of the city slept. Ryer got home at \n     6:30 a.m., Smith and MacFarlane around 8. Owens made it by \n     9:30. But for all of the night's heroes, one of the more \n     unsung ones might have been Mother Nature, in the form of a \n     geological stroke of luck.\n       Since the first hour of the derailment, hydrochloric acid \n     had been leaking from one of the tanker cars. Yet, there \n     hadn't been a single problem with air or water flowing from \n     the spot. The possible reason, according to state \n     environmental officials, was the limestone bedrock beneath \n     the tunnel. Being an\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\n     alkali, it reacts with acid sort of like water with fire, \n     neutralizing its caustic nature.\n\n\n                         day 2: a new strategy\n\n       The fire, while still burning, no longer seemed an imminent \n     threat to blow into an environmental disaster. By late \n     afternoon, a firefighting force that had peaked at 150 was \n     down to 50. Not that their jobs were getting much easier.\n       Some boxcars had already been removed from the tunnel. \n     Others would soon follow. But some were still baking at 400 \n     degrees, and smoke still poured from the north end. The next \n     day, two men--a state official and a chemical consultant--\n     were overcome by smoke.\n       But it was on Thursday afternoon that the firefighters \n     hatched a new strategy. Dan Stone got a preview of it from \n     his office, when three firemen asked if there might be an \n     entrance to the tunnel through his building. There wasn't, \n     but they eventually found another: through a manhole, where \n     they poked a hose to douse the fire's midsection. It was also \n     the entry point for hazardous waste crews that pumped \n     hydrochloric acid from the leaking tanker.\n       Outnumbering fire crews by then were street crews, digging \n     into the pavement five blocks east of Howard Street to lay \n     new fiber-optic cable. Lines near or through the tunnel had \n     been damaged or destroyed, disrupting e-mail. Internet and \n     phone service from Baltimore to New York to Africa.\n\n\n                           Sorting out events\n\n       By nightfall Thursday, another force had arrived on the \n     scene. The National Transportation Safety Board plays an \n     important role in sorting out such events, ultimately \n     assigning blame. Yesterday, the NTSB made itself known to the \n     public through board member John Hammerschmidt, whose \n     briefings were minor masterpieces of bureaucratic jargon.\n       On for the day's final briefing was CSX President Michael \n     Ward, who grew up not far from Terry Ryer's 6th Battalion \n     fire headquarters in Brooklyn.\n       Ward praised the city, praised the mayor and said his \n     company would continue to err on the side of caution. Then \n     came a question. Once this mess was cleaned up, would his \n     company consider installing sprinklers in the tunnel?\n       Ward testily called any such question ``premature.''\n       ``Hindsight is 20-20,'' offered the Fire Department's Mike \n     Maybin, affirming his department's skills.\n       What about foresight? They must have forgotten to ask \n     Elaine Macklin, at Sutton Place, who again went to bed with \n     smoke pouring past her 14th-floor window.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this article, among other things, details \nhow this train derailment threatened to leak hazardous chemicals, such \nas hydrochloric acid, into the main tunnel running under downtown \nBaltimore. They were able to stop that leak. This train derailment \nclosed roads, broke fiberoptic communications cables, generated a water \nmain break, caused evacuation of residents, and injured workers. While \nit was not one of the more serious things, it indicates how widespread \nthis was: They canceled three Baltimore Orioles baseball games. They \nsimply could not play with hazardous materials around. People could not \nget to the game. Baltimore was basically shut off.\n  To show the cost to the business community, we have only to look at \nwhat happened to the Baltimore Orioles. Damages associated with just \nthe lost baseball revenues are estimated at almost $5 million for the \nBaltimore Orioles.\n  Is Baltimore an isolated example? Of course not. Between 1978 and \n1995, as I said, over 260,000 people were evacuated across the Nation \ndue to transportation accidents involving trains. There are some \nreasons why. The Federal Railroad Administration increased inspections \nand allocated few resources to ensure bridge safety across the Nation. \nTrain derailments during that period increased 18 percent.\n  Unfortunately, we do not have good statistics about the prevalence or \ndamages associated with accidents such as the one in Baltimore. We do \nknow from press reports that transportation-related accidents involving \ndangerous substances occur around the Nation each year. A quick search \nrevealed many.\n  For example, I found an exploding boxcar in Kansas City sending its \nhazardous contents, potassium nitrate, into a nearby school. I am told \nthat is one of the things that was used in the bomb in Kansas City.\n  I found other reports in Charleston, SC, of a train derailment that \nspilled 300 gallons of formaldehyde and forced the evacuation of 100 \nfamilies and hospitalized 7.\n  I know of the train derailment in California where hazardous \nsubstances were dumped in a river and endangered the life and property \nof millions of people in California.\n  While we do not have a complete count of all the accidents, we do \nhave data to show transportation of dangerous substances is on the \nrise. With increased transportation comes an increased risk unless we \nstep back and evaluate how well our transportation infrastructure is \nhandling this dangerous cargo.\n  We need to know whether our emergency response personnel are trained \nand equipped to deal with hazardous accidents, not only in urban \nBaltimore but in rural Nevada. We need to know whether we adequately \nconvey information on dangerous accidents to the public in time to \nensure their safety.\n  We do not have reliable estimates of the need to upgrade \ninfrastructure in order to handle unique threats posed by accidents \ninvolving dangerous substances. We will need these estimates to prepare \na new transportation bill which we are going to begin next year, our \nevery-5-year bill. The study required by this amendment offered by this \nSenator and the two Senators from Maryland is an important first step \nin that effort.\n  It was coincidental that I had the hearing today--it had been \nscheduled for some time--dealing with our decaying infrastructure. We \nneed to do something, and one of the things we can do will be focused \nas a result of this amendment, which will cause the Department of \nTransportation and the General Accounting Office to take a look at how \nsafe it is to transport and, if not, what do they recommend to make it \nmore safe.\n  We are going to try to vote on this at 5:45 p.m. today.\n  There is going to be a vote today and we would like to keep it on \nTransportation. When we hear from the minority, we will be in a \nposition to offer a unanimous consent in that regard. I hope this \namendment will be supported. I think it should be an overwhelming \naffirmative vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nthe very able Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, in cosponsoring this \namendment to the fiscal year 2002 Transportation appropriations bill \nwhich calls for a study of the hazards and risks associated with the \ntransportation of hazardous chemicals or radioactive material on our \nrail and highway network.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, more than 800,000 \nshipments of hazardous materials, or hazmats, occur each day on our \nhighways, railroads, and waterways. The total volume of hazardous \nmaterials such as flammable liquids and corrosive chemicals exceeds \nsome 3 billion tons a year. While the vast majority of these shipments \nare transported safely, without any release, the number of hazmat \nincidents reported to the Department of Transportation has nearly \ndoubled in the past decade.\n  As Senator Reid has already noted, last Wednesday a 60-car freight \ntrain, including several cars containing hazardous chemicals, derailed \nand caught fire in the Howard Street tunnel right through downtown \nBaltimore. The cause of the derailment and fire are still under \ninvestigation, but according to news reports, some fire officials \nspeculate the fire started in a car carrying tripropylene, a caustic \nand flammable chemical used for making detergents and plastics.\n  I take this opportunity to commend the members of the Baltimore City \nFire Department for their heroic efforts in managing the fire and \nprotecting the health and safety of the citizens of our city. For \nnearly 5 days, the city firefighters undertook tremendous risks, \ncourageously entering the dark tunnel, vision impaired by smoke, to \nface the fire and the volatile chemicals and hazardous materials that \nburned within. During the height of the incident, over 150 of the \ncity's firefighters were on the scene and many more obviously reported \nfor duty throughout the course of this incident.\n  The fact that injuries were kept to a minimum is a testament to the \nskill and professionalism with which the Baltimore City firefighters \nperformed their jobs. I also express my appreciation to the Coast Guard \nStrike Force, the Maryland Department of Environment, and all the other \nmembers of the team who worked around the clock to\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\nprotect public health and the environment.\n  Firefighters' activities were largely completed last night. This \nmorning, the last of the 60 railcars was pulled out of the tunnel. The \ntunnel is now free of the train and examination will now take place \nwith respect to the structural status of this tunnel.\n  As Senator Reid and I discussed last week on the Senate floor, this \naccident underscores the potential dangers to public health and safety, \nthe environment and the economy in connection with the transportation \nof hazardous materials, but it also makes clear the need to invest in \nour Nation's infrastructure.\n  I very much welcome the amendment of my colleague. I want to \nunderscore this is an issue in which he has taken considerable \ninterest. In fact, he held a hearing this morning which had been \nscheduled, as I understand it, well before this incident took place. \nSenator Reid and others who have been concerned about the \ninfrastructure, and I know it is a concern the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, shares with us, have for quite \nsome time tried to focus attention on the necessity to improve the \nNation's infrastructure.\n\n  Later in the consideration of this bill I will join with my \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, in offering an amendment to specifically \nbegin to address the aging rail infrastructure in the Baltimore area. \nOur amendment would provide up to $750,000 in Federal matching funds \nfor the Department of Transportation, in cooperation with Amtrak, \nNorfolk Southern, CSX, the State of Maryland, and the City of \nBaltimore, to conduct a comprehensive study to assess the existing \nproblems in the freight and passenger rail infrastructure in the \nBaltimore region. The study would assess the condition, track, \nlimitation, and efficiency of the existing tunnels, bridges, and other \nrailroad facilities owned and operated by the railroads. It would also \nexamine the benefits and costs of various alternatives, including \nshared usage of track. It would make recommendations regarding \nimprovements to the rail infrastructure in the Baltimore region or the \nconstruction of new facilities to reduce congestion and improve safety \nand efficiency. The availability of the funds would be contingent upon \nCSX, Norfolk Southern and the State of Maryland providing equal amounts \nto conduct the study.\n  Next year marks the 175th year of railroad in America commemorating \nthe history of railroading that actually began in Baltimore with the \nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad. While it is an honor to have this historic \ncommemoration, this commemoration also serves to date our railroad \ninfrastructure in Maryland as amongst the oldest, of course, in the \ncountry. Indeed, major rail improvements made in the latter part of the \n19th century, including rail corridors, bridges and tunnels, continue \neven to this day to serve by providing routes for significant inner-\ncity passenger and freight traffic moving up and down the east coast, \nas well as providing links from the ports to the Midwest and points \nbeyond.\n  Two major main line corridors traverse Baltimore. Amtrak operates \nmore than 100 trains a day through Baltimore, traversing through two \nsets of major tunnels, the Union tunnel and the Baltimore and Potomac \ntunnel, immediately northeast and southwest of Penn Station. These \ntunnels were built in the 1870s when the Pennsylvania Railroad extended \nits reach south to Washington. A second parallel Union tunnel was built \nin the early part of the 20th century. Amtrak's corridor is also used \nby MARC commuter rail trains linking Baltimore and Washington and \nNorfolk and Southern freight trains.\n  While a number of improvements have been made to the corridor since \nthe 1970s, the basic infrastructure of the route, including the tunnels \nand bridges over the numerous rivers north of Baltimore, is virtually \nthe same as that in place some 75 to 100 years ago. CSX, the descendent \nof the original Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also operates its main line \nthrough Baltimore. The main line serves traffic traveling north and \nsouth up and down the east coast and traffic which is ultimately headed \nwest to the Ohio River Valley. Both movements converge between \nWashington and Baltimore and use the main line through the latter city. \nIt is CSX's main line which passes through Baltimore by the 1.7-mile-\nlong Howard Street tunnel where the accident occurred on Wednesday \nnight. Most of this was built in the 1890s on a single track. Numerous \nother short tunnels and bridges are also along the route north and east \nof the central city.\n  The physical condition of the rail infrastructure and the mix of \ntrains that use it cause various problems for the movement of freight \nand passengers. There are inadequate vertical clearances for the \npassage of certain types of freight since high-cube, double-stacked \ncontainer trains. There are numerous chokepoints and there is capacity-\nrelated congestion on the Northeast Corridor and the CSX main line.\n\n  So the purpose of this study, this additional amendment that Senator \nMikulski and I will offer, is to assess these and other problems in the \nfreight and passenger rail infrastructure in the Baltimore region, and \nto identify potential solutions to those problems. We need to get some \nsense of what the possibilities are, what the costs associated with \nthem are, and what might be a reasonable course of action in order to \naddress this situation. I very much hope when that amendment is offered \nour colleagues will be supportive of it.\n  I do want to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks an \neditorial from the Baltimore Sun about the effort of our firefighters \nand other authorities who responded to this emergency entitled, ``There \nwhen you need them.'' I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to conclude by, again, \nunderscoring the very important contribution that my colleague from \nNevada has made in alerting us, not just now but over a sustained \nperiod of time, to the importance of addressing the much broader issue. \nI, of course, have focused today on this Baltimore tunnel problem, but \nthat is only illustrative, as it were, simply an example of the kind of \nsituation we are confronting in many, many parts of the country. My \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, has repeatedly stressed the \nimportance of addressing this question. His amendment, which I join in \ncosponsoring, to require a study of the hazards and risks to the public \nhealth and safety, the environment, and the economy flowing from the \ntransportation of hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials, and \nthe improvements necessary to our infrastructure, I think, is a very \nimportant contribution. I strongly support it, and I trust when it \ncomes to a vote it will receive the overwhelming support of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 20, 2001]\n\n                        There When You Need Them\n\n       Without warning: Emergency responses were generally good, \n     but luck was better, the worst did not happen.\n       Baltimore had a close call Wednesday. It could have been so \n     much worse.\n       Industrial chemicals that caught fire, or that did not, \n     might have sent toxic fumes into the downtown atmosphere, \n     damaging lungs and skin, invading work places and residences.\n       On the whole, the ugly billows from both ends of the tunnel \n     proved to be benign.\n       The whole metropolitan population is in debt to the \n     courageous firefighters who entered the tunnel, into the \n     unknown, to deal with a fire they could not locate. Also the \n     police, hazardous materials experts and public works workers \n     who toiled on no notice through the night to cope with the \n     fire, train mishap, water main break and power outage that \n     paralyzed a great city.\n       They had other plans for the evening. But this was their \n     job and they did it.\n       City, state and federal authorities were right to err on \n     the side of caution in closing roads, waterways, baseball, \n     business and normal life until public safety was secured.\n       The one thing that did not work well was the civil defense \n     siren. In nearly a half-century it has been tested but never \n     before used for a real emergency. Those who heard it did not \n     know what it conveyed.\n       Were they to duck beneath desks in event of nuclear attack? \n     If not, what was the loud siren saying? For those who were \n     just trying to go home in the evening rush hour, the best \n     response was to carry on doing it, assuming they heard a mere \n     malfunction.\n       People have long since learned to turn on radio, television \n     or the Internet--or battery-operated radios in the event of \n     power outage--to learn if something big is happening. The \n     siren probably did not alert anyone who did not already know \n     about it.\n       The emergency showed just how interconnected modern society \n     is, how dependent\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\n     we all are on everyone else functioning normally.\n       The disruptions to city life and to East Coast commerce \n     will go on for some time, More lessons will be learned in \n     ensuing days.\n       New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, Norfolk and the \n     rest had better pay attention. Here, but for the grace of \n     God, go they.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I join with my colleagues, Senator \nReid and Senator Sarbanes, as an enthusiastic cosponsor of their \nrespective amendments that I believe, should they be agreed to, will \nmake America safer.\n  Last week in Baltimore we had a terrible train wreck in something \ncalled the Baltimore tunnel. A train overturned. It was a freight \ntrain. Immediately, we were not sure what was in it; what were the \nconsequences of a fire; were we going to have an explosion; and whether \nthe smoke billowing out of the tunnel was going to be a toxic plume \nover Baltimore. The civil defense alarm sounded for the first time in \nBaltimore in 50 years. The mayor jumped into action immediately, as did \nour brave firefighters and emergency management people because we had \nto both contain the fire and we had to contain panic.\n  I salute the mayor and the Governor for the support he gave the \nmayor, and the brave men and women of our public safety organizations, \nour firefighters, emergency management, public works, and also the \ncitizens of Baltimore.\n  The railroad worked in a hands-on fashion with our mayor. I am happy \nto report that, as of now, we have pulled the railroad cars out, the \nsmoke is clearing, but now the next phase needs to begin. During this \nsaga that was unfolding, both in Baltimore and in the national media, \nour first fear was for the firefighters, the first responders, the ones \nwho had to go in there and who initially were not sure what they were \ngoing into. The temperatures were reading 1,500 degrees. You could not \nget in through the smoke. They went down through manholes--let me tell \nyou, through a manhole to a 8-foot platform, then down another ladder \nto see what the deal was. Our firefighters had to be tethered so we did \nnot lose them in the smoke.\n  You know what. They did it. They did it without flinching. They did \nit without hesitation. They did it with skill. They did it with \nintegrity and unparalleled courage. We salute them. And also a salute \nto their spouses who were there to support people doing such daring \ndeeds.\n  Yes, the railroad worked, chem-hazmat worked, but now we have to get \nback to our work so we can protect the first responders, protect \nproperty, and also protect the nearby neighborhoods.\n  This accident, which shut down much of Baltimore and the freight \nmovement in the Northeast Corridor, really was a wake-up call to take a \nclose look at the practice of transporting hazardous materials through \nroads and tunnels. Because we do use railroads, we do use trucks, we do \nneed to be sure that we know what is going through our communities. \nWhat made our quick response possible was that we had a manifest and we \nknew what was happening.\n  We do not know the consequences of these new kinds of materials going \nthrough together, the synergistic effects. One car had paper, the other \ncar had hydrochloric acid, and the other car had other hazardous waste. \nOne needs to be fought with water. One could have caused other problems \nif you fought the fire with water. I am not evaluating the best way to \ntransport these items, but we have to do our homework so we can protect \nour people. This is why I join with my esteemed colleague, Senator Reid \nof Nevada. He has an amendment that calls upon the Secretary of \nTransportation, in consultation with the Comptroller General, to \nconduct a study evaluating the hazards and risks to public health, \nsafety, the environment, and the economy associated with the \ntransportation of hazardous chemical and radioactive materials; and to \ntake a look at our transportation infrastructure and the improvements \nnecessary to prevent accidents involving such chemicals and other \nmaterials, and to examine the preparedness of Federal, State, and local \nemergency and medical personnel to respond to these accidents.\n  Well done, Senator Reid. This is exactly the kind of amendment we \nneed. This is exactly the kind of amendment we need so we show we are \nstanding sentry over our communities and making sure we have the \ninfrastructure necessary to protect our communities.\n  That Baltimore tunnel is over 100 years old. It was built when \nrailroads were built. The Garret family created the B Railroad and it \nwent west. It was one of the first railroads to go west. We want those \nrailroads to continue to run. The Port of Baltimore will not exist \nwithout our railroads, so we are not saying don't do it. But when we \nare going to do our transportation, let's do it right.\n  The whole idea of examining the preparedness of Federal, State, and \nlocal emergency and medical personnel is also appropriate. As the \nchairperson of the subcommittee on VA/HUD that funds FEMA, this is also \nhow we need to make sure our first responders and our emergency \nmanagement people are ready. We have to have them ready as ``all \nhazards'' personnel. We could have something that was an accident, \nwhich was a chemical accident, where there are other things where there \nare attacks on the United States. This is where we need to be \nprepared. This is where we need to be prepared.\n\n  We salute this amendment. I hope my colleagues will endorse it.\n  Also, my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has taken the leadership role \nof directing the Secretary of Transportation to study existing rail \ninfrastructure in the Baltimore metropolitan area. It directs the \nSecretary to make those recommendations because we are worried about \nour rail infrastructure, including improvements in tunnels, bridges, \nand other rail facilities. We want them to do it in conjunction with \nthe FRA, the chair of the Surface Transportation Board, the State of \nMaryland, our railroad folks, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Amtrak.\n  The amendment calls for a study to be used, and it provides that the \nrailroads in the State of Maryland also join in this joint partnership. \nI believe they will. These studies need to be done with a sense of \ntimeliness and a sense of urgency.\n  Thank God we escaped without the loss of life. We thank God that \nthere was no major loss of property. Thank God we didn't have to \nevacuate communities. But an incredible economic toll resulted. It was \nnot only the Orioles game being canceled, but it was the delay of \nfreight which slowed down the corridor with enormous consequences. But \nthe consequences would have been even more severe had we not had the \ncurrent infrastructure in place.\n  I believe the best way we say thank you to the emergency management \npeople, our firefighters, and for the excellent job our people did in \nresponding is to have a parade, which I hope Baltimore has--I hope not \nonly with banners, which we ought to display with pride, but I also \nthink we should say it with deeds. And these two studies are a good way \nto do it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want \nto express my appreciation to her, and also the senior Senator from \nMaryland for joining in this amendment.\n  The two Senators from Maryland can describe better than anyone here \nthe terror of those brave firefighters facing a tunnel a mile and a \nhalf long, knowing there was a train in there and not knowing what was \non the train but knowing there was a lot of smoke coming from it.\n  This was a real act of courage, as the Senators have indicated. I \ncan't imagine the terror that these men and women had in fighting this \nfire. From all of the accounts I have read--I have followed it very \nclosely--it appears that it was a picture book attack on a very \ndangerous fire.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actually, they knew what was in the train because they \nhad the railroad manifest of what was contained in the railroad cars. \nThey knew, in fact, there was hazardous material being carried in some \nof the 60 cars that were on that train. Firefighters do a great job day \nin and day out all across the country. We generally sort of simply come \nto accept as a matter of\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\ncourse the tremendous risk they run. A high profile incident like this, \nof course, focuses attention back on it. There was tremendous heroism \nthere. But there is also tremendous heroism on the part of firefighters \ntaking place every day all across America in extremely dangerous \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I again express my appreciation to the two \nSenators from Maryland who have so aptly kept us on top of what was \ngoing on there. I also join with them on this amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending Reid \namendment regarding a Department of Transportation/General Accounting \nOffice study on the hazards and risks to public health and safety, the \nenvironment, and the economy associated with the transportation of \nhazardous chemicals and radioactive material.\n  In light of the recent events in Baltimore, it is entirely \nunderstandable that Senators from Maryland would join the Senator from \nNevada in offering this amendment. Many of our urban areas suffer from \ninadequate and perhaps unsafe transportation infrastructure. However, I \nhasten to point out that if this derailment had happened to a train \ncarrying spent nuclear fuel or other radioactive material, none of the \nhavoc we saw in Baltimore would have occurred. The Orioles would not \nhave had to cancel games and there would have been no threat to the \ngeneral public health and safety. That's because the casks used to \ntransport such material are subjected to rigorous safety standards by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission and are tested is such a manner to \nensure that a train derailment and any number of other accidents that \ncould befall the casks would neither damage the casks or allow the \nrelease of any radioactive material.\n  As many of you well know, transportation is one of the key issues \nthat arises in the discussions we have had here on the Senate floor \nwhen we debate the matter of how to deal with the disposal of our spent \nnuclear fuel. But I need to remind everyone that we already transport \nsuch material--and have been doing so for over 30 years. There have \nbeen close to 3,000 shipments in this country and no fatality, injury \nor environmental damage has ever occurred because of radioactive cargo. \nThat is not to say there have not been accidents. There have--but the \ncasks have performed as designed. They haven't broken open. They have \nnot leaked. We have done a hood job transporting spent nuclear fuel and \nradioactive waste and we will continue to do so. Great precautions are \ntaken to avoid accidents and when and if Yucca Mountain is declared \nsuitable as a repository for fuel, additional transportation safety \nprovisions under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act will kick in to ensure \nthat the additional transportation of spent fuel will continue in a \nsafe manner.\n  But we don't have to wait for Yucca to open to have safety measures \nin place--we already have them. Shipments are happening now and are \nsafe. A nuclear fuel container consists of literally tons of shielding \ninside a thick steel cylinder. Any container design must be licensed by \nthe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before the container is used for \nshipment. The NRC will not certify the container until it undergoes a \nseries of rigorous tests demonstrating that it is invulnerable to \nimpact, flames, submersion and puncture.\n  In addition to the safety of the casks, spent nuclear fuel may be \nshipped only along specified highway routes. Shippers submit routes to \nthe NRC for approval ahead of time. The NRC checks that a route \nconforms to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, requiring \nthe most direct interstate route, and avoiding large cities when a \nbypass or beltway is available. NRC officials drive the route ahead of \ntime if it has not been previously approved before or used within the \npast few years. They will check for law enforcement and emergency \nresponse capability as well as secure facilities for emergency stops. \nDOT regulations also require that the shipper notify the governor of \neach State on the route seven days be fore the trip.\n  Specialized trucking companies handle spent nuclear fuel shipments in \nthe United States. These experienced, specially licensed companies haul \nall kinds of hazardous materials more than 50 million miles annually. \nVehicles are state of the art, equipped with computers that provide an \ninstantaneous update on the truck's location and convey messages \nbetween driver and dispatcher through a satellite communications \nnetwork. Drivers receive extensive training and must be certified.\n  The DOT and NRC establish emergency preparedness requirements for \nradioactive materials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the \nDOE provide emergency response training for state and local law \nenforcement officials, fire fighters, and rescue squads, covering \npreparedness planningandaccid4nt handling. In addition, DOE \nradiological assistance teams provide expertise and equipment, \nincluding mobile laboratories, to every region of the country. Also, \naccording to a voluntary mutual assistance agreement, utilities respond \nto incidents in their area until emergency personnel from the shipper \nand shipping utility arrive.\n  I have no objection to the overall purpose of the amendment however, \nin having a study done on infrastructure and training. My colleagues \nshould be award that we already do that continuously for nuclear fuel \nand high-level radioactive waste.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1037\n\n                       MICHIGAN CORRIDOR PROJECTS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the distinguished \nchairwoman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. As the \nchairwoman knows, over the past few years, the State of Michigan has \ncompeted for funds under the Coordinated Border and Corridor Program of \nthe Transportation Equity Act (TEA 21). However, because of increased \nearmarking, discretionary funds have been greatly diminished. This \nyear, both House and Senate did not contain any discretionary funds, \neliminating an important discretionary funding source for the State of \nMichigan.\n  I would ask the distinguished chairwoman to give consideration to a \nparticularly important project on our U.S.-Canadian border in Michigan. \nThe Ambassador Bridge Gateway Project which will provide direct \ninterstate access to the Ambassador Bridge and improve overall traffic \nflow to and from our U.S.-Canadian border, needs $10 million this year \nto keep the project on schedule. To date, there has been a total of \n$30.2 million in federal funds either spent or committed with a state \nmatch of $7 million. Any consideration that the distinguished \nchairwoman can provide is much appreciated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join the distinguished Senator from Michigan in asking \nthe distinguished chairwoman to give this important project \nconsideration in conference. The Ambassador Bridge in Detroit, MI is a \ncritical project for the State's trade infrastructure. It is one of the \nthree busiest border crossings in North America, and more trade moves \nover this bridge than the country exports to Japan. It is crucial that \nwe keep traffic moving safely and efficiently at this crossing. The \nAmbassador Bridge Gateway project will provide direct interstate access \nto the bridge, and improve overall traffic flow to and from the \nAmbassador Bridge. This project also has a wide range of\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nsupport from the state, local government, metropolitan planning and the \nbusiness community.\n  Ms. MURRAY. I thank the distinguished Senators from Michigan, and I \nwill be happy to work with them in conference on this important \ncorridor project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8055-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I commend Senator Murray and Senator \nShelby for drafting an amendment that is attempting to address the \nissue of safe trucks on American highways. This is an issue that has \ncaused a lot of disagreement. I know it is a very controversial issue. \nI want to speak about it because my State is most certainly affected. \nBut I think every State is affected by whether we have safe trucks on \nour highways.\n  We do not yet have an agreement on this issue that everyone can live \nwith, but I think we are a lot closer than anyone thinks. I ask \nSenators Murray, Shelby, McCain, Gramm, and the administration to work \ntogether to try to make sure we come out with regulations that will \nassure that we have the facilities and manpower to inspect every truck \ncoming into our country, whether it is from Mexico or from Canada.\n  Second, we must make sure we have foreign-owned trucks and drivers \nmeet U.S. safety standards, while ensuring fair treatment for our \ntrading partners. That is our responsibility and our commitment under \nNAFTA.\n  Third, I think it is very important that we commit to providing the \nfinancial resources for the inspection stations and other border \ninfrastructure. The administration asked for about $88 million for this \npurpose. The Murray-Shelby committee report that is on the floor has \nmore than $100 million to make sure we have the border inspection \nstations, without which we couldn't possibly comply with NAFTA.\n  If we have good regulations and the money to conduct the inspections, \nI think we can come up with language that will be acceptable to \neveryone and keep our commitment under NAFTA.\n  I voted for NAFTA. I support free trade. But there are provisions in \nthe underlying bill that I think could keep the United States from \nkeeping its commitment under NAFTA.\n  I also believe the Department of Transportation regulations are not \nquite strong enough to assure that we will have inspections of every \ntruck. I don't think we have been able to fix this yet. I hope we will \nbe able to work together on language that will assure that we will have \nreal inspections, that will ensure safety on our highways, and comply \nwith our commitments under NAFTA. I don't think we are there yet, but I \nthink we are working on it.\n  I ask everyone to come to the table. Senator Stevens has been a \nleader on this issue. Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, certainly is a leader on this issue. Senator Shelby and \nSenator Murray as the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nTransportation Subcommittee are leaders on this issue.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee as \nwell as the Commerce Committee. But mostly I am a person who is going \nto be on highways where there is going to be a lot of NAFTA traffic. \nWhen we are looking at 8,500 Mexican commercial trucking companies \nhaving the authority to operate in commercial zones today, I think we \nare talking about a lot of Mexican traffic on our freeways. We want a \nlot of Mexican and Canadian commerce, as long as the trucks meet our \nstandards. We have to assure that those inspection stations are there \nto make sure it happens.\n  In 1999, both United States and Mexican commercial motor vehicles \nmade an estimated 4.5 million crossings on the border. Seventy percent \nof those were in Texas.\n  This debate is not merely hypothetical to Texas, nor to the other \nborder States. The added burden of overweight and potentially unsafe \ntrucks is a daily reality in south Texas.\n  The reason for low inspection statistics is the lack of adequate \nspace to conduct safety inspections. Currently, the only permanent \ninspection facilities at the United States-Mexico border are at the \nState facilities in Calexico and Otay Mesa, CA. At the other 25 border \ncrossings, Federal and State inspectors have limited access to the \nexisting U.S. Customs lots.\n  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors do not have \nthe equipment nor the space they need to do the job. Those inspectors \nhave space to inspect only one or two trucks at a time. The \nconstruction of dedicated motor carrier safety inspection facilities at \nor near the existing Federal border crossing would improve inspection \nstatistics.\n  Working with the Department of Public Safety in Texas, we have \nidentified funding needs of $100 million to construct safety inspection \nstations. So it is very important that all of us focus on this issue \nand that we all look for a resolution of this issue.\n  I think we are very close, but we are not there yet. I hope everyone \nwill come together either to fashion an answer right now in this bill \nbefore it goes out of this Chamber or agree that we will not do that \nnow, that we will write something in conference, but most certainly we \nwould not stand on the language that is in the underlying bill nor the \nlanguage that is in the House underlying bill that was passed that \nwould prohibit Mexican trucks from coming into the United States at \nall.\n  I think we can come up with language that will be acceptable to the \nadministration and acceptable to our Mexican counterparts. But the \nbottom line is, we are not going to have unsafe trucks on our highways \nas long as I have a voice in the Senate, because we have standards. The \nwhole concept of NAFTA was that we would have parity, parity of our \ntruck standards with the truck standards of Canada and Mexico. That \nmeans there would be a level playing field in trucking company \ncompetition, so that there would not be an unfair advantage to another \ncountry and, secondly, so that there would be safety on all of our \nhighways, to make sure we are not in any way discriminating against any \ncountry nor are we lowering the standards that we have in our country.\n  So I intend to be very active in this debate. I intend to be very \nactive in bringing the groups together to try to come to that \ncompromise. My bottom line is only one; and that is that there is \nparity, safety, and a level playing field for the truckers of our \ncountry and the countries in NAFTA with whom we trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8055-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8055-S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ILSA EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

The CBO staff contacts are Joseph C.\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\n     Whitehill (for federal costs) and Paige Piper/Bach (for the \n     private-sector impact).\n           Sincerely,\n           Barry B. Anderson\n           (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     ILSA Extension Act of 2001\n       The ILSA Extension Act of 2001 would extend the authorities \n     of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) of 1996 for an \n     additional five years through 2006. The bill would lower the \n     threshold of investments in Libya that could trigger \n     sanctions under the act from $40 million to $20 million, and \n     it would revise the definition of investment to include any \n     amendment or modification of existing contracts that would \n     exceed the threshold amount. CBO estimates that implementing \n     the bill would not significantly affect discretionary \n     spending. The bill would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply.\n       Based on information from the Department of State, CBO \n     estimates that the ILSA Extension Act of 2001 would result in \n     a substantial increase in the number of investments in Libya \n     that could be subject to the sanctions in ILSA. CBO estimates \n     that the additional workload necessary to identify such \n     investments would increase the department's spending by less \n     than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of \n     appropriated funds.\n       By extending the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, the ILSA \n     Extension Act of 2001 could impose a private-sector mandate \n     as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The \n     President would be required to impose certain sanctions of \n     U.S. entities or foreign companies that invest over a \n     specific amount of money in developing the petroleum and \n     natural gas resources of Iran or Libya. Among the sanctions \n     available under the act, the President could impose certain \n     restrictions on U.S. offices of a sanctioned company or on \n     entities and financial institutions engaged in business \n     transactions with a sanctioned entity. The act does, however, \n     allow the President the discretion to make exceptions in \n     applying such sanctions. Since passage of ILSA, no such \n     sanctions have been imposed. Consequently, CBO expects that \n     sanctions are unlikely to be imposed under the extension and \n     that the direct cost of the mandate would fall below the \n     annual threshold established by UMRA for private-sector \n     mandates ($113 million in 2001, adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       The ILSA Extension Act of 2001 contains no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA and would not \n     affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n       CBO prepared two estimates for the House companion bill, \n     H.R. 1954. The first estimate was for H.R. 1954 as ordered by \n     the House Committee on International Relations on June 20, \n     2001. The second estimate was for H.R. 1954 as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on July 12, \n     2001. The International Relations Committee versions of H.R. \n     1954 is similar to the Senate bill. The Ways and Means \n     Committee version would require the President to report to \n     the Congress on the effectiveness of actions taken under ILSA \n     within 18 months after enactment, and it would provide for \n     the early termination of that act of any time after \n     submission of the report. CBO estimated that implementing \n     either version of H.R. 1954 would not significantly affect \n     discretionary spending and that the cost of the private-\n     sector mandate would fall below the annual threshold \n     established by UMRA.\n       The CBO staff contact for federal costs is Joseph C. \n     Whitehill. The CBO staff contact for private-sector mandates \n     is Paige Piper/Bach. This estimate was approved by Peter H. \n     Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8056-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, S. 805, introduced on May 1, is a vital \nstep toward the day when advanced research will find ways to halt, and \neven cure, life-threatening muscular dystrophy.\n  Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder, actually a number of \nseparate disorders, that are characterized by weakening and eventual \nwasting of muscles throughout the body. A quarter of a million \nAmericans of all ages are affected by these disorders. One form, \nDuchenne, strikes young boys and usually takes their lives before they \nreach their twenties. Other forms that affect adults are also severely \ndebilitating and can be devastating to the victims and their families.\n  Since 1966, entertainer Jerry Lewis has hosted the annual Muscular \nDystrophy Labor Day Telethon, calling the Nation's attention to the \nmuscular dystrophies and seeking help for individuals and families \naffected by these diseases. Jerry Lewis is the National Chairman of the \nMuscular Dystrophy Association which, through its Telethon and year-\nround fund raising activities, has raised hundreds of millions of \ndollars for programs of direct patient services, research and summer \ncamp. The MDA program supports a nationwide network of 230 clinics, \nwhich are affiliated with hospitals and universities, sends more than \n4,000 youngsters it serves to MDA summer camps, and helps pay for \nwheelchairs, braces, and various therapies for people with muscular \ndystrophy.\n  In addition to providing these direct patient and family services, \nMDA expends about $30 million per year to support scientific research. \nOver the past half century, MDA has funded research that was vital in \ndeveloping the protocols that resulted in groundbreaking discoveries in \ngenetic mapping. This extraordinary organization has played a key role \nin identifying the gene defects that cause virtually all of the forms \nof muscular dystrophy. The Muscular Dystrophy Association is to be \ncommended for its work and can be justifiably proud of the very \npositive role it has in assisting those affected by neuromuscular \ndisease. In fact, the implications of their research extend to all of \nthe estimated 5,000 genetic-based diseases affecting all of mankind. \nWith all of the research insights and opportunities made available by \nthis organization, it is time for us to help.\n  The next critical phase in muscular dystrophy research is to apply \nthese basic scientific discoveries to the development of effective \ntherapies. That will require substantial Federal funding. Authorizing \nsuch a vigorous Federal effort is the purpose of S. 805. The bill calls \nupon NIH and the Centers for Disease Control to establish Centers of \nExcellence in which intensified clinical research can be conducted \nwhich will speed the discovery of treatments and cures for the various \nforms of muscular dystrophy.\n  S. 805 provides the Director of the NIH and the Directors of the \nseveral institutes within NIH that conduct muscular dystrophy research \nwith the authority and responsibility to concentrate and intensify that \nresearch effort. The bill also authorizes the funds needed to conduct \nessential clinical trials. In short, it gives NIH the organization and \nthe mandate to exploit recent advances in gene therapy. The goal is the \nswiftest possible rescue for children and adults whose lives will \notherwise be lost or badly damaged by muscular dystrophy.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has responded generously and often to the \ndemands for research funding aimed at other diseases that shorten or \nimpair the lives of Americans. It is time to add muscular dystrophy to \nthe list of those diseases. I commend my colleagues for introducing S. \n805, and I regret that I am just now getting the opportunity to deliver \nthis statement, two weeks after my name was added to this important \nlegislation as a cosponsor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8056-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 23, \n1994 in Buena Park, California. Two men parked near a gay bar were \nslashed with broken bottles and beaten by a group of men who shouted \nanti-gay epithets and stole the victims' car.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8056-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8056-S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR WORKERS, FARMERS, COMMUNITIES, AND \n                           FIRMS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to lend my full \nsupport to the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, Farmers, \nCommunities, and Firms Act of 2001, which I introduced today along with \nSenators Bingaman, Baucus, and Daschle. I particularly want to \ncongratulate Senator Bingaman on all the hard work and dedication that \nhe has shown on this\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nissue over the past several months in crafting this piece of \nlegislation, which is so critical to American workers and their \nfamilies.\n  Improving and expanding TAA is a priority for us, and we hope it will \nbecome a priority for Congress and for the President as well. This bill \nis not just a reauthorization but an improvement to our current TAA \nprogram--and not a moment too soon. Earlier this week, the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve told us our economic outlook remains troubling. We \nknow that means there will be more and more workers and families who \nwill need to turn to TAA for help to rebuild their futures.\n  In addition to reauthorizing TAA for an additional five years, this \nbill makes substantial improvements to the TAA program as a whole. The \nbill extends possible TAA benefits for an additional 26 weeks, provides \nwage insurance for many displaced workers over 50, and expands coverage \nfor secondary workers and workers whose jobs were lost when companies \nshifted their operations overseas.\n  Given the massive legacy cost issue facing our steel companies, I \nparticularly wanted to take action to provide health care and child \ncare benefits for workers who have lost their jobs due to imports. At \nmy urging, the bill contains several health care provisions, including \na refundable tax credit for 50 percent of COBRA benefits and a \nprovision that links TAA beneficiaries to child care and health \nbenefits that they are entitled to under TANF.\n  As we expand coverage and benefits available under TAA, however, we \nstill have to remember what's really important in this debate: TAA \ncannot substitute for a good job, and too many good jobs are being lost \ndue to our current trade policies. That's what we really need to focus \non, although we still need TAA because there will always be workers who \nneed it.\n  As Governor of West Virginia in the 1980's and later as a U.S. \nSenator, I have seen firsthand the devastation that import surges have \nwrought on manufacturing communities. I have walked the streets of \nWelch, knowing that one in four people I met that day were unemployed. \nI have been to Weirton and Wheeling and seen the impact of the recent \nsurge of dumped and subsidized steel imports on the economic landscape \nand the collective psyche of those communities as thousands of \nsteelworkers, as well as workers whose jobs depend on those steel \ncompanies staying open, have been laid off. I have seen jean factories \nin Elkins and Phillippi, a shoe plant in Marlington, a glassworks in \nHuntington, and a shirt factory in Morgantown, close down because of \nforeign competition, throwing hundreds of people--many of whom had \nnever held another job--out of work.\n  Many of the unemployed are in their 20's and 30's with young children \nto support. Others are in their 40's and 50's and have held the same \njob for more than 20 years. A few may never find work again. For those \nwho do, it will be at a vastly reduced salary with fewer benefits. And \nas plants continue to close down, who knows if the health care and \npension benefits that were guaranteed by their employers and which \nthose workers thought they could depend on will still be there for them \nwhen they retire?\n  It makes me angry that we as a Nation have not done nearly enough to \nhelp those who have been dislocated from foreign trade, through no \nfault of their own, particularly when our trade policies led to their \nunemployment. Instead, we have provided a TAA program for which many of \nour workers do not qualify and which provides too little assistance for \nworkers to retrain so that they can adequately provide for their \nfamilies. That is just not right.\n  At the same time, our foreign trade partners continue to engage in \nunfair and illegal trade practices that throw more and more Americans \nout of work. For years, the relative market shares of the top Japanese \nsteel firms has never varied by more than 1 percent, regardless of \nchanges in the marketplace, because they have a cartel. Russian \nsteelworkers often do not receive wages. New uneconomic steel capacity \ncontinues to come on line around the world, often partially funded by \nloans from international financial institutions that receive U.S. \nGovernment funding.\n  Yet our steelworkers, glassworkers, and others in the manufacturing \nsector of our economy are forced to compete on the same playing field \nwith these countries, whose producers are heavily subsidized or who \nhave benefitted from a long legacy of indirect government assistance or \ntoleration of anti-competitive activities. Such practices have allowed \nforeign steel companies to stay in business long after they would have \nshut down if they were located in the United States. How are our \nworkers supposed to compete with that, no matter how efficient they \nare?\n  It is no wonder that people in this country are beginning to wake up \nto our trade policies and wonder just what we are doing and what \nprinciples, if any, we are using to guide them. You should not need to \nhave an MBA from Harvard in order to get a good job, with good wages \nand benefits, in this country.\n  If this Administration wants to negotiate more trade agreements, \nwithout dealing with the impact that trade has on our steelworkers and \nworkers in other sectors of our economy who built this country into the \neconomic super power that it is today, then it will fail miserably.\n  This bill is a good step forward. I urge my colleagues in Congress to \nhelp us pass it and the President to sign it into law. But it is only \nthe beginning. We simply cannot ignore the fact that with trade, a \nrising tide does not always lift all boats. Our laws are not the laws \nof nature, but rather, the laws of mankind. We cannot say that \ndislocation through trade is inevitable and just throw up our hands, \nleaving millions of American workers behind. We have an obligation to \nthem and to their families, to craft trade policies that are to their \nbenefit and which help them prepare for the future. It is an obligation \nthat we simply cannot ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8057-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I ask that the following article \nfrom the Wall Street Journal, dated July 19, 2001, be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 19, 2001]\n\n                           [By Rick Wartzman]\n\n   Falling Behind--As Officials Lost Faith in the Minimum Wage, Pat \n                           Williams Lived it\n\n       Shreveport, LA.--Night had fallen by the time Pat Williams, \n     hungry and bone tired, arrived home to find the little red \n     ticket mocking the more than 10 hours of toil she had just \n     put in.\n       ``Oh, Lord,'' she said, reaching into her mailbox, ``what \n     is this?'' She swatted a mosquito, held the ticket to the \n     light above her front stoop and took in the bad news: Reliant \n     Energy Inc. had cut off her gas because her account was $477 \n     overdue.\n       ``I ain't going to sweat it,'' she muttered over and over. \n     Clearly, though, she was wound tight, and soon began puffing \n     on a succession of discount cigarettes.\n       It was early April, and Ms. Williams was dressed in the \n     dark blue uniform that she wears at her first job, caring for \n     the aged and infirm at a nursing home. Atop that was the gray \n     apron she dons for her second job, cleaning offices at night. \n     The place where she works as a nursing assistant, Harmony \n     House, was paying her $5.55 an hour--barely above the minimum \n     wage--even though she has been there more than 10 years, is a \n     union member and completed college courses to become \n     certified. The cleaning job, which she took up because she \n     couldn't make ends meet, pays right at the federally mandated \n     minimum: $5.15 an hour.\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\n       For the 46-year-old single mother with a bright smile and \n     big dimples, life has never been easy. But, as she will tell \n     you, it certainly has been easier.\n       When she began minimum-wage work more than two decades ago, \n     Ms. Williams says, she had little difficulty paying her \n     bills. Small indulgences for her and her three children--a \n     burger and fries on a Saturday afternoon, a new blouse, the \n     occasional name-brand sneakers--weren't such a stretch. Most \n     of all, Ms. Williams wasn't nearly so stressed over money.\n       Sometimes, she and her best friend, Ruby Moore, sit in Ms. \n     Williams's back yard and, as trains thunder by, they talk \n     about how they just can't get ahead. Ms. Moore, 51, has \n     earned around the minimum wage for years, first by working in \n     the kitchen of a drug-treatment center, and now by cooking \n     for recovering addicts of a different sort--the gamblers \n     who've surfaced along with the glittering casino boats on the \n     Red River. ``It's much harder than it used to be,'' she says. \n     ``You've got to skip this bill in order to pay that bill.''\n       ``You think you're moving forward,'' adds Ms. Williams, \n     ``but you're just moving backwards.''\n       There's little wonder why. As a long-time low-wage worker, \n     Ms. Williams has felt the sting of one of the most profound \n     shifts in American economic policy during the past 20 years: \n     a mounting disdain for the minimum wage. Established during \n     the New Deal, the minimum wage was once viewed by Democrats \n     and Republicans alike as an instrument of economic justice--\n     an effort to ``end starvation wages,'' as President Franklin \n     D. Roosevelt himself put it. Now, though, it is seen by much \n     of official Washington as an economic impediment, an undue \n     burden on a marketplace better left unfettered. Where the \n     onus was once on the business owner to pay ``a decent wage,'' \n     it's now more on the worker to demonstrate that he or she \n     deserves one.\n       This sea change began when Ronald Reagan swept into office. \n     From 1950 through 1982, the minimum wage was allowed to fall \n     below 45% of the average hourly wage in the U.S. in only four \n     separate years. Since 1982, the minimum wage has never \n     reached 45%, and it currently stands at 36%, of that \n     benchmark. Even using a conservative measure of inflation, \n     the minimum wage throughout the '60s and '70s was \n     consistently worth more than $5.50 an hour--and frequently \n     more than $6--in today's terms. After 1980, its value \n     plummeted, sinking to less than $4.50 as President Reagan \n     left office. Two subsequent increases have nudged it back up \n     to its present $5.15.\n       While the robust job market of the '90s thinned the ranks \n     of minimum-wage workers--only about 1% of hourly employees \n     earn exactly $5.15 an hour now, down from more than 9% in \n     1980--plenty of people still hover right around the pay \n     floor.\n       Legislation introduced in Congress last February would \n     elevate the minimum wage to $6.65 an hour by 2003. More than \n     11 million workers, or about 15% of the hourly labor force, \n     now earn from $5.15 to $6.64. President Bush has signaled \n     that he could accept a moderate increase in the minimum \n     wage--but only if states are allowed to opt out. The Senate, \n     where the Democrats recently gained control, is expected to \n     take up the matter in the coming weeks.\n       Meanwhile, in communities across the country, low-wage work \n     isn't a relic, but an unremitting reality. A just-published \n     study by two economists--William Carrington, formerly of the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Reserve's Bruce \n     Fallick--gives a name to this phenomenon: the ``minimum-wage \n     career.'' They tracked some 3,500 people for 10 years after \n     they had left school and found that more than 8% spent at \n     least half of that time in jobs paying at or near the minimum \n     wage. In Ms. Williams's case, practically everyone she knows \n     has been mired in such occupations their whole working lives.\n       For them, it's as if the two longest peacetime economic \n     expansions in the nation's history--one under President \n     Reagan, the other under President Clinton--never happened at \n     all.\n       Ms. Williams earned $10,067 in wages last year. She also \n     received a $2,353 federal tax credit targeted to the working \n     poor. Because her children are all grown and gone, the size \n     of the credit hinges on Ms. Williams's seven-year-old \n     grandson, Kimdrick, staying with her for more than half the \n     year. Caring for Kimdrick is a survival strategy she worked \n     out with her eldest daughter; if she weren't caring for a \n     child, Ms. Williams would have been eligible for a tax credit \n     of only $27--a point at which, she says, she'd likely be on \n     the streets. The daughter claims her other two children for \n     tax purposes.\n       Through the 1980s, Ms. Williams's wages were so low that \n     she received welfare payments--at times as much as $217 a \n     month--to supplement her income. But she ceased collecting \n     these handouts 12 years ago, partly, she says, because it was \n     a hassle to reapply every few months and partly because of \n     the indignity. ``I just wanted welfare to be a stepping \n     stone,'' she says. ``It made me feel terrible.'' Last summer, \n     Ms. Williams also stopped reapplying for food stamps, which \n     in the past had been worth up to $324 a month, depending on \n     how many of her children were living with her and other \n     factors. The local housing authority still picks up nearly \n     two-thirds of her monthly $525 in rent, and she receives \n     free medical care for her high blood pressure at an \n     indigent clinic.\n       Inside her small but fastidiously kept house--decorated \n     mostly with bric-a-brac from Good Will and the Dollar Store \n     and pictures cut out of magazines hung on the walls--Ms. \n     Williams ticked off the expenses that she was juggling at the \n     moment. Besides the gas bill, a notice recently arrived \n     reminding her that she was late in paying $142.14 to the \n     electric company. She owed $55.26 to the phone company, \n     $23.47 on the student loan she took out years ago for her \n     nursing classes, and $39.95 for her burglar alarm--a must, \n     she says, in her crime-infested neighborhood.\n       Violence touched her just last year. Ms. Williams's \n     boyfriend snapped and, according to police records, came at \n     two of her kids with a knife. Ms. Williams shot him with her \n     .25-caliber pistol. He staggered into traffic and was run \n     over and died. The authorities ruled the shooting \n     ``justifiable,'' and Ms. Williams was never charged.\n       The incident, she says, left a void in her heart. It also \n     left one in her pocketbook. The boyfriend used to chip in on \n     the bills, and his absence has been the main reason that Ms. \n     Williams has had to find a second job--even in Shreveport, \n     where it's relatively cheap to live.\n       Her budget offers no cushion. The bill from Reliant Energy, \n     swollen in part by unusually cold weather last winter, sent \n     Ms. Williams tearing into her scant savings. She had somehow \n     managed to put away a few dollars in the hopes of eventually \n     moving someplace quieter, out in the country. But in a single \n     stroke, the check to Reliant wiped out most of her nest egg. \n     ``It's devastating,'' she said, ``just devastating.''\n       A little later, Ms. Williams moved along Hollywood Avenue, \n     a run-down commercial strip near her house, where sin and \n     salvation compete head-on; for every liquor store and bail \n     bondsman, a Baptist church beckons. ``Why is it so hard to \n     get a pay increase?'' she asked. ``If I made $7 an hour, I'd \n     think I was doing good.''\n       Over on Illinois Avenue, Ms. Williams gazed at the simple \n     wooden house she grew up in. She remembered sitting out on \n     the front porch with her daddy, watching him sell \n     watermelons--three for $1--in the 1950s. ``They were good and \n     sweet,'' she said. It was a different world back then.\n       One by one, President Eisenhower's top advisers paraded \n     into the Cabinet Room of the White House and took their \n     places around the big mahogany table. The discussion on this \n     morning, Dec. 10, 1954, quickly turned to the workaday \n     business of running the country: an initiative to add 70,000 \n     units of public housing, the Buy American Act, the need for \n     preventive medical care. Yet one subject, above all, seemed \n     to stir the participants' passion: raising the minimum \n     wage.\n       Mr. Eisenhower--the first Republican to occupy the White \n     House since the minimum wage was enacted--had floated the \n     idea of increasing it from 75 cents an hour early in the \n     year. Now, with the economy humming along, it appeared the \n     perfect time to put the plan in motion. Even the president's \n     economic adviser, the cautious Arthur Burns, agreed that the \n     only question left to decide was what ``the optimum figure'' \n     for the new wage would be.\n       Handwritten notes from the cabinet meeting, stored at the \n     Eisenhower Library, suggest that the president listened \n     intently to the numbers being bandied about. George Humphrey, \n     the treasury secretary, declared that going to $1 an hour \n     ``would be too much'' and could undermine smooth relations \n     with the business community. All eyes then fell on Labor \n     Secretary Jim Mitchell, a plain-spoken man who had once been \n     in charge of employee relations at Bloomingdale's. One \n     dollar, he countered, ``has great appeal.'' The vice \n     president, Richard Nixon, added that it would be \n     ``unfortunate'' if the administration recommended less than \n     $1 because that would only enhance the odds that Democrats in \n     Congress would ``raise the ante.''\n       Finally, Mr. Eisenhower spoke up. ``We just have to seek \n     that place where both sides will curse us,'' he said. ``Then \n     we'll be right.''\n       The law establishing the federal minimum wage, the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938, had called for just such a \n     balancing act. It stipulated that workers be paid at least \n     enough to maintain a ``minimum standard of living necessary \n     for health, efficiency and general well-being.'' At the same \n     time, though, it sought to do this ``without substantially \n     curtailing employment.''\n       Mr. Eisenhower ultimately proposed an increase to 90 \n     cents--and the cursing came on cue. The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce warned that a 90-cent minimum would be ``self-\n     defeating'' because many mom-and-pop businesses would have to \n     shut their doors and lay people off, hurting the very low-\n     skilled workers who were supposed to benefit. George Meany, \n     the president of the American Federation of Labor, denounced \n     the administration's plan as ``grossly inadequate'' to lift \n     up the poor and pushed for $1.25 an hour.\n       In many ways, the economic debate hasn't changed much over \n     the years. Opponents have long claimed that imposing a higher \n     minimum wage kills jobs. ``The direct unemployment,'' wrote \n     Prof. George Stigler in a landmark article in the June 1946 \n     American Economic Review, ``is substantial and certain.''\n       Just yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     told a congressional hearing that he would abolish the \n     minimum wage if he could. ``I'm not in favor of cutting \n     anybody's earnings or preventing them from rising,'' he \n     said, ``but I am against them losing\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n     their jobs because of artificial government intervention, \n     which is essentially what the minimum wage is.''\n       Yet other analysts have disagreed, touting the minimum wage \n     as an effective means for helping working people to escape \n     poverty. Those in this camp contend that as long as it isn't \n     excessive, an increase in the minimum wage will destroy few, \n     if any, jobs. Their rationale: As businesses raise their \n     wages, they're apt to suffer less turnover and will often \n     find that their employees are more diligent, leading to a \n     jump in output that more than makes up for the extra cost to \n     the payroll.\n       As the Eisenhower plan moved to Capitol Hill, the action \n     unfolded in a manner typical of the era. Democrats, by and \n     large, wanted a higher minimum wage than did their GOP \n     counterparts. But the divide wasn't purely partisan. Southern \n     Democrats railed against a raise, while ``liberal \n     Republicans'' favored one.\n       In July 1955, a bill emerged from Congress to increase the \n     minimum wage to $1. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Eisenhower \n     signed the legislation into law. ``I think `fairness' is a \n     good word'' to express what the president hoped to achieve, \n     says Maxwell Rabb, who was Mr. Eisenhower's cabinet \n     secretary. ``He did not want a divided nation,'' and lifting \n     wages for those at the bottom was part of that larger agenda.\n       The minimum wage went up again during each of the next two \n     administrations--those of presidents Kennedy and Johnson--and \n     coverage also was extended to more than 12 million workers, \n     including retail and restaurant employees and farm hands, who \n     previously had been exempt. By 1968, as Richard Nixon was \n     elected president, the value of the minimum wage had hit its \n     apex: $6.82 an hour in today's terms.\n       Many lawmakers fixed their sights on the average wage in \n     the U.S., taking care to keep the minimum at about half that \n     amount. ``People feel poor when their income is less than 50% \n     of the average,'' explained Rep. Al Quie of Minnesota, who \n     served for 11 terms beginning in 1958 and would go on to \n     become ranking Republican on the House Labor Committee.\n       Mr. Quie and other key players from the minimum-wage wars \n     of yesteryear--including members of both parties--say their \n     advocacy for increases was propelled, in large part, by a \n     fundamental belief: People who get up and go to work each day \n     deserve to make enough money to cover their essential needs. \n     Employers that aren't productive enough to provide such a \n     basic level of compensation--``chiselers,'' some detractors \n     have called them--don't belong in an affluent society.\n       This way of thinking, recalls Eugene Mittelman, who served \n     as labor counsel for GOP Sen. Jacob Javits of New York from \n     the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, transcended all the \n     conflicting studies about how the minimum wage affected \n     unemployment, inflation and poverty. ``It was more of a \n     general feeling that if people worked, they ought to make a \n     living wage,'' he says. ``This wasn't economically driven. It \n     was morally driven.''\n       The Shreveport that Pat Williams was born into in the \n     spring of 1955 was an oil-and-gas boomtown, where folks \n     swayed to the music of Elvis Presley, the young star of the \n     ``Louisiana Hayride,'' a radio show aired right from the \n     city's own Municipal Auditorium.\n       The Williams household didn't partake in the good times, \n     however. The family never had much money, and Pat was raised \n     under the loving but strict hand of a Jehovah's Witness. She \n     was, she says, ``a good kid'' until, at age 13, she made a \n     startling discovery: The couple she thought were her \n     parents--the domestic and retired carpenter she had known her \n     whole life as ``Mommy and Daddy''--were actually her aunt and \n     uncle. Pat's real mother had abandoned her as a baby.\n       The revelation ``totally messed me up,'' she says. ``I went \n     from getting A's and B's in school to D's and F's, when I \n     showed up at all.''\n       By 19, Ms. Williams was a 10th-grade dropout with three \n     children, no husband and no job. Then, one day in 1979, she \n     says, ``something inside me clicked.'' Bored with just \n     lounging around, living off welfare, and overwhelmed by a \n     sense that ``I wanted my children to have more than I did,'' \n     Ms. Williams set out to find work.\n       She landed a job at the Hollywood Tourist Courts, a rooms-\n     by-the-hour motel where she cleaned up and checked in \n     patrons, some of them acquaintances of hers apparently \n     sneaking off for illicit trysts. She received only minimum \n     wage--then $2.90 an hour--but ``it felt good,'' she says, to \n     be bringing in her own money. ``I was proud.''\n       What's more, Ms. Williams found that even on her salary--\n     which was equivalent to $6.34 an hour in today's dollars--she \n     was able to meet her routine expenses without much of a \n     strain. She usually had enough money left on the weekends to \n     take her brood to Mister Swiss, a hamburger joint next to the \n     motel, where they'd grab lunch and pop the leftover change \n     into the jukebox. Despite being poor, says Ms. Williams, \n     ``those days were more carefree.''\n       Over the next two years, the minimum wage rose to $3.35 an \n     hour, or $6.08 in today's terms, following a four-step \n     increase that had been passed in 1977. Little did Ms. \n     Williams know that this would mark the last time the minimum \n     wage would be raised for nearly a decade, undoing a practice \n     that had been carried out by seven U.S. presidents--and \n     leaving her further and further behind.\n       In the summer of 1969, an analysis written by a former \n     commissioner of labor statistics named Ewan Clague crossed \n     President Nixon's desk. It indicated that the minimum wage \n     was exacerbating one of the most vexing problems confronting \n     the nation at the time: a skyrocketing youth unemployment \n     rate. A business owner subject to the minimum wage, Mr. \n     Clague wrote, ``cannot afford to put up with a mediocre job \n     performance by inexperienced youngsters.''\n       Mr. Nixon's answer--a proposal whose development can be \n     traced through numerous documents culled from the National \n     Archives--was to allow employers to pay 16- and 17-year-olds \n     a ``youth subminimum,'' an amount even lower than the minimum \n     wage. The logic was simple: High-school dropouts could then \n     find entry-level positions much more easily, acquiring the \n     skills and work habits they'd need to eventually secure more-\n     rewarding jobs. Yet the plan faced many critics, who feared \n     that business owners would engage in, as Sen. Javits put it, \n     the ``wholesale replacement'' of adult workers with younger, \n     cheaper employees.\n       A bill to raise the minimum wage finally passed the \n     Democratic-controlled Congress in August 1973. However, it \n     didn't include a youth subminimum, and it sought to ramp up \n     the wage on a faster timetable than many Republicans thought \n     prudent. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union \n     launched a campaign urging Mr. Nixon to sign the bill; the \n     corset and brassiere assemblers from Local 32 in New York \n     alone mailed him more than 1,500 postcards and letters. \n     Unimpressed, Mr. Nixon vetoed the legislation.\n       Mr. Meany, the AFL-CIO chief, slammed the president's \n     decision as a ``cruel blow'' to low-wage workers, while \n     Harrison Williams of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of \n     the Senate Labor Committee, accused Mr. Nixon of exhibiting \n     ``a callous disregard'' for the working poor. But in \n     hindsight, what's most striking about the standoff--so bitter \n     and protracted that the legislative history would one day \n     fill a bound volume more than two inches thick--is that few \n     voices ever assailed the minimum wage itself.\n       ``There can be no doubt about the need for a higher minimum \n     wage,'' Mr. Nixon said in his veto message. ``Both fairness \n     and decency require that we act. . . .''\n       In the spring of 1974, Congress passed a new minimum-wage \n     bill, which still lacked a youth subminimum. But this time, \n     on April 8, Mr. Nixon signed it, a deed that would get a \n     little lost on the next morning's front page given other news \n     out of Atlanta: Hank Aaron had just smashed his record-\n     setting 715th major-league home run.\n       Few in the president's party protested the raise, which \n     took the minimum wage to $2.30 an hour ($6.25 in 2001 terms) \n     from $1.60 over three years. That made up for much of the \n     inflation that had eaten away at it since the last increase \n     in '68. The president himself proclaimed that, while Congress \n     ``did not go as far as I wished in protecting . . . work \n     opportunities for youth,'' the fight had dragged on long \n     enough. Improving the wages of workers whose earnings have \n     ``remained static for six years,'' he said, ``is now a matter \n     of justice that can no longer be fairly delayed.''\n       It wouldn't take much of a cynic to dismiss President \n     Nixon's comments as politically motivated, especially given \n     that he signed the bill as the Watergate scandal neared its \n     climax. Surely, he no longer had the muscle to sustain \n     another veto. But several Nixon advisers insist that to read \n     it this way would be mistaken.\n       ``This wasn't a political sop to anybody,'' says Ken Cole, \n     then Mr. Nixon's point man on domestic-policy issues. ``He \n     believed in what he was doing.''\n       Whenever Labor Department supervisor Willis Nordlund needed \n     some esoteric piece of information on the minimum wage, he \n     knew right where to turn: the big bank of file cabinets \n     inside room C-3319 at the department's cavernous Washington \n     headquarters--a depository so chockfull, he says, it \n     contained handwritten charts going back to the days of the \n     New Deal.\n       And so, Mr. Nordlund recalls, it was more than a little \n     shocking when one morning, sometime in the late 1980s, he \n     walked into the third-floor file room, only to find all the \n     material thrown out by another supervisor who wanted the \n     space.\n       For someone who had taken to heart Franklin Roosevelt's \n     assessment that, next to Social Security, the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act ranked as ``the most far-reaching, far-sighted \n     program for the benefit of workers ever adopted,'' it was not \n     an easy period. Mr. Nordlund's budget for research into the \n     minimum wage had been slashed through the Reagan years. Now, \n     the cleaning out of the files, he says, was ``the final kick \n     in the gut''--to him and, symbolically at least, to the \n     minimum wage itself. ``This was an administration,'' he says, \n     ``that just wanted the minimum wage to go away.''\n       Indeed, it did. A mere six years after Richard Nixon had \n     talked about raising it as ``a matter of justice'' and three \n     years after Jimmy Carter had raised it again, Ronald Reagan \n     blasted the minimum wage as the cause of ``more misery and \n     unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.''\n       Seen this way, raising the minimum wage wasn't moral; it \n     was downright ``immoral,'' says economist Milton Friedman, \n     the intellectual godfather of the Reagan revolution. ``If \n     you're willing to work for $1.25 an hour,\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n     and I'm willing to pay you $1.25 an hour because that's what \n     you're worth, are you better off being unemployed'' because \n     the government insists on a higher wage?\n       This wasn't a wholly new line of reasoning, to be sure. But \n     after President Reagan was elected, ``the tone changed,'' \n     says Sen. Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a \n     leading champion of a higher minimum wage. ``It was much more \n     ideological.''\n       For the first time ever, a president and his top aides set \n     out to see the minimum wage wither. ``If we would have had \n     our druthers,'' acknowledges Murray Weidenbaum, the chairman \n     of Mr. Reagan's first Council of Economic Advisers, ``we \n     would have eliminated it.'' However, because that would have \n     been such ``a painful political process,'' Mr. Weidenbaum \n     says that he and other officials were content to let \n     inflation turn the minimum wage into ``an effective dead \n     letter.''\n       The administration's antipathy was fueled by scholarship \n     similar to that which Mr. Nixon had zeroed in on earlier: The \n     minimum wage, these studies found, was a barrier to \n     employment for low-skilled workers, especially African-\n     American teens.\n       Much of this research was the product of a ``neoclassical'' \n     movement in economics that had been gaining steam in academic \n     circles since the 1960s, thanks in no small part to the \n     influence of University of Chicago professors, including Mr. \n     Friedman and George Stigler. The school emphasized the \n     virtues of economic efficiency. The concept that every worker \n     is entitled to a ``living wage,'' regardless of his or her \n     skills, ``was no longer part of the discussion,'' says Robert \n     Prasch, who teaches the history of economic thought at \n     Middlebury College.\n       At one point, Mr. Reagan proposed his own version of a \n     youth subminimum. But unlike President Nixon, whose promotion \n     of a lesser pay scale for teenagers had been tempered by a \n     sense that the minimum wage shouldn't be allowed to erode too \n     much in general, Mr. Reagan saw almost any meddling in the \n     marketplace as anathema. The president ``believed that the \n     government should not have the right to step in and bar \n     employment opportunities for anyone,'' says John Cogan, who \n     served as an assistant secretary in the Reagan Labor \n     Department. ``The moral issue was very clear in his mind.''\n       It was for others as well. Many of the Republicans who rode \n     on Mr. Reagan's coattails in 1980 ``thought just like he \n     did'' on the minimum wage, says John Motley, who was then a \n     lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, \n     a group representing small enterprise. In fact, he says, \n     about two dozen lawmakers elected to Congress that year--far \n     more than ever before--were NFIB members. On Capitol Hill, \n     entrepreneurs were treated increasingly as ``heroic \n     figures,'' Mr. Motley says. ``The government needed to help \n     them, not saddle them with mandates and regulations.''\n       As the NFIB and other minimum-wage adversaries such as the \n     National Restaurant Association ascended, the policy's \n     greatest guardian fell on hard times. Following President \n     Reagan's firing of striking air-traffic controllers in 1981, \n     labor unions went on the defensive and were unable to fight \n     as tenaciously as they had in the past for a higher minimum \n     wage. All the while, the portion of the work force that's \n     unionized declined steadily, edging under 20% in 1984.\n       When Mr. Reagan took office in 1981, the minimum wage was \n     at $3.35 an hour. When he left eight years later, it was \n     still at $3.35. In real terms, its value had sunk almost 27%, \n     to $4.46 in today's dollars.\n       Back in Shreveport, Pat Williams grappled with the \n     consequences. After a couple of years at the Hollywood \n     Courts, she left the motel for a better job, cooking soul \n     food at a restaurant called the Riverboat Inn for the \n     comparatively lofty pay of $5.75 an hour. But the place shut \n     down in the mid-1980s, and Ms. Williams wound up as a nursing \n     assistant at Harmony House, back on the minimum wage.\n       As her purchasing power dwindled, Ms. Williams scrimped. \n     Where her family once enjoyed a varied diet, including \n     all sorts of meat, by the late '80s they ate strictly \n     chicken--so much of it that her kids would break out in \n     song around the dinner table:\n\n       Chicken fly high\n       Chicken fly low\n       Chicken fly Mamma's way\n       Don't fly no mo'\n\n       When the chicken money ran out, the children recall, they \n     subsisted on beans and rice.\n       The worst, though, was the holidays. Ms. Williams and the \n     kids--Theresa, Youlonda and Darrell--all still vividly \n     remember the Christmas that they couldn't afford a single \n     gift. Youlonda says that she and her siblings tried to \n     comfort their mom, telling her it was all right, that they \n     understood. But Ms. Williams just sat on her bed and cried. \n     Eventually, she came out of her room and turned on the \n     stereo. She doesn't remember exactly what she played that \n     December afternoon, but she's sure it was her favorite music: \n     the blues.\n       ``If you really listen to the blues,'' she says, ``you find \n     out it's nothing but the truth.''\n       A half dozen Harmony House workers sat on Ms. Williams's \n     threadbare couches one evening last April, sipping beers and \n     peering through a cigarette haze, as union organizer Zack \n     Nauth offered up something rare in their lives: a word of \n     hope.\n       Louisiana nursing homes, which had been complaining that \n     deficient Medicaid reimbursements were the main culprit for \n     their workers' low pay, were slated to receive a $60 million \n     infusion from the state. Mr. Nauth, of the Service Employees \n     International Union, told the women that they needed to speak \n     up and make sure they got their fair share. The nursing \n     homes, Mr. Nauth said, would ``just as soon put it all into \n     their own bank accounts.''\n       The women were skeptical that any of it would come their \n     way, however, and spent most of the night venting. One \n     worker, Shirley Vance, was particularly testy and questioned \n     why they even have a union at Harmony House. ``I don't see no \n     results,'' she said, griping about her biweekly dues of \n     $6.50. But Ms. Williams and her friend, Annie Freeman, \n     maintained that the union has been a real plus. Workers had \n     fewer rights and virtually no benefits, they said, before the \n     SEIU got there. ``We've had to fight for what we have,'' said \n     Ms. Williams.\n       Of the six women at the meeting, all were making less than \n     $6 an hour, including one who has been at Harmony House for \n     18 years. ``We can't survive on what they pay us,'' said Ms. \n     Freeman, a nursing assistant who, after more than a decade at \n     the home, earns $5.60 an hour.\n       ``We sure can't,'' echoed Ms. Vance. ``It's pitiful.''\n       Before the meeting broke up, the conversation turned to the \n     minimum wage. Mr. Nauth told the group that he's \n     heard rumblings that Congress may vote on an increase this \n     year. Ms. Williams said she gets ``all excited'' at the \n     prospect but knows better than to count on it. The last \n     time lawmakers deliberated on such legislation, just last \n     year, it died.\n       Since Ronald Reagan left office, the minimum wage has been \n     raised twice: with great reluctance by President Bush in 1989 \n     and by President Clinton in 1996. Both followed drawn-out \n     battles defined by the kind of partisan sniping that has come \n     with the changed complexion of Congress. Many of the seats \n     once held by Southern Democrats have been seized by \n     Republicans, and the number of GOP moderates who used to \n     support the minimum wage has shriveled in the conservative \n     tide.\n       One new twist, added to the debate in recent rounds, is \n     that tax breaks for small businesses are now routinely linked \n     to any minimum-wage bill. The only way low-wage workers get \n     help is if company owners do, too. In earlier years, ``that \n     would have been laughed out of the room by both sides,'' says \n     Ken Young, a long-time AFL-CIO official. No one thought about \n     business breaks ``when you were talking about the people at \n     the very bottom end of the economic ladder.''\n       With the minimum wage worth less today than it was all \n     through the '60s and ' 70s, a backlash has developed around \n     the nation. Ten states and the District of Columbia now have \n     their own minimum wages that are higher than the federal \n     government's. And in a host of cities, so-called living-wage \n     campaigns have been undertaken to raise workers' pay to \n     anywhere from around $8.00 an hour--what it takes for someone \n     to support a family of four above the poverty line--to more \n     than $10.\n       The immediate aim of the Harmony House workers, though, was \n     far more modest: a $1-an-hour increase. Mr. Nauth asked the \n     women to devise a slogan that they could use to rally the \n     public to their cause. Ms. Freeman's entry: ``Take Care of \n     the People Who Take Care of Yours.''\n       Several of the women said they think from time to time \n     about finding another job. The Shreveport economy has been \n     strong lately, and most ``anybody that's got some get-up-and-\n     go'' should be able to find work that pays satisfactorily, \n     says Mayor Keith Hightower. The median pay for telemarketers \n     in the area is $8.50 an hour. Housekeepers at the casinos \n     earn up to $7. But for someone like Ms. Williams, who burns \n     up so much energy just trying to make it day to day, job \n     hunting seems hugely daunting.\n       Besides, she and the others say that, save for their wages, \n     they feel good about what they do. The nursing home residents \n     ``are like family,'' says Ms. Williams, who keeps photographs \n     of her patients who've passed on. In the mid-'90s, Ms. \n     Williams left Harmony House for a hospital job that paid a \n     bit better, but she came back a couple of years later because \n     she didn't like the atmosphere at the new place nearly as \n     much.\n       Over at Harmony House, a low-slung edifice that's \n     antiseptic-clean inside, officials say they'd love to pay \n     their workers more, but the Medicaid situation has made it \n     impossible. ``We've really been in a pinch,'' says James \n     Shelton, a supervisor at Central Management Co., a \n     Winnfield, La.-based firm whose principals own and operate \n     Harmony House along with other nursing homes around the \n     state. Nevertheless, the company's president saw his own \n     pay go up 44% in 1999. According to the latest available \n     records from the state health department, Teddy Price's \n     salary soared to $402,943 that year from $279,282 in 1998. \n     A spokeswoman says the increase reflects Mr. Price's \n     heightened responsibilities during the past few years as \n     Central Management has added five new facilities to its \n     portfolio.\n       Less than a week after The Wall Street Journal asked \n     Central Management about its workers' wages, Harmony House \n     announced that ``because of market conditions,'' it was \n     raising the pay of its certified nursing assistants. \n     Housekeepers, laundry workers and kitchen personnel got no \n     increase.\n       Ms. Williams says she's ``grateful.'' She now makes $6.35 \n     an hour--pay that's about equal in value to that of her first \n     minimum-wage job, 22 years ago.\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n                       The Faces of Low-Wage Work\n\n       Name: Gussie Cannedy.\n       Age: 76.\n       Home: Philadelphia.\n       Occupation: Answers phones at the American Red Cross.\n       Hourly wage: $5.15.\n       Ms. Cannedy, a widow who retired as a clothing-factory \n     supervisor in 1985, works at the Red Cross to supplement her \n     $715 in monthly Social Security income.

Madam President, I rise to recognize and \ncongratulate Rena Marie Van Tine of Chicago on her recent appointment \nas an Associate Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, IL. When she \nwas sworn in on June 12, 2001, Ms. Van Tine became not only the first \njudge in Illinois of South Asian heritage, but the first female Indian \nAmerican judge in the Nation.\n  With a fast-growing community of Asian Americans in Cook County, it \nis important that the Judiciary reflects the diversity of the people it \nserves. I applaud Chief Judge Donald P. O'Connell and other Circuit \nJudges of Cook County for electing this outstanding lawyer to join them \non the bench.\n  Judge Van Tine is a highly experienced attorney with a distinguished \nrecord of service to the people of Illinois. She most recently served \nas Special Counsel to Illinois State Comptroller Daniel W. Hynes, in a \nposition where she oversaw the regulation of approximately one billion \ndollars in Illinois consumer trust funds entrusted pursuant to the laws \ngoverning the cemetery and funeral industries.\n  Prior to joining the Comptroller's Office, Judge Van Tine was a Cook \nCounty Assistant State's Attorney for 12 years. In this capacity she \ntried hundreds of cases, both in the Criminal Division where she \nprosecuted violent offenders, as well as in the Civil Division where \nshe saved taxpayers millions of dollars in lawsuits.\n  In addition to her public service positions, Judge Van Tine has been \nactive with voluntary bar activities. A past president of the Asian \nAmerican Bar Association and a former executive committee member of the \nAlliance of Bar Associations for Judicial Screening, she is currently \non the board of the Women's Bar Association of Illinois, and is a \nfounding member of the Chicago chapter of the Indian-American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Her contributions to the legal profession are extensive. Judge Van \nTine was an adjunct professor for Trial Advocacy at the Chicago-Kent \nCollege of Law, and has served as a mock judge for local and national \nmoot court competitions. She has written a book chapter in the American \nBar Association's publication of ``Dear Sisters, Dear Daughters: Words \nof Wisdom from Multicultural Women Attorneys Who've Been There and Done \nThat.'' She also assisted in establishing a legal clinic at the Indo-\nAmerican Center, which has been providing legal assistance to the Asian \nAmerican community since 1997.\n  Judge Van Tine has made numerous appearances at law schools, bar \nprograms, and symposiums to educate law students, attorneys, and \ncommunity members about various aspects of law and issues affecting \nAsian Americans, such as hate crimes. She has also discussed the issue \nof running ethical judicial campaigns on a cable program aired by the \nIllinois Judges Association.\n  Judge Van Tine is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church where \nshe has participated in conducting Cabrini Green Health workshops for \nchildren, serving as a Cook County Hospital candy striper, and \nvolunteering as a Sunday nursery school teacher.\n  Judge Van Tine earned her law degree at New York Law School and her \nundergraduate degree from Oakland University. She has completed several \ngraduate courses at Michigan State University focusing on inter-\ncultural communication. Judge Van Tine has been married for 13 years to \nMatthew Van Tine, an attorney specializing in commercial and antitrust \nlitigation. They have a young daughter named Kristen.\n  As the senior Senator of the State of Illinois, I ask my colleagues \nto join me on the occasion of her appointment to the bench in \ncongratulating Rena Marie Van Tine for all of her \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8061-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONNA CENTRELLA\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDonna Centrella, a very special woman whom I met 2 years ago during my \ncampaign in New York. Donna died on Monday after a long, brave battle \nwith ovarian cancer.\n  I first met Donna in September 1999 when I visited Massena Memorial \nHospital in Massena, NY. Donna had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer \nin August, but did not have health insurance to cover her treatment. \nMiraculously, she found a doctor who would treat her without insurance \nand she was able to afford care through a variety of State programs.\n  Perhaps even more astounding was her doctor's statement that she was \nactually better off without managed care coverage because he could \nbetter treat her that way. Without HMO constraints, they were free to \nmake the decisions about the best procedures to follow for her \ntreatment and care: Her doctor could keep her in the hospital as long \nas needed and he would not have to get pre-approval for surgery.\n  I have retold Donna's unbelievable story many times since meeting \nthis extraordinary woman. Hers is a story that underscores the profound \nneed in this country for immediate reform of the way we provide health \ncoverage to our citizens. We owe it to patients like Donna to sign \npatient protections into law as soon as possible to ensure that we can \nprovide the best medical treatment possible to everyone who needs it.\n  We have lost an ally, but I have faith that we will not lose the \nfight for greater patient protections. It saddens me greatly that Donna \nwill not be here to see it happen. She was an amazing soul whose \ndetermination and strength I will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8061-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8061-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8062-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n    REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO TERRORISTS WHO \n  THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to terrorists \nwho threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process that was declared \nin Executive Order 12947 of January 23, 1995.\n                                                      George W.

They must choose receipt of one or the other or \n     waive an amount of retirement pay equal to the amount of \n     disability compensation; and\n       Whereas, no other federal employees face a reduction in \n     civil service retirement benefits if they also receive \n     compensation for a service-connected disability; and\n       Whereas, federal legislation has been introduced to amend \n     Title 38 of the U.S. Code to treat career military retirees \n     like other federal retirees and permit them to receive \n     service-connected disability compensation without requiring a \n     concurrent deduction from retirement pay; and\n       Whereas, it is fundamentally unfair to require military \n     veterans to essentially fund their own disability \n     compensation by offsetting it against retirement benefits \n     earned in service to their country; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the general court of New Hampshire hereby urges the \n     United States Congress to\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\n     enact legislation to allow disabled, military retirees to \n     receive service-connected disability compensation benefits \n     without requiring them to waive an equal amount of retirement \n     pay; and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the house clerk \n     to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the chairpersons of committees of the \n     United States Congress having jurisdiction over Veterans \n     Affairs, the Secretary of Defense; and each member of the New \n     Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-145. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of New Hampshire relative to \n     supporting the electoral college; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 10\n\n       Whereas, the President of the United States has been \n     elected by the electoral college since the adoption of the \n     Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the electoral college promotes moderation in the \n     political process by encouraging the consideration of varying \n     perspectives and discouraging the exclusion of minorities of \n     all types, including geographic and philosophical minorities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the electoral college preserves and recognizes the \n     importance of states as states; and\n       Whereas, the electoral college promotes the separation of \n     powers, without which a federal system of government cannot \n     successfully function; and\n       Whereas, the constitutional concepts of the electoral \n     college, the bicameral legislature, and the nonelective \n     judiciary serve to articulate the superiority of fundamental \n     rights over majoritarianism; and\n       Whereas, the abolition of the electoral college necessarily \n     entails the abandonment of a constitutionally-enshrined and \n     historically-tested system in favor of an uncertain \n     alternative requiring federal control of the electoral \n     process; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the preservation of the electoral college is in the \n     best interests of this nation and all of its citizens; and\n       That any attempt to amend the Constitution to abolish the \n     electoral college should be defeated; and\n       That the clerk of the New Hampshire house of \n     representatives forward copies of this resolution to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States Senate, and to the members of \n     the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-146. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of New Hampshire relative to expanding eligibility \n     for membership in the American Legion; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, membership in the American Legion is restricted to \n     veterans who served during certain periods set by Congress of \n     wartime service; and\n       Whereas, membership in the American Legion is declining; \n     and\n       Whereas, many otherwise qualified veterans are prevented \n     from joining the American Legion due to the restrictions on \n     dates of service; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives in \n     General Court convened:\n       That the general court of the state of New Hampshire hereby \n     urges Congress to expand membership in the American Legion to \n     include all veterans with records of honorable, active duty \n     service in the United States Armed Forces, regardless of \n     dates of service; and\n       That copies of this resolution shall be forwarded by the \n     house clerk to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and to each member of the New Hampshire congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-147. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     insurance coverage for loss, damage, or diminution in value \n     to property caused by drought; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 140\n\n       Whereas, drought is a complex physical and social \n     phenomenon of widespread significance; and\n       Whereas, drought damage is unforeseenable and not \n     immediately identifiable; and\n       Whereas, the ongoing drought in some parts of the country \n     has an adverse impact on the economic growth; and\n       Whereas, many insurers will not recognize damages to \n     property caused by varied climatic conditions, lack of \n     precipitation for extended periods of time being just one \n     example; and\n       Whereas, many homeowner insurers do not recognize \n     structural damage caused by foundation shifts due to \n     adjustments in subsurface water levels as covered under their \n     respective policy provisions or within the policy definition \n     as an ``Act of God''; and\n       Whereas, millions of homeowners are forced to bear the \n     financial burden to repair homes for damage caused by natural \n     circumstances beyond their conrol but for which homeowner \n     insurance policies should protect against: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to study the feasibility of \n     insurance coverage for loss, damage, or diminution in value \n     to property caused by drought: Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-148. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the pending \n     charter boat moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 50\n\n       Whereas, the charter fishing industry in Louisiana is in \n     its infancy but has begun a period of healthy growth which \n     can only be beneficial to the state's overall economic \n     development and the capture of tourist dollars; and\n       Whereas, the Gulf States Fishery Management Council voted \n     this spring to send to the National Marine Fisheries Service \n     a recommendation for a three-year moratorium on the issuance \n     of new charter vessel permits for reef and coastal migratory \n     pelagic fishing; and\n       Whereas, the genesis of the recommended moratorium was \n     concern about the area of the Gulf of Mexico near Florida \n     where the charter industry is much more mature, much more \n     widespread, and has created a situation where there are too \n     many boats with too many fishermen competing for too few \n     fish; and\n       Whereas, the charter industry in Louisiana exists in a \n     significantly different environment, one where there is not \n     an overabundance of permitted charter boat captains and where \n     there is an abundance of habitat and fish which should result \n     in a productive charter industry; and\n       Whereas, a productive and expanding charter industry would \n     be of great benefit to the economic health of the state, a \n     benefit that would be denied the state of Louisiana if the \n     moratorium were adopted and new charter captains would not be \n     eligible for permitting. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the Louisiana Congressional \n     delegation and the United States Congress to express its \n     desire to the National Marine Fisheries Service that the \n     pending charter boat moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico not be \n     implemented. Be it further\n       Resolved, That if a moratorium is considered by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service, that the moratorium be \n     limited to the eastern Gulf of Mexico with an authorization \n     for continued expansion of the industry in the western Gulf \n     of Mexico where there are no issues of overcrowding. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     each member of the Louisiana Congressional delegation and to \n     the presiding officers of the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-149. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the Outer \n     Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of \n     Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, it has been almost four years since the \n     environmental impact statement was prepared for the Oil and \n     Gas Lease Sales 169, 172, 175, 178, and 182 in the Gulf of \n     Mexico; and\n       Whereas, as a result of public testimony in response to \n     that environmental impact statement, there was recognition of \n     the significant impact which will be felt relative to the \n     infrastructure in offshore activity focal points such as Port \n     Fourchon and LA Highway 1 through the parish of Lafourche; \n     and\n       Whereas, at the present time, 40 of the 45 deep water rigs \n     working in the Gulf of Mexico are being serviced through Port \n     Fourchon, as are many of the rigs located on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf, with the accompanying increase in land \n     traffic and inland waterway traffic, all primarily through \n     the parish of Lafourche; and\n       Whereas, efforts have so far failed to develop plans to \n     mitigate these present and well-documented impacts while \n     efforts to increase the number of leases in the Gulf of \n     Mexico continue with no apparent effort to provide mitigation \n     for current or increased impacts. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States to \n     direct the Minerals Management Service of the United States \n     Department of the Interior to develop a plan for impact \n     mitigation relative to the Outer Continental Shelf oil and \n     gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, to each member of the \n     Louisiana Congressional delegation, and to the director of \n     the Minerals Management Service.\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-150.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-151.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to address the \n     problem of sexual trafficking and to support the bipartisan \n     federal initiatives to prosecute traffickers and assist \n     victimized women and girls.

RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1219. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nswine and bovine waste nutrients as a renewable energy resource for the \nrenewable electricity production credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for years I have worked to decrease our \nreliance on foreign sources of energy and accelerate and diversify \ndomestic energy production. I believe public policy ought to promote \nrenewable domestic production that burns clean energy. For this reason, \nI will be introducing the Providing Opportunities With Effluent \nRenewables, or POWER Act today which cultivates another homegrown \nresource: swine and bovine waste nutrients.\n  Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a production tax \ncredit for electricity produced from renewable sources. Currently, the \nproduction tax credit is available for wind, closed-loop biomass, and \npoultry waste. The\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\nPOWER Act will modify Section 45 to include swine and bovine waste \nnutrient as a renewable energy source.\n  The benefits of swine and bovine waste nutrient as a renewable \nresource are enormous. Right now, there are at least 20 dairy and hog \nfarms in the United States that use an anaerobic digester or similar \nsystems to convert manure into electricity. These facilities include \nswine and/or dairy operations in California, Wisconsin, New York, \nConnecticut, Vermont, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, \nMinnesota, and my home State of Iowa.\n  By using animal waste as an energy source, a livestock producer can \nreduce or eliminate monthly energy purchases from electric and gas \nsuppliers. In fact, a dairy operation in Minnesota that uses this \ntechnology generates enough electricity to run the entire dairy \noperation, saving close to $700 a week in electricity costs. This dairy \nfarm also sells the excess power to their electrical provider, \nfurnishing enough electricity to power 78 homes each month, year round.\n  The benefits of using an anaerobic digester do not end at electricity \nproduction. Using this technology can reduce and sometimes nearly \neliminate offensive odors from the animal waste. In addition, the \nprocess of anaerobic digestion results in a higher quality fertilizer. \nThe dairy farm I referenced earlier estimates that the fertilizing \nvalue of the animal waste is increased by 50 percent. Additional \nenvironmental benefits include mitigating animal waste's contribution \nto air, surface, and groundwater pollution.\n  With all the problems that this type of opportunity remedies, I'm \nsure there will be a number of folks wondering why we haven't tried \nthis before. The reason is, even if we had provided swine and bovine \nproducers with tax incentives to produce renewable energy, they \nprobably wouldn't have had access to the capital necessary for \ninfrastructure development.\n  In fact, there was a segment on National Public Radio last week \naddressing the topic of anaerobic digester energy production. A \nprofessor from Cal State University who is an expert on anaerobic \ndigesters was interviewed. The professor explained that the main reason \nfarmers have not pursued this type of opportunity is cost.\n  For that reason, in addition to the tax credit opportunity I'm \nproviding under section 45, I'm also going to guarantee within the \nPOWER Act that funds be made available under the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program for the development of anaerobic digesters.\n  Currently, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program provides \nfunding for technical, educational, and financial assistance to farmers \nand ranchers for soil, water, and related natural resource concerns on \ntheir land. A component of the program allows for improvements to farm \nmanure management systems. The POWER Act will guarantee that payments, \nup to two years worth of funding which currently amount to $100,000, \nwould be made available to producers for ``cost sharing'' opportunities \nrelated to anaerobic digester implementation.\n  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient as an energy source can \ncultivate profitability while improving environmental quality. \nMaximizing farm resources in such a manner may prove essential to \nremain competitive and environmentally sustainable in today's livestock \nmarket.\n  In addition, more widespread use of this technology will create jobs \nrelated to the design, operation, and manufacture of energy recovery \nsystems. The development of renewable energy opportunities will help us \ndiminish our foreign energy dependence while promoting ``green energy'' \nproduction. This tax/farmbill proposal is real ``win-win'' situation \nfor America and for our livestock producers.\n  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient is a perfect example of how the \nagriculture and energy industries can come together to develop an \nenvironmentally friendly renewable resource. My legislation will foster \nincreased investment and development in waste to energy technology \nthereby improving farmer profitability, environmental quality, and \nenergy productivity and reliability.\n  Why should we promote swine and bovine waste nutrient as an energy \nsource? Consider the recent electricity shortage in California, the \nsky-high prices at the pump throughout last year and the soaring cost \nof home heating fuel and natural gas this winter. We have an obligation \nto consumers across the country to accelerate the nation's production \nof homegrown, clean-burning, renewable sources of energy.\n  The POWER Act is good for agriculture, good for the environment, good \nfor energy consumers, and promotes a good, make that great, renewable \nresource that will reduce our energy dependence on foreign fuels. It is \nmy hope that all of my colleagues join with me to advance this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Specter, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1220. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a grant program for the rehabilitation, preservation or \nimprovement of railroad track; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Smith of Oregon \nand I have introduced the Railroad Track Modernization Act. As chairman \nand ranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, the needs of the Nation's small railroads have been brought \nto our attention by railroad experts during hearings concerning the \nstate of the railroad industry. Our colleagues Senators Schumer, \nDurbin, and Specter join us in introducing this legislation.\n  Short line railroads have saved tens of thousands of miles of light \ndensity rail line from abandonment. In 1980, there were 220 short line \nrailroads in the U.S. Today there are over 500 short line railroads, \ndue in part to the mergers and streamlining of Class I operations which \nencouraged the larger companies to sell off their little-used or \nabandoned branch lines. Short line and regional railroads are an \nimportant and growing component of the railroad industry. Today they \noperate and maintain 20 percent of the American railroad industry's \nroute mileage and account for 9 percent of the rail industry's freight \nrevenue and 11 percent of railroad employment.\n  These line railroads employ approximately 25,000 individuals, serve \nthousands of local and rural shippers and are often the only connection \nthese shippers have to the national rail network. To survive, this \ninfrastructure needs to be upgraded in order to move the heavier cars \nthat are currently being moved by the Class I railroads. The revenues \nof the smaller railroads are not sufficient to get the job done.\n  Since 1982, the short lines and regional have maintained the track in \nrural areas where rail service would have been abandoned by the Class I \nrailroad. Because of their relatively low traffic levels, the Class I \nrailroads could not afford to invest in this infrastructure and, as a \nresult, allowed these lines to slowly deteriorate. With a lower cost \nstructure and more flexible service, short line companies that both the \ntrack have been able to keep them going. However, the revenue is still \nnot high enough to make up for past years of neglect.\n  Today, two factors have combined to bring this situation to a head. \nFirst, the advent of the heavier 286,000-pound cars that are becoming \nthe standard of the Class I industry puts a greater premium on speed \nand precisely scheduled operations, the short line railroads must meet \nthese higher standards or be cut off from the national system.\n  This legislation does not create a long term program to fix this \nproblem, but instead it creates a one time fix for this problem. While \nthese small railroads have enough traffic to operate profitably on an \nongoing basis, they do not earn enough to make the large capital \ninvestment required by the advent of the 286,000-pound cars or the need \nto significantly increase speed. This legislation would authorize a \nprogram which could provide grants to the nation's smaller railroads to \nhelp them make the improvements needed to stay in business and continue \nto serve small shippers.\n  This legislation is of vital importance to the economy of Louisiana \nand the Nation. Louisiana is home to ten\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\nsmall freight railroads that maintain rail service on over 500 miles of \ntrack. Without these small railroads, dozens of Louisiana communities \nand hundreds of employees would be cut off from our national rail \nnetwork.\n  In addition, small railroads are vital to the safety of our highways. \nEvery loaded rail car keeps as many as four trucks off to our nation's \nroads. At a time when we face record congestion and unprecedented \ndelays we can ill afford the influx of trucks caused by the failure of \nthe small freight railroad system. Millions of additional trucks per \nyear is not only bad for our interstate highways, but also for the \nstate rural roads in Louisiana. These roads will bear the brunt of \ndamage caused by the trucks, while dramatically increasing our highway \ncosts.\n  The Timber Rock Railroad, TIBR, serves Beauregard Parrish and handles \n15,000 carloads of freight per year, of which lumber and coal are the \nmajor commodities. Without the existence of TIBR, many major employers \nin western Louisiana such as Boise Cascade, Louisiana Pacific and \nEnergy Gulf States would be without any rail service at all. The New \nOrleans and Gulf Coast Railway runs for 24 miles from Gouldsboro Yard \nin New Orleans through Orleans, Jefferson, and Plaquemine Parishes to \nMyrtle Grove. New Orleans and Gulf Coast, NOGC, serves shippers such as \nChevron Chemical's Oak Point Plant, Harvest States' Myrtle Grove Grain \nExport Terminal, and TOSCO Petroleum's refinery at Alliance. Rail is \nthe safest mode of transportation for hazardous materials, and by \ntransporting hazardous materials by rail NOGC keeps hundreds of \ntruckloads of dangerous cargoes off of Highway 23 and the streets of \nNew Orleans. The Louisiana & Delta Railroad, L, is headquartered in \nNew Iberia, LA and operates 114 miles of track carrying 12,000 carloads \nof carbon black, sugar, molasses, pipe, rice and paper products. The \nrailroad serves dozens of customers in Lafayette, St. Martin, \nVermilion, Iberia, St. Mary, Assumption, and Lafourche Parishes. In \norder to upgrade the infrastructure of Louisiana's short lines and \nthose around the nation who provide the same kind of local service as \nthe TIER, NOGC, and L, the Railroad Track Modernization Act should be \npassed.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

To simplify, \nVA currently provides access to health care under the following \npriority scheme: veterans who have suffered service-connected \ndisabilities have first opportunity to enroll for VA care; then, \nveterans who are former prisoners of war, those who are \ncatastrophically disabled, and those who have no where else to turn for \nhealth care because of financial constraints may enroll for VA care; \nand, finally, veterans who simply choose to seek VA care even though \nthey can afford care elsewhere, and, in testimony to the quality of \ncare VA provides, many do, are invited to enroll. Currently, VA\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nwelcomes all veterans to enroll for care, and VA generally turns away \nno veteran who seeks hospital or clinical care. But lower priority \npatients are required to make copayments for the care and the \nmedications they receive from VA.\n  As I have noted, poor veterans, technically, those who are classified \nas being ``unable to defray the expenses of necessary care,'' have \npriority over veterans who have nonservice-connected illnesses or \ndisabilities. In order to determine who is, in fact, ``unable to \ndefray,'' VA uses a single, national ``means test.'' In effect, a \nveteran without dependents who has an annual income of less than \n$23,688 has priority access to VA care at no charge; a veteran with a \nhigher annual income who does not otherwise qualify for priority status \nis required to make a copayment to receive the same care. In addition, \nthat patient is placed in the pool of ``discretionary'' patients who \nface the risk of disenrollment should VA budget shortfalls ever require \nlimiting enrollment.\n  A single, national ``means test'' applies irrespective of cost-of-\nliving variations among geographic localities. In many other Federal \npay and benefits systems, by contrast, geographic cost-of-living \nvariations are taken into consideration. For example, the housing \nallowance paid to active duty service members is based on the average \nhousing costs in the area they are assigned; salary and wage payments \nto Federal employees, while utilizing national pay scales, also contain \nlocality adjustments; and, benefits afforded to low income families by \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, are based on \nmedian family income in the area in which the applicant resides. VA's \n``means test'' should also take such local cost-of-living variations \ninto account. Today, I introduce legislation which would require VA to \ndo so.\n  My legislation would adjust VA's current ``means test'' to allow \nveterans who live in high-cost areas, such as Philadelphia, to qualify \nfor priority status in VA hospitals even if their incomes are slightly \nhigher than VA's single, national threshold amount. My bill would \nprovide for an additional formula to measure a veteran's ``unable to \ndefray'' status, the ``Low Income index'' established by HUD under the \nU.S. Housing Act of 1937. That index defines ``low income'' by \nreference to the median family income in the Metropolitan Statistical \nArea in which the applicant lives. Clearly, a formula which takes into \naccount local variations in income, and, thus, the local cost of \nliving, more fairly measures a veteran's actual ability to assist in \ndefraying the cost of his or her medical care. I note, however, that \nthe current VA formula would also be retained lest veteran-patients who \nlive in relatively low cost areas lose priority status they might \ncurrently have under that formula. It is not my intention to shrink the \npool of priority patients; it is my intention to expand it by allowing \nmore low income persons, particularly the urban poor, to qualify.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in improving VA's medical care \npriority ``means test'' so that it more accurately accomplishes its \ntrue purpose of measuring whether a veteran can, or cannot, be expected \nto assist in defraying the cost of his or her necessary medical care. \nSuch a test, clearly, must take into account variations in the cost-of-\nliving in the locality in which the veteran resides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today prostate cancer remains the most \ncommonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in America. According to estimates \nby the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nmore than 198,000 American men will learn that they have the disease \nwithin the year. Nearly 32,000 American men will lose their lives to \nprostate cancer this year, making it the second most common cause of \ncancer death among men. Those statistics translate into devastating \nrealities for men and families across this country.\n  This disease will affect one in six men in the United States during \nhis lifetime. More than 25 percent of those battling this disease are \nunder the age of 65, prime years of productivity for families and for \nthis Nation. The number of Americans impacted by cancer, and prostate \ncancer, is expected to grow. If unchecked during the next decade, \ncancer incidence and mortality rates could increase by 25-30 percent.\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nIn too many cases, prostate cancer is still undetected until advanced \nstages of the disease, when conventional therapies no longer work. This \nmakes it critical that all American families understand the risks of \nprostate cancer and take measures to ensure early detection.\n  If a man has one close relative with prostate cancer, his risk of the \ndisease is double. With two close relatives, his risk is fivefold. \nShould he have three close relatives, his likelihood of a prostate \ncancer diagnosis is nearly certain. African American families are at \nparticular risk. African American men have the highest incidence and \nmortality rates in the world. According to the National Prostate Cancer \nCoalition, we must raise public awareness about the impact of prostate \ncancer and emphasize early detection with the PSA, Prostate Specific \nAntigen, blood test. Over the last two years prostate cancer \nmortalities have decreased by 14 percent. This shows that, with the \nright investment in education and research, we are already saving \nlives.\n  I would like to congratulate President Bush for honoring his promise \nto make meaningful investments in biomedical research. Commitments such \nas these are bringing us closer to doubling the funding at the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, and put us on the right track to \ndramatically increase the level of funding for research at the National \nCancer Institute, NCI, by FY 2003. His commitment and leadership is \nparamount to the investments needed in the fight against prostate \ncancer.\n  In an effort to help increase awareness and educate American men and \ntheir families about prostate cancer and early detection, as well as \nemphasize the need for more prostate cancer research, I ask unanimous \nconsent to consider a resolution that designates every September as the \nNational Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Together, Senator Reid and I, \nalong with many others, ask for your support and encourage all of our \ncolleagues to join us in raising awareness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8069-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1032.

Some propose significantly increasing \n     radioactive material transport.\n       (4) Approximately 261,000 people were evacuated across the \n     Nation because of rail-related accidental releases of \n     hazardous chemicals between 1978 and 1995, and during that \n     period industry reported 8 transportation accidents involving \n     the small volume of high level radioactive waste transported \n     during that period.\n       (5) The Federal Railroad Administration has significantly \n     decreased railroad inspections and has allocated few \n     resources since 1993 to assure the structural integrity of \n     railroad bridges. Train derailments have increased by 18 \n     percent over roughly the same period.\n       (6) The poor condition of highway, railway, and waterway \n     infrastructure, increases in the volume of hazardous chemical \n     transport, and proposed increases in radioactive material \n     transport increase the risk of accidents involving such \n     chemicals and materials.\n       (7) Measuring the risks of hazardous chemical or \n     radioactive material accidents and preventing such accidents \n     requires specific information concerning the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes contemplated \n     for such transport to inform and enable investment in related \n     infrastructure.\n       (8) Mitigating the impact of hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transportation accidents requires \n     skilled, localized, and well-equipped emergency response \n     personnel along all specifically identified transportation \n     routes.\n       (9) Accidents involving hazardous chemical or radioactive \n     material transport pose threats to the public health and \n     safety, the environment, and the economy.\n       (b) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall, in \n     consultation with the Comptroller General of the United \n     States, conduct a study of the hazards and risks to public \n     health and safety, the environment, and the economy \n     associated with the transportation of hazardous chemicals and \n     radioactive material.\n       (c) Matters To Be Addressed.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall address the following matters:\n       (1) Whether the Federal Government conducts individualized \n     and detailed evaluations and inspections of the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes for the \n     current, and any anticipated or proposed, transport of \n     hazardous chemicals and radioactive material, including \n     whether resources and information are adequate to conduct \n     such evaluations and inspections.\n       (2) The costs and time required to ensure adequate \n     inspection of specific transportation routes and related \n     infrastructure and to complete the infrastructure \n     improvements necessary to ensure the safety of current, and \n     any anticipated or proposed, hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transport.\n       (3) Whether Federal, State, and local emergency \n     preparedness personnel, emergency response personnel, and \n     medical personnel are adequately trained and equipped to \n     promptly respond to accidents along specific transportation \n     routes for current, anticipated, or proposed hazardous \n     chemical and radioactive material transport.\n       (4) The costs and time required to ensure that Federal, \n     State, and local emergency preparedness personnel, emergency \n     response personnel, and medical personnel are adequately \n     trained and equipped to promptly respond to accidents along \n     specific transportation routes for current, anticipated, or \n     proposed hazardous chemical and radioactive material \n     transport.\n       (5) The availability of, or requirements to establish, \n     information collection and dissemination systems adequate to \n     provide the public, in an accessible manner, with timely, \n     complete, specific, and accurate information (including \n     databases) concerning actual, proposed, or anticipated \n     shipments by highway, railway, or waterway of hazardous \n     chemicals and radioactive materials, including accidents \n     involving the transportation of such chemicals and materials \n     by those means.\n       (d) Deadline for Completion.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall be completed not later than six months after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report.--Upon completion of the study under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     study.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1038.

Res. 16\n\n       Whereas George Washington responded to a letter sent by \n     Moses Seixas, warden of Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode \n     Island, in August 1790;\n       Whereas, although Touro Synagogue, the oldest Jewish house \n     of worship in the United States, and now a national historic \n     site, was dedicated in December 1763, Jewish families had \n     been in Newport for over 100 years before that date;\n       Whereas these Jews, some of whom were Marranos, came to the \n     United States with hopes of starting a new life in this \n     country, where they could practice their religious beliefs \n     freely and without persecution;\n       Whereas they were drawn to the Colony of Rhode Island and \n     the Providence Plantations because of Governor Roger \n     Williams' assurances of religious liberty;\n       Whereas the letter from Touro Synagogue is the most famous \n     of many congratulatory notes addressed to the new president \n     by American Jewish congregations;\n       Whereas Seixas articulated the following principle, which \n     Washington repeated in his letter: ``For happily the \n     Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no \n     sanction, to persecution no assistance; requires only that \n     they who live under its protection, should demean themselves \n     as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their \n     effectual support'';\n       Whereas this was the first statement of such a principle \n     enunciated by a leader of the new United States Government;\n       Whereas this principle has become the cornerstone of United \n     States religious and ethnic toleration as it has developed \n     during the past two centuries;\n       Whereas the original letter is on display as part of the \n     permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National \n     Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas Americans of all religious faiths gather at Touro \n     Synagogue each August on the anniversary of the date of the \n     letter's delivery and at the Klutznick Museum on George \n     Washington's birthday to hear readings of the letter and to \n     discuss how the letter's message can be applied to \n     contemporary challenges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the George Washington letter to Touro Synagogue in \n     Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1790, which is on display as \n     part of the permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith \n     Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., is one \n     of the most significant early statements buttressing the \n     nascent American constitutional guarantee of religious \n     freedom; and\n       (2) the text of the George Washington letter should be \n     widely circulated, serving as an important tool for teaching \n     tolerance to children and adults alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/23/senate-section/article/S8076-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.
