Mr. President, today is a very joyous occasion in the Reid \nfamily. At 6:30 this morning, approximately, eastern time--3:30 Reno, \nNV, time--my tenth grandchild was born. Everyone is doing well. The \nlittle baby is 18 inches long--kind of short, really--and weighs 6 \npounds 12 ounces. We are very happy for this little boy. He is the \nthird son that my son has had.\n  I rise today thinking of my new grandson, and I want to discuss Earth \nDay and what having a good, clean environment means to my \ngrandchildren. I am very concerned, having seen, even in my lifetime, \nthe Earth change--and many times not for the better.\n  Earth Day is a time for reflecting on the progress of the last \ncentury and acting to protect our environment for generations and \ncenturies to come. It is good that at least 1 day a year we focus on \nthe Earth. We take it for granted. In the last 30 years, the country \nhas taken major steps to achieve clean water, clean air, safe drinking \nwater, hazardous waste cleanup, and reducing pollution across the \nboard.\n  Take just one thing, clean water. Why do we have a Clean Water Act? \nWe have a Clean Water Act because, for instance, in Ohio the Cuyahoga \nRiver kept catching fire. Mr. Nixon was President of the United States \nat that time. In a bipartisan effort to do something about the polluted \nwaterways in America, Congress joined with the President to pass a \nClean Water Act to prevent rivers catching fire.\n  We have made progress. We still have a lot of polluted water, but at \nthe time that President Nixon recognized the need to do something, \nprobably about 80 percent of our waterways were polluted. Now these \nmany years later probably only about 30 percent of our waterways are \npolluted. If you fish the rivers and lakes around the United States, \nnow you can actually eat the fish you catch. That is progress. But we \nhave a lot more to do.\n  We need to clean up that extra 20 percent or 30 percent of the \nwaterways that are polluted. We need to make sure we have safe drinking \nwater so someone can pick up a glass of water and drink it and know \nthey are not going to get sick.\n  It is not that way around much of our country. And when we travel \noverseas, we usually take lots of water with us because in many parts \nof the world we cannot drink the water because it is polluted. In the \nUnited States, we are finding much more polluted water. There is lots \nof polluted water.\n  In my State of Nevada, we have naturally occurring arsenic in the \nwater and we know that arsenic causes cancer. We need to do something \nabout that.\n  Even though we have a long way to go, we should be justifiably proud \nof\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nthe progress we have made. We cannot afford to rest on past successes \nbecause millions of people are still breathing unhealthy air, drinking \nunsafe water, and are unable to swim or fish in many of our Nation's \nwaterways.\n  As I have said before, there is still much that needs to be done. As \nthe new century dawns, we face even more complex environmental and \npublic health problems. These problems include persistent toxics. We \nhave a new phenomenon and that is, because of our development of \nnuclear power and nuclear weapons, now we have areas that are polluted \nwith things nuclear. On the Colorado River, we have 13,000 tons of \nuranium tailings. We need to clean those up because, of course, the \nColorado River is a very important waterway in the western part of the \nUnited States. We have not provided money to do that. We need to do \nthat. But that is a new threat to our environment.\n  We have new problems in addition to nuclear issues. We have global \nwarming. We have the dangers of invasive species. For example, in the \nState of Nevada, we have very little water. It is arid. It is a desert. \nYou could count the rivers in Nevada on the fingers of one hand. Some \nof those rivers are being very seriously threatened as a result of \nsomething called salt cedar or tamarisk, a plant brought in from Iran \n100 years ago to stabilize the banks of streams, and it has just taken \nover everything. They are, frankly, very ugly. They use huge amounts of \nwater. You cannot get rid of them. You can't burn them; you can't \npoison them; you can't snag them and pull them out. The only thing we \nfound that might work is an insect that eats them, and we are working \non that. The Department of Agriculture is working on a program to see \nif we can get rid of them that way. But these invasive species are all \nover America and we need to work on their eradication.\n  Fine air particles from fossil fuel use, land use changes, the need \nfor thoughtful use of our land for housing, recreation, and \ntransportation: these challenges require the energy and enthusiasm that \nmarked the first Earth Day 30 years ago. But also we need a new level \nof sophistication and commitment.\n  I like President Bush. I think he is a very good man. I think he \nmeans well. From what has happened during the first 100 days of this \nadministration dealing with the environment, I think he is getting bad \nadvice from somebody.\n  I can't imagine a good man doing such things in the first few months \nof his administration. His Administrator of EPA gave a speech about the \nimportance and dangers of global warming and about needing to do \nsomething about it and referred to the CO2 contamination. \nFour days later, the administration cuts her legs out from under her \nand says they are going to delay implementation.\n  Greenhouse gas emission is a problem. This would have been the first \ntangible U.S. effort to address global warming, and we backed away from \nit.\n  Next, the administration proposed drilling on all public lands, \nincluding national wildlife refuges, national forests, national \nmonuments, and other public lands. This was followed closely by a delay \nof the rules designed to protect 60 million acres of national forest \nfrom logging and roadbuilding. This ``roadless rule'' had been \npublished after more than 600 public hearings and consideration of 1.6 \nmillion comments. It is not as if it was done in the dead of night.\n  Soon after that, the administration pulled back a long-awaited \nregulation lowering the standard of arsenic, a known human carcinogen, \nin our drinking water supplies. As early as 1962, the US Public Health \nService recommended that the standard be lowered to 10 ppb. EPA held an \nextensive comment period on this rule, including more than 180 days of \ncomment and holding stakeholder meetings beginning as early as 1997. \nThere was a study by the National Science Foundation. Now the \nadministration wants to re-study this issue and further delay the \nprocess of getting arsenic out of our drinking water. That is \nabsolutely wrong.\n  Then, without any apparent regard for the economic, environmental or \nforeign relations consequences, the administration walked away from \ninternational climate change negotiations that were being conducted \nunder a U.S.-ratified treaty. The administration also suspended the \nrule which requires companies getting federal dollars to be in \ncompliance with federal laws, including environmental laws.\n  I was in a meeting with Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel. We agreed, if \nwe are going to do something about this Kyoto treaty, on making sure \nthe Third World nations are also brought into the picture. Senator Byrd \nsaid he had the intention of going forward with the discussion. We need \nto do something about global warming. He said that he is going on 84 \nyears of age and he has been able to see in his lifetime the changes \nthat have taken place in the environment.\n  This was not good for us. We walked away from this treaty.\n  And, without explanation, the administration withdrew draft plans for \npublic access to information on potential catastrophic chemical \naccidents in neighborhoods around the country. These plans are more \nthan a year late and their withdrawal suggests that the administration \ndoesn't want the public to know about these dangers.\n  In April, the Bush administration weakened the new energy efficiency \nstandards for water heaters and central aid conditioners. Over the next \n30 years, this change equals the total electricity used by all American \nhouseholds in one year. When electricity supplies are drastically low \nand high priced, as in California, does it make sense to increase \nelectricity consumption rather than conserving? The answer is no. \nSimilarly, does it make sense to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge for oil that will arrive years too late to address high gasoline \nprices this summer when fuel efficiency improvements would be quicker \nand longer lasting?\n  The budget proposal by the administration represents yet more bad \nnews for the environment. The budget resolution which passed the Senate \non a party line vote eliminates or underfunds environmental programs \nacross a range of agencies, including cuts at EPA in clean water state \nrevolving funds, estuary protection, beach protection, scientific \nresearch on clean air, and law enforcement personnel. These cuts would \ngreatly undercut environmental protections, and the protection of \npublic health.\n  The budget document, which was submitted to us later, among other \nthings, calls for a 30-percent cut in alternative energy research on \nsolar, geothermal, and wind. That is the wrong way to go. These cuts \nwill greatly hurt environmental protection and the protection of public \nhealth. It also cuts vital environmental programs at the Department of \nthe Interior, Department of Agriculture, and renewable energy programs \nat the Department of Energy. We can do better.\n  Mr. President, I repeat what I said on Monday and Tuesday. We did \nnothing here Monday. We did nothing yesterday. It appears we are going \nto do nothing today.\n  We have a bipartisan bill, the brownfields legislation, S. 350, \nentitled ``The Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration \nAct of 2001.'' We need to consider this bill. This is a bill that has \n68 cosponsors. It is supported by the National Governors' Conference, \nrealtors, environmentalists, businesses, and local governments. It is \nsupported by a broad array of outside groups. I cannot imagine why we \nare not considering this bill. It was reported out of committee 15 to \n3.\n  In addition to that, the problems that three Members had we resolved. \nI can't speak for all three, but I know Senator Voinovich had some \nproblems. We worked those out.\n  This legislation is so important. We have 500,000 contaminated or \nabandoned sites in the United States waiting to be cleaned up. Private \nparties and communities need to be involved. We believe that these \nsites will create about 600,000 jobs nationally and increase annual tax \nrevenues by $2.4 billion. We need to move forward on this legislation. \nIt will be good for urban America and rural America. I just can't \nimagine why we are not doing it.\n  The testimony on the bill supports moving quickly. Witnesses have \ncalled for the bill to move quickly.\n  For example, the witness for the Conference of Mayors testified, \n``the Nation's mayors believe that the time has come for bipartisan \naction on\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nbrownfields. We have waited a long time for final congressional action \non brownfields legislation.''\n  Another witness pout it even more strongly: ``Time is of the essence \n. . . We look forward to working with you toward timely, expeditious, \nhopefully almost immediate enactment.''\n  I agree with these sentiments. Let us take up this bill and do what \nwe were elected to do--pass good bills into law. This bill is good for \nthe environment and good for jobs and there is neither need nor \njustification for any further delay.\n  We need to find a ``green path'' forward. We need to make sure we \ntake the steps to protect the earth for our grandchildren, steps which \ninclude finalizing the numerous rules and enforcement cases which have \nbeen stopped mid-stream, rules which were developed over years and \nwhich provide critical protections for our environment.\n  We need to ensure that the public is informed about threats to their \nhealth and their environment. We need a safe and sustainable energy \npolicy. We need steps to address the very real problem of climate \nchange, we need a vision for conserving game and non-game species and \ntheir habitat, we need a commitment to reclaiming polluted industrial, \nagricultural and military sites and we need to make a fundamental \ninvestment in conservation that recognizes that we do not inherit the \nplanet from our ancestors, but borrow it from our children.\n  These measures would be truly planting a tree to honor the Earth.\n  It is bipartisan. I really can't imagine why we are not considering \nthis bill. We agreed to 2 hours on this side. I hope the majority will \nallow us to take the bill up immediately. It is good environmental \nlegislation. It speaks for what Earth Day is all about.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \ninspirational work this morning. There is no one who cares more about \nthe quality of the environment than Senator Harry Reid. I join with him \nin calling for taking up a brownfields bill. It would be good for my \nState and for all States in this Union. I very much appreciate his \nleadership on that critical subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3869-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3869-S3870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           QUALITY EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to address what I \nbelieve to be most important issue facing our country today; that is, \nimproving the quality of education received by every child across this \ncountry. It will affect not only our future prosperity but the kind of \nNation in which we live and the vibrancy of our very democracy.\n  I thank all colleagues who helped bring us to this historic point, \nstarting with my friend and colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, with whom \nI have enjoyed working on this issue for the last several years; our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, Senator Gregg, Senator \nFrist, Senator Jeffords, and others; and the Democratic members on the \nHELP Committee, Senator Dodd and others, but principally Senator \nKennedy.\n  I want to say a special word about Senator Kennedy this morning. His \ndedication to improving the quality of America's educational system is \ntruly remarkable. He has proven himself to be not only principled but \npragmatic. He fights for what he believes in, but he is not willing to \nsacrifice real progress for America's schoolchildren for the older \nideological ideas. Without his hard work and dedication, we would not \nbe where we are today.\n  I thank all of these leaders for bringing us to where we are. It has \nbeen a long road for me personally and a long road for many of us in \nthis Chamber.\n  My thoughts go back to 1989, my first year as Governor, when \nPresident Bush called us to a national summit in the city of \nCharlottesville.\n  For only the third time in our Nation's history, all 50 Governors had \ngathered together to focus on a single subject. The first time was \nTeddy Roosevelt's focus on the issue of the environment. In this case, \nit was President Bush's first focus on the subject of education. We \ncame out of that summit dedicated to the standards and accountability \nmovement, and we established the National Education Goals Panel, of \nwhich I was an initial member. I had the privilege of serving, in later \nyears, as chairman.\n  From there I went on and had the privilege of serving as the chairman \nof the Education Commission of the States, a collection of State and \nlocal officials who work to improve the quality of our schools at the \nState and local levels.\n  Finally, I had the privilege of serving on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress Board, the NAEP Board, trying to devise the very \nbest assessments for our children, authentic assessments, that tell us \nmore than if they can memorize rote knowledge, but instead whether they \ncan think and reason and express themselves intelligently.\n  It has also been a long road for this Senate. I, again, thank Senator \nLieberman and my colleagues at the Progressive Policy Institute, who \nhelped fashion the principles that lie at the heart of the bill we will \nsoon take up. We stand on the precipice of historic progress saying \nthat the status quo that leaves too many of our children behind is no \nlonger good enough. The consequences of failure today are greater than \never before. We must do better. I believe we can.\n  During the campaign last year, I was very pleased when President Bush \nadopted many of the principles that lay at the heart of our bill. That \nwas an important step in the right direction. I give him credit for \nthat. I am proud that the thinking in my own caucus has evolved on many \nof these critical issues. So there has been a convergence of thought, \nand now a consensus exists on the part of most of us of what needs to \nbe done to improve the quality of our local schools. The principles and \nthe values are the same, even if occasionally we have differences of \nopinion about how to embrace those principles and give them full \nmeaning in the context of education today.\n  We stand on the threshold of great progress, the most significant \neducational progress in a generation. Accountability lies at the heart \nof our agenda. We redefine the definition of ``success.'' No longer \nwill we define success for America's schoolchildren merely in terms of \nhow much we spend, but instead we will define success in terms of how \nmuch our children learn.\n  There will be high academic standards and assessments to determine \nhow every child is doing toward meeting those standards. Everyone in \nthe process will be held responsible for making progress--every school, \nevery school district, every State--each and every year.\n  For the first time, there will be real consequences--real \nconsequences--for academic failure. In relation to some of the new \nmoney dedicated to new administrative funding, if progress is not made, \nit will be reduced, because it only makes sense that if the funding is \nnot achieving the progress for which it was intended, it should be \nredirected into ways which will achieve real progress.\n  For the first time, America's parents will be given an important \nchoice. If your local school is not doing well enough for several \nsuccessive years, you will be allowed to send your child to a better \nperforming public school. You will begin to have an option of receiving \nsupplemental services, additional instruction on top of that provided \nin your local school, to give your child the reading, writing, and \nscientific knowledge that your child will need to be successful in \nmeeting the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n  We inject competition--true competition--into the system, embracing \nmarket forces for the innovation and additional accountability they can \nbring. We seek to achieve the best of both worlds, with charter \nschools, magnet schools, robust public school choice, but not \nwithdrawing the important resources necessary to making our public \nschools flourish.\n  We avoid the false choices of those who say that the only way to \nimprove the quality of education is to abandon our public schools, on \nthe one hand, and, on the other hand, those who say the status quo is \ngood enough and that the answer to the challenges facing America's \nschools is simply to add more money.\n  We embrace the notion of additional flexibility for our local schools \nand States. We cut through the redtape\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nthat too often has bogged us down at the Federal level. We only ask in \nreturn that our local schools and school districts give us additional \nprogress for the flexibility that we provide.\n  We invest in professional development. Every study I have ever seen--\nI know the Presiding Officer has labored in these vineyards as a \nGovernor, as did I--every study I have ever seen indicates the two most \nimportant variables in determining a child's academic success is, \nfirst, whether a parent is involved or engaged in that child's \neducational activities, making it a priority at the home; and, \nsecondly, whether there is a well-prepared and highly motivated \nclassroom professional teacher in that classroom, helping to provide \nthe individual instruction every one of our children needs and every \none of our children deserves.\n  These are the principles that lie at the heart of our bill: increased \naccountability for everyone; more competition in parental choice within \nthe context of public education; more flexibility for our States and \nlocal school districts; and investing in professional development, to \nensure that every classroom has a motivated, highly trained teacher \nthat every child deserves.\n  But now, my friends, we come to the critical moment. Now we face the \nacid test which will determine whether our actions will truly live up \nto our words. We are all for reform. We are all for accountability. But \nwill we do what it takes in a practical sense to make reform and \naccountability work? I believe we must. We are all for holding everyone \nelse responsible--the classroom teachers, school principals, district \nsuperintendents, Governors; everyone else in this process--but will we \nhold ourselves, this institution, accountable? Will we hold this \nPresident and this administration accountable to doing what it takes to \ngive meaning to the words that we speak? I believe we must.\n  Last week I visited schools across my State, in Evansville, in South \nBend, in Fort Wayne, in Indianapolis, in Floyd County. I saw the \ndifference the Title I dollars are making in the lives of our children \nand in the quality of instruction taking place in our classrooms. It \nwas a wonderful thing to behold. I compliment those teachers and \nprincipals and school superintendents who are using those dollars to \ngive those children hope and educational opportunity.\n  But as I visited those schools and saw what was working and making a \ndifference, I was also saddened to remember that 6.8 million children--\n6.8 million of our young people--who are qualified to receive that \nassistance are instead receiving none. What about them? Will they be \nleft behind? If we do not rise to this challenge, I am afraid they \nwill.\n\n  President Bush, during the campaign last year, pledged to leave no \nchild behind. I commend him for that pledge. Now it is up to us and to \nhim to redeem it. And so we must. We will enact a system of standards \nadopted by the States, assessments to determine how each and every one \nof our children are doing. We will insist upon results.\n  But what do we do with the results of those assessments when they \ntell us so many of our children need to do better? Do we simply pat \nthem on the head, wish them good luck, and say: Now you are on your \nown? Of course we must do better than that.\n  Throwing dollars at our schools without accountability is a waste; \nbut accountability without the means to truly improve the quality of \ninstruction our children are receiving is nothing but a cruel hoax.\n  I call upon my colleagues in this Chamber and our new President to \njoin with us, to join with us in a historic effort of improving the \nquality of instruction for our children who need it most, to join with \nus in embracing reform, but also what it means in a tangible, practical \ndollars-and-cents way of making reform work.\n  Our actions in this great Chamber must be more than a facade of \nreform. The bill that we enact and that the President signs must offer \nmore than an illusion of progress. We must not individually or \ncollectively participate in perpetuating a hoax upon America's \nschoolchildren. It is important for me to acknowledge that from time to \ntime on this side of the aisle there has been a diversity of thought on \nthis subject. But when it comes to the commitment of resources to make \nthe reform work, to make progress become a reality, we stand united and \ndetermined.\n  This debate is not about accountability versus spending. We are all \nfor accountability. We are all for reform. This debate is a question of \npriorities and whether we will do what the American people have been \nasking of us for so very long now; and that is, to make the quality of \nour children's education our No. 1 priority. I believe we must.\n  The President's tax package this next year calls for devoting $68 \nbillion to the cause of tax relief.\n  That is a cause which I embrace, as do many of my colleagues. We \nbelieve some tax relief for the hard-working taxpayers of America is in \norder for a variety of reasons, but it is not our only priority.\n  The President's proposal, as it currently stands, calls for investing \n$2.6 billion in improving the quality of education, 25 times more for \nreducing taxes than investing in the quality of our children's \neducation. I support tax cuts. I support tax relief, but it is not 25 \ntimes more important than our children's education. We can and should \nhave both. We should not be forced to make this unnecessary choice \nbetween two alternatives, both of which can be accommodated if the \nadministration will be more forthcoming with resources.\n  In conclusion, this debate is about education reform, and it is about \nthe resources to make education reform work. More important than that, \nit is about the credibility of this institution and those of us who are \nprivileged to comprise it. Will we do more than read the polls and put \ntogether a construct to satisfy our constituents, to make them believe \nwe are doing something about improving the quality of education for our \nchildren, when, in fact, we are not; or will we make the difficult \ndecision and allocate the resources that are necessary to live up to \nthe challenge we face, to fulfill the expectations they have a right to \nexpect of us? I believe we should.\n  I call upon the Members of the Senate and the administration and this \nPresident to join with us to redeem the pledge he made in the campaign, \nthe pledge that all of us embrace of leaving no child behind and to \ndevote the resources to our schools to make accountability, reform, and \nprogress be more than empty words but a reality in the daily lives of \nour schools.\n  I am privileged to be in the Chamber with my colleague from \nCalifornia with whom I have worked on this issue and so many others. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the junior Senator \nfrom Indiana for those remarks. He stands in the leadership of this \nbody in terms of his views on education. I, for one, am very \nappreciative of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3870-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3870-S3874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENERGY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will use my time in morning business \nto update the Senate on the status of the electricity crisis in \nCalifornia.\n  April is typically the best time of year for California when it comes \nto meeting its energy needs. Winter has ended in northern California, \nand the southern part of the State has not yet begun to get hot. Thus, \nthe demand for energy is low throughout the State, and California has \nalways had more than enough power to meet its needs. As a result, \nelectricity is usually very cheap. So this is as good a time as any to \nprovide an update of where the State is and to see how this year is \ndifferent from all other years. The last ten months provide a gloomy \npicture of what may well happen this summer.\n  The average cost of electricity for California this month has been \nabout $300 a megawatt hour. This is more than 10 times higher than the \naverage for last April, right before the crisis began. The average \nprice for electricity in the States of Washington and Oregon is even \nhigher, and the price for electricity bought in the futures market for \nthis summer is now averaging more than $750 a single megawatt hour.\n  The State Department of Water Resources, which since January has been \npurchasing all of California's power needs, has now spent $5.2 billion \npurchasing power just in the first months of this year. It is spending \nat a rate of $73 million a day. This is having a serious financial \nimpact on the State's\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\ncredit standing. Yesterday's Standard & Poor's downgraded the State's \ncredit rating two notches from AA to A-plus.\n  It is important to point out that the money the State is spending to \nbuy electricity is gone. It does not buy a textbook or a computer for a \nschool. It won't repair a bridge or road. It will not build a highway. \nIt doesn't go for law enforcement. It is money that simply disappears. \nAs a result, the State could well be out of money.\n  At the same time, the Northwest is experiencing what may well be its \ndriest year on record. Consequently, California will not be able to \nrely on the 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of power it typically imports from \nthe Northwest in the summer--usually enough for 7 to 8 million homes. \nThere will not be enough power in the Northwest to even meet its own \nenergy needs this summer.\n  Meanwhile, natural gas prices in most of the United States are about \nthree times higher than their historic average, and in southern \nCalifornia they are eight times higher. Independent analysts, such as \nthe Brattle Group, have raised significant questions about malfeasance \non the part of the few companies that have an oligopoly on the natural \ngas pipelines. Meanwhile, it has been more than 5 months since the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the FERC, found that electricity \nrates were ``unjust and unreasonable'', and still they have not acted \nto fulfill the mandate of the Federal Power Act which directs the FERC \nto set reasonable rates when the market is not functioning properly.\n  Allow me to read from the language of the Federal Power Act.\n\n       Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own \n     motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, \n     or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected \n     by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to \n     jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, \n     practice, or contract affected such rate, charge, or \n     classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory \n     or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and \n     reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, \n     practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, \n     and shall fix the same by order.\n\n  That is the Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act very clearly \nsays: FERC, once you find that rates are unjust and unreasonable, you \nmust then fix reasonable rates or charges.\n  The FERC has not done its duty.\n  The problems in California began in 1996, when the State became the \nfirst to pass a comprehensive energy deregulation bill. That bill was \nknown as AB 1890. The bill passed very quickly at the end of the \nlegislative session. It enjoyed nearly unanimous bipartisan support.\n  AB 1890 was supposed to increase supplies of energy and decrease \nprices for consumers, but the exact opposite happened. The bill assumed \nthat increases in energy supply, competition, and efficiency would \ndrive down energy prices. This assumption turned out to be badly \nflawed, and as a result the State was burned by several provisions of \nthe bill.\n  First, the bill forced the utilities to purchase at least 95 percent \nof their electricity in the day-ahead and spot market and did not \npermit utilities to hedge their bets with long-term, bilateral \ncontracts. That is a huge problem because if 95 percent of the power is \nbought on the spot market, and those spot market prices go up, the \nState is in the pickle that it is in today.\n  Second, the State forced its investor-owned utilities to sell off \ntheir generating assets, allowing out-of-State energy generators to \npurchase the plants and sell the electricity back to the utilities at \nmarket rates.\n  Let me give you an example of that. For Southern California Edison, \nwhen it divested of a generating facility, at the time Southern \nCalifornia Edison was selling its power at $30 a megawatt hour. As soon \nas it sold it to a generating facility, the out-of-State generating \nfacility turned around to sell the power back to Southern California \nEdison at $300 a megawatt hour. That is part of the problem.\n  Third, the bill immediately deregulated wholesale prices, but left \nretail rates regulated until March of 2002, or until a utility has sold \noff all of its generating units, creating a half-regulated, half-\nderegulated system. So the free market that we heard so much about \ncan't function as a market should because it is broken. The price on \nthe wholesale end is deregulated. The utility cannot pass that price \nthrough to the consumer--or has not been able to.\n  Incidentally, that is going to change because the State will pass \nmore than a 30-percent rate increase that should go into play in either \nMay or June of this year. So some of that will be corrected.\n  Fourth, the State set up a power exchange as a product of that bill \nthat aimed to attract sellers by promising the highest clearing price \nof energy to all bidders. So no matter what you bid your power in for, \nyou are guaranteed the highest price paid to any other bidder. That \nproved to be fatal.\n  Energy suppliers realized that simply withholding power from the \npower exchange and from the California energy market would drastically \ndrive up the prices. And they did.\n  Spot prices increased dramatically. The costs could not be passed on \nto consumers. The State's largest investor-owned utility filed for \nbankruptcy, and the State's second largest investor-owned utility, \nSouthern California Edison, remains on the brink of bankruptcy. The \nresult has been this crisis, and this crisis could well become an \neconomic disaster not only for California, but for the entire West.\n  Now, what has the State done? I am the first to admit that California \nhas been slow to address the crisis. I think part of this was an actual \ndisbelief that the situation could have gotten this bad this fast. Let \nme speak about supply because there had not been much supply--very \nlittle supply, less than 2,000 megawatts actually--added to the State's \npower supply in the last decade. But since the first of the year, the \nState has licensed and approved 14 new gas-fired plants and 8 new \npeaker plants, which will all be on line within the next 2 years. The \nState expects to add 9,810 megawatts--that is enough power for 9.810 \nmillion households--and have that power on line by the summer of 2003. \nAnd the State, in total, will add 20,000 megawatts, enough to power 20 \nmillion homes, and have that on line by the end of 2004.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart which \nlists the plants that have been approved, plant by plant, by the State, \nand the expected dates they will come on line.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      CALIFORNIA POWER PLANTS COMING ONLINE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Plant name                       Capacity             Location--(Peaker?)

Mr. President, I tell you that because the problem is \nin this initial period; the problem is going to be for the next 2 \nyears. After that, it is expected that the State will have adequate \npower supply to begin to create a functioning free market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, not desiring to object, I just want to \nmake sure that I follow that time and that there is time for me. I was \nscheduled at 10:15 was my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 10:15 \nto 11 was under the control of Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia so long as 10 minutes is added to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. President, the State is adding additional power. The problem \ncomes in the next 2 years. What can be done and what is the appropriate \nFederal role in the next 2 years? I submit that the appropriate Federal \nrole is to provide a period for liability and stability until the State \nhas brought on line enough additional power to have a functioning free \nmarket where supply and demand functions in an appropriate manner.\n  The State has also planned an $850 million conservation package that \nwill aim to reduce energy demand across the board by 10 percent or \nmore. So in the immediate future, conservation is the best way for \nCalifornia to avoid days of rolling blackouts this summer. But, in my \nopinion, it is going to be impossible to achieve enough conservation to \navoid all blackouts.\n  Additionally, the Governor of California has issued a series of \nexecutive orders authorizing increased output at existing facilities \nand ensuring that environmental regulations are not posing any barriers \nto maximum energy production.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time a \nletter from Winston Hickox, the Secretary of the California \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, asserting that there are no energy \nplants idling in the State because of environmental reasons, with the \nexception of those State plants that are being retrofitted so that they \ncan operate cleaner, more efficiently, and more often this summer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, March 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It has been alleged that air \n     quality regulations are a major contributor to California's \n     current power shortage crisis and are constraining energy \n     supplies. In his March 22, 2001, testimony before the House \n     Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee (enclosed), Dr. Alan \n     Lloyd, Chairman of the California Environmental Protection \n     Agency's Air Resources Board (ARB), refuted those statements. \n     The situation in California has not changed. No essential \n     power generation is off-line due to air quality constraints.\n       As you know, on February 8, 2001, Governor Gray Davis \n     issued a series of Executive Orders to comprehensively \n     address power generation. The Orders boosted generating \n     capacity by authorizing increased output at existing \n     facilities, accelerated power plant construction, streamlined \n     the review process for new facilities, and provided \n     incentives for distributed and renewable generation.\n       California regulatory agencies are quickly and successfully \n     expediting permits for new generating units. Since April \n     1999, nine major power projects (including one expansion) \n     totaling an additional 6,300 megawatts (MW) have been \n     approved. Six plants are under construction with four \n     expected to be on-line this year between July and November. \n     Another 14 projects (new sitings and expansions) are under \n     review for an additional 7,700 MW of capacity. All of these \n     projects include the necessary environmental offsets and \n     required emission controls. The State has also realized the \n     need for short-term supply and is expediting permits for \n     smaller peaking plants. These peakers will be on-line for the \n     2001 summer peak season.\n       With regard to existing capacity, the ARB is continuing its \n     coordination with the California Independent System Operator \n     (Cal-ISO), local air districts, California Energy Commission \n     (CEC), and plant personnel to identify generating units that \n     may be constrained by air permit limitations and to remove \n     barriers to summer time operation. Governor Davis' Executive \n     Orders dealt with this matter as well, authorizing additional \n     compliance mechanisms to keep both power generation and \n     environmental protection on track. The U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency, Region IX, is working closely with \n     California regulatory agencies and has indicated support for \n     this approach.\n       This spring, a number of generating units are off-line for \n     routine maintenance. Many of them are taking advantage of \n     this downtime--and available labor--to install air pollution \n     controls. Please note, these installations have been \n     carefully coordinated with Cal-ISO. They were only authorized \n     upon a finding that sufficient supplies and reliability of \n     the power grid system would be maintained.\n       In summary, air quality agencies realize the seriousness of \n     the State's energy situation and have been working \n     diligently, and effectively, to site new power plants and \n     increase existing capacity while still addressing air quality \n     concerns. Existing state and federal laws provide significant \n     flexibility to make these adjustments. Governor Davis' \n     Executive Orders provide additional means and flexibility to \n     keep generation on-line and quickly permit new power plants. \n     The air quality regulatory system works. We believe that \n     California can increase energy supply while, at the same \n     time, protecting public health and the environment. \n     California citizens expect nothing less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Winston H. Hickox,\n                                                 Agency Secretary.\n       Enclosure.\n\n  Testimony of Dr. Alan C. Lloyd, Chairman, California Air Resources \n Board, Before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, March \n                                22, 2001\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. My \n     name is Alan Lloyd, and I serve as Chairman of the California \n     Air Resources Board (ARB). I welcome the opportunity to \n     provide an overview of California's electricity challenge \n     with respect to air quality issues.\n       Over the past several months, Governor Davis has embarked \n     on a comprehensive strategy to address the electricity \n     situation in California. One of the major components of the \n     State's plan centers around increasing energy supplies by \n     expediting the construction of power plants and other sources \n     of generation. Specifically, we are in the midst of an \n     aggressive effort to bring 5,000 megawatts on line by this \n     summer and 20,000 megawatts by 2004 in order to meet \n     anticipated energy demand this summer and beyond.\n       Mr. Chairman, my main message is this: We can accomplish \n     this goal within the existing framework of California's air \n     quality regulations. Furthermore, environmental laws do not \n     pose a barrier in terms of our ability to bring new \n     generation on line and ensure that existing power plants can \n     operate at maximum capacity. In short, we can increase energy \n     supply in an expedited manner while at the same time \n     maintaining our commitment to the environment.\n       Air pollution controls have been identified as a major \n     contributor to California's current energy challenge. That \n     perception is not accurate. Air quality issues are a very \n     small part of the State's overall power production problem. \n     Where air quality rules have affected or might have \n     potentially affected the ability to create essential power, \n     state and local regulators have moved swiftly and \n     successfully to keep needed plants on line. Simply put, no \n     essential electricity generation\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n     has been curtailed due to air emission limitations. \n     California's programs to protect public health are not a \n     major factor in the electricity shortages experienced to \n     date.\n       No single factor can explain the current energy crisis. The \n     matter is far too complex. However, it can be said with \n     certainty that environmental laws are not to blame. Under \n     existing environmental programs and the policy direction of \n     Governor Davis, state and local air regulators have had, have \n     used, and will continue to use, the considerable flexibility \n     included in California's regulatory programs to ensure that \n     power generating sources remain in operation under \n     environmentally sound conditions. While the review process \n     and decision making timelines have been streamlined, \n     substantive environmental standards and mitigation \n     requirements have not been compromised.\n       Over the last several months, there has been an increasing \n     focus on environmental laws as contributors to the energy \n     crisis. This concern has taken two distinct forms:\n       1. The charge that environmental laws have prevented \n     maximum utilization of existing electrical generation \n     facilities; and\n       2. The allegation that environmental laws have prevented \n     bringing new electrical generation facilities online.\n       There have also been charges that the State of California \n     has not be responsive enough in addressing the power issues, \n     and has not been willing to take the extraordinary actions \n     needed to deal with how environmental requirements have \n     affected electricity production.\n       Mr. Chairman, I submit to you that these statements have \n     diverted attention from the true and complex causes of the \n     current energy situation. As a result, they have not \n     contributed to productive efforts to resolve it. I would like \n     to briefly address each of these issues.\n       Although existing laws and regulations provide mechanisms \n     for addressing our power needs, they can also require \n     substantial time and process. Governor Davis, through the \n     exercise of his emergency powers under state law, has \n     significantly expanded state and local agencies' ability to \n     apply flexibility and common sense to act quickly to ensure \n     that power generation will continue.\n       By using his emergency powers and issuing Executive Orders, \n     Governor Davis has added substantially to the state's ability \n     to deal with our current energy situation. Executive Orders \n     D-24-01, D-26-01, and D-28-01 ensure that where statutory and \n     regulatory impediments exist--related to either the continued \n     operation of an existing plant or the construction of a new \n     clean facility--they will be swiftly addressed and resolved. \n     The Executive Orders also provide that these actions will be \n     accomplished without sacrificing needed air quality \n     protections.\n       State and local agencies now have both the direction the \n     authority they need to expeditiously review and approve \n     permits. Under the Governor's Executive Orders, they are:\n       Allowing the continued operation of existing facilities \n     that might otherwise face limits on hours of operation.\n       Expediting the review and permit approval for new peaking \n     facilities that have acquired the needed control technology \n     and mitigation, but need rapid processing to come on line \n     quickly.\n       Enabling new peaking plants to obtain emission credits \n     needed for permitting through the state, rather than \n     arranging for them through private transactions.\n       Completing permit reviews and approvals for new large \n     facilities in as little as four months to enable new capacity \n     to begin construction expeditiously.\n       The Governor's Executive Orders maintain all substantive \n     environmental protections. For example, existing units must \n     continue to utilize all of the required emission control \n     equipment, and must provide funds to mitigate the impact of \n     their increased hours of operation. Similarly, new units must \n     utilize the best available control equipment and must \n     continue to provide emission reduction credits to mitigate \n     their emission increases. Permitting will take less time, but \n     will not be less protective.\n       All central station electrical generating facilities are \n     permitted by local air pollution control districts under \n     rules incorporated in the State Implementation Plan (SIP). \n     These permits reflect operator-provided information, \n     including factors such as intended hours of operation and \n     fuel type. This information has a direct bearing on the \n     facility's anticipated emissions. Based on operator-provided \n     data, emission limits are established through the air \n     permits. It is these operator-defined limits that have been \n     at issue. In many cases, these facilities are now in a \n     position of having, or wanting to generate additional \n     electrical power in excess of the time periods assumed in the \n     original permitting process.\n       Despite this unanticipated high level of operation, through \n     the joint efforts of local air districts, the Air Resources \n     board (ARB), and the California Energy Conservation and \n     Development Commission (CEC), as well as the assistance of \n     the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), needed \n     electrical generation has not been interrupted. State law and \n     local regulations provide several means to address permit \n     limitations without disruption of electrical generation or \n     unmitigated damage to air quality.\n       The ARB has assisted local air districts in addressing any \n     potential issues arising out of their efforts to maintain \n     power generation. ARB has maintained close coordination with \n     the U.S. EPA to ensure that state and local response to the \n     energy situation does not raise concerns at the federal \n     level. We have approached the electricity shortage with an \n     environmentally sound balance of need awareness and impact \n     concern. U.S. EPA has indicated its understanding of the \n     complexities California is facing and has indicated a \n     continued willingness to assist.\n       At the Governor's direction, the ARB and air districts have \n     been able to balance the State's energy needs with the \n     public's right to clean air. Existing air quality regulations \n     have provided the flexibility to address expeditiously the \n     unexpected power demands of the State without material harm \n     to air quality. These accommodations have been completed in \n     very short time frames and have ensured continued power \n     generation. This flexibility has been used numerous times \n     over the last six months to enable continued power \n     production. These have affected both large and small plants \n     are summarized in Attachment 1.\n       The additional grants of authority to the Governor under \n     the Emergency Services Act augments existing statutes and \n     increases the ability of state and local agencies to work \n     together in significantly reduced time frames. Whether it is \n     providing for an existing source to operate beyond its \n     permitted hours of operation of streamlining certification of \n     new peaking sources, the Governor's emergency Executive \n     Orders provide even greater flexibility in responding to \n     source specific generation issues than previously existed.\n       All new proposed power plants must be constructed and \n     operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and \n     local air pollution requirements. Within California, the 35 \n     local air districts are responsible for regulating emissions \n     from stationary sources, including power plants. At the state \n     level, ARB is the agency charged with coordinating efforts to \n     attain and maintain federal and state ambient air quality \n     standards and comply with the requirements of the federal \n     Clean Air Act. To this end, ARB coordinates the activities of \n     all the districts in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.\n       Some have cited California's environmental laws as the \n     reason new power generation has not been built in recent \n     years. However, a review of CEC data demonstrates otherwise. \n     Since April 1999, CEC has approved 13 major power projects \n     (including one expansion) totaling over 8,400 MW of \n     additional capacity. Six of these plants are under \n     construction and four of those six are expected to be on line \n     this year, with start dates spanning from July through \n     November. Another 15 projects (new sitings and expansions) \n     are currently under review for an additional 6,700 MW of \n     capacity. Lastly, there is still an additional 7,960 MW of \n     capacity that has been publicly announced and for which the \n     CEC anticipates receiving applications this year.\n       Some have also argued that costs of compliance with air \n     quality regulations are too substantial and must be relaxed \n     to achieve needed power generation. This argument is also \n     flawed. Today, approximately 15,000 MW of new electrical \n     generation has either been approved or is in the licensing \n     process. All of these projects have included the necessary \n     environmental offset packages and have incorporated all \n     required emission controls. Compliance with these \n     requirements has proven to be both technically and \n     economically feasible.\n       To bring new, additional peaking facilities on line, \n     Governor Davis has created both a streamlined review process \n     and an ARB-operated emission offset bank. These actions will \n     ensure that all necessary peaking facilities can also be \n     sited.\n       The CEC's siting process is designed to take 12 months. \n     However, a number of factors, other than environmental \n     regulations, have recently influenced individual project \n     timelines. Over the last two to three years, the actions of \n     local activists, businesses, and others have slowed the pace \n     of some projects. In fact, power generators themselves have \n     utilized the siting process to hold up the licensing of a \n     competitor.\n       Since 1997, competing companies have intervened in 12 of \n     the 21 projects proposed for licensing. Their participation \n     has slowed the process in at least four cases.\n       Constraints on electrical generation capacity from central \n     station powerplants have caused increased interest in the use \n     of distributed generation (DG). DG is electrical generation \n     at or near the place of use. Governor Davis supports \n     legislation action that will provide incentives for \n     distributed generation. Last September, the Governor signed \n     Senate Bill 1298, which directs ARB to establish a \n     certification program and adopt uniform emissions standards \n     and general air quality guidelines for DG technologies. By \n     law, this program must be in effect by January 1, 2003. ARB \n     is on a fast track and expects to complete this December--\n     over a year ahead of schedule.\n       As the foregoing demonstrates, it is not environmental \n     regulation that has prevented the creation of additional \n     power generation. Rather, many factors have contributed to \n     the current crisis. Among those is also the fact that market \n     participants can and do manipulate the electrical power \n     market by withholding capacity in order to maximize their \n     price of electricity.\n       Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     agrees. Although it found insufficient evidence of market \n     manipulation by any individual market participant: ``. . . \n     there was clear evidence that the California market \n     structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to \n     exercise market\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\n     power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and \n     unreasonable rates under the FPA . . . we reaffirm our \n     findings that unjust and unreasonable rates were charged \n     and could continue to be charged unless remedies are \n     implemented.''\n       The Air Resources Board is continuing its efforts to ensure \n     that California has the maximum electrical power output \n     possible, while still protecting public health and mitigating \n     any adverse effects of increased electrical output. This is \n     being done within the confines of existing law as recently \n     expanded through the Governor's Executive Orders. To quote \n     Governor Davis, California is demonstrating that we can cut \n     red tape, build more power plants and continue to protect the \n     environment.\n       Our State's history reflects a pattern of success even in \n     the face of unparalleled challenges. California, the most \n     populous state in the nation, has made incredible strides in \n     improving air quality and protecting public health. At the \n     same time, the State has enjoyed immense population and \n     business growth. During this current energy situation, \n     California will maintain its record of achieving a balance \n     among all the issues to ensure that a reasonable and \n     successful solution is achieved.\n       In sum, the air quality regulatory system works. The \n     Governor's utilization of his emergency powers to expedite \n     the process of power siting while maintaining environmental \n     standards confirms that California can maintain its \n     environmental and economic objectives.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify \n     this morning.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the point I am trying to make is that \nthere is no environmental law that is holding up either the approval or \nthe functioning of any generation facility in the State of California. \nAlso, I have written the CEOs of all of the energy generators that sell \npower to California and I have confirmation of this. I have not heard \nof one single example that contradicts Secretary Hickox's statement. So \nI believe that California is really doing all it can right now to \nmaximize energy supply, to reduce its demand, but it is still not \nlikely to be enough for the summer.\n  Now, this summer we are projected to have a shortfall on a warm day, \nwith all plants operating, of 2,000 megawatts. On a hot day, with some \nplants down, the shortfall is estimated to be 10,000 megawatts. That \ncould well be a serious disaster. Because hydropower in the Northwest \nis also low, there will also be shortages in other Western States as \nwell. Our State has already experienced several days of rolling \nblackouts, and when a blackout hits, it means traffic lights go out, \nelevators stop, fuel pumps are down, food begins to rot, and production \nstops. The economic losses are measured in billions, and there well \ncould be loss of life.\n  Let me put price on the table. This chart shows that in 1999 the \ntotal cost for energy in the State of California was $7 billion. In the \nyear 2000, those costs became $32 billion. The cost predicted for \nenergy to the State of California in 2001 is $65 billion.\n  Look at this cost jump in 3 years. This is the problem--this \nderegulated wholesale market has run amok, and there are no controls. \nIf the FERC has found these prices to be unjust and unreasonable and \nrefuses to regulate, what happens this year with these prices and no \nregulation? So the situation we are in is inordinately serious.\n  I want to make a couple of points about natural gas. Natural gas \nstocks are low everywhere, and the price for natural gas for most of \nthe country is averaging about 3 times more than the historic average. \nHowever, in Southern California, the prices are 8 to 9 times higher. \nCN Sugar, a refiner in Crockett, CA, generally pays about $450,000 a \nmonth for its steam generated through natural gas.\n  During the peaks of this past year, $450,000 a month has risen to $2 \nmillion a month. That plant can employ 1,000 to 1,200 people. That \nplant cannot continue to operate under these conditions.\n  There is a real problem in the transportation costs of natural gas \nbecause they are not transparent and because profits are hidden. The \ntransportation of natural gas, the cost of moving gas from, let's say, \nSan Juan, New Mexico, to San Diego has always been regulated. When it \nwas, that cost was about 70 cents per decatherm.\n  If natural gas is selling for $5 in San Juan and it costs 70 cents to \ntransport it to southern California, when it gets to southern \nCalifornia it should be selling for no more than $5.70.\n  The price of natural gas today in San Juan, NM, is $4.80. However, \nthe price in southern California today is $14.71. In northern \nCalifornia it is $9.59. Something is clearly wrong. This price need be \nno more than $6 per decatherm, not $14.71.\n  In February of 2000, the FERC decided to experiment, and it removed \nthe cap on the transportation of natural gas for 2\\1/2\\ years, \nbelieving the market would actually drive down the price. Clearly, the \nopposite happened. The absence of transparency allowed companies to \nwithhold parts of that natural gas transportation pipeline just for the \npurpose of increasing prices, and prices have risen.\n  Senator Gordon Smith and I, along with Senator Bingaman, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Murray, and Senator Lieberman, introduced legislation \nyesterday directing FERC to do its job. The legislation says that since \nyou, FERC, have found the prices to be unjust and unreasonable, you \nmust now do your job and you must set either cost-based rates on a \ntemporary basis or a rate cap on a temporary basis for the western grid \nwithin 60 days.\n  It requires that those costs must be passed on to the consumer in a \nmanner that the State believes just. The cost can be staggered over \nyears and passed on through real-time pricing, tiered pricing, or by \nsetting a baseline, but it must be passed on, again, to create a \nfunctioning marketplace.\n  The bill also requires that all future orders to sell natural gas or \nelectricity to an affected State must include a reasonable assurance of \npayment.\n  We believe this is a bill that must be passed by this body. The \nEnergy Committee has had two hearings on the subject, and I am hopeful \nthis body will pass this bill in a timely manner. The inability or \nfailure to do so I think is going to create a human and an economic \ndisaster in the Western States come summer because these costs, not \nonly of natural gas but electricity, in the hot months are going to be \nserious and extraordinarily high.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to give this status report. I \nend by particularly thanking Senator Smith of Oregon. He has worked \nwith me in a bipartisan way. He has gone with me to see members of the \ncommittees on the House side. He has stood very solid and steady in \nsupport of this legislation. I am very proud to have him as a major \ncosponsor. I also thank the Senators from the great State of Washington \nand the Senator from Connecticut who also recognize what this problem \nis and are determined to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about education. \nSince we are going to seriously consider education reform in this \nChamber during the ensuing days, I thought it might be appropriate for \nme to talk about it before I, and many others, offer amendments.\n  New Mexicans and Americans agree, from everything I can tell, that \nimproving the educational opportunities available to our children \nshould be our top priority. The issue is whether or not we can reform \nthe school system such that our children will perform better as they \nare educated in our public school systems in ensuing years.\n  There is ample evidence that it is absolutely imperative the public \nschool systems do better, that more and more of our schools be held \naccountable, and that an accountability requirement be part of the \nreform measures the Senate will be considering in the next few days or \nweeks.\n  For starters, going back to the days of our origin, I quote a very \ndistinguished American who talked about investing resources. Benjamin \nFranklin said:\n\n       An investment in knowledge always pays the highest \n     interest.\n\n  Obviously, that is a very simple way of talking about our priorities \nand\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nwhere we put our resources and where we might expect the best benefits \nfor society. This great American in our founding days said: You will \nalways get the best interest when you invest in knowledge.\n  Later in the discussions there will be ample opportunity for Senators \nto assess the performance of the school systems across America and what \nis happening to our children--not everywhere but some places; not to \nall children but to substantial numbers by way of our desire to give \nthem the basic skills with which to perform as students, as growing \nAmericans, and ultimately as adults in our society, which is requiring \nmore and more that people be skilled of mind, their cognitive skills be \ndeveloped to the highest extent possible.\n  The President of the United States, in suggesting reform of the \neducational system, also suggested with that reform there should be a \nsubstantial increase in the level of funding by the Federal Government. \nThe President suggested we spend $44.5 billion for the Department of \nEducation. That is an 11.5-percent increase over last year, but it is \nalso $1 billion in new funding for a new reading program for young \nchildren, tied into the reform measures that we will talk about as the \nbill proceeds.\n  It increases special education funding to a Federal share of 17 \npercent. That is 17 of the 40 percent we have committed. It is the \nhighest proportional share by the Federal Government in the history of \nthe program. It doesn't do justice to our original commitment of 40, \nbut for a 1-year add-on to the program, it is substantial. It provides \n$2.6 billion in the area of teacher quality funds. That is a 17-percent \nincrease. It provides a $\\1/2\\ billion increase for title I grants to \nserve disadvantaged children.\n  There is already bipartisan discussion between the committee members \nand the President. There will be a lot of discussion as to how to \nchange the underlying laws we have had on the books for a long time, \nthe bill that provides most of the funding for education and how that \nwill be changed.\n  The Senate will begin debate on a new act which is going to be called \nthe Better Education For Students and Teachers Act. I will take a few \nmoments to talk about my specific input which I will offer to the \nSenate.\n  Americans and New Mexicans are concerned. Their highest priority is \neducation. Second, most Americans and most New Mexicans are worried \nabout what is happening to the character and the morals of our society, \nof our culture. That seems to be almost the second most important issue \naround. I will be offering on the floor what will be called the Strong \nCharacter for Strong Schools Act.\n  It is important to note that reform does not only apply to math, \nscience, and reading. While the current debate is centered on reform, \nour bill simply encourages the creation of character education programs \nat the State and local level by providing grants to eligible entities. \nThe bill builds upon a highly successful demonstration program to \nincrease character education contained in last year's ESEA bill.\n\n  Since 1994, the Department of Education has granted seed money to \nsome of our school systems to develop character education programs. \nCurrently, there are 36 States that have either received some Federal \nfunding or on their own have enacted laws encouraging or mandating \ncharacter education. Thus, the time is now to ensure that there will be \na permanent and dedicated funding source made available for character \neducation programs.\n  When we first look at character education, questions are asked. What \nis it? Will it work? Will teachers want to do it? I will cite an \nexample of how it is being done in my State under a program called the \nSix Pillars of Good Character. I will read the words that equate to the \nsix pillars and discuss it. The words are trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These were developed \na few years ago when a large group of Americans, under the leadership \nof a foundation in the United States that brought them together to talk \nabout good character, the Josephsen Institute for Ethics, essentially a \nfoundation that promoted ethics, was specific in coming up with six \npillars of character.\n  In my State, we have the largest number of public schools at the \ngrade school level, junior high level, of any State in the Union that \nhas incorporated these six pillars into the daily education of our \nchildren. The teachers love it. It empowers them to do some things they \nhave always wanted to do. There are lesson plans that help them get \nacross these six pillars as part of the normal education of our \nchildren.\n  It is a joy to go to a school and see what is occurring in the \nhallways of the school. They chose one of the pillars of character for \neach month. If you go to the school when they chose ``responsibility,'' \nyou will see the hallways laden with posters that contain ideas and \nevents about responsibility. At the end of the month, they get together \nand talk about that pillar. You will see the most enthusiastic group of \nteachers and young people discussing what happened during that month \nwith respect to encouraging responsibility and understanding of it and \nactions based upon it.\n  Without telling the Senate how that got started, it is a glimpse of \nwhat can happen across America if we continue to encourage this kind of \ncharacter education and ask more and more of our States to get involved \nand encourage them but not order them to do this.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership. Since the departure of \nSenator Nunn, he has joined with me in promoting the encouraging \nstartup funding for character education in the United States.\n  In addition to that measure, Senator Kennedy will join me in a bill \nwhich will address itself to mental health needs in our schools. \nEssentially, it will say the mental health resources not in the school \nbut which are in the community and are public should be used in \ncollaboration with the schools for the counselors and for the young \npeople. I think that bill will find general acceptance in the Senate \nand is something we ought to encourage.\n  The third amendment I will introduce with a number of cosponsors has \nto do with the recruitment and retention of teachers. Rather than \ndetailing this, I will do so when I introduce the amendment. It is \nobvious we need teacher recruitment and teacher development. We will \npromote this idea by advocating teacher recruitment and development \nretention centers within our States for the exchange of names to \nprovide a program in the country on a purely voluntary grant basis \nwhere there would be internships by budding teachers with senior \nteachers known for their quality and competency, thus permitting a \nnumber of young Americans to have a half year or year service as an \nintern with an educator before they are placed in the classroom.\n  I think it is going to be a worthwhile debate. There are many \nparticipating from the committee in the Senate. I do not happen to be \non that committee, but I will participate to the maximum extent so \nthese three amendments and ideas will be incorporated in amendments \nthat will be offered on the floor.\n  I know Senator Smith is waiting and I have exceeded my time, so I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, under the time allotted to \nSenator Thomas I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in early April, April 6 to \nbe exact, the Senate recessed. The following day, April 7, a Saturday, \na helicopter, in the fog, crashed into the side of a mountain in \nVietnam. In that crash, seven American military personnel were killed \nas were nine Vietnamese. It is a grim yet a vivid reminder of the fact \nthat every day American servicemen throughout the world are serving \ntheir country in harm's way. Even though the Nation is not at war, we \nsometimes forget these men and women put their lives on the line for \nus.\n  I want to share with the Senate what these men were doing. These men \nwere searching for the remains of American missing personnel, MIAs from \nthe Vietnam war. These young men volunteered for this job and put their \nlives\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\non the line to find answers for the families of those who are missing.\n  In a statement issued April 7 by the National Alliance of Families \nexpressing their sympathy to the families, the National Alliance of \nFamilies said:\n\n       We extend our sincere condolences to the families of these \n     service members and hope they will be comforted by the fact \n     that their loved ones will always be remembered for their \n     commitment to finding our loved ones.\n\n  I just came back about 45 minutes ago from a memorial service at Fort \nMyer for those seven Americans and their nine Vietnamese counterparts. \nTo sit there with some of the families of those missing was difficult. \nBut, again, it is a reminder of what these men and women in uniform do, \nall across the world. I honor them today in the Senate by letting the \nAmerican people know who they are. These are not anonymous people; \nthese are real people with, now, real grieving widows, real grieving \nmothers and fathers.\n  The members on board were members of the Army, the Air Force, and the \nNavy. To be specific, there were three members of the U.S. Army, three \nmembers of the U.S. Air Force, and one Navy personnel. They were black, \nthey were Hispanic, they were Caucasian--they were Americans. They were \nAmerican military. They were: Army LTC Rennie Melville Cory, Jr., of \nOklahoma City, OK; LTC George D. Martin III of Hopkins, SC; and SFC \nTommy James Murphy of Georgia--hometown not available; they were Air \nForce MAJ Charles E. Lewis of Las Cruces, NM; MSG Steven L. Moser of \nSan Diego, CA; and TSgt Robert M. Flynn of Huntsville, AL; they were \nNavy CPO Pedro Juan Gonzalez of Buckeye, AZ--real people, real \nAmericans.\n  I used to teach high school, and oftentimes I would be amazed at the \nheroes some of our young people sought out--many in the athletic world, \nsome in the world of entertainment, some whom I might not have picked \nas heroes. But if you are looking for heroes to admire, here they are, \nseven of them, who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to search \nfor the remains of American men and women missing from the Vietnam war. \nWhat an honor to serve your country in that capacity.\n  At least five times that I can recall, I as a Member of either the \nCongress or the Senate had the opportunity to visit Vietnam--indeed, \nfly on maybe the same helicopter, but certainly similar helicopters \nwith Vietnamese pilots. We flew all over Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, \nflying these missions, trying to find answers for POWs and MIAs. These \nwonderful people who make these sacrifices--long days, weeks away from \ntheir families, on the ground, sifting through dirt, trying to find \nremains, looking at wreckage, digging into the files and the archives--\nwhatever it takes, they are out there doing it day in and day out with \nvery few accolades.\n  I honor them today by simply saying thank you. Thank you for caring \nenough to search for your colleagues and comrades in arms who are \nmissing. Thank you for serving your country. Thank you for making the \nultimate sacrifice doing it. I also thank the families, those who \nsurvive, who will now endure this pain.\n  It is special with me because I have also endured it. When I was 3 \nyears old my father, who served in World War II, died in the service of \nhis country in a military aircraft accident. My mother, as a widow, \nraised me and my brother for all those years.\n  These are heroes. These were members of what is called the Joint Task \nForce--Full Accounting. I ask all of us, my colleagues in the Senate \nand the American people who are listening, tonight, when you put your \nhead down, you might just remember these men in your prayers and say \nthank you from a grateful nation for your service.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know there have been a number, more or \nless, of opening statements or statements with regard to education in \nAmerica in the hope that we can move forward on a very important \neducation reform bill that has been requested by President Bush and has \nbeen worked on in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nThe bill was reported out overwhelmingly some months ago.\n  At that point, negotiations began between Republicans on the \ncommittee, Democrats on the committee, and the administration. I had \nthe impression that good progress had been made. That is as it should \nbe. Education is a very high priority in America with the President and \nwith the Congress but, most importantly, with the American people.\n  I have stated in this Chamber many times before how importantly I \nview education. In my State of Mississippi, we are struggling mightily \nto improve the quality of our education to make sure that quality \neducation is available to all of our students. We are truly working on \nthe idea that no child should be left behind.\n  We had a $100 million contribution from Jim and Sally Barkesdale for \nfourth grade reading only in my State.\n  We are now at a point where we have 50 schools that have been \napproved for the Power-Up Program where students from the fifth grade \nto the eighth grade have access to privately donated computers with \nspecifically trained teachers on how to teach these children to use \nthem to learn to read. This program allows them to become computer \nliterate and improve their reading skills.\n  Now we have unique programs in my State for fourth graders, and fifth \nthrough the eighth grade for reading alone. We are focusing on where \nthere is a tremendous need. That story can be replicated all across \nAmerica.\n\n  In addition to that, I am a son of a schoolteacher. She taught for 19 \nyears before she got into bookkeeping and eventually into radio \nannouncing. So I care a lot about education.\n  I worked for the University of Mississippi in placement and in the \nfinancial office for the alumni association and for the law school \nplacement bureau. I have been involved in working with guidance \ncounselors and teachers and promoting education generally. I care \nmightily about this.\n  As a Member of Congress for 29 years, I have watched us try to have a \nconstructive role from the Federal level with the States and local \nschool officials. We have put billions of dollars into trying to be \nhelpful from the Federal level. The number is well over $130-plus \nbillion for title I since I think 1965.\n  As we poured more and more money from the Federal level into local \neducation, the test scores have continued to slide downward. There is \nsomething missing. Money alone is not the answer. Money is part of the \nanswer. We need to put more funds at the local, State, and Federal \nlevel into education, but we need more than that. We need fundamental \nreform. We need flexibility. We need accountability. We need to make \nsure the children are learning to read and to do math. We need to know \nwe are getting results for the efforts that are put into this important \narea of education.\n  We need to make sure teachers have the training they need to do the \njob, and that there are more and better programs to make sure we have \nteachers who have been taught how to teach the use of computers. We \nhave computers in backs of classrooms and in hallways that aren't being \nused because they do not have teachers who are trained or qualified to \nteach their usage. We need more progress for our teachers. We need \naccountability for teachers.\n  Testing is something I have struggled with a little bit. We need to \nhave a way to know how our students are doing. I worry about a national \ntesting system. But the President has convinced me that there must be \nsome sort of testing mechanism with a lot of local discretion, and it \nmust occur regularly, not just sporadically.\n  There is much we can do in this area. I had been prepared to and have \nbeen under the impression that we were going to be able to move on the \neducation reform package on Monday of this week. But there was an \nobjection to the motion to proceed. My attitude was, fine, we will \nbegin talking about the issue and emphasize its importance, and surely \nwe can go to the bill\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\non Tuesday. Tuesday came and went. Even though great progress was made \non negotiations and reform and movement on the money issue, there was \nstill no agreement to go forward on the bill. Now here we are on \nWednesday. Each time I have called and talked to the Democratic leader, \nI have had the impression that he would like to move forward, but, he \nwas just not quite ready yet.\n  I understand what is occurring. Leverage is being applied on the \nPresident to try to get more money, and to get a commitment to spend \nmore and more money. It is obvious what is happening. But I don't think \nthat is the responsible thing to do.\n  I think we should go forward with the bill. In the past I have been \ncriticized because I wouldn't move to a bill and just said let's let \nthe Senate work its will. Let's have amendments. Let's have votes. Some \namendments win; some lose. In the end, you have a product, and then you \nvote and go forward.\n\n  I am being told until a total agreement is reached, we cannot go \nforward. I do not understand. Education is the highest priority in \nAmerica with the President, the legislative branch, the States, the \nGovernors, local school officials--everybody--and here we are. We \nstand, and we wait.\n  We are ready to go to the bill. Let's take it up. Let's have a free-\nflowing debate. Let's have amendments. Let's have votes. Let's do our \njob. Yet I am told we cannot even proceed to the bill.\n  Well, I am going to be patient. I am hoping that by this afternoon we \ncan at least proceed to this bill. It was reported unanimously out of \ncommittee. Let's go to the underlying bill. We can have some amendments \noffered. Then, if there is agreement between all the parties, the \nmanager can offer an amendment, and we can amend that.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's begin. \nLet's do our job on education. We have had enough time. We should have \ndone the bill in February. But I was told by the committee it was not \nready. Then I was told we were making progress. And then it was \nreported out overwhelmingly. Everybody was happy. We are ready to go, \nand yet here we are and we cannot go forward.\n  So rather than just at this point mark time, I thought it was \nimportant that we go forward and try to take up another bill while we \nhope that some agreement can be reached and we can move forward on the \neducation bill.\n  I talked to the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over \nthe brownfields legislation. I had thought maybe there would be a need \nto go to this legislation as we were getting ready to go home for the \nEaster period. I indicated to the chairman I thought it would be \nnecessary for him to be prepared to go forward. He is ready to do so.\n  So I think I am going to ask for an agreement I believe the \nDemocratic leadership is agreeable to this that we would go forward \nwith this legislation which affects all of our States, a lot of \ncommunities. This is some reform legislation that hopefully will allow \nmore of these brownfields to actually be cleaned up and not just be a \nlawyers' enhancement act. This will be a plus for the institution and \nit will get us some results. I believe we can do this in a couple hours \nand we would be prepared to have a vote at about 2 o'clock or so.\n  I inquire of the chairman of the committee, is your counterpart \nready?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I see the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. We are ready.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the work \nthey have already done and for being ready to go to this bill on short \nnotice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3877-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 350\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart. And I do \nnot say that without justification. I measure my words in saying that I \nrise today with a heavy heart, for it will shortly be time for me to \nsay goodbye, for now at least, to one of the most extraordinary men I \nhave ever had the pleasure of knowing in my 83 years on God's \nfootstool, this Earth.\n  The minority staff director of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nMr. Jim English, has decided to retire this year. Jim English has been \nmy right arm, figuratively speaking, since 1989, when I assumed the \nchairmanship of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate. We have \nbeen through so many battles together, that sometimes it seems as if \nJim English has always been with me. I could almost say, I can never \nremember a time in my life when Jim was not beside me.\n  In fact, I met Jim English in 1973, when he worked on the \nTransportation Subcommittee, but he did not actually work directly for \nme until 1989.\n  Jim English was born on a farm near Homer, LA. That simple fact \nexplains a great deal. Jim English has a head full of brains. And he \nknows how to use them. They do not go to waste. They are not dormant. \nThey are always working. But while he has a head full of brains, he \ndoes not have a thimble full of arrogance or supercilious attitude.\n  He is rock solid. He is honest. And he is full of good humor. He is \nthe type of person whose values and character reflect the very best of \nAmerica, and indeed the very best of human nature, and the preeminently \nbest of nobility. Few persons have I seen in life that I would think of \nas being noble. Jim English is one. I do not recall ever having said \nthis about anybody else. It does not mean that I have not seen other \nvery noble people. The man who raised me, Titus Dalton Byrd, a man of \nlittle education, but with a big heart and a great soul, was a noble \nman.\n  James English has had a working career which includes being an \naccounting clerk for the D.C. Government, revenue officer for the IRS, \nclerk of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, vice president \nfor government affairs at Amtrak, Assistant Secretary of the Senate, \nstaff director of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and minority \nstaff director of the Appropriations Committee. I daresay that\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nhe has worn all of those many hats, those many badges with distinction. \nThere is probably no position that Jim would not improve just by \noccupying it.\n  He is without doubt--and I have had some extraordinarily fine staff \npeople--he is without a doubt, overall, the finest staff member I have \never employed in my 48 years on Capitol Hill.\n  I have employed some top-notch, very fine staff people. I say this \nabout Jim English because of his versatility, for one. He is \nmultitalented, he is supremely capable, and he is completely undaunted \nby any challenge. Jim English is also unrelentingly curious. He will \ndig and dig and dig until he gets an answer to a question.\n  It has been said by someone that curiosity is one of the certain \ncharacteristics of a vigorous mind. When you stop and think about it, \nthat is a very apt saying. Never was there a better example of the \ntruth of that observation than we have seen in Jim English. Moreover, I \nhave never met anyone so consistently good humored, even in the most \nstressful of situations. As my dear friend, Senator Ted Stevens, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, knows, there are certainly \ntimes when being on the Appropriations Committee staff can be \ndreadfully stressful and demanding.\n  I cannot recall ever seeing Jim English angry in all of the years I \nhave known him. I have rarely ever even seen him become impatient.\n  Emerson once observed:\n\n       It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; \n     it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great \n     man is he who in the midst of a crowd keeps with perfect \n     sweetness the independence of solitude.\n\n  That is Jim English. He is the epitome of Emerson's thoughts in that \nregard: Gentle with everyone, yet the toughest of adversaries when he \nmust be tough. Jim English seems always to maintain perfect control and \nequanimity. In all the years I have worked with Jim English, I have \nnever heard him tell an off-color joke. I have never heard him use \nprofanity. If he had, he wouldn't stay on my staff. I don't use it in \nfront of my staff. Not that I have never used it in my life, but I \ndon't use it anymore. And Jim English doesn't use it. My staff people \ndon't use it. He is just a good man.\n  The Bible says no man is good, but Jim English comes as near to it as \nanyone I have ever met. Losing him will be like losing an arm. Jim has \ngiven over 30 years to Federal service, with 23 of those years spent \nwith the Senate Appropriations Committee. Almost 13 of those 23 years \nhe has spent working closely with me.\n  I shall miss him professionally, and I shall miss him personally, but \nI know he wants to spend more time with his lovely and good wife \nPhyllis, with his daughters Kathleen Pfost and Elizabeth Arensdorf, and \nwith his four grandchildren, Ashley, Alex, Evan, and Jimmy. As much as \nI regret losing Jim English--and I couldn't keep him if I wanted to--no \none could begrudge him these desires.\n  I wish for him all the best that life has to offer, and I want him to \nknow I am grateful for the loyalty, the service, and the friendship he \nhas offered to me for so many good years.\n  My dear colleague--and I say ``dear colleague'' meaning it--Ted \nStevens is on the floor. He wants to share his thoughts on this \nsubject.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to Senator Stevens, after \nwhich I be recognized again for just a few lines, and that the time be \nextended to whatever is necessary, which will not be very long but not \nmore than 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to my great friend from \nWest Virginia. I am chairing a hearing at the present time of the \nDefense Subcommittee of Appropriations. But I am saddened to come to \nthe Chamber for this occasion to recognize and comment upon the \nretirement of Jim English from the staff of our Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n  I say to Jim, very frankly, all of the members of our staff, \nminority, majority, Members and staff, extend to him our heartfelt \ncongratulations and thanks for all he has done and our desire that he \nand his wife Phyllis and their daughters and grandchildren will have a \ngrand time.\n  I can't fathom a young man such as that deciding to retire, but I \nhope there are some fishing holes along the line that he will explore, \nand other activities to do. My first father-in-law told me that English \nis the only language in which ``retire'' means other than go to bed. I \nhope it is a misuse of the term ``retire'' in terms of referring to Jim \nEnglish because he has much yet to contribute to our country and to his \nfamily.\n  Senator Byrd and I have worked together with Jim English since 1973. \nAlthough he left the committee and worked for Amtrak, as my colleague \nmentioned, and he worked under the leadership of the Senator from West \nVirginia on his staff and with the leadership staff, he has been back \nagain with our committee since 1989, according to our figures, and has \nserved as Senator Byrd's majority staff director and now as the \nDemocratic staff director in this equalness we are now celebrating.\n  In the time I have been chairman, Jim English has not just been an \nadviser to Senator Byrd, he has been our adviser, the committee's \nadviser, and he has worked with us in a way that has been deserving of \nthe trust we have imposed and conferred upon him. He is a man who \nbelieves in close bipartisan relationships. On a committee such as \nours, he has fostered that by his actions and by his work. Much of the \ncredit for the close bipartisan relationship we have now comes from the \nwork he did before when Senator Byrd was chairman of the committee. \nThat period has extended through the time I have been chairman.\n  We have a different relationship on our committee. It is a committee \nthat recognizes the work has to be done. There is only one committee \nthat actually has to pass 13 bills every year. No matter what happens, \nthose bills have to pass the Congress. They have to be approved by our \ncommittee. As my colleague mentioned, there are many issues that arise, \nmany specific battles where animosities develop within our ranks. I \nhave never seen Jim English take part in that. He has been a man of \ncalm temper--unlike me, I might add--and he is one who has worked to \nensure that the processes we follow are fair and honorable.\n  I can say without any question that my staff and I have trusted Jim \ncompletely. If he tells us anything, it is accepted on its face. There \nis no reason to go behind Jim English's word. He is a man who has \nplayed a central role in the appropriations process for many years.\n  I come to the Chamber to say I will miss him. I really don't like the \nidea of seeing a young man such as him leave. It raises a question in \nmy mind: Who is the smarter of the two?\n  Anyone who recognizes the caliber of Jim English and his \nprofessionalism will understand how much we are going to miss him.\n  I am sure you will find someone to replace him, and it is my hope \nthat we will have the same relationship with whomever that is. But it \nis a difficult time to have a person such as Jim decide to leave, and I \nwant to say to Jim English that the doors of my offices will always be \nopen to you, no matter the issue and I will continue to rely upon your \nadvice, no matter where you go. I think you have earned the reputation \nto be accepted in this body as a man of integrity and honor and one who \nhas always kept his word. There is nothing better you can say about a \nman, in my opinion.\n  I wish I had the capability the Senator from West Virginia has to \nremember quotes from distinguished authors. I have never tried to \ndevelop that capability. But I do want Jim to know we have benefited \ngreatly from his service, whether Republican or Democrat. The country \nis better off for you having spent time with us. We hope you will enjoy \nyour life from now on and come back to see us from time to time. \nWhatever your new endeavors may be, you have our best wishes, and you \nhave my assurance that I would be ready to help you in any regard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens for those remarks. \nIn my judgment, having served on the Appropriations Committee longer \nthan any other Senator serving, going on 43 years--and I have seen some \ngood chairmen of the Appropriations Committee--I have no hesitancy in \nsaying Senator Stevens is the best chairman\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nof the Appropriations Committee--and that includes myself as chairman--\nhe is the best chairman the Senate Appropriations Committee has had \nduring my long tenure in this body. I know that what he says brings \npride to the heart of this man--Jim English--who is about to leave the \nemploy of the Senate.\n  Let me close with a few lines which I think are most fitting when we \nthink of Jim English.\n\n                       It Will Show In Your Face\n\n     You don't have to tell how you live each day\n     You don't have to say if you work or play;\n     For a tried and true barometer--right in its place,\n     However you live, my friend, it will show in your face.\n\n     The false, the deceit that you bear in your heart\n     Won't stay down inside where it first got its start;\n     For sinew and blood are a thin veil of lace\n     What you carry in your heart will show in your face.\n\n     If you have gambled and won in the great game of life\n     If you feel you have conquered sorrow and strife;\n     If you played the game square and you stand on first base,\n     You won't have to tell it, it will show in your face.\n\n     Then if you dissipate nights till the day is most nigh,\n     There is only one teller, and one that won't lie;\n     Since your facial barometer is right in its place,\n     However you live, my friend, it will show in your face.\n\n     Well, if your life is unselfish and for others you live,\n     Not for what you can get but for what you can give,\n     And if you live close to God in his infinite grace,\n     You won't have to tell it, it will show in your face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3879-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING JAMES HAROLD ENGLISH FOR HIS 23 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE \n                          UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that my friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, yield for a brief minute.\n  Mr. President, we have nine Senators who wish to speak on this \nlegislation, and there may be others at a subsequent time. I wonder if \nmy friend from New Hampshire would allow us to give a rough idea of \nwhen people should be here. I know the Senator from Oklahoma, a \nvaluable member of the committee, wishes to speak before the chairman, \nand I have no problem with that. I am wondering, how long does the \nSenator from Oklahoma wish to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Following that, Mr. President, I wonder if we may have a \nunanimous consent agreement that the Senator from New Hampshire speak \nfor up to 20 minutes; the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, 15 minutes; \nSenator Chafee, 15 minutes; Senator Boxer, 15 minutes; Senator Bond, 15 \nminutes; Senator Clinton, 15 minutes; Senator Crapo, 15 minutes; and \nSenator Corzine, 15 minutes. That will use about an hour and 20 minutes \nand still leave time for others who wish to come.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me change that to about 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Let's make it 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right.\n  Mr. REID. I have failed to list Senator Carper, but we will do him \nafter that for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was one who opposed S. 350 when it \nwas in committee because of some problems that were there that we have \ntried to address, we have gotten a lot of cooperation from the \ncommittee in the meantime to address the problems. I think S. 350 \ncontains provisions that would be a positive first step toward \nrevitalizing brownfields in this country.\n  S. 350 provides developers with moderate assurances for Superfund-\nforced cleanups. While some of my concerns over the finality of the \nlanguage remain, I am comforted by the remarks of the chairman and \nranking member of the committee concerning new information. That is, \nthe information referred to in S. 350 pertains to information of the \nhighest quality, objectivity, and weight which is acquired after \ncleanup has begun. With this language, I don't think the abuses I was \nconcerned about are going to be there. If they are, we will be \nmonitoring it.\n  The scope of the cleanup finality provision is still of concern. The \nEPA could simply sidestep the bill by using RCRA, the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act, or even the Toxic Substances and Control \nAct to force parties to clean up sites. This is one of the concerns we \ntried to address in the committee. I don't think it has been addressed \nto our satisfaction, but at least we are in a position to monitor it.\n  It has been the argument of supporters of the legislation that EPA \nhas never overfiled on a brownfields site. If the EPA overfiles a State \ncleanup, S. 350 now requires the EPA to notify Congress. I wasn't \nsatisfied with just the fact that they had not done this in the past \nbecause there is always that first time. We will be closely monitoring \nthis to make sure that provision stays in the legislation.\n  I still have concerns that businesses will not feel adequately \nprotected, and, therefore, brownfields may not get cleaned up. In the \nend, the developers and businesses will be the judges of S. 350's \nsuccesses or failures.\n  A lot of people forget this and look at the bureaucracy and say: We \nare going to have all this language. I can assure you, Mr. President, \nif we do not have some protection for developers and businesses that \nare willing to bid on cleanup sites, they are not going to be able to \ndo it. It does not do any good to pass legislation unless there is \nenough confidence in the business community that they will not be \nabused if they bid on these projects.\n  According to the EPA's figures, there are 200,000 sites contaminated \nprimarily from petroleum. This is roughly half the approximately \n450,000 brownfields in the United States. During the markup, I had \nconcerns that by failing to address RCRA, Congress was neglecting the \n200,000-plus sites that are petroleum-contaminated brown-\nfield sites in this country. By not addressing these sites in S. 350, \nCongress is preventing almost half the brownfields in this country from \nbeing cleaned up and developed.\n  I insisted Congress must address this issue. I stated that it was not \nright to allow so many brownfields to remain contaminated under this \nprogram.\n  I am proud to say today help is on the way for these sites. The \nInhofe amendment, which is incorporated into the managers' amendment, \nwill take a first major step toward cleaning up petroleum-contaminated \nsites.\n  Specifically, the Inhofe amendment, A, allows relatively low-risk \nbrown-\nfield sites contaminated by petroleum or petroleum products to apply \nfor brownfields revitalization funding and, B, authorizes $50 million \nto be used for petroleum sites.\n  My amendment will allow the large amount of abandoned gas stations \nand other mildly petroleum-contaminated sites all across the Nation to \nbe cleaned up and put back into productive use.\n  Finally, I still want to work to place a cap on the administrative \ncosts set aside by the Federal EPA. A cost cap will ensure States and \nparties seeking to clean up and redevelop brownfields are getting the \nvast majority of the funds for brownfields programs and not just for \nadministrative costs.\n  EPA has informed us they are currently using approximately 16 percent \nof brownfields funds appropriated on administrative costs. This amount \nis unacceptable. I will be watching very closely to see what can be \ndone perhaps in the appropriations process. Senator Bond and some \nothers can perhaps propose an amendment to get this cap on and avoid \nexcessive administrative costs.\n  Over the last several years, the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works has worked very hard on Superfund reform. With S. 350, the \ncommittee has decided for now to address only brownfields.\n  There are a lot of other problems. In the very beginning, I said \nlet's not cherry-pick this thing; let's not just address brownfields. \nLet's get into it and look at retroactive liability, natural resource \ndamages, joint and several liability, and some of the abuses that have \ntaken place in this system.\n  I believe we now have the assurance of enough Members that we will go \nahead with a more comprehensive program and address these other \nproblems.\n\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member and specifically Senators \nCrapo, Bond, and Voinovich who are helping me on some of the issues \nabout which I have concerns and also the staff who have spent many \nhours coming up with a bill that I think is acceptable. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Smith is right outside the door. I \nam told that is the case.\n  Based on a prior unanimous consent agreement, Senator Smith will \nspeak from 11:40 a.m. until 12 o'clock. I will\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nspeak from 12 to 12:15 p.m. Senator Chafee will speak from 12:15 p.m. \nto 12:30 p.m. Senator Boxer will speak from 12:30 p.m. to 12:45 p.m. \nSenator Bond will speak from 12:45 p.m. to 1 p.m. Senator Clinton will \nspeak from 1 p.m. to 1:15 p.m. Senator Crapo will speak from 1:15 p.m. \nto 1:30 p.m. Senator Corzine will speak from 1:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. \nSenator Carper will speak from 1:45 p.m. to 2 p.m.\n  If anyone wants to juggle those times, they can contact the Members. \nThat is the way it is now.\n  Mr. President, while Senator Smith is on his way, I wish to express \nmy appreciation to the majority leader. I have been on the floor the \nlast 3 days indicating why we did not go to this legislation, and we \nare now considering it.\n  I extend my appreciation to Senator Lott for moving forward this very \nimportant piece of legislation. It is something that is long overdue, \nyears overdue, but it is something that could not be more timely to \nclean up half a million sites and do a lot of good things about which \nwe will hear in the next couple of hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am very proud to be \ndebating the brownfields legislation, known as the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, or S. 350. It \nis a bill we have worked on for a long time--many years actually. It is \nexciting to be at this point and to have bipartisan legislation that, \nfrankly, we know after we finish the debate is going to pass. That does \nnot happen every day in the Senate. So it is exciting.\n  I am proud that two-thirds of the Senate, both political parties, are \ncosponsors--68 to be exact. Also, the President supports the bill. If \nwe can get the cooperation of the House of Representatives, this will \npass quickly, and the President will sign it. We are very excited about \nthat.\n  This bill has the full bipartisan support of all members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee across the political spectrum.\n  Make no mistake about it, in spite of the support the bill has, it \nhas not been an easy process. Superfund, so-called, is a very difficult \nsubject. That is an issue I have worked on and I know Senator Reid and \nSenator Chafee and others have for many years.\n  Ever since I began my service in the Congress, I have tried to reform \nthis flawed Superfund law. It has been a bitter battle with a lot of \ndifferences of opinion as to how we do it, sometimes partisan and \nsometimes regional. But basically on reforming Superfund, other than a \nfew short fixes on certain things such as recyclers, we really have not \naccomplished very much in the last 11 years.\n  I have always believed we are in need of comprehensive Superfund \nreform to make the program work. I still believe after we pass the bill \nthere is a lot to be done. Today we have a chance to do something good. \nIt is not comprehensive Superfund reform. Frankly, I am at the point \nnow where comprehensive Superfund reform is not going to happen, and \nmaybe it should not happen. Maybe we should just move forward on a \npiece-bill basis and do the right thing.\n\n  I was pleased to be joined by the committee's ranking member, the \nSuperfund subcommittee chairman and its ranking member, Senators Reid, \nChafee, and Boxer. I commend all of my colleagues who are present--\nSenator Reid, Senator Boxer, Senator Chafee--for their leadership and \nworking tirelessly and in good faith in a bipartisan manner. Without \ntheir cooperation and help, we would not be here today.\n  It is always easy to reach agreement on easy issues, but the \ndifficult issues, such as some of the issues with which we deal in the \nenvironment, are not that easy and we have to work hard, respect the \nother side's position, and try to come to a compromise.\n  If there is any positive spinoff from a 50/50 Senate, about which so \nmuch is written and spoken, it is that, even if we do not want to, we \nhave to work together because we are not going to pass anything \nmeaningful, anything positive. We will not pass anything out of \ncommittee going anywhere on the floor unless it is bipartisan.\n\n  We may not always agree on how to achieve our goals, but we all share \nthe same desire for a safe and healthy environment for all of our \nfamilies and for the future and our future generations. As I have said \nmany times, environment should be about the future. It shouldn't be \nabout politics of today. It should be about tomorrow and our children. \nSometimes in the decisions we make we would like to have immediate \nresults, but we don't get them. It takes time to see the fruits of our \nlabors.\n  I think you will see in the brownfields legislation, when it passes, \nthe process of cleaning up the old abandoned industrial sites.\n  I thank President Bush, as well, and his new EPA administrator, \nChristine Whitman, for unwavering support. When they first took office, \nmy very first meeting was with then-Governor Whitman, now Administrator \nWhitman. She gave me her full support and commitment on this issue, as \ndid the President. The President stated the brownfields reform is a top \nenvironmental priority for his administration. It will now pass the \nSenate within the first 100 days of the administration. That is a \npromise made and a promise kept--sometimes rare in politics these days.\n  The President recognizes what it means for the environment. I am \nproud the Senate will pass this priority and do it today.\n  As former Governors, both President Bush and Administrator Whitman \nunderstand the importance of cleaning up the sites, and the President \ndeserves credit for making this a top priority, as do my colleagues in \nthe Senate. Without the support of the President, we would not see this \nlegislation become law. To his credit, President Clinton, as well, was \na supporter of the brownfields bill.\n  It has not been easy, but we have worked in good faith. I thank all \nSenators involved for their willingness to work together toward this \ncommon goal. It is amazing what can be accomplished when we set aside \nthe rhetoric and focus on the goal; or, indeed, if we have the \nrhetoric, complete the rhetoric and sit down and get focused on getting \nthe job done.\n  Last year, the committee was successful in passing good, balanced, \nbipartisan legislation, including estuaries restoration, clean beaches, \nand the most famous of all, the historic Everglades restoration, which \nwas a prime project of the Senator from Rhode Island, our distinguished \nfather and former colleague, Mr. John Chafee.\n  I made a commitment after Senator Chafee's passing that I would, in \nfact, shepherd that bill through the Senate, which we did, and \nPresident Clinton signed it. It is now law. We will see that great \nnatural resource restored.\n  Again, it will take time. It will not happen tomorrow. We will not \nsee the Everglades restored tomorrow, but we will see it done over a \nperiod of 10, 20, 30 years. We will not see every brownfield restored \ntoday after passage of the bill, but we will see industrial site after \nindustrial site, abandoned industrial sites all over America, gradually \nbecome green or restored in a way that they are productive and \nproducing tax revenues in the communities across our Nation.\n  When you see a brownfield, abandoned site, and you see activity, with \npeople working and cleaning it up, and it is looking nice in your \ncommunity, you can reference back to this legislation and know that is \nwhy it is being done.\n  People say, why do you need the legislation? The answer is, under \ncurrent law no one will clean them up. I will discuss the reasons in a \nmoment. With brownfields, we have proven we can work together in \ncooperation, as opposed to confrontation, and we can accomplish great \nthings. When we talk about all the great issues of the day, whether \nChina, the budget, or whatever, brownfields is not exactly something \nthat gets a lot of glamour. We had a huge debate on the Ashcroft \nconfirmation. That received a lot of publicity. However, down in the \ntrenches, these are the kinds of issues that don't get a lot of \nattention. Maybe the trade press follows them. The national press \ndoesn't do much. Indeed, sometimes not even your local press, but it is \nimportant. It is very important to the communities because we will be \nrestoring these sites.\n  I am hopeful the effort will set the stage for more cooperation and \nalso get\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nat more of the old Superfund law to pick away and try to reform various \nparts of the bill so we don't need Superfund anymore. We will be \ncleaning up all of these sites as soon as we can.\n  We have learned environmental politics delays environmental \nprotection. Let me repeat that: Environmental politics delays \nenvironmental protection. The more we argue about things, the longer it \ntakes to get something in place that will bring this to resolution, and \nthe resolution would be the cleanup. The expedited cleanup of \nbrownfield sites is very important to my constituents in New Hampshire, \nas it is to other constituents in other States. My State helped to \ndrive this economy during the industrial age--little old New Hampshire, \nwith the mills along the Merrimack. We have more than our share of \nthese likely contaminated sites waiting to be turned back into positive \nassets, including abandoned railroad sites, along the railroads, along \nthe rivers. Frequently, these are the sites we are talking about. It \ncould be Bradford, Keene, Concord, or New Ipswich. This bill will be of \nmonumental benefit to not only those towns but many towns all over \nAmerica. This bill will also create opportunities for the development \nof more facilities such as the Londonderry eco-industrial park. Now \nthese brownfield sites will turn into industrial parks. Or, indeed, if \nthey are not parks, they may very well be ``green'' parks as opposed to \nindustrial parks. Again, this bill provides help in that regard.\n  If you take an abandoned industrial site and convert it to a good \ncommercial site, producing revenues for the community, it enhances the \ncommunity in a beautification way, produces revenue, puts people to \nwork. It is a win-win-win. Furthermore, it takes the pressure off of \ngreen space. We won't go outside of Frankfurt, KY, somewhere and pull \noff acres of land to build an industrial park if we have 10 acres of \nabandoned brownfield sites to bring back and revitalize and use again. \nThat is the beauty of the legislation.\n  I am proud to help communities all across the Nation. We estimate as \nmany as 400,000 to 500,000 brownfield sites exist across America. We \nwill see activity now on these sites.\n  A brief background on the bill. On March 8, the Environmental and \nPublic Works Committee reported S. 350, the Brownfields Revitalization \nand Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. There were a few dissenting \nvotes, but we worked with those individuals who had concerns and the \nMembers now have been able to reconcile those differences. As far as I \nknow, we have a totally united front. That is a tribute to every member \nof that committee, on both sides, a tribute to the staffs of the \nmembers working hard to address the concerns to come out with a totally \nunified effort on a bipartisan bill.\n\n  This is a strong bill. It deserves the support of the full Senate, \nnot only the 68 cosponsors but the other 32 out there, as well.\n  How is S. 350 better than current law? That is the issue. Current law \nis what it is and we are now cleaning up sites. How do we improve it? \nSimply stated, our bill provides an element of finality that does not \nexist today in current law. While allowing for Federal involvement \nunder specific conditions, current law allows EPA to act whenever there \nis a release or a threatened release. Again, current law allows EPA to \nact whenever there is a release or threatened release.\n  This bill changes that requirement, ups the ante a little bit, and \nprovides four things: One, EPA to find that ``the release or threatened \nrelease may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public \nhealth, welfare or the environmnent'' and after taking into \nconsideration response activities already taken, ``additional response \nactions are likely to be necessary to address, prevent, limit, or \nmitigate the release or threatened release.\n  We put some conditions on there for the EPA's finding.\n  We also find that the action should come at the request of the State \nif we need to come back.\n  Third, contamination may have migrated across a State line.\n  Fourth, there may be new information to emerge after the cleanup that \nresults in the site presenting a threat.\n  That is not all our bill does. It also authorizes $200 million in \ncritically needed funds to assess and clean up brownfield sites as well \nas $50 million to assist State cleanup programs. This is more than \ndouble the level of funding currently expended on the EPA brownfield \nprogram.\n  I also want to point out this is not about only Federal dollars. The \nFederal dollars, the $200 million we are talking about here, are \nnowhere near enough money to clean up 500,000 brownfield sites. What \nthis does is it limits the liability and brings us closer to finality \nin cleanup so we can now get contractors to go on these sites. They can \nget the insurance, they can take the risk, and they are not going to be \nheld accountable if a hot spot or some other problem that was not their \nfault occurs several years down the road. That has been the problem to \ndate. They cannot do it because they will be held liable so they say, \nfine, we are not going to go on the site and clean it up and take the \nrisk.\n  If a contractor comes onto a site, he is responsible. If he does what \nhe is supposed to do, follows the plans as he is supposed to, cleans it \nup and does it in good faith and we find something later, he is not \naccountable. That is why this bill will go so far toward moving us in \nthe right direction, getting these sites cleaned up.\n  Individuals and towns and property owners will now invest in cleaning \nup these sites. Banks will lend money. There are millions and millions \nof dollars--tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions--that will be \nused now from the private sector to clean up these sites, far beyond \nthe $200 million we are talking about in this bill.\n  This will promote conservation through redevelopment, as I said \nbefore, as opposed to new greenfield development, and will help to \nrevitalize our city centers and create new jobs in the inner cities. It \nis a win for the environment, a win for the economy, a win for the \nNation, a win for every State, including New Hampshire, and a lot of \ncommunities with those brownfield sites. It is a giant step forward. We \nnow have a chance to move forward on a piece of legislation that will \nmake a significant difference in communities across the Nation.\n  The real winners are the people who live near these abandoned sites--\nsometimes those are minorities--the renewed urban centers that will see \ndevelopment and jobs replace blighted, contaminated sites, the local \ncommunities that will be revitalized, and the green space that is \npreserved. It is a win, win, win, win, win, no matter how you cut it. \nThanks to the leadership of my colleagues, Senators Reid, Boxer, and \nChafee, and all my colleagues on the committee, we have a chance to \nenact now, for the first time in all the years I have been in Congress, \nwhich is 16--the first time to enact meaningful brownfields reform. We \ncame out of the gate running. I hope the House will follow suit, \nbecause if they do, it will be on the President's desk shortly and the \nPresident can sign this bill before the end of the summer.\n  There are numerous interests that support S. 350. I ask unanimous \nconsent that several letters of support I have received--and all of us \nhave received them--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                                    March 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to commend you for \n     your continued commitment to the issue of Brownfields \n     revitalization. Without the necessary reforms to the \n     Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act \n     (CERCLA), clean up and redevelopment opportunities are lost \n     as well as new jobs, new tax revenues, and the opportunity to \n     manage growth. NCSL's Environment Committee has made this a \n     top priority and we applaud the committee's leadership for \n     designating it as one of the first environmental issues to be \n     brought before the 107th Congress.\n       The Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 (S 350) provides a welcome increase \n     in federal funding for the assessment and cleanup of state \n     brownfields. We are encouraged by the committee's efforts to \n     provide some level of liability reform for innocent property \n     owners. NCSL would also like to acknowledge the committee's \n     success in garnering broad bi-partisan support on an issue \n     that is of concern in all 50 states.\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\n       As you continue work on The Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, we urge you to \n     reexamine the following:\n       The 20% cost share (under CERCLA the cost share is 10%)--\n     this could discourage states with tight budgets from \n     participating in the program. NCSL suggests that you maintain \n     the cost share provision of 10% under CERCLA.\n       NCSL recognizes that finality has been a contentious issue. \n     NCSL acknowledges that the bill provides relief from \n     Superfund liability, but we urge the committee to reexamine \n     the power of the Administrator with a view towards according \n     the states the appropriate deference prior to initiation of \n     an enforcement action.\n       Additions to the National Priorities List--NCSL supports \n     the listing of a facility only after the Administrator \n     obtains concurrence from the Governor of the respective \n     state.\n       We appreciate the efforts of the chief sponsors of S. 350 \n     and the subcommittee to bring forward a bill to further \n     advance brownfields cleanup and redevelopment. We look \n     forward to working with you on this issue.

The mayors believe \n     that this legislation can dramatically improve the nation's \n     efforts to recycle abandoned and other underutilized \n     brownfield sites, providing new incentives and statutory \n     reforms to speed the assessment, cleanup and redevelopment of \n     these properties.\n       This is a national problem that deserves a strong and \n     prompt federal response. The mayors believe that this \n     bipartisan legislation will help accelerate ongoing private \n     sector and public efforts to recycle America's land.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this priority \n     legislation for the nation's cities. We strongly support this \n     legislation and we encourage you to move forward \n     expeditiously so that the nation can secure the many positive \n     benefits to be achieved from the reuse and redevelopment of \n     the many thousands of brownfields throughout the U.S.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               H. Brent Coles,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Mayor of Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Ranking Member, Environmental and Public Works Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Lincoln Chafee,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk \n         Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and \n         Risk Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith, Chairman Chafee, Senator Reid, and \n     Senator Boxer: We are writing to thank you for the \n     outstanding leadership you have demonstrated by your re-\n     introduction of the Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. Our organizations, and \n     our many community partners across America, are heartened by \n     the benefits that this legislation would impart upon our \n     landscapes, economies, public parks and our communities as a \n     whole. Transforming abandoned brownfield sites into \n     greenfields or new development will provide momentum for \n     increasing ``smart growth'' and reducing sprawl by utilizing \n     existing transportation infrastructure, which in turn will \n     lead to better transportation systems and the revitalization \n     of historic areas and our urban centers.\n       As you are well aware, brownfields pose some of the most \n     critical land-use challenges--and afford some of the most \n     promising revitalization opportunities--facing our nation's \n     communities, from our cities to more rural locales. \n     Revitalization of these idled sites into urgently needed \n     parks and green spaces or into appropriate redevelopment will \n     provide great benefits to our neighborhoods and local \n     economies. In the process, it has also proven to be an \n     extremely powerful tool in local effort to control urban \n     spawl by directing economic growth to already developed \n     areas, encouraging the restoration and reuse of historical \n     sites, and in addressing longstanding issues of environmental \n     justice in underserved areas.\n       We acknowledge the commitment that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and other federal agencies have \n     demonstrated to brownfields restoration through existing \n     programs. At the same time, given that there are an estimated \n     450,000--600,000 brownfield properties nationwide, we \n     recognize that these limited resources have been stretched \n     too far to allow for an optimal federal role. Additional \n     investment, at higher levels and in new directions, is \n     essential to meeting the enormous backlog of need and to \n     establish the truest federal partnership with the many state, \n     local, and private entities working to renew brownfield \n     sites.\n       The Brownfield Revitalization and Environmental Restoration \n     Act of 2001 would provide this much needed federal response. \n     Through our work with local governments, our organizations \n     have witnessed first-hand--and have often worked as a partner \n     to help create--the benefits that this bill would provide. We \n     are particularly gratified by the emphasis your legislation \n     places on brownfields-to-parks conversion, and the \n     flexibility it provides to tailor funding based on a \n     community's particular needs. In all, this bill provides the \n     framework and funding that an effective national approach to \n     brownfields will require.\n       Accordingly, we appreciate your vision in developing this \n     legislation, and we look forward to working with your towards \n     its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Trust for Public Land.\n     Scenic America.\n     American Planning Association.\n     The Enterprise Foundation.\n     National Association of Regional Councils.\n     Smart Growth America.\n     Surface Transportation Policy Project.\n     National Recreation and Park Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association, we write to express our support for the \n     liability reforms contained in S. 350, the ``Brownfield \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001,'' \n     and we urge you and your committee to support these \n     provisions during the markup of the measure scheduled for \n     March 8, 2001. By enacting these reforms, Congress can help \n     to expedite the cleanup and redevelopment of more than \n     450,000 contaminated brownfield sites throughout the country \n     while at the same time breathing new life into the inner \n     cities in which these sites are concentrated.\n       As the largest association of attorneys in the United \n     States with over 400,000 members nationwide, the American Bar \n     Association has a strong interest in working with Congress in \n     order to ensure that federal environmental law, including the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act (``CERCLA'' or ``Superfund''), encourages and \n     does not impede the cleanup of brownfields. In an effort to \n     play a meaningful role in this area, the ABA House of \n     Delegates adopted a resolution in 1999 outlining detailed \n     suggestions for encouraging the redevelopment of brownfields, \n     and this resolution and the accompanying background report \n     are enclosed.\n       In recent years, brownfields increasingly have reduced the \n     quality of urban life in America. These contaminated \n     properties often lie unused or underutilized for long periods \n     of time largely due to the perceived legal liabilities that \n     confront potential new owners and developers of these \n     properties. While these sites remain idle, employment levels \n     suffer, particularly among disadvantaged communities within \n     the inner city. Often this accelerates urban flight, \n     increases sprawl, and creates the need to carve out yet more \n     space for suburban development, with the related \n     infrastructure needs that such development requires. By \n     encouraging the redevelopment of brownfields, we can \n     revitalize our urban core, preserve open space, conserve \n     resources, and make far better use of public dollars.\n       By now, almost all of the states have adopted their own \n     state brownfields programs, including statutes and \n     regulations designed to encourage the voluntary remediation \n     of brownfields. These programs generally set clear cleanup \n     standards that are designed to protect human health and the \n     environment while also taking future site use into \n     consideration. In order to encourage developers to \n     participate in these voluntary cleanup programs, most states \n     also grant liability relief to those who successfully clean \n     up the sites to the states' standards.\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n       These programs have been recognized as being among the most \n     successful state environmental programs of the last decade. \n     Through these programs, sites across the country are being \n     cleaned up and redeveloped, creating new jobs and economic \n     opportunities, limiting the development of so called \n     ``greenfields,'' and restoring state and local tax bases. \n     While these programs have met with considerable success, the \n     continuing threat of Superfund liability discourages many \n     developers from buying and then voluntarily cleaning up \n     contaminated property. As a result, many brownfield sites \n     remain idle for extended periods of time, despite the state \n     cleanup programs.\n       The ABA supports a number of key provisions contained in S. \n     350, including those provisions that encourage developers to \n     participate in state brownfields cleanup programs. The ABA \n     believes that in order to promote the continued economic use \n     of contaminated properties and reduce unnecessary litigation, \n     Congress should eliminate all Superfund liability for parties \n     who successfully clean up properties pursuant to a state \n     brownfields program, so long as the state programs (1) impose \n     cleanup standards that are protective of human health and the \n     environment; (2) ensure appropriate public notice and public \n     participation; and (3) provide the financial and personnel \n     resources necessary to carry out their programs.\n       S. 350 goes a long way towards achieving these aims by \n     preventing the President and the EPA from pursuing \n     enforcement actions against those involved in state \n     brownfields cleanup programs except in certain specific \n     circumstances, such as when a state requests federal \n     assistance, the contamination migrates across state lines or \n     onto federal property, or there is an imminent and \n     substantial endangerment to public health, welfare or the \n     environment so that additional response actions are likely to \n     be necessary. By preventing the EPA from intervening in state \n     cleanups except in these limited situations, S. 350 will \n     encourage developers and other parties to participate in \n     state cleanup programs and bring brownfields back into \n     productive use by granting greater ``finality'' to these \n     programs.\n       The ABA also supports those provisions in S. 350 that would \n     grant Superfund liability exemptions to certain types of \n     innocent parties, including bona fide prospective purchasers \n     who do not cause or worsen the contamination at a brownfields \n     site and innocent owners of real estate that is continguous \n     to the property where the hazardous waste was released. The \n     ABA favors comprehensive reform of Superfund, including the \n     elimination of joint and several liability in favor of a \n     ``fair share'' allocation system in which liability is \n     allocated based upon each party's relative contribution to \n     the harm. Until Congress enacts comprehensive reform \n     legislation, however, the ABA believes that truly innocent \n     parties, including those covered by S. 350, should be \n     released from potential Superfund liability. These reforms \n     are consistent with the principle that ``polluters should \n     pay,'' but only for the harm that they cause and not for the \n     harm caused by others. Innocent parties who have neither \n     caused nor worsened environmental hazards should not be \n     subject to liability under Superfund, and S. 350 furthers \n     this important principle.\n       The ABA has been a consistent advocate of legislation that \n     would expedite the cleanup of brownfields and Superfund \n     sites, reduce litigation, and promote fairness to all \n     parties, and the liability reforms contained in S. 350 make \n     significant strides towards achieving these goals. For these \n     reasons, we urge you to support these reforms during the full \n     committee markup scheduled for March 8.\n       Thank you for considering the views of the ABA on these \n     important matters. If you would like more information \n     regarding the ABA's positions on these issues, please contact \n     our legislative counsel for environmental law matters, Larson \n     Frisby, at 202/662-1098.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert D. Evans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Institute of Architects,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, March 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the 67,000 members of the \n     American Institute of Architects (AIA). I am writing to \n     commend you on the introduction of the Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Amendments Act \n     of 2001. This measure, S. 350, demonstrates your commitment \n     and leadership in keeping the brownfields redevelopment issue \n     at the forefront of the national agenda. The AIA endorses \n     this important measure since it offers practical solutions to \n     the key issues, including liability reform and financing \n     options. It is important for Congress to pass meaningful \n     brownfields redevelopment legislation this year. Superfund \n     reform issues should not be allowed to delay passage of S. \n     350.\n       As you know, there are brownfields problems in nearly every \n     community in the United States. If enacted, your bill would \n     offer thousands of communities the flexibility to access \n     grants or loan capitalization funds. Thus, S. 350 recognizes \n     that one size does not fit all and offers user-friendly \n     solutions that communities desperately need. Passage of S. \n     350 will stimulate and rejuvenate the economic development \n     components of cities. Thus, it would better integrate some \n     state and local environmental and economic development \n     programs.\n       Liability reform is clearly at the heart of a successful \n     brownfields proposal. Your measure provides protection for \n     innocent landowners and for those whose property may have \n     been contaminated through no fault of their own. Architects \n     and other members of the private sector are keenly aware that \n     these provisions are needed if progress is to occur at the \n     estimated 500,000 brownfields sites nationwide.\n       For your review and for inclusion in the Committee record, \n     I have enclosed a copy of a chapter entitled ``The New Market \n     Frontier: Unlocking Community Capitalism Through Brownfields \n     Redevelopment'' from the American Bar Association's book, \n     Brownfields: A Comprehensive Guide to Redeveloping \n     Contaminated Property, which shows architects in three case \n     studies providing practical solutions to brownfields \n     problems. In addition, I have enclosed a copy of a recent AIA \n     publication ``Communities by Design,'' which demonstrates the \n     value of good design.\n       Finally, the AIA welcomes the opportunity of working with \n     you and your staff so that S. 350 advances and is signed into \n     law during the 107th Congress. If you need further assistance \n     contact Dan Wilson, senior director, Federal Affairs at (202) \n     626-7384.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Gordon H. Chong,\n\n                                      Chairman, Government Affairs\n     Advisory Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          American Society of Civil Engineers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The American Society of Civil Engineers \n     (ASCE), which represents 126,000 civil engineers in private \n     practice, academia and government service, respectfully \n     requests your support for passage of S. 350, the Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001.\n       We urge you to contact the Senate leadership to request \n     that the bill be brought to the floor as soon as possible.\n       ASCE advocates legislation that would eliminate statutory \n     and regulatory barriers to the redevelopment of \n     ``brownfields,'' lands that effectively have been removed \n     from productive capacity due to serious contamination. These \n     sites, properly restored, aid in the revival of blighted \n     areas, promote sustainable development, and invest in the \n     nation's industrial strength.\n       As you are aware, the current brownfields program was \n     established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in \n     1993 under the Superfund program. That program, which has \n     expanded to include more than 300 brownfields assessment \n     grants (most for $200,000 over 2 years) totaling more than \n     $57 million, now needs to be placed on a sound statutory \n     footing in order to ensure future success.\n       ASCE considers the program vital because we support limits \n     on urban sprawl to achieve a balance between economic \n     development, rights of individual property owners, public \n     interests, social needs and the environment. Community growth \n     planning based on the principles of sustainable development \n     should give consideration to the public needs, to private \n     initiatives and to local, state and regional planning \n     objectives.\n       Moreover, revitalized brownfields would reduce the demand \n     for the undeveloped land. Full provision of public \n     infrastructure and facilities redevelopment must be included \n     in all growth initiatives and should be made at the lowest \n     appropriate level of government.\n       We believe that a targeted brownfields restoration program \n     should take into account site-specific environmental exposure \n     factors and risk based on a reasonable assessment of the \n     future use of the property.\n       To ensure a uniform and protective cleanup effort \n     nationally, we would hope that S. 350 also would require \n     minimum criteria for adequate state brownfields programs. \n     ASCE believes the states should be required to demonstrate \n     that their programs satisfy minimum restoration criteria \n     before a bar to federal enforcement would apply.\n       We support systems to ensure appropriate public \n     participation in state cleanups or provide assurance through \n     state review or approval that site cleanups are adequate.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert W.

We \n     appreciate your outstanding efforts to promote\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n     local environmental quality, as typified by your energetic \n     advocacy of this brownfields legislation.\n       TPL was honored to be part of the coalition that helped to \n     push this legislation to the brink of enactment at the end of \n     the 106th Congress, and we again look forward to working with \n     you to make this legislation a reality within the near \n     future. We are particularly grateful that you have re-\n     introduced identical legislation this time around.\n       Given our experience in community open-space issues, we are \n     heartened by the emphasis the legislation places on \n     brownfields-to-parks conversion where appropriate, and its \n     flexibility to tailor loan and grant funding based on \n     community needs and eventual uses. In all, this legislation \n     provides the framework and funding that an effective national \n     approach to brownfields requires, and offers the promise of a \n     much-needed federal partnership role in brownfields \n     reclamation.\n       Brownfields afford some of the most promising \n     revitalization opportunities from our cities to more rural \n     locales. This legislation will serve to help meet the \n     pronounced needs in underserved communities to reclaim \n     abandoned sites and create open spaces where they are most \n     needed. By transforming these idled sites into urgently \n     needed parks and green spaces, or by focusing investment into \n     their appropriate redevelopment, reclamation of brownfield \n     properties brings new life to local economies and to the \n     spirit of neighborhoods.\n       The Trust for Public Land gratefully recognizes the vision \n     and careful craftsmanship you have shown in your work to \n     advance this vital legislation, and we look forward to \n     working with you toward its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Alan Front,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Building Owners and Managers\n\n\n                                    Association International,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of commercial real estate \n     professionals nationwide, I am writing to ask for your \n     support, before the full Senate, of S. 350--the Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. The \n     Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) International \n     and its 18,000 members believe that this bill provides \n     Congress its best opportunity to improve our nation's \n     remediation efforts in 2001.\n       Thanks to the efforts of a dedicated collection of \n     senators, the Senate now has a bipartisan piece of \n     legislation that would generate improved liability \n     protections, enhanced state involvement and increased federal \n     cleanup funding. Adoption of S. 350 would have an immediate \n     and dramatic impact on reducing the 400,000 brownfields sites \n     across America.\n       As the Environment and Public Works Committee has forwarded \n     this legislation out of committee, we look for your support \n     in securing its approval by the full Senate. We ask for your \n     assistance in bringing this bill to the floor and achieving \n     its passage early in 2001. If you have any questions or \n     concerns, please contact Rick Sheridan at (202) 326-6338.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard D. Baier,\n     President, BOMA International.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Realtors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the more than 760,000 \n     members of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS, I wish to \n     convey our strong support for the ``Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act.'' NAR \n     commends you for your efforts in crafting a practical and \n     effective bill which has garnered bipartisan support from the \n     leadership of the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee.\n       NAR supports this bill because it:\n       Provides liability relief for innocent property owners who \n     have not caused or contributed to hazardous waste \n     contamination;\n       Increases funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of the \n     hundreds of thousands of our nation's contaminated \n     ``brownfields'' sites;\n       Recognizes the finality of successful state hazardous waste \n     cleanup efforts.\n       Brownfields sites offer excellent opportunities for the \n     economic, environmental and social enrichment of our \n     communities. Unfortunately, liability concerns and a lack of \n     adequate resources often deter redevelopment of such sites. \n     As a result, properties that could be enhancing community \n     growth are left dilapidated, contributing to nothing but \n     economic ruin. Once revitalized, however, brownfields sites \n     benefit their surrounding communities by increasing the tax \n     base, creating jobs and providing new housing.\n       The new Administration has clearly indicated its support \n     for brownfields revitalization efforts. The ``Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act'' is a \n     positive, broadly-supported policy initiative. NAR looks \n     forward to working together with you to enact brownfields \n     legislation in the 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard Mendenhall,\n     2001 President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Institute of Scrap\n\n\n                                   Recycling Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Works, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Superfund Waste Control and Risk \n         Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and \n         Risk assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith, Reid, Chafee and Boxer: The Institute \n     of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), strongly supports \n     the passage of the Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. Passage of this \n     bipartisan bill will reduce the many legal and regulatory \n     barriers that stand in the way of brownfields redevelopment.\n       This important brownfields legislation will provide \n     liability relief for innocent property owners who purchase a \n     property without knowing that it is contaminated, but who \n     carry out a good faith effort to investigate the site. It \n     also recognizes the finality of successful state approved \n     voluntary cleanup efforts and provides funds to cleanup and \n     redevelop brownfields sites.\n       ISRI stands ready to help build support for passage of this \n     bipartisan borwnfields bill. In the previous Congress, ISRI's \n     membership worked to build grassroots support and sought \n     cosponsors for S. 2700 of the 106th Congress, the predecessor \n     bill to the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001.\n       ISRI looks forward to continuing to work with you to see \n     that the brownfields bill you have sponsored becomes law. We \n     believe that the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 is a model for sensible bipartisan \n     environmental policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robin K. Wiener,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Before I close, I take a moment, as we \nusually do, to recognize some of the staff who have worked tirelessly \non this legislation. It has not been easy. Sometimes we go home for the \nweekend or go back to our States and staffs are here working through \nthese issues.\n  I commend my own Department of Environmental Services, Phil O'Brien \nand Mike Wimsatt, for their tireless work and input into this process; \nfrom Senator Chafee's office--I am sure he will want to thank his own \nstaff--Ted Michaels; from Senator Reid's staff, Lisa Haage, Barbara \nRogers, and Eric Washburn--we appreciate all your help; Sara Barth from \nSenator Boxer's office; Louis Renjel from Senator Inhofe's office; \nCatherine Walters of Senator Voinovich's staff; and Gabrielle Tenzer \nfrom Senator Clinton's staff; and from the EPA, Randy Deitz and Sven \nKaiser. Last but not least, my good committee staff: David Conover, \nChelsea Maxwell, Marty Hall, and Jim Qualters. I thank them for a lot \nof effort, a lot of hard work in working together.\n  Of course, there are many more who deserve thanks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Phil Gramm of Texas be \nadded as a cosponsor of the bill, which will get us up to 69.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join with my friend from New Hampshire in \nexpressing appreciation to the people who have worked to get this bill \nto the point it is. He has certainly been gracious in extending \nappreciation to my staff. Lisa Haage, Barbara Rogers, and Eric Washburn \nhave done excellent work. I also thank, as he has, the hard-working \nstaff of the committee: David Conover, Chelsea Maxwell, Marty Hall, and \nTed Michaels of Senator Chafee's office, who has done such an \noutstanding job working with Sandra Barth of Senator Boxer's office. \nWithout this good staff, we would not be at the point we are.\n  I also want to take a minute to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I worked with the Senator from New \nHampshire on the very volatile, difficult Select Committee On MIA/POWs. \nFor one intense year we worked on that. That is where I first got to \nknow the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nNew Hampshire. I recognize how strongly he feels about issues.\n  Then I had the good fortune of being able to work with him on the \nEthics Committee. He was the lead Republican, I was the lead Democrat \non the committee for I don't know how long--it was a long time--until \nhe got his chairmanship of this committee.\n  I have found him to be a person who understands the institution and \nunderstands the importance of people being moral and living up to the \nethical standards that are important for this institution. I may not \nalways agree with him on issues, but I agree with him as a person. He \nis one of the finest people with whom I have ever dealt. So I have the \nutmost respect for him, how he has handled this committee.\n  For 17 days I was chairman of this committee. The treatment I \nreceived while chairman, and while ranking member, has been \noutstanding. Senator Bob Smith is a good person and somebody of whom \nthe citizens of the State of New Hampshire should be proud.\n\n  I have spoken on this bill for 3 days now, expressing my desire to \nhave it considered. It is here now. I already said I appreciate Senator \nLott bringing it before the Senate.\n  I have been talking about Senator Smith. I also want to talk about \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee who has been responsible for \nbringing us to this point, and that is Senator Barbara Boxer. Senator \nBoxer and I came to the House together in 1982. We have worked together \nfor all these years. I have tremendous admiration for Barbara Boxer. \nShe is someone who believes strongly in the issues. I have to say, she \nhas done great work for this country on exposing military fraud and \nmilitary incompetence. But the best work she has done, in my opinion, \nhas been in dealing with the environment. So as a member of this \ncommittee that I have worked on since I have been in the Senate, she \nhas been an outstanding member. She has run the subcommittee very well.\n  An outstanding example is how she has been able to reach out to \nLincoln Chafee, who is a very able member of this committee. I had the \ngood fortune of serving in my time in the Senate with his father. I can \nsay John Chafee would be very proud of Lincoln for the work he has done \non this committee. This was John Chafee's committee. He was the \nchairman, he was the ranking member of it. I cannot say more than that \nJohn Chafee would be very proud of his son for the work he has done on \nthis committee.\n  As Senator Smith has indicated, this is an important piece of \nlegislation. It has now 69 cosponsors. It was reported out of committee \nby a 15-3 vote. The staff has worked very hard to make sure the \nproblems people had with the legislation were resolved prior to it \ncoming to the floor--and most of those have been. That is the reason we \nare working now on a specific time agreement. We are going to vote on \nthis matter around 2 o'clock this afternoon.\n  Members of the Environment and Public Works staff have worked hard. \nMembers of this committee worked hard to get the legislation to this \npoint. I have been extremely impressed with the new members of this \ncommittee. Senator Corzine and Senator Clinton have worked extremely \nhard, as has Senator Carper, to get us where we are. They are going to \ncome later today, as the unanimous consent agreement indicates, and \nspeak on their own behalf.\n  As I have said for 3 days, there are 500,000 sites from Kentucky to \nNevada, waiting to be cleaned up. About 600,000 people will be put to \nwork on these projects.\n  This will create local revenues of almost $2.5 billion.\n  This is an important bill. It provides critically needed money to \nassess the cleanup of abandoned and underutilized brownfield sites. It \nwill create jobs. It will increase tax revenues and create parks and \nopen space. It will encourage cleanup and provide legal protection for \nparties. It provides funding for enhancement of cleanup programs.\n  The managers' amendment before us today does several additional \nthings that were not in the reported bill. It further clarifies the \ncoordination between the States and the EPA. This was an issue raised \nby Senator Voinovich. I told him before the full committee that we \nwould work to resolve his problems. We did that.\n  The managers' amendment provides clarification for cities and others \nin purchasing insurance for brownfield sites. That is also an important \naddition to this legislation.\n  It also provides for an additional $50 million per year for abandoned \nsites which are contaminated by petroleum. There was some concern that \nthis may not have been covered in the original legislation. That has \nbeen resolved.\n  Corner gas stations: A lot of times we find people simply stay away \nfrom them. These corner gas stations are located at very essential \nsites in downtown areas. We are trying to revitalize them. This \naddition in the managers' amendment will do a great deal to resolve \nthat issue.\n  I am pleased we were able to work out the provisions so these \nnumerous sites can also be addressed.\n  There was a provision requested by Senators Inhofe and Crapo. They \nfelt very strongly about this. I am pleased we were able to agree on \nthat. It will be an important and critical part of this legislation.\n  This amendment also provides a provision for areas with a high \nincidence of cancer and disease. It will give special consideration in \nmaking grant decisions regarding children. This was pushed very \nstrongly by Senator Clinton. I am grateful for her input. These \nprovisions grew out of the amendment discussed in the markup of the \noriginal bill sponsored by Senator Clinton.\n  I also want to add Senators Corzine and Boxer. But it is supported by \na broad bipartisan group of Members.\n  This amendment also increases citizen participation by adding \ncitizens' rights in requesting sites to be considered under State \nprograms. This is intended to ensure the beginning of the process so \nthat States can benefit from input from citizens who may be aware of \nadditional sites needing attention and who can help identify additional \nreuse and redevelopment opportunities.\n  All of these changes have been carefully considered for providing \nadditional improvements to the bill. Moreover, they collectively \nrepresent the same delicate balance as the underlying bill. It also \ncomplements the needs of real estate communities, environmental areas, \nmayors, and other local government officials, land and conservation \ngroups, and the communities that are most directly affected by these \nsites.\n  This bill is balanced. It is unique. It is bipartisan. It sets an \nexample for the Senate in the months to come.\n  This brownfields legislation is not just an urban problem. It also is \nvery important to rural communities throughout America. For example, \nbrownfields money was granted to Mineral County to do a cleanup. It is \na very rural site. It was damaged by the largest ammunition dump during \nthe war. It is run now as an ammunition dump by the Army. But there \nare lots of problems there. We have a 240-acre brownfield site set for \ncleanup. After it is finished, we are confident that a golf course can \nbe created for this very rural community which will add recreational \nactivities.\n\n  An existing loan program in Las Vegas has already been used to fund \nthe cleanup of an old armory site, which will create jobs. It will now \nbe a home to a senior center, a small business incubator, a cultural \ncenter, and retail stores.\n  I want to see many more examples of reclaiming these abandoned, \ncontaminated lands in Nevada and across the country. This bill provides \nfunds to accomplish it.\n  The Presiding Officer is a valuable member of the committee.\n  I have already spoken on a number of occasions about Senator \nVoinovich's contribution to this legislation. It has been significant.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for Senator Torricelli. I yield to \nmy friend from Rhode Island who has done such a magnificent job working \non this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 350, \nthe Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of \n2001. This bill has won the support of the Bush administration, dozens \nof organizations, and 68 co-sponsors in the Senate. Today, the Senate \nhas the opportunity to pass this bipartisan, pro-environment and pro-\neconomic development bill.\n  Brownfields are the legacy of our nation's industrial heritage. A \nchanging\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nindustrialized economy, the migration of land use from urban to \nsuburban and rural areas, and our nation's strict liability \ncontamination laws have all contributed to the presence of abandoned \nindustrial sites. With more than 450,000 brownfield sites nationwide, \nwe must begin to reclaim those lands, clean up our communities, and \ndiscontinue the practice of placing new industrial facilities on open, \ngreen spaces.\n  As a former mayor, I understand the environmental, economic, and \nsocial benefits that can be realized in our communities from \nrevitalizing brownfields. While the environmental and social benefits \ncan seem obvious, only a mayor understands the continuing fiscal \nexpense to our nation's municipalities of the hundreds of thousands of \npieces of prime real estate that have dropped from the tax rolls.\n  Enactment of this legislation will provide a building block for the \nrevitalization of our communities. Communities whose fortunes sank \nalong with the decline of mills and factories will once again attract \nnew residents and well-paying jobs. We will bring vibrant industry back \nto the brownfield sites that currently host crime, mischief and \ncontamination. There will be parks at sites that now contain more \nrubble than grass. City tax rolls will burgeon; neighborhoods can be \ninvigorated; new homes can be built, and community character will be \nrestored.\n  S. 350 enjoys broad bipartisan support. Not only is it supported by \nthe Bush administration, the bill's predecessor was supported by the \nClinton administration last session. The bill is strongly supported by \nthe nation's mayors, state elected officials, the real estate industry, \nopen space advocates, business groups, and environmental organizations. \nRarely do we see these organizations come together on the same side of \nan issue. This high level of support is testimony to the bipartisan \nnature of the legislation. It demonstrates that we can forge sound \nlegislation, and balance the needs of the environment and the economy \nif we come to the table with open minds and good intentions.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for his leadership on this issue, Senator \nSmith. His tireless efforts over that time have certainly paved the way \nfor this legislation. I also would like to extend my appreciation to \nSenator Reid of Nevada and Senator Boxer for their commitment to this \nissue and the bipartisan process which has proven so successful. In \naddition, let me thank the staff that has worked so hard on this bill: \nDavid Conover, Chelsea Maxwell, and Marty Hall of Senator Smith's \nstaff, Lisa Haage of Senator Reid's staff, Sara Barth of Senator \nBoxer's staff, and Ted Michaels of my staff.\n  The issue of brownfields has been discussed for nearly a decade. \nWhile I was mayor of Warwick, my fax machine constantly fed me alerts \nfrom the U.S. Conference of Mayors seeking my support for brownfields \nreform. With this legislation today, we have the opportunity to protect \nthe environment, strengthen local economies, and revitalize our \ncommunities. I urge each of my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 350 \nand give each mayor across the country the benefit of the full \npotential of their real estate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the \nSenator from Rhode Island for a moment, I thank the Senator so much for \nhis leadership on this issue. It has meant so much to us to have it and \nthat of Senator Smith. Senator Reid and I are most grateful. I think we \nhave a team that is very good for the environment. When we are \ntogether, it is a real winner because we can reach out to colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle from the entire spectrum. So I just want to say \nthank you.\n  I say to the Senator, as much as I miss your father, whom I adored, I \nmust say that it is wonderful to have you here and following in his \n``green'' footsteps.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am here to say that this bill, S. 350, \nthe Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act, is a \ntremendously important issue for this country and for my constituents.\n  I truly believe if we look around the country, it is an extremely \nimportant issue to everyone. Why? Because we have so many acres of land \naround the country that have been contaminated with low-level hazardous \nwaste. They do not fit the definition of a Superfund site, but they are \nexpensive to clean up, and local communities really do need our help.\n  I want to show you an example of a successful brownfields \nrestoration. This photograph is of a site in Emeryville, CA, that \nhosted a steel manufacturing plant for over 100 years. In the early \n1990s, it was shut down, the buildings were demolished, and the area \nwas left empty and desolate. You can see from the photograph what a \nhorrible eyesore it was to the community. And, by the way, this site is \nalong a major freeway, so everyone saw it. It gave the impression of a \ncommunity that was simply going downhill.\n  The next picture I will show you is what happened when the State got \ntogether with the IKEA company and worked together to clean up the \nsite.\n  In 1997, the State came to this agreement with the original owners of \nthe site and with IKEA to restore and redevelop the area. Now the site \nholds 280,000 square feet of commercial retail space. The project has \ncreated 300 new, permanent jobs for the community. Now the site \ngenerates roughly $70 million in annual sales.\n  There are not too many things in this Chamber that we can do that has \nsuch clear-cut benefit. Clean up the environment and you make an area \nmuch nicer to look at. And then you can develop it and bring jobs to \nthe site.\n  So if anyone questions the need for this brownfields legislation, I \nwould welcome them to, again, look at these before-and-after pictures. \nHere it is after; here it is before. It is a pretty clear picture.\n  I am so proud of the bipartisan cooperation that occurred in getting \nthe bill through the Environment and Public Works Committee. The broad \nsupport, from a variety of diverse interests, as well as the \ncosponsorship of over 60 Senators, is a good indication that the time \nhas come to pass this brownfields legislation.\n  I understand that even our colleagues who have problems with the bill \nare now supporting it. I think this is a tribute to them for being open \nminded about it, and a tribute to our chairman, Chairman Smith, and our \nranking member, Harry Reid, for working with our colleagues.\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about the brownfields in my home State of \nCalifornia, the largest State in the Union, with 34 million people. The \neconomy of my State would be considered the sixth largest economy in \nthe world. So it seems to me that whenever there are problems in the \ncountry, of course, we have more of those problems in my State. And \nwhen good things are happening, we have more of the good things.\n  This is one of the problems. So let's talk about it. There are \nestimated to be hundreds, if not thousands, of brownfield sites in \nCalifornia. We have heard nationwide estimates of 400,000 to 600,000 \nbrownfield sites. We have thousands of sites in California because some \nindustries have left the State with a dangerous legacy of \ncontamination.\n  This bill will serve as a catalyst for cleanup because it provides \nfunding for grants and revolving loan funds to assist our States, our \nlocal communities, and our tribal governments to do the assessments \nfirst. In other words, what is the problem? What is going on? What is \nit going to cost to clean it up? And how is the best way to clean it \nup?\n  This bill fills a gap. As I said before, Superfund covers our \nNation's most hazardous sites. We really did not have a way to approach \nthe less hazardous sites.\n  I want to talk about how happy I am that this bill includes my \nproposal to protect children. Under S. 350, funding will be prioritized \nfor brownfields that disproportionately impact the health of children, \npregnant women, or other vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. \nThis is very important.\n  Why do I say that? Because children are not small adults. I have said \nthis often. I am a small adult. But children are not small adults. They \nare more sensitive than adults to the health\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nthreats posed by hazardous waste, even the kinds we call low level. \nWhy? Because their bodies are changing, and they are developing. \nHealthy adults can tolerate higher levels of pollutants than children.\n  In recognition of this, the bill ensures that children, and others \nwho are particularly vulnerable, will be given special priority for \nfunding under this bill. So we are going to look at these sites. If it \nis a site where children play, where children go, where the elderly go, \nwhere people who are vulnerable go, those sites will be priority sites.\n  The bill also gives priority to cleanups in low-income and minority \ncommunities because, unfortunately, we have seen a lot of the \nenvironmental injustice in this country where brownfield sites are \ndisproportionately located in low-income and minority communities, \ncertainly in places such as Oakland, Los Angeles, and Sacramento.\n  So we have a situation where the brownfields are most prevalent in \ncommunities that are least able to deal with them. And the more \nbrownfield sites that are in a community, the lower the chance that the \ncommunity can improve its economic plight. It is a horrible cycle of \npoverty.\n  Let's take this site shown in the photograph. This site was in a very \nlow-income community, and no one had the resources. And a company such \nas IKEA, who eventually came to this site, did not want to go to this \nsite because there was no one to go to the store. You would have a \nsituation where the site could sit vacant for years and years and \nyears. It contributes to the cycle. You can never get out of the cycle.\n  So by saying this kind of a situation in a low-income community would \nbe a priority, we will give an economic stimulus to those communities. \nI am very pleased about that.\n  The last issue that I believe very strongly about is the issue of \nsites that were contaminated because there was illegal manufacturing of \na controlled substance there. This may sound very odd. So let me \nexplain what I mean.\n  In California, we have a terrible problem from the production of \nmethamphetamine. It turns out that this terribly dangerous drug is not \nonly illegal, not only does it destroy people--destroy people--but the \nbyproduct of methamphetamine production is a toxic stew of lye, \nhydriodic acid, and red phosphorus. These elements threaten the \ngroundwater and agricultural lands of the Central Valley and elsewhere \nin California where these secret methamphetamine labs are sited.\n  I show you a picture of one abandoned lab where you can see these \ncontainers with all the chemicals that were left on the site.\n  This is another picture of an abandoned meth site. We can see what it \nlooks like, what a disaster it is when these criminals leave and then \nsuddenly the owners of the land who had no idea this was happening are \nleft with this horrible contamination. We were able to include relief \nfor these farmers. I will talk about that in a minute.\n  I will take a moment to talk more about these methamphetamine labs. \nIn California alone, there were 277 secret drug labs that were raided \nin 1990. In 1998, there were over 1,000 of these clandestine drug labs. \nThe State is doing its best to address the problem as well as the \nlarger brownfields problem. They are trying to do it, but it is very \nhard to do it alone. We have to have everyone helping. This bill will \nprovide invaluable assistance for the cleanup of meth sites and other \nbrownfields, which is another reason I am such a strong supporter of \nthe legislation.\n  This bill includes liability relief for innocent parties. These \ninnocent parties are people who are interested in cleaning up the \nbrownfield site, but they are afraid to get involved because they may \nbecome liable for somebody else's mess. Our bill makes it clear that \ninnocent parties will not be held liable under Superfund for the work \nthey do on a brownfield site. This provision alone should help reduce \nthe fear of developers and real estate interests, and it should lead to \nmore cleanups. This provision is certainly a strong reason that a \nvariety of business and real estate interests are strong supporters of \nthe bill. They want to come in; they want to clean up the sites; but \nthey don't want to now become held liable for past problems and then be \nhauled into court on a Superfund case.\n  However, I do believe very strongly that the polluter must pay. Our \nbill does not protect people who are responsible for cleanup under \nSuperfund or any other statute. If you make a mess, if you despoil the \nenvironment, you still will be held responsible for cleaning it up. We \nmaintain ``the polluter pays'' principle that underpins many of our \nhazardous waste statutes.\n  The committee considered and rejected efforts to waive the \napplication of other statutes, such as RCRA and TSCA, to these \nbrownfield sites. It was too complicated to try to amend other \nstatutes, and I appreciate the fact that our foursome stuck together \nduring these amendments because it would have opened up a can of worms. \nWhat we did was we kept this narrow. We kept it on the issue of \nbrownfields. We kept out extraneous issues. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation on that.\n  Our bill encourages States to take the lead on brownfield sites. It \ndoes set some limitations on EPA's enforcement authority under \nSuperfund for sites covered by this bill. We believe this is important \nin gaining strong support. I am comfortable with this feature because \nthere are a number of safeguards that ensure that a secure Federal \nsafety net remains. These safeguards are an essential part of the \ncompromise that is the heart of the bill. They ensure that EPA can \napply its full Superfund enforcement authority under a variety of \ncircumstances.\n  Most important to me--and it was a tough debate that we had--was the \nguarantee that EPA could intervene if a site threatens to cause \nimmediate and substantial endangerment to the public's health or \nwelfare or to the environment. I believe this language guarantees that \nif a State's oversight of a cleanup fails to protect our citizens or \nour environment, the Federal Government can intervene. We are clear \nthat we want the State to be responsible, but if there is a problem \nwhich will result in an immediate threat to people's health, the EPA \ncan enter. It was a careful balance that went into crafting that \nprovision as well as the rest of the bill.\n  Together I believe we have produced a sensible and balanced bill that \nwill help encourage the recycling of brownfield sites that now sit \nunused around the Nation.\n  In closing, one more time I will show our success story that happened \nin Emeryville. First, let's show the before picture again. This is what \nwe are talking about, sites that look like this, sites that are \nharmful. People don't want to go on them. People are afraid of them. \nThere is no economic development in the middle of our urban areas. Then \nwhen we work together, we can bring business interests to the site and \nwe start to see people use the site again. The site will bring in \nrevenues.\n  I thank my colleagues for all their hard work, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for too many years comprehensive Superfund \nreform has been blocked by partisan rhetoric and fear-mongering. Even \nthough the general public, government agencies, and federal bureaucrats \nknow that the Superfund program is broken, proposed changes were called \nstealth attacks, roll-backs, and letting polluters off the hook. Those \ncharacterizations were not accurate, but they were effective in \nprotecting one of the most troubled and inefficient programs in the \nFederal Government from meaningful reform.\n  For more than 7 years we have been unable to reach agreement on \nSuperfund reauthorization so the Environment and Public Works Committee \ndecided to take a smaller, targeted approach. So today we are here \nconsidering S. 350, the Brownfield Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act.\n  There is general agreement that we need to address the issue of \nBrownfields. Across the country, brownfields are blights on the \nlandscape, but because of liability concerns, too often clean-up and \nredevelopment opportunities are lost. The loss of clean-up and \nredevelopment opportunities means the loss of jobs and tax revenues for \ncommunities and means these sites are not cleaned up.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n  However, even though I will support this bill today, more needs to be \ndone.\n  Working with my friends and colleagues, specifically Senators Inhofe \nand Crapo, we were able to reach an agreement with the managers of the \nbill to include in the manager's amendment a provision which will \ninclude petroleum only sites in the brownfields program. It is \nestimated that petroleum only sites make up almost half the brownfield \nsites in the country. How can we pass a brownfields bill that excludes \nhalf the brownfield sites in the country? Fortunately, agreement was \nreached on this issue.\n  I want to go on record that I still have concerns regarding liability \nissues. In my opinion the legislation does not protect developers from \npotential liability and administrative orders under the Toxic Substance \nControl Act. I joined with Senators Inhofe and Crapo in offering an \namendment during the committee's consideration, but unfortunately it \nwas defeated. Opponents argued that EPA has not yet used TSCA or RCRA \nto deal with hazardous materials covered under Superfund so therefore \nit shouldn't be an issue. However, many believe that if the ``front \ndoor'' of Superfund is closed, EPA will use TSCA or RCRA as a ``back \ndoor'' to pursue legal action against a developer.\n  In addition, it is my opinion that the bill still gives too much \nauthority to the EPA over State programs. If we are going to give the \nresponsibility to the State, EPA must step back and let the States run \nthe programs and EPA must first work with the State before overstepping \nand taking enforcement actions.\n  S. 350 is a step in the right direction. However, we must continue \nour efforts to address the liability issues that still remain and we \nmust continue efforts to make the overall Superfund program more \nreasonable and workable.\n  As we all know, the great environmental progress in this country has \nbeen made with bi-partisan support, when honest concern for the \nenvironment and the people outweighed political opportunism. I hope \nthat the progress made on brownfields will translate into positive \nmovement on the remaining issues.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity today \nto speak about an important piece of environmental legislation, the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act. This bill \nenjoys the bipartisan support of 15 of the 18 members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and with the additions made in \nthe manager's amendment, I hope it will receive widespread support on \nthe floor.\n  This bill aims to return abandoned, contaminated lots that plague \nnearly every city and town in this country to their past vitality. Once \nupon a time, these 450,000 ``brownfields'' were home to our \nneighborhood gas station, a flourishing textile mill, or a \nmanufacturing plant. They were central to the economic well being of \ntheir communities. Unfortunately, now they lay idle and unproductive, \nspoiling the quality of life in thousands of communities across the \ncountry. Brownfields lower a community's tax base, encourage urban \nsprawl and loss of open space, and worst of all, threaten to pollute \nlocal streams and drinking water, endangering human health and \nenvironmental quality.\n  While everyone wishes to see brownfields reintegrated into the \ncommunity, they often remain untouched urban eyesores. Developers fear \nthe potential liability risks involved in developing a site laden with \nunknown chemicals. Communities lack the funds to initiate their own \nclean up plans.\n  This bill could change all of that. First, it provides much-needed \nfunding for brownfields' restoration programs. Second, it offers \nimportant legal protections that will give developers, private and \npublic, the confidence to cleanup these toxic sites. All across the \ncountry, we see examples of communities successfully restoring \nbrownfields sites into vibrant and prosperous enterprises, including in \nmy home state of Connecticut.\n  With the help of small federal grants and loans, more than two dozen \ncities and towns throughout Connecticut have been able to jump-start \ntheir plans for environmental remediation and economic development of \nbrownfields sites.\n  Just last month, I joined in the Grand Opening of a new Harley \nDavidson dealership on a former brownfields site in Stamford, one of \nEPAs Brownfields Showcase Communities. Prior to cleanup, the area was a \nchemical cesspool of abandoned lots contaminated with PCBs, lead, \narsenic and several other metals. During cleanup, close to 3,000 tons \nof contaminated soil were removed from the site, reducing the risk of \ngroundwater contamination and exposure to neighborhood residents. Now \nthis enterprise brings new life, a cleaner environment, and new jobs to \nthe industrial South End of Stamford.\n  The promise of this approach may seem obvious, but the language in \nthis bill was not easily agreed. It is the product of over eight years \nof negotiations, debate and finally compromise. So it is with pride \nthat I join more than two thirds of my colleagues, Democrat and \nRepublican, and dozens of organizations representing a wide range of \ninterests, including those of mayors, developers, realtors, insurance \ncompanies and environmental groups, in supporting this legislation, I \nbelieve we should all feel a sense of accomplishment and pride--this \nwas battle hard won.\n  This is a good day for America's communities, especially in the inner \ncities which regrettably are home to many of these urban wastelands. \nBut it doesn't have to stay that way. This legislation is a shot in the \neconomic arm for towns like Stamford seeking to revitalize their \nneighborhoods for future generations to enjoy. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to support S. 350, \nthe Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of \n2001. This bill will help communities throughout the country identify \nand clean up brownfields, sites where low level contamination has kept \nthe land from being developed.\n  This bill would help communities in several different ways. By \nproviding liability protection and economic incentives to clean up \ncontaminated and abandoned industrial sites, this legislation will make \nour communities healthier and reduce environmental threats. By \nreturning these sites to productive use, we encourage redevelopment and \nhelp curb sprawl. This legislation means both new jobs and a cleaner \nenvironment for Missouri. It shows that a clean environment and a \nstrong economy are not in competition, they go hand in hand.\n  In Missouri, we have 11 brownfield projects financed in part with \nfederal funds, and another 29 projects that are State-financed.\n  One example of a successful brownfield project is Martin Luther King \nBusiness Park in St. Louis, Missouri. The site, which is across the \nstreet from two schools, was contaminated from a century of metal \nplating and junkyards. Asbestos and high levels of lead were found \nclose to the surface. As a result of federally-funded assessments and \nthe State's Voluntary Cleanup and Brownfield Redevelopment Programs, a \ndeveloper stepped forward to purchase and cleanup the property. Due to \nthese cleanup efforts, a much-needed warehouse/light manufacturing \nfacility in the heart of St. Louis opened in 2000, bringing more than \n60 jobs to the area. Construction of an even larger facility is \nscheduled to begin this year after cleanup is complete. This \ndevelopment will help to rejuvenate the entire surrounding area. This \nprogress was made possible by the federal brownfield grant which \nallowed the City to perform initial environmental assessments. Without \nthose assessments, developers are reluctant to even consider such \nproperties.\n  We have made considerable progress toward making our urban centers \ninto places where people want to work and live. Yet we still have more \nthan 12,000 abandoned and tax-default properties in St. Louis alone. \nObviously our work is not done.\n  Brownfields are not just an urban problem. A century of lead mining \nhas left towns like Bonne Terre, Missouri with contamination from \nmining waste. In Bonne Terre, developers are reluctant to purchase land \nnear the mine waste properties being addressed by Superfund because of \npossible contamination. Using federal pilot funds, Bonne Terre is \nworking on cleaning up these sites and developing them into a\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n122-acre commercial zone and industrial park. The clean up and \ndevelopment will bring more jobs to this rural community as well as \naddress environmental concerns.\n  I anticipate a strong vote in favor of the Brownfields Revitalization \nand Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. I hope that this vote will \nprovide momentum for this legislation as it proceeds to the House of \nRepresentatives and that it will eventually be signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 350, the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. I \ncompliment the efforts of Senators Smith, Reid, Chafee, and Boxer. They \nhave done a great job in moving this legislation forward.\n  I was very disappointed that this bill was not enacted last year, it \nrepresents a lot of hard work and compromise. I think this bill is a \nwin-win for the environment, for local communities and for local \neconomies. More hazardous waste sites will be cleaned up, and we'll \nhave more parks and open space, more economic redevelopment, and more \njobs. This bill will make cleaning up polluted sites easier by reducing \nthe many legal and regulatory barriers to brownfields redevelopment \nwhile providing much needed cleanup funds.\n  The brownfields bill is important for rural areas, not just big \ncities. In Montana, we have hundreds of sites that have been polluted \nby mining, timber processing, railroad work, and other industrial \nactivities that were part of our economic development.\n  I worked hard on a very similar bill last year, together with many of \nmy colleagues. Last year, it was the first bipartisan brownfields bill \never introduced in the Senate. I was thrilled to cosponsor the bill \nagain this year, under the leadership of Senator Smith and Senator \nReid. This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, including \nthe National Association of Realtors, the Conference of Mayors, and the \nTrust for Public Lands. It represents a hard-won, delicately balanced \ncompromise.\n  Superfund critics have long argued that the possibility that EPA \ncould second-guess state-approved cleanups has discouraged brownfields \nremediation. At the same time, I and others have argued that we need to \npreserve the federal government's ability to use Superfund authorities \nto deal with dangerous situations at sites cleaned up under state \nprograms in the rare case in which the cleanup is inadequate and there \nis a threat to human health or the environment.\n  The tension between these two views has been one of the major \nobstacles to moving brownfields legislation in the past. This bill \nforges a new compromise on this issue, and it is a good compromise. \nBoth sides came to the table and made some important concessions. The \nbill is not perfect, it is not everything I wanted. It is not \neverything some of my colleagues across the aisle wanted, either. But, \nas I have often said, let us not let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. And this is a good bill that will do good things for the \nenvironment, for communities, for businesses and for the Nation. These \nsites need to be cleaned up, for the health and well-being of our \ncitizens and our environment, and doing nothing is no longer an option.\n  Hopefully, two other bills will come to the floor that would expand \nthe abilities of the Economic Development Administration and the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to help local communities \nphysically develop and restore brownfields sites to productive use. \nTaken together, S. 350 and these two bills would make up a complete \nbrownfields redevelopment package. They will provide critical economic \nand technical assistance to communities during all stages of \nbrownfields redevelopment--from an initial site assessment to putting \nthe finishing touches on a new apartment building or city park.\n  I am happy to hear that the administration has expressed its support \nfor S. 350. The brownfields bill is an outstanding example of a \nbipartisan effort to help communities across the nation. I hope we can \nall work together to make sure it is signed into law this year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand will pass S. 350, the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 2001. I am a strong supporter and advocate of this \nlegislation. I commend Senators Smith of New Hampshire, Reid, Chafee \nand Boxer for their tremendous effort to craft strong bi-partisan \nlegislation to help our nation's communities. Brownfields are \nabandoned, idled, or under-used commercial or industrial properties \nwhere development or expansion is hindered by real or perceived \nenvironmental contamination. Businesses located on brownfields were \nonce the economic foundations of communities. Today, brownfields lie \nabandoned--the legacy of our industrial past. These properties taint \nour urban landscape. Contamination, or the perception of contamination, \nimpedes brownfields redevelopment, stifles community development and \nthreatens the health of our citizens and the environment. Redeveloped, \nbrownfields can be engines for economic development. They represent new \nopportunities in our cities, older suburbs and rural areas for housing, \njobs and recreation.\n  As Co-Chair of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, I believe \nbrownfields redevelopment is one of the most important ways to \nrevitalize cities and implement growth management. The redevelopment of \nbrownfields, is a fiscally-sound way to bring investment back to \nneglected neighborhoods, cleanup the environment, use infrastructure \nthat is already paid for and relieve development pressure on our urban \nfringe and farmlands.\n  The State of Michigan is a leader in brownfields redevelopment, \noffering technical assistance and grant and loan programs to help \ncommunities redevelop brownfields. This legislation will compliment \nstate and local efforts to successfully redevelop brownfields. The bill \nprovides much needed funding to state and local jurisdictions for the \nassessment, characterization, and remediation of brownfield sites. \nImportantly, the bill removes the threat of lawsuits for contiguous \nlandowners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners. \nCommunities must often overcome serious financial and environmental \nbarriers to redevelop brownfields. Greenfields availability, liability \nconcerns, the time and cost of cleanup, and a reluctance to invest in \nolder urban areas deters private investment. This bill will help \ncommunities address these barriers to redevelopment. Finally, the bill \nprovides greater certainty to developers and parties conducting the \ncleanup, ensuring that decisions under state programs will not be \nsecond-guessed. Public investment and greater governmental certainty \ncombined with private investment can provide incentives for \nredeveloping brownfield properties and level the economic playing field \nbetween greenfields and brownfields.\n  I believe the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 2001 will do much to encourage commercial, \nresidential and recreational development in our nation's communities \nwhere existing infrastructure, access to public transit, and close \nproximity to cultural facilities currently exist. America's emerging \nmarkets and future potential for economic growth lies in our cities and \nolder suburbs. This potential is reflected in locally unmet consumer \ndemand, underutilized labor resources and developable land that is rich \nin infrastructure. In Detroit, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment estimates that there is a $1.4 billion retail gap, the \npurchasing power of residents minus retail sales. In Flint, HUD \nestimates the retail gap to be $186 million and in East Lansing, $160 \nmillion. The redevelopment of brownfields will help communities realize \nthe development potential of our urban communities. It is a critical \ntool for metropolitan areas to grow smarter allowing us to recycle our \nNation's land to promote continued economic growth while curtailing \nurban sprawl and cleaning up our environment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on March 12, 2001, the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works filed Senate Report 107-2, to \naccompany S. 350, the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 2001. When the report was filed, the cost estimate \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office was not available. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that the cost estimate be printed\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\nin the Record to comply with Section 403 of the Congressional Budget \nand Impoundment Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Congress,  \n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2001.\n     Hon.

If you wish further details on this estimate, we \n     will be pleased to provide them.

Crippen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\nS. 350 Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of \n  2001, as reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n                        Works on March 12, 2001\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       S. 350 would expand and modify certain programs governed by \n     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, commonly known as the \n     Superfund Act). The bill would provide a statutory framework \n     for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies and \n     programs related to brownfield sites and the liability of \n     certain entities under CERCLA. (Brownfields are properties \n     where the presence, or potential presence, of a hazardous \n     substance complicates the expansion or redevelopment of the \n     property.) The bill would authorize the appropriation of $750 \n     million over the next 5 years for grants to States and other \n     governmental entities for various brownfield initiatives. \n     Another $250 million would be authorized over the same period \n     for grants to States and Indian tribes for implementing \n     voluntary cleanup programs. Finally, the bill would exempt \n     some property owners from liability under CERCLA under \n     certain terms and conditions.\n       Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 350 would cost $680 million \n     over the 2002-2006 period. CBO estimates that provisions \n     affecting the liability of certain property owners would \n     reduce net offsetting receipts (a form of direct spending) by \n     $2 million a year beginning in 2002, or a total of $20 \n     million over the next 10 years. In addition, the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting this bill \n     would reduce revenues by a total of $24 million over the \n     2002-2006 period and by $110 million over the 2002-2011 \n     period. Because S. 350 would affect direct spending and \n     receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       S. 350 would impose no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA).\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 350 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 300 (natural resources and the environment).\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      SPENDING SUBJECT TO\n         APPROPRIATION\n \nBrownfields Spending Under\n Current Law:\n  Budget Authority \\1\\........     92      0      0      0      0      0\n  Estimated Outlays...........     89     87     41     14      5      0\nProposed Changes:\n  Authorization Level.........      0    200    200    200    200    200\n  Estimated Outlays...........      0     10    110    170    190    200\nBrownfields Spending Under S.\n 350:\n  Authorization Level \\1\\.....     92    200    200    200    200    200\n  Estimated Outlays...........     89     97    151    184    195    200\n \n  CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority....      0      2      2      2      2      2\nEstimated Outlays.............      0      2      2      2      2      2\n \n      CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues \\2\\........      0      0      1      4      8     11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2001 level is the amount appropriated for that year for EPA\n  grants for brownfields initiatives, including grants to States for\n  voluntary programs.\n\\2\\ Source: Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE\n\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 350 will \n     be enacted by the end of fiscal year 2001, and that all funds \n     authorized by the bill will be appropriated. Estimated \n     outlays are based on the historical spending patterns for \n     similar activities in the Superfund program.\n\n                   Spending subject to appropriation\n\n       S. 350 would authorize the appropriation of $1 billion over \n     the next 5 years for two grant programs: for brownfield \n     revitalization and for enhancing State programs related to \n     brownfields and other voluntary initiatives. In recent years, \n     the Congress has allocated some of the money appropriated for \n     EPA's Superfund program for such grants; this legislation \n     would provide an explicit statutory authorization for these \n     activities and would authorize specific amounts for fiscal \n     years 2002 through 2006. Provisions limiting the liability of \n     certain property owners could increase the use of \n     appropriated funds to clean up Superfund sites, but CBO \n     estimates that any change in discretionary spending would not \n     be significant in the next 5 years.\n       Grant Programs. Title I would authorize the appropriation \n     of $150 million annually for grants to States and other \n     governmental entities to characterize, assess, or cleanup \n     brownfield sites. Remediation grants could be used to \n     capitalize revolving funds or to pay for cleaning up sites \n     owned by public or nonprofit entities. Grants used for \n     remediation would be subject to a matching requirement and \n     could be used to leverage funding from other sources. In \n     addition, title III would authorize $50 million a year for \n     grants to States and Indian tribes to develop or enhance \n     programs pertaining to brownfields or voluntary response \n     programs. These funds also could be used to capitalize \n     revolving funds for brownfield remediation activities.\n       Cleanup Costs. Under CERCLA, property owners may be \n     responsible for cleanup activities, even if they did not \n     contribute to the contamination of a Superfund site. Title II \n     would amend CERCLA to limit the liability of certain \n     prospective purchasers of contaminated property after the \n     date of enactment. By reducing the pool of potentially \n     responsible parties, the ``prospective purchaser'' provisions \n     in section 202 could reduce the number of Superfund sites \n     that can be cleaned up in a timely fashion by private \n     entities. This could, in turn, increase the number of sites \n     needing full or partial Federal funding for cleanup \n     activities.\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill's prospective \n     purchaser provisions would not affect discretionary spending \n     for several years because only properties purchased after the \n     date of enactment would be exempt from liability. The cost \n     eventually could be significant, however, because cleanup \n     costs average $20 million per site.\n\n                            Direct spending\n\n       CBO estimates that provisions limiting the liability of \n     certain property owners would reduce net offsetting receipts \n     by about $2 million a year. EPA currently negotiates \n     liability settlements with 20 to 25 prospective purchasers of \n     contaminated property. As part of these agreements, \n     purchasers make both monetary and in-kind payments in \n     consideration of the government's covenant not to sue. While \n     the cash payments vary significantly among properties, the \n     agency typically collects an average of $100,000 per \n     settlement. EPA would forgo such payments under S. 350, \n     because prospective purchasers would no longer need these \n     agreements to be relieved of liability for cleaning up a \n     site.\n       The other limitations on liability in title II also could \n     affect EPA's ability to recover costs that the agency incurs \n     at cleanup projects that are the responsibility of private \n     parties. Liability for cleanup is retroactive, strict, and \n     joint and several, so changing the liability of one party \n     generally has the effect of shifting liability among the \n     other private parties. On the other hand, there may be some \n     circumstances in which this legislation would exempt the only \n     party likely to pay cleanup costs. We estimate that the loss \n     of offsetting receipts from these changes is likely to be \n     insignificant, however, because most of the provisions are \n     similar to current EPA practice.\n\n                                Revenues\n\n       This bill would affect revenues by authorizing States and \n     local governments to use Federal grants for brownfields \n     remediation to capitalize revolving funds. JCT expects that \n     the ability to leverage these revolving funds would result in \n     an increase in the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by State and \n     local governments. JCT estimates that the Federal Government \n     would forgo tax revenues of $110 million over the 2002-2011 \n     period as a result of these provisions.\n\n\n                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts.

The bill would authorize $200 million annually \n     from 2002 through 2006 for grants to State and local \n     governments for inventorying, characterizing, assessing and \n     remediating brownfield sites and for establishing or \n     enhancing response programs. Implementing S. 350 would \n     benefit State, local, and tribal governments if the Congress \n     appropriates funds for the grants and loans authorized in the \n     bill. Any costs incurred to participate in those grants and \n     loan programs would be voluntary.\n       S. 350 would make several changes to current law concerning \n     liabilities under CERCLA of certain property owners, which \n     may include State, local, or tribal governments. These \n     changes in liability, while not preemptions of State law, \n     could make it more difficult for any States that currently \n     rely on CERCLA to recover costs and damages under their own \n     cleanup programs from parties whose liability now would be \n     eliminated or limited by the bill. On the other hand, these \n     changes could benefit State, local, and tribal governments as \n     landowners if their liability would be reduced or eliminated. \n     Enacting S. 350 could also benefit State and local \n     governments with contaminated sites in their jurisdictions by \n     clarifying the liability for certain property owners under \n     Federal law and thereby encouraging remediation and \n     redevelopment of those sites.\n\n\n                 ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\n       This bill contains no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Kathleen Gramp (226-\n     2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Victoria Heid Hall (225-3220); Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Lauren Marks (226-2940); Revenues: Thomas Holtmann (226-\n     7575).\n       Estimate Approved by: Peter H. Fontaine Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hamsphire. Mr. President, I also ask to have printed \nin the Record a letter dated April 12, 2001 to Mr. Dan Crippen of the \nCongressional Budget Office signed by myself, Senator Reid, Senator \nChafee, and Senator Boxer. The letter illustrates areas in CBO's cost \nestimate that the authors of S. 350 believe to be inaccurate or \nmisleading. It is our intent, and our belief, that S. 350 will bring \nincreased private resources to brownfield sites, which will in turn \nlimit future expenditure of public resources.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2001.\n     Mr. Dan L. Crippen,\n     Director, Congressional Budget Office, Ford House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Crippen: We are writing with regard to the \n     Congressional Budget Office's cost estimate for S. 350, the \n     Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act \n     of 2001. It is important that the cost estimate prepared by \n     your office accurately reflect the provisions of the bill. As \n     the lead authors of the legislation, we are concerned that \n     the cost estimate for S. 350 is inaccurate in several \n     respects and is unintentionally misleading with regard to the \n     intent and application of the legislation.\n       The cost estimate indicates that section 202 of S. 350 \n     would ``reduce the number of Superfund sites that can be \n     cleaned up in a timely fashion by private entities.'' We \n     disagree with this assumption because the effect of section \n     202 will be to encourage private entities to perform \n     cleanups. Although the bill may limit future potential \n     liability of parties not currently liable under the Superfund \n     statute, it does not affect the liability of parties who are \n     already liable under the statute at sites already underway. \n     For even those new prospective purchasers receiving \n     protection under section 202, the bill provides for a \n     ``windfall lien,'' which would further reduce any need for \n     Federal funding at these sites. Moreover, the ``prospective \n     purchaser'' exemption is designed to, and should result in, a \n     significant increase in cleanups by private parties, \n     particularly at non-National Priorities List sites. The net \n     effect of these factors would be an increase in the \n     availability of private cleanup funds. The overall number of \n     sites at which Federal response authority applies under the \n     Superfund statute, and which will be cleaned up by private \n     entities, will increase as a result of enactment of the \n     ``prospective purchaser'' provisions.\n       In addition, the cost estimate asserts that the eventual \n     cost of the bill will be significant because cleanup costs \n     average $20 million per site. In fact, although cleanup costs \n     at National Priorities List sites may average approximately \n     $20 million per site, the cleanup costs at a brownfield site \n     averages approximately $500,000 per site. Indeed, since this \n     section applies to both NPL and non-NPL sites, and there are \n     many more brownfield sites addressed annually than there are \n     NPL sites, the average cost of the sites covered by this \n     provision would be dramatically less than that indicated. \n     Therefore, as currently drafted, the estimate would lead one \n     to believe that S. 350 could shift responsibility to the \n     Federal Government for as much as $20 million in cleanup \n     costs per site. This simply is not the case.\n       While we do not dispute the numbers provided by the cost \n     estimate, it is equally important that the narrative section \n     of the cost estimate accurately track the provisions of the \n     legislation as closely as possible. We respectfully request \n     that the Congressional Budget Office reissue the cost \n     estimate for S. 350 to address the types of concerns we have \n     raised. Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss these \n     issues further.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Smith,\n     Lincoln Chafee,\n     Harry Reid,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

The Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today \non S. 350, the Senate's Superfund brownfields legislation.\n  As most of those working on this issue know, I have been working on \ncomprehensive Superfund reform essentially ever since I was elected to \nCongress, about 8\\1/2\\ years ago. This was a very difficult issue.\n  In my opinion, we would have been best served if we had comprehensive \nSuperfund reform of the entire Superfund statute, but given the \npolitical dynamics we face in the country and the Congress today, it \nwas evident that we would not be able to achieve a comprehensive bill \nat this point in time, and the decision was made to move ahead with \nbrownfields legislation this year. That was a decision I fought against \nlast year but agreed to support this year, to see if we couldn't move \nahead and achieve some of the objectives that have already been so well \nexplained with regard to this legislation.\n  Brownfields legislation is badly needed in this country, as we try to \nreform and clean up some of the areas that have been discussed by other \nSenators. One of the concerns many of us had, however, was that if we \ndo a brownfields bill, we need to do one that truly works and not \nsimply create another approach to the issue that runs into the same \nproblems we have dealt with under the Superfund statute for so many \nyears. In other words, we need to craft it so the effort to reclaim \nthese areas and make them green again is not a failure and we don't \nsimply pass legislation that creates another set of difficult, \nburdensome approaches to the issue.\n  To effectively encourage more brownfields redevelopment programs, we \nhave to provide the necessary resources, give the States the management \nand oversight responsibility within their borders, and ensure that \ndevelopers are confident that their involvement will be truly welcomed \nand they will not simply pick up the liabilities already facing those \nwho own the brownfields and work on the properties.\n  All this has to be done in conjunction with the assurance that public \nhealth and the environment are being adequately protected. In that \ncontext, as the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee handled \nthis issue, a number of us had concerns that we hadn't yet achieved \nthose objectives as well as we could. I commend the managers of this \nbill for working so well with us to address those issues in the interim \nsince the bill was sent out of committee and is now being considered in \nthe Senate. We have a managers' amendment that addresses a number of \nthose concerns and that makes it possible for those of us who had \nproblems with the way the bill was originally drafted to work with and \nsupport the bill at this point.\n  The Senate has held many hearings on this legislation. A number of us \nhave worked on this measure for many years. I will discuss some of the \nelements of progress that have been made since the bill was sent out of \ncommittee and as we now move forward with the managers' amendment. I am \nvery pleased that we were successful in making these improvements.\n  The first issue relates to State finality. For those who are not \nconcerned with the issue, what we are talking about is a policy \ndecision that says that State governments should be the ones that \nhandle the management of the brownfields legislation. Instead of having \na national, federally led and, many of us believe, dictate-driven \ndecisionmaking process, we wanted to put together a system in which \neach individual State had the ability to interpret and implement the \nbrownfields legislation with decisions going on in their own States.\n  Many of us felt that State management and control would result in \nmuch better decisionmaking, as we would see it at the State and local \nlevel, than we would have if the decisionmaking were driven from the \nFederal level. It is a case of the State and local people having a much \nbetter understanding of the needs in their communities than those who \nare distant decisionmakers, not having the ability and understanding to \ntruly address the issues as best they could.\n  We needed to achieve that by still making sure the environmental \nobjectives were in place. I believe the managers' amendment gives us an \nimportant stride forward in this effort.\n  As the Senator from California, who just spoke, indicated, one of the \nprotections built into this bill was the provision that if, as the \nState moves forward, an imminent and substantial endangerment is found \nto the environment or public health, then the Federal Government, \nthrough the EPA, can step in and take some remedial actions. Short of \nthat imminent and substantial endangerment, it is the State's \nresponsibility for action.\n  One of the concerns that was debated in committee was whether we had \nadequately clarified it enough to make it clear that the EPA or the \nFederal administrators could not simply use any excuse they wanted in \norder to claim an imminent and substantial endangerment, and had to \ntruly work with the States and step in at the Federal level only in \nthose extreme cases in which it was clear that the State either did not \nhave the resources or was not willing to implement the law.\n  I believe that is where we have reached the compromise. The language \nincluded in the bill says imminent and substantial endangerment must be \nfound by the Federal Government before it can step in and supersede a \nState's actions, which is the intent of all of us who have worked on \nthis legislation. That gives the States truly an opportunity to have \nfinality to their decisions about how to implement this law.\n  Second, I am pleased that our efforts working with the managers of \nthe bill were successful in nearly doubling the number of eligible \nbrownfield sites under the program by expanding the bill's coverage. \nThis improvement alone will help make this program a reality for many \nmore communities around the country.\n  In appreciation for the managers' efforts to improve the original \nbill, I intend to support the amendment today, and the bill with the \namendment in place. I know there is still a lot of debate about whether \nwe have made enough improvement in the legislation or whether we have \nmade the bill good enough. The other body is going to be working on its \nproposals, and there will still be an effort to work with the \nadministration, as the President, the House, and the Senate all work \ntogether to craft a brownfields bill that will ultimately be signed \ninto law.\n  I look forward to working with all of them to make sure that even \nfurther improvements and changes to the legislation can be made as we \nmove through the legislative process.\n  This effort today is a very strong effort, and I think a very good \neffort, to move forward on meaningful brownfields legislation. With the \nmanagers' amendment, as I said, enough improvements have been made that \nthose of us who had concerns at the committee level, I think most, if \nnot all of us, will be able to support the bill today. We will continue \nto work with the House and the President and with the managers of the \nbill in the Senate to see that we can make even additional improvements \nto the legislation as it moves forward in the legislative process. I \nthink it is an important first step we are taking today, but it should \nbe recognized as such--as an important but first step.\n\n  With that, I conclude my remarks and yield back my remaining time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 350, the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Restoration Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nOhio is using the time of Senator Bond; is that true?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this legislation will provide \nincentives to clean up abandoned industrial sites, or brownfields, \nacross the country and put them back into productive use and preserve \nour green spaces.\n  I want to congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator Smith, \nthe ranking member of the committee, Senator Reid, the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Chafee, and all the other members of the committee \nwho have worked to put this piece of legislation together.\n  Revitalizing our urban areas has been an issue I have been passionate \nabout for many years. As former mayor of Cleveland, I experienced \nfirst-hand the difficulties that cities face in redeveloping these \nsites.\n  I have been working on brownfields issues at the national level since \nI became Governor of Ohio in 1990 and through my involvement with the \nNational Governors' Association and the Republican Governors' \nAssociation. For more than a decade, I have worked closely with \ncongressional leaders, such as Mike Oxley of Ohio and the late Senator \nJohn Chafee, to develop legislation that would do many of the same \nthings this bill does.\n  When the Environment and Public Works Committee considered this \nlegislation in March, I voted to report the bill out of committee after \ngetting a commitment from the Presiding Officer today, Senator Reid, \nthat he would be willing to work with me on some concerns I had \nregarding specific bill language.\n  During the committee markup of S. 350, I offered an amendment seeking \nto strengthen the State finality provisions in the legislation. Based \non the commitment I received from Senator Reid, I ultimately withdrew \nmy amendment.\n  In my view, we need to create more certainty in the brownfields \ncleanup process. Parties that clean up non-Superfund sites under State \ncleanup laws need certainty about the rules that apply to them, \nparticularly that their actions terminate the risk of future liability \nunder the Federal Superfund Program.\n  Last Congress, I introduced legislation supported by the National \nGovernors' Association and the National Council of State Legislatures \nwhich would create more certainty by allowing States to release parties \nthat cleaned up sites under State laws and programs from Federal \nliability.\n  I believe it is important that we build upon the success of State \nprograms by providing even more incentives to clean up brownfield sites \nin order to provide better protection for the health and safety of our \ncitizens and substantially improve the environment.\n  What we do not need are delays caused by the U.S. EPA's second-\nguessing of State decisions. A good example of second-guessing occurred \nin my own State. One company, TRW, completed a cleanup at its site in \nMinerva, OH, under Ohio's enforcement program in 1986. Despite these \ncleanup efforts, the U.S. EPA placed the site on the NPL list in 1989. \nHowever, after listing the site, the EPA took no aggressive steps for \nadditional cleanup, and it has remained untouched for years.\n  To enhance and encourage further cleanup efforts, my State has \nimplemented a private-sector-based program to clean up brownfield \nsites. When I was Governor, the Ohio EPA, Republicans and Democrats in \nthe General Assembly and I worked hard to implement a program that we \nbelieve works for Ohio. Our program is already successful in improving \nOhio's environment and our economy, recycling acres and acres of \nwasteland, particularly in our urban areas.\n  In almost 20 years under the Federal Superfund Program, the U.S. EPA \nhas only cleaned up 18 sites in Ohio. In contrast, 78 sites have been \ncleaned up under Ohio's voluntary program in the last 6 years, and many \nmore cleanups are underway.\n  States clearly have been the innovators in developing voluntary \ncleanup programs, and Ohio's program has been very successful in \ngetting cleanups done more quickly and cost effectively. For example, \nthe first cleanup conducted under our program--the Kessler Products \nfacility near Canton, OH--was estimated to cost $2 million and to take \n3 to 5 years to complete if it had been cleaned up under Superfund. \nHowever, under Ohio's voluntary program, the cost was $600,000 and took \n6 months to complete. These cleanups are good for the environment and \nthey are good for the economy.\n  States are leading the way in cleaning up sites more efficiently and \ncost effectively. According to State solid waste management officials, \nStates average more than 1,400 cleanups per year, and they are \naddressing approximately 4,700 sites all over the United States of \nAmerica at any given time.\n  I am pleased the bill we are considering today does not require the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency to pre-approve State laws and \nprograms. State brownfield programs address sites that are not on the \nnational priorities list and where the Federal Government has played \nlittle or no role.\n  Ohio and other States have very successful programs that clean up \nsites more efficiently and cost effectively. I worked closely with \nSenator Smith and Senator Reid and other Members to protect these \nState's programs. The managers' amendment is a result of that hard \nwork.\n\n  While I would still like to see more protection and certainty for \nState programs, I do not believe we should delay the improvements to \nthe current programs that are in this bill. What our States are doing \nis helping to recycle our urban wastelands, prevent urban sprawl, and \npreserve our farmland and green spaces. So often people forget about \nthe fact we have these acres of wastelands in many urban, and even \nrural, areas around the nation. Unless these sites are cleaned up, they \nwill force a greater loss of green space in our respective States.\n  These programs are cleaning up industrial eyesores in our cities and \nmaking them more desirable places to live and work. That is another \naspect of this legislation to which the Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer, eloquently spoke.\n  Because these programs are putting abandoned sites back into \nproductive use, they are a key element in providing economic rebirth to \nmany urban areas and good paying jobs to local residents. That is \nanother side we do not think about. We have all sorts of assistance \nprograms, training programs, and so forth, helping people become self-\nsufficient and productive citizens. In far too many cases in the United \nStates, because we have not recycled urban industrial sites, businesses \nand jobs are developed in the outlying areas where many urban residents \nsimply cannot get to, and are, therefore, unable to take advantage of \nthose jobs.\n  Mr. President, this is a wonderful bill in so many respects. It makes \nsense for our environment and it makes sense for our economy. \nTherefore, I am pleased the Senate is considering this bill today and I \nurge the House and Senate to come to a prompt agreement on a final \nversion of this legislation so we can provide a cleaner environment for \ncities across America.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this important \nlegislation to provide States and local communities with the tools and \nthe resources they need to clean up and reuse polluted industrial \nproperties, turning them from eyesores into opportunities and \nleveraging literally billions of dollars in economic benefits.\n  The legislation we are voting on today, S. 350, the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nAct of 2001, represents the ultimate form of recycling. It is the \nrecycling of one of our most precious and scarce natural resources; \nnamely, our land. Our environmental resources, as our financial \nresources, are not limitless. The cleanup and reuse of brownfield sites \nallows businesses and developers to use existing infrastructure so we \ncan reduce sprawl and preserve our precious green space and farmland \nand, at the same time, it provides an opportunity to energize local \neconomies and create new jobs.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 350, the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, an act which, \nas the President knows so well, enjoys broad bipartisan support of a \nmajority of the Senate, as well as of the administration, a diversity \nof State and local government organizations, business interests, and \nenvironmental advocacy groups.\n  This bill, S. 350, is an important step in building on the proven \nsuccess of existing brownfields efforts. The bill authorizes the \nestablishment of a flexible program to provide grants and loans to \nState, tribal, and local governments and nonprofit organizations to \nassess, safely clean up, and reuse brownfields. It includes important \nprovisions that promote assistance for small, low-income communities, \nas well as supporting efforts to create or preserve open space and \nfurthering participation by the public in cleanup decisions.\n  The bill provides appropriate liability relief for innocent parties \nwho want to clean up and reuse brownfield sites, while maintaining the \nnecessary Federal safety net to address serious cleanup issues.\n  Last week, I was delighted to learn that the EPA was making grants \nfor additional brownfields funding for Utica, NY. I remember the first \ntime I visited downtown Utica and saw all of the old mill and factory \nbuildings, which already were tied in with existing utilities, \nproviding an excellent opportunity for remediation that could be then \nfollowed by immediate redevelopment, only to be told because they were \nbuilt on old industrial sites, because the manufacturing processes that \noccurred in the 19th and 20th centuries involved dangerous chemicals \nand other contaminants, these brownfield sites in the middle of \ndowntown Utica were too expensive for private developers and the local \ncommunity to clean up. I am delighted that Utica and other such places \naround New York, including Albany and Chautauqua Counties and a village \nof Haverstram in Rockland County also received brownfields funding.\n  We have seen the benefits of brownfields cleanup and revitalization \nthroughout New York, from Buffalo to Glen Cove, and all the places in \nbetween. I stood on the shore at Glen Cove, one of the most beautiful \ncommunities on the north shore of Long Island, and could see the \neffects of the cleanup of brownfields that are going to turn what had \nbeen a contaminated waste area into a place that can be part of \nwaterfront redevelopment.\n\n  To date, over 20 communities across New York have received assistance \nthrough EPA's existing brownfields program. It is my hope and belief \nthat there will be many more when we finish this legislation, which \nwill more than double the resources currently available for brownfields \ncleanup across our country.\n  This bill strikes a delicate balance. There are compromises and \ntradeoffs. I appreciate the hard work of the committee in a bipartisan \nfashion to move this legislation forward. I take this opportunity to \nthank the leadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee on \nwhich I am honored to serve, particularly our chairman, Senator Smith, \nand our ranking member, Senator Reid, and the two Senators who pushed \nthis legislation forward because of their respective chairing and \nranking positions on a subcommittee; namely, Senators Chafee and Boxer. \nI also thank the staffs, including my staff, the committee staff, and \nthe individual staffs of the Senators who worked so quickly and \ndiligently to move this legislation to the floor today.\n  The managers' amendment includes a number of significant provisions. \nAgain, I applaud and thank everyone who was part of this process. I am \ngrateful; two of the managers' amendments I personally sponsored will \nbe part of this legislation. One provision will help focus the delivery \nof brownfields assistance to communities that experience a higher than \nnormal incidence of diseases such as cancer, asthma, or birth defects.\n  Two weeks ago, I was very fortunate and honored to go with my friend, \nthe Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, to Fallon, NV, where we held a \nhearing on a cancer cluster. It is a lovely community, 50, 60 miles \nfrom Reno. It is a small community, maybe 30,000 people at most, in a \nsparsely populated county. They have had 12 cases of leukemia among \nchildren in the last 2 years. Clearly, it is a cancer cluster. We don't \nknow what is causing it. Many believe, and much of the testimony we \nheard certainly suggests, this rate of cancer in this kind of a cluster \ncould be linked with exposure to hazardous substances.\n  The important provision we have added to the bill will offer \nassistance to communities already burdened with severe health programs, \nto help them clean up the polluted sites that may contribute to these \nproblems. We will have to do a lot more, and I will be working with \nSenator Reid under his leadership to think about what else we can do to \naddress environmental health issues.\n  We certainly have more than our share in New York. I am hoping that \nin the future we will have a hearing in New York, perhaps on Long \nIsland, to talk about the cancer clusters. We have asthma clusters; we \nhave diabetes clusters. We need to figure out what we are doing or what \nwe could stop doing or how we can clean up whatever might be \nassociated.\n  Under S. 350, States that receive brownfields funding must survey and \ninventory sites in the State. I was concerned there might be sites that \nwould be overlooked in communities that are small or sparsely populated \nsuch as Fallon, or low-income or minority such as those in New York \nCity.\n  I am pleased that with this provision in the managers' amendment we \nwill be able to include public participation so individuals can request \na nearby brownfield site be assessed under a State program. States \nwould maintain discretion and flexibility to set up this process \nhowever they best see fit, but concerned citizens would not be shut out \nof the process. They could participate and ask their particular \nbrownfield site be given some attention and perhaps even expedited \ncleanup because of the impact on their local community.\n  In every corner of our country there are abandoned, blighted areas \nthat used to be the engines of the industrial economy or served in our \nnational defense. We were privileged to hear testimony from the admiral \nwho runs the naval airbase that trains the top gun pilots outside of \nFallon. They use a lot of jet fuel. They have to occasionally burn it. \nThey sometimes have to drop it in their flight. They were very willing \nto come forward and talk about what the defense industry can do to help \nin this area.\n  Many of the places suffering from brownfields were in the forefront \nof creating the strong economy and the strong national defense system \nwe enjoy today. I think we have to pay attention to the needs of these \ncommunities.\n  I thank all who have made it possible for us to consider this bill \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to join in passing this important piece of \nenvironmental and economic and health care legislation. I hope our \ncolleagues in the House will work to move their own brownfields bill so \nwe can finally get about the business of revitalizing these sites so \nthey can realize their economic potential and preserve our country's \nbeautiful, open spaces, and revitalize our downtown areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from New York leaves the \nfloor, I want to publicly express my appreciation for her traveling to \nNevada as part of a committee to deal with a most serious problem. As \nthe Senator indicated, we do not know what the problem is in Churchill \nCounty. Is it problems with the base? It could be from fuel. We \nunderstand there have been alleged large leakages of fuel. Is it from \nthe dumping of the fuel, as she indicated? There is a theory by some \nacademics out of England that maybe it is\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\na virus caused by the huge influx of people coming to the base from \nvarious parts of the world to this previously very stable community. \nMaybe it is from the agricultural activity. The first Bureau of \nReclamation project in the history of this country took place there, \nthe Newlands project. For years they have been dumping hundreds of tons \nof pesticides and herbicides on those crops. Could that be the cause? \nCould it be the arsenic in the water there, which is 100 parts per \nbillion? We are trying to lower it to 10 parts per billion. We simply \ndo not know the cause.\n  With the Senator from New York coming there--I do not mean to \nembarrass her, but with her national following, she focused attention \non Fallon, NV, that would have never been accomplished had she not \nshown up there.\n  I indicated to the Senator earlier today I am going to send to her \nthe series of positive editorials that were written about her coming to \nthe State of Nevada, trying to help us with this most difficult \nproblem.\n  Finally, I want to say, as I have already said earlier, outside her \npresence but on this floor, what a valuable member of this committee is \nthe Senator from New York. For the not quite 100 days we have been \nfunctioning as this new Congress, she has been a member of this \ncommittee and she has been very valuable. She attends the meetings, \nstays through the meetings, and, as I indicated, she has been of \nvaluable assistance making this legislation better. I am happy to have \nher as a member of the committee and of the Senate. The people from New \nYork should feel very good about the person they brought to Washington \nas a Senator representing that State.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey the time that is \nleft over from my having spoken. I believe there may be some other time \nin there. I think the only speakers we have still to come are Senator \nCorzine and Senator Carper--I think that is all who wish to speak. We \nare going to 2 o'clock, so I yield whatever time up to 10 or 12 minutes \nto the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding the \ntime. Before I begin my own remarks on brownfields, I want to join him \nin commenting that Hillary Rodham Clinton had potentially one of the \nmost difficult transformations ever, maybe, becoming a Member of the \nSenate. It is also fair to say after only 100 days she has probably had \none of the most remarkably successful transformations ever made to the \nSenate.\n  Rarely has someone come to the Senate and devoted themselves so \ndiligently to the details of their work, meeting their responsibilities \nto their State with such bipartisan acclaim by her colleagues.\n  I think the people of New York should be very proud, under difficult \ncircumstances and the changing of public responsibilities, of how well \nshe accomplished the feat and now how proudly she represents the State \nof New York.\n\n  Since the fortunes of New Jersey are so closely tied to those of our \nmodest neighbor across the river, we are grateful that New York is so \nwell represented. I congratulate her on her introduction to the Senate.\n  As my friend and colleague from New York, I wish to address my \ncolleagues on the question of the brownfields legislation. We have now \ncompleted an unprecedented decade of extraordinary national prosperity. \nBut it is a cruel irony that many of those communities which, a \ngeneration ago, laid the foundation for America's industrial might and \nthe prosperity of our generation have not participated in every aspect \nof this new prosperity.\n  Critical to the goal of ensuring that all communities do, indeed, \nbenefit from this prosperity is creating sound economic development in \nthese traditional economic centers. Although often more graphic in \ncentral cities because of their limited space, brownfields \nredevelopment is not just an issue of these old centers. It has also \nbecome a question of small towns. The problem is, whether it is these \nolder industrial centers upon which our Nation built its future or it \nis small towns or rural areas, the Senate now in considering again \nchanges to brownfields legislation must deal with the reality that \nbrownfields redevelopment projects must overcome several difficult but \ncritical barriers. These barriers historically have included: No. 1, a \nlack of process certainty; No. 2, liability concerns; No. 3, added \nexpenses of environmental cleanup and the lack of redevelopment \nfinancing.\n  S. 350 is a bipartisan effort to address these very issues and to \nmake our brownfields program of the last few years everything that it \ncan, should, and must be.\n  Since 1993, when the Brownfields Pilot Program was implemented, \nhundreds of communities across the Nation have been successful in their \nefforts to assess, clean up, and redevelop vacant or underused \ncontaminated sites. In my State of New Jersey, brownfields \nrevitalization represents the potential rebirth of many distressed \ncities. Indeed, in many respects brownfields and HOPE VI grants have \nentirely changed the landscape of some of the most distressed urban \nareas in the State of New Jersey.\n  In Trenton, an old steel plant has been transformed to a minor league \nbaseball field. Now a center of recreation, attention, and life of the \ncity of Trenton, only years ago it was abandoned, contaminated \nproperty.\n  A railroad yard on the Camden waterfront in front of a enormously \nwonderful view of the city of Philadelphia, what should have been some \nof the most productive land in the Nation, was abandoned. It has now \nbecome a major entertainment center for the bistate area.\n  The city of Elizabeth is taking a former landfill and constructing a \nshopping mall.\n  For all of these reasons, brownfields legislation is critical, \nirreplaceable, in the economic revitalization of the cities of New \nJersey. It is not a theory. It is not a potential. It has been proven. \nIt is real in every one of these communities. But it does need to be \nimproved. I support the enhancements contained in S. 350 because, No. \n1, they reduce the legal and regulatory barriers that prevent \nbrownfields redevelopment and provide funds to States for cleanup \nprograms. No. 2, they address the needs to address potential \nliabilities faced by prospective purchasers and adjoining landowners. \nFinally, they provide funds to assess and clean up abandoned and \nunderutilized brownfields sites. This has not been the province of \nprivate funding sources.\n  This bill goes a long way to remove many of the uncertainties that \nhave made the financing of a brownfield project such a formidable task. \nWhile this legislation is a major step in the right direction, there is \nmore that must be done to enhance the public-private partnerships to \ncomplete the picture of brownfields revitalization. The strengthening \nof the public-private partnership utilizes tax incentives to help \nattract affordable private investment.\n  In August of 1997, this body approved a potentially significant \nbrownfields tax incentive. This tax incentive, referred to as the \n``expensing provision,'' allowed new owners of these contaminated sites \nto write cleanup costs off their taxes in the year they were deducted. \nThis allows for increased cashflow for redevelopment projects. \nSurprisingly, despite the potential advantage of this expensing \nprovision, there have been relatively few takers.\n  A GAO study reported in December of 2000 that in New Jersey there had \nbeen only three development projects which had even applied for this \ntax benefit. Developers told me they are discouraged from using the \nprovision because of the provision's indefinite future and the \nexclusion of brownfield sites containing petroleum. There is simply no \nincentive for real estate developers to complete projects and market \nthem quickly if the tax benefit they have derived is going to be taxed \nas ordinary income at 39.6 percent rather than capital gains at 20 \npercent.\n  The financial impact of that reality is very significant.\n  I intend to propose legislation which I believe is a very positive \nenhancement.\n  My legislation will tax this ``recapture'' or reclaiming of this \npreviously earned benefit as capital gain at a rate of 20 percent \nrather than as ordinary income.\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n  Using tax incentives to overcome capital shortages, in the market \nplace, to achieve greater public benefits, is a proven formula for \nsuccess.\n  This is exactly what I intend to do. This can be done to reverse \nnegative trends and start new, constructive initiatives.\n  In 1962, the Regional Plan Association of New Jersey-New York-\nConnecticut in its publication ``Spread City'' stated that the region \nwas drifting into a costly spread-out pattern of suburban development \nversus dormant central cities.\n  This publication noted that this pattern would produce suburbs with \n``neither the benefits of the city nor the pleasures of the \ncountryside.''\n  Four decades later this vision of ``Spread City'' has, in fact, \nmaterialized.\n  Today, brownfields redevelopment should be viewed as a method of \ncontrolling urban sprawl and ultimately preserving greenfields.\n  A recent study of nine New Jersey cities posed conservative estimates \nthat redevelopment of identified sites across the state could house \nnearly a quarter of 225,000 new residents expected by 2005.\n  It is, therefore, good economic policy. It is good social policy. It \nis good housing and job creation policy.\n  Finally, it is good environmental land use policy to enact \nbrownfields legislation, and to enhance it and improve it with the \nnecessary tax incentives to stimulate growth based on this exciting \nconcept.\n  I strongly identify myself with this initiative hoping the Senate \nwill consider my changes when indeed it is time to vote on brownfields.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Wellstone be added as a cosponsor to S. 350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Torricelli). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I point out, Mr. President, that with the \naddition of Senator Wellstone, that makes 70 cosponsors to this \nlegislation. That runs the entire political spectrum, from Helms to \nWellstone. I think it is a great tribute to the type of legislation it \nis that we could forge this kind of bipartisanship.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, there are a number of \nstakeholders who have written to express their support for S. 350. I \ndid enter those letters in the Record and obviously will not read them \nall, but I would like to highlight just three or four.\n  One of those letters was from the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The \nquote from that letter is:\n\n       The mayors believe that this legislation can dramatically \n     improve the nation's efforts to recycle abandoned or other \n     underutilized brownfields sites, providing new incentives and \n     statutory reforms to speed the assessment, cleanup and \n     redevelopment of these properties.\n\n  I think that is a very dramatic statement. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, the mayors are a bipartisan group from both political parties \nall across the country and are across the political spectrum as well.\n  Another letter we received was from the Trust for Public Land. One \nparagraph of that letter states:\n\n       Brownfields afford some of the most promising \n     revitalization opportunities from our cities to more \n     rural locales. This legislation will serve to help meet \n     the pronounced needs in under-served communities to \n     reclaim abandoned sites and create open spaces. . \n     .reclamation of brownfields properties brings new life to \n     local economies and to the spirit of neighborhoods.\n\n  Also from the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\n       I . . . commend you for your continued commitment to the \n     issue of brownfields revitalization. Without the necessary \n     reforms to CERCLA, [the Superfund law] clean up and \n     redevelopment opportunities are lost, as well as new jobs, \n     new tax revenues, and the opportunity to manage growth . . . \n     NCSL has made this a top priority and we applaud the \n     committee's leadership. . . .\n\n  Finally, from the Building Owners & Managers Association, \nInternational:\n\n       Thanks to the efforts of a dedicated collection of \n     Senators, the Senate now has a bipartisan piece of \n     legislation that would generate improved liability \n     protections, enhanced State involvement and increased federal \n     cleanup funding. Adoption of S. 350 would have an immediate \n     and dramatic impact on reducing the 400,000 brownfields sites \n     across America.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have stated many times indeed--and the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer also mentioned some of this in his \nremarks--this bill is going to encourage redevelopment and \nrevitalization all across our country.\n  I would like to highlight one particular redevelopment option that \nwould benefit from this bill. It is called ECO industrial development. \nIt is similar to that of the Londonderry, NH, industrial park.\n  By reducing the waste and pollution from industry, industrial land \nusers become better neighbors in residential areas. Developers and \ncommunities can target the kind of development they want rather than \nbeing at odds with each other.\n  I think that is the beauty of this legislation.\n  Eco-industrial development helps break down the notion that enhanced \nenvironmental management can only be done at a greater cost to \nbusinesses. It is not true. The two go hand in hand. You can have an \nenhanced environment, and you can enhance industry. That is why this \nconcept is so appropriate.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will, in fact, encourage responsible \nredevelopment and revitalization similar to the Londonderry eco-\nIndustrial park.\n  Let me talk about eco-industrial development for just a second. It \ncreates efficiencies in the use of materials and energy through \nplanned, voluntary networks among businesses and their industrial-\nmanufacturing processes. This increased efficiency not only drives down \npollution and waste generated by these industrial processes, but it \nincreases the profitability and competitiveness of the businesses at \nthe same time. With these reinforcing benefits, eco-industrial \ndevelopment is a market-based, incentive-driven means for preventing \npollution rather than relying on the fragmented, end-of-the-pipe \nregulations we have done for so many years.\n  So our current measures of productivity are based almost entirely on \nmeasuring industrial output per unit of labor. But a handful of \ncompanies--Dow Chemical, Monsanto, 3M, Ford Motor, and others--have \nbeen focusing on ways to increase or maintain their current level of \noutput while using fewer resources. This resource productivity can \nincrease a company's return on its assets significantly. And overall, \nan industrial and manufacturing sector in the U.S. that uses materials \nand energy more efficiently will become more productive, more \nprofitable, and will remain competitive in global markets.\n\n  I think the moral of the story is that when you take an abandoned \nsite that has been polluted and you convert it into whatever--either a \ngreen space or a true park or playground, or a baseball field, as the \nPresiding Officer mentioned, in Trenton--whatever you do with it, if \nyou turn it into something productive, you have, No. 1, created jobs in \ndoing so, and, No. 2, you have taken all the pressure off additional \ngreen space--a lot of pressure off additional green space--that now \nwill not be developed because this will be redeveloped, and also you \nhelp to beautify your community.\n  I think it is also important to point out it is not just the large \ncities such as Trenton, NJ, or Manchester, NH, or any other large \ncity--it is not just large cities--there are many small towns all \nacross America where some 400,000 to 500,000 of these sites lie. A lot \nof them are on the eastern seaboard in the early developed areas of our \ncountry, along the rivers and railroad tracks, and these are the areas \nthat need help.\n  For so many years, under the current Superfund law, they have not \nbeen able to develop these sites because industry and contractors \nsimply would not take the risk, knowing the possible liability. So that \nis why this legislation is so exciting. It is also why we have 70 \ncosponsors and why we probably will have a close to unanimous, if not \nunanimous, vote in the Senate. And we look\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nforward to seeing this bill move forward to the House, and to get it \nout of the House or out of conference, whatever the case may be, and \nget it to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 350, the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  This bill proves that environmental protection and economic \ndevelopment can go hand in hand, that we can take depressed, blighted \nareas, such as those in New Jersey with which we have worked, and make \nthem vibrant and productive, and that we can do so in a cooperative, \nbipartisan manner.\n  Hundreds of thousands of contaminated industrial sites lie \nunderutilized or even abandoned across the country, largely because of \nthe potential risk and expense of cleaning them up. New Jersey has more \nthan 8,000 of these brownfields.\n  When developers now look at these sites, they see a hornet's nest of \nproblems. But when I look at them, I see opportunities. Many of these \nbrownfields are located in economically depressed urban areas. Cleaning \nthem up can spur economic development, create jobs, and bring in \nadditional tax revenue.\n  Of course, cleaning up brownfields does more than help the economy. \nIt also protects the public health. In addition, by cleaning up sites \nin our urban areas, we redirect development away from our remaining \nopen space and reduce many of the problems associated with sprawl.\n  Unfortunately, despite the broad benefits of cleaning up brownfields, \nthe private sector often finds it unattractive or unrealistic to take \non the task. Nor is it always easy for States and local governments. \nThat's why this legislation is so important. By providing needed \nfunding and placing reasonable limits on developers' liability, it \nshould encourage the development of many brownfields and the \nrevitalization of depressed areas around our Nation and across the \nState of New Jersey.\n  This legislation also represents an important compromise of Federal \nand State interests. It provides funding for grants to States to help \nthem enhance and develop their own brownfields programs. It recognizes \nthe important lead role that States play in dealing with brownfields, \nbut it also retains the right of the Federal Government to intervene \nunder certain circumstances to address serious threats that may arise. \nIn general, I see this as a sound balance.\n\n  We should be proud that we have been able to work this in a way that \nleads to a positive long-term result.\n  I do point out, however, that this bill merely provides an \nauthorization for funding in the future. It doesn't provide the funding \nitself. Often we talk about authorizations and take victory laps, but \nthe appropriations process is important. That will be up to those in \nthe appropriations process later on, and we'll all have to work hard to \nmake sure that we can find real dollars to be placed against this real \nneed.\n  Along these lines, I was very disappointed that the Bush budget \nincluded only $98 million for brownfields redevelopment. That's far \nshort of the $250 million authorized in this bill for fiscal year 2002. \nThe Bush administration has said that it would support the bill, but \ntheir budget doesn't have the money to show this support. Congress will \nhave to do better.\n  Finally, I acknowledge the leadership of my predecessor, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, who took the lead in the last Congress to develop \nthis legislation. Senator Lautenberg for years has been a strong \nadvocate of addressing brownfields. I am pleased that his efforts--and \nthe efforts of staffer Lisa Haage, who now works for the Environment \nCommittee--soon should bear fruit.\n  I also want to thank Senators Smith, Reid, Chafee, and Boxer for \ntheir leadership and hard work in crafting and advancing this \nbipartisan legislation this year. This bill proves that bipartisanship \ncan and will lead to positive results, particularly with regard to \nenvironmental legislation. I am hopeful that that spirit of cooperation \nwill operate here in the Chamber.\n  With that, I conclude my remarks and again urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to express my support for S. 350, the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Restoration Act. It is a bill which I hope we will \nvote to pass today and, hopefully, it will be enacted in the House as \nwell. The bill before us this afternoon represents years of discussion, \ncountless hearings and a genuine compromise. Some people in this \nChamber have been part of those discussions and have worked hard to \nachieve this compromise.\n  We have heard from others today who talked about the balance this \nbill represents and some of the compromises it contains. I want to \nfocus in my remarks on what this bill means to our States, including \nthe State I am privileged to represent, Delaware, where this \nlegislation can make and will make a real and significant impact.\n  This morning, I came to work by train, as I do most mornings. I \ncaught the train in Wilmington and headed down to Washington. I looked \nout, as I often do, the left side of the train as we pulled out of the \nAmtrak station in Wilmington, and I looked over to an area that during \nWorld War II was a prime area for building ships, along the magnificent \nChristina River. Between roughly 1941 and 1945, some 10,000 men and \nwomen worked along the banks of the Christina River in Wilmington. They \nbuilt all kinds of ships, destroyer escorts, troop landing ships, \nLiberty ships, and other vessels that really helped to win World War \nII.\n  When the war was over in 1945, not surprisingly, all of those people \nwere no longer needed. Eventually, within a few years after the end of \nthe war, that vibrant shipbuilding community along the Christina folded \nup and all of those jobs, for the most part, went away. What had been a \nvibrant area with manufacturing vitality began to go to seed, and over \nthe years it eventually turned into an abandoned wasteland.\n  To be honest, as Delaware's Congressman during the late 1980s, as I \nrode that same Amtrak train to work, I looked out that window and said \nto myself, boy, this looks awful. And it did. Today it doesn't. Today, \nwe have a river walk, we have a beautiful park, we have buildings that \nhave been restored or are being restored, we have museums, restaurants, \nand places to shop. We have a stadium where one of the greatest minor \nleague baseball teams in America plays, the Wilmington Blue Rocks.\n  A couple years ago, as Delaware's Governor, I signed legislation that \nenabled us to go in and turn that industrial wasteland into the \nriverfront jewel that it is becoming today for the State of Delaware. \nWe returned to productive use some land that had been forgotten and \nthat in a way, served as a buffer to keep people away from the river.\n  I want to thank several people, certainly our subcommittee chairman, \nthe ranking Democrat, and Senator Chafee, who headed the subcommittee \nto develop this bill and nurtured it over the years. I thank Senator \nSmith, chairman of the committee, for his good work, and Senator Reid \nof Nevada, who has spent a fair amount of time in these vineyards in \nthe last couple of years.\n  As a freshman Senator who joined this important debate a little late, \nthey were kind enough to work with me and teach me a thing or two about \nthese issues and listen to my concerns and to reflect some of them in \nthe final bill. I don't see my friend from Ohio on the floor, but I \nwant to say a word about Senator Voinovich, who chaired\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nthe National Governors' Association during the time when I was its \nvice-chairman, and who has worked on this bill with me. We had the \nopportunity to work a little together on this legislation and he was \ninstrumental in making a good bill even better. I am pleased to say to \ncolleagues today and fellow Governors across the country that included \nin this bill is a provision that will go some distance toward ensuring \nthat State certification of brownfields cleanup will actually result in \nthe revitalization of thousands of underutilized sites in States across \nthe country.\n\n  I thank Senator Voinovich for his work on this, as well as the other \nmembers of our committee who have worked very hard and patiently over \nthe last several months and years, and who didn't pass up the \nopportunity this year to make this bill the best it could be. I believe \nwhat we have today is a brownfields bill that moves EPA's existing \nprogram a significant step forward.\n  This bill protects our environment and encourages businesses to reuse \nthese sites. In my opinion, it just makes good sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of this bill.\n  Before I yield, I want to say, in reflecting on my first roughly 3 \nmonths here as a Senator, I have had the opportunity to work in a \nbipartisan manner in the Chamber on a couple of major initiatives, such \nas bankruptcy reform, along with the Presiding Officer, who was \ninstrumental in it; but the bill passed with 85 votes, with broad \nbipartisan support. There was also campaign finance reform, which \nenjoyed a lot of Democratic and Republican support as well. We had the \nbudget resolution, which ended up enjoying a fair amount of Democratic \nsupport as well as Republican support, and today we have the \nbrownfields legislation, which I believe will pass this Chamber with \nbroad bipartisan support. I am encouraged at this degree of bipartisan \nsupport we have seen on these issues. Maybe we will somehow set the \nstage today for debate which is to begin maybe tomorrow or next week, \nand that is to bring up the education issues, to try to redefine the \nFederal role regarding the education of our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I surrender my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of \nminutes to explain to my colleagues the managers' amendment, which will \nbe part of the entire vote. We did expand the bill. At the end of the \nmarkup in committee, there were a number of concerns raised by Senators \non both sides, which we attempted to address and finally were able to \naddress. I wanted to highlight three or four of them on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Senator Inhofe raised a concern, and Senator Bond as well, about \ninnocent parties cleaning up relatively low-risk brownfield sites \ncontaminated by petroleum or a petroleum product. We were able to allow \nfor the application for brownfields revitalization funding for those \npurposes as requested by Senators Inhofe and Bond.\n\n  Also, in authorizing $200 million annually for the brownfields \nrevitalization program, we added another $50 million, or 25 percent of \nthe total for the cleanup of petroleum sites. This was included in the \nmanagers' amendment. We have unanimous committee support for it today. \nThose are two contributions to the overall legislation by Senators \nInhofe and Bond.\n  In addition, Senator Chafee asked for a clarification that a grant or \nloan recipient may use a portion of that grant or loan to purchase \ninsurance for the characterization assessment or remediation of the \nprospective brownfields site. We were able to take care of that.\n  Senator Clinton asked for conditions to the rank and criteria used to \naward moneys under this bill to address sites with a disproportionate \nimpact on the health of children, minorities, and other sensitive \nsubpopulations in communities with a higher than average incidence of \ncancer and other diseases and conditions. We were able to include that. \nAnother concern of Senator Clinton was an element to a State response \nprogram whereby a citizen can request a State official to conduct a \nsite assessment and the State official considers and responds \nappropriately to that request. Those issues of concern were added to \nthe managers' amendment.\n  In addition, Senator Voinovich asked for a requirement that the \nAdministrator consult with States in determining when new information \nregarding a facility presents a threat to human health or the \nenvironment, while preserving EPA's authority to take appropriate \naction.\n  Mr. President, I also received a moment ago a statement from the \nadministration. I will quote from part of it:\n\n       The administration supports Senate passage of S. 350 which \n     would authorize appropriations to assess and clean up certain \n     abandoned industrial sites known as brownfields and provide \n     protection from liability for certain landowners. By removing \n     barriers to brownfield cleanup and redevelopment, S. 350 \n     would allow communities to reduce environmental and health \n     risks, capitalize on existing infrastructure, attract new \n     businesses and jobs, and improve their tax base.\n\n  We are pleased to have that statement of support.\n  Before I yield to Senator Reid for final remarks before the vote, I \nthank Senator Reid again and all of the members of the committee, \nSenator Chafee, Senator Boxer, and all those who worked with me to \nbring this to closure. It has been a pleasure. I have enjoyed it. It \nwas a long ride, but we finally got to the end. We are glad we did. The \ncountry will be the beneficiary of our actions.\n  It is nice to know that a piece of legislation, once it passes, will \nhave immediate results for almost any community in America. There are \nso many sites. There are probably very few communities that do not have \na brownfield site, which is an abandoned industrial site.\n  I will be pleased when the bill is signed and when the dollars start \nto flow, not just from the few dollars we have in the Federal process \nbut from the investments that will be made by the private sector \nbecause these folks will now be able to go onsite and clean them up.\n  I am excited about the bill. I am glad we are at the end. I am happy \nto hand it over to the House now and wait for them, and hopefully, if \nthere is a conference, it will be an easy one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Delaware for being a member of the \ncommittee. Senator Carper and I came to Washington together, along with \nthe Presiding Officer, in 1982. When he was elected to the Senate, I \nwas very happy. He was a great Member of the House of Representatives \nand a tremendous Governor.\n  I was happy to visit the State of Delaware on a number of occasions \nand work with the Governor of Delaware. The people of Delaware are very \nfortunate to have someone of the caliber of Tom Carper representing \nthem in the Senate. He is a great addition to Joe Biden. They are good \nSenators. I do not know how you can do better than the two Senators \nfrom the State of Delaware.\n  Senator Carper's work on the committee and on this bill has been \nexemplary. He reached out on a bipartisan basis to Senators Crapo and \nVoinovich. He and Senator Voinovich were fellow Governors. As a result \nof his advocacy, he worked very hard with Senator Voinovich to satisfy \nthe problems he had with this bill. I express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  I was very happy to hear from Senator Smith that we do now have a \nstatement from the administration on this legislation. This is, in \neffect, icing on the cake. This legislation has been long in coming. \nThe prior administration tried very hard to get it before the Congress. \nFor various procedural reasons, we were unable to do so for 2 years. On \na bipartisan basis, the committee was able to report this important \nlegislation for consideration by the Senate.\n  This legislation is representative of how we should operate in the \nSenate. It is a bill we recognize was controversial. It is a bill about \nwhich we recognize there were disparate views in the committee, and we \nalso realize the Senate was divided 50/50, just as the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee was divided 50/50. Republicans reached\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nDemocrats, Democrats reached Republicans, and we came up with this \nlegislation.\n  This is very good legislation; 500,000 sites in America will benefit \nfrom this legislation. Billions of dollars will go to local \ncommunities. Hundreds of thousands of jobs, in fact 600,000 jobs, will \nbe required to clean up these sites. This is important because, as we \nindicated earlier this morning, there are corner service stations in \nurban areas upon which nothing can be built. People will not touch them \nbecause they are an old service station and there may be Superfund \nliability. This legislation takes care of that.\n  Corner service stations all over America will be cleaned up and \nsomething built which will contribute to the local community.\n  There are dry cleaning establishments all over America. We do not \nhave big dry cleaners. They are all small. All over America we have old \ndry cleaning establishments. New businesses will not touch them because \nof possible Superfund liability. This legislation takes care of all \nthat.\n  This is what the American people want in sending us an equally \ndivided Senate. This is what the people deserve. This legislation will \ngo a long way toward making people feel good about Government.\n  It has been a pleasure working with the Senator from New Hampshire, \nas I have already stated. This is a joint effort. I commend and applaud \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Chafee, and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Boxer, for their outstanding work.\n\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 352 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 352) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended, is agreed to.\n\n\n       regarding consultation with the states on new information\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto clarify some issues related to the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act. Is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthe exception under which the President may bring an enforcement action \nfollowing new information becoming available is to occur after the \nAdministrator has consulted with the State?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My colleague from Ohio is correct. The \nmanagers' amendment clarifies the role of the State when new \ninformation has become available. Specifically, the Administrator must \nconsult with the State before an enforcement action can be taken. \nAdditionally, the State's records must be consulted to determine \nwhether the new information was known by the State as defined in the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Is it also correct that this provision does not limit \nthe Administrator of the EPA from making a determination, based on new \ninformation, that the conditions at the facility present a threat that \nrequires further remediation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, The managers' amendment states that consultation \nwith the State shall not limit the ability of the Administrator in \nmaking a determination, as the result of new information, that \ncontamination or conditions at a facility present a threat requiring \nfurther remediation to protect public health or welfare or the \nenvironment. Consultation with the State is important and is addressed \nin this section and other portions of the bill. It is not intended, \nhowever, to be an open-ended process. Consultation should not delay or \nprohibit the Administrator's ability to determine that a site presents \na threat that requires further remediation.\n  Mr. REID. I am very pleased that we were able to resolve the concerns \nraised by my colleague Mr. Voinovich at the Committee markup, and wish \nto thank him for working with us to reach this resolution.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank my colleagues for clarifying the role of the \nStates in making these determinations.\n\n\n                       Regarding Petroleum Sites\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman and \nranking member if they agree with my interpretation of the Inhofe \namendment adopted as part of the managers' package.\n  This amendment ensures that certain sites that have been contaminated \nby petroleum or petroleum products, ``petroleum contaminated'', will be \neligible for funding under title I of this bill, by expressly adding \nthese sites to the definition of ``brownfield sites,'' and specifically \nauthorizing funding for the characterization, assessment and \nremediation of these sites. These petroleum-contaminated sites must \nmeet several conditions to be eligible for funding under this new \nprovision.\n  First, the site must be relatively low risk, as compared with other \npetroleum-only sites in the State. This provision does not presuppose \nthat each State has conducted a ranking of its petroleum sites, or \nrequire that it do so. Rather, we are aware that most States already \nhave experience in making determinations as to which petroleum \ncontaminated sites pose the greatest risk, under section 9003(h)(3) of \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), States are directed to prioritize \nsites for corrective action based on ``which pose the greatest threat \nto human health and the environment.'' The Committee contemplates that \nStates will be able to use similar approaches to those used under \nsection 9003(h)(3) to identify sites that are appropriately covered by \nthis provision, those that are relatively low risk.\n  Section 9003(h)(3) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act directs states, \nwho are authorized under section 9003(h)(7), to prioritize underground \nstorage tank, ``UST'', sites. Under 9003(h)(3), a priority for \nremediation is given to UST sites which pose the greatest threat to \nhuman health and the environment, as determined by those States. The \nnew section 128(a)(D)(ii)(II) of S. 350 addresses sites that meet all \nof the following conditions: there are no viable responsible parties, \notherwise known as abandoned sites; the petroleum site is not subject \nto an order under section 9003(h) of SWDA; and the petroleum \ncontamination is relatively low risk. Relatively low risk should be \ndetermined by comparing the relative risk of a given site to UST and \nother petroleum contaminated sites in that State. The determination as \nto whether a particular site meets the ``relatively low risk'' \ncriterion will be made by the entity that is awarding the grant or loan \nto the person doing the work.\n  Funds authorized under the new section 128(l)(2) shall be used for \nsite remediation, characterization, or assessment. If a site uses funds \nauthorized by section 128(l)(2) to assess a site, and it is later \ndetermined (after the assessment) that the site is eligible for other \napplicable Federal and State funding, funds from those other applicable \nFederal or State programs shall be used first. This will preserve funds \nauthorized under this bill for sites that do not have access to another \nsource of funding.\n  Neither this nor any other provision of S. 350, in any way, alters \nthe exclusion of petroleum or petroleum products from the definition of \n``hazardous substance'' under section 101 of CERCLA.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for this amendment and \nam also interested in knowing if this interpretation is consistent with \nthe intent of the chairman and the ranking member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Oklahoma's interpretation of the \namendment is consistent with my interpretation of the provisions and I \nam pleased we were able to include it in the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the chairman. I hope that this section will \nprovide an additional tool for addressing abandoned petroleum sites. \nThe bill includes mechanisms to allow us to evaluate how this and other \nprovisions of the bill are working, and whether the funding levels are \nsufficient.\n  Mr. BOND. I'd like to thank the chairman and ranking member for\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\ntheir cooperation on this amendment and commend the Senator from \nOklahoma for his leadership on this important initiative, which will \nprovide a vital tool for brownfields cleanups.\n\n\n       regarding ``contract carriage'' and ``spur track'' issues\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as we have discussed here today, I hope \nthere will be additional opportunities for the committee to consider \nneeded legislative changes to sections of Superfund that are not \nrelated to brownfields.\n  There are two such changes which clarify liability for common \ncarriers and rail spur track owners I would like to bring to your \nattention which this committee has favorably considered in past \nSuperfund bills.\n  The first provision would conform the existing law to the industry's \ncurrent practice of using contract carriage agreements by clarifying \nthat a railroad would not be liable for the transportation of hazardous \nsubstances under the terms of a contract with a shipper who later \nmishandles the commodity. This is a technical amendment which is \nnecessary to reflect the fact that most rail shipments today move under \nthe terms of transportation contracts, not tariffs, as was the case \nwhen CERCLA was first enacted in 1980.\n  The second issue addresses contamination on or around spur tracks, \nwhich run to and through shipper facilities. The current law states \nthat railroads can be potentially liable as landowners for such \ncontamination even when it is caused by a shipper. This change would \nhold the railroad liable only if the railroad caused or contributed to \nthe release of the hazardous substance.\n  Both these issues recognize that a railroad, as a common carrier, \nshould not be liable when it cannot control its customer's handling of \nhazardous substances, and the customer's actions result in the release \nof a hazardous substance that creates CERCLA liability.\n  These noncontroversial changes are simple and needed reforms to the \nSuperfund law, and I would hope you could support including these \nprovisions in later Superfund legislation or even, if the opportunity \npresents itself as part of this brownfields bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would say to my good friend that I \nagree with these provisions and have, in fact, supported them in the \npast. I will continue to support them, but as we have discussed it will \nbe difficult to include them in the brownfields bill. I would certainly \nsupport the inclusion of these provisions in any Superfund legislation \nthat the committee acts on later this year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman for his support on these two \nprovisions.\n\n\n                   regarding environmental insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the subcommittee \nchairman and ranking minority member and the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee chairman in helping craft this brownfields bill. I \nwould like to clarify one matter in the managers' amendment regarding \nthe use of funding under this bill to purchase certain environmental \ninsurance at brownfield sites.\n  S. 350 clarifies that a person who receives federal funds for \ncharacterization, assessment and cleanup of a brownfield site, and is \nperforming that work, will be able to use a portion of that money to \npurchase insurance for the characterization, assessment or remediation \nof that site. While I believe this can be a valuable tool, I would like \nto ensure that the limited brownfield funding is maximized to \nfacilitate cleanup and reuse of as many sites as possible.\n  I would like to confirm with the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nSuperfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment that the language is \nlimited to the purchase of environmental insurance by persons \nperforming the actions, that the purchase of environmental insurance is \nintended to be a relatively minor percentage of the overall costs at a \nsite, and that its primary purpose is to insure against costs of \nassessment, characterization and cleanup being higher than anticipated.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is correct. This \nprovision is intended only to clarify that a person performing the \ncharacterization, assessment, or cleanup can use federal assistance to \npurchase environmental insurance such as cost-cap insurance, which is \none of the most frequently used policies at brownfield sites. Such a \npolicy would cover the costs of cleanup if the actual costs exceeded \nestimated costs. It is my understanding that this clarifies EPA's \ncurrent practice. This protection can give a developer the necessary \ncomfort to invest in a site. In addition, the purchase of such \nenvironmental insurance with federal assistance is not intended to be a \nsignificant portion of the overall assessment, characterization, or \ncleanup costs at a site. The Senator from Nevada also is correct \nregarding the purpose of these policies: no portion of the funding \nunder this bill would be available for other types of insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's clarification of \nthis matter.\n\n\nRegarding a Mechanism for Citizens to Request State Officials to Assess \n                      a Potential Brownfields Site\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank Chairmen Smith and Chafee and \nSenators Reid and Boxer for agreeing to further enhance opportunities \nfor public participation in state brownfields programs under S. 350. \nSpecifically, the bill as amended would provide an opportunity for \nindividuals to request that a nearby brownfields site be assessed under \na state program, and for such requests to be considered and responded \nto in an appropriate manner by the State. Although states complying \nwith the other state program elements in the bill must survey and \ninventory sites in the state, there may be rare instances when sites \nare inadvertently overlooked. I am particularly concerned about this \nhappening in communities that may be small or sparsely populated, low-\nincome, minority, or otherwise socially or politically disenfranchised.\n  This new provision will help to ensure that in those rare \ncircumstances that a site is overlooked in a State's survey process, \nsomeone who lives or works in the community can bring a potential \nbrownfields site to the attention of the State and request that the \nsite be assessed under the state's brownfields program. The intent is \nto provide states with the flexibility to set up this element of their \nstate brownfields program as they best see fit, and the provision does \nnot create an appeals process. Is that your understanding of the \nprovision?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, that is my understanding of the \nprovision.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I agree that it is important for States to be \nresponsive to the concerns of their citizens. As a former Governor of \nOhio, I have the unique first-hand experience of dealing with such \nissues and the role of the state. In fact, Ohio law already requires \nthe state to respond to environmental complaints.\n  The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, OEPA, responds under the \nverified complaint procedure required under State law. Under this \nstatute, the Director of OEPA must take action by expeditiously \ninvestigating claims and following up within a specified period of \ntime. If enforcement action is warranted, then the Director must \ncontact the State Attorney General to initiate proper proceedings.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is important for a State to be \nresponsive to concerns brought up by its citizens. For example, under \nthe New Hampshire program, if a citizen contacts the Department of \nEnvironmental Services, DES, regarding a site, the first and foremost \nconsideration is to carefully assess the potential risk to human health \nand the environment. Both written and telephone communications are \nassigned to DES's Special Investigations Section in the Waste \nManagement Division. There are four individuals who are involved in \nthis work and provide round-the-clock coverage.\n  DES first checks the data base to verify that the inquiry is indeed a \nnew matter and decides, based upon the information offered, the level \nof risk and hence the immediacy of response required. Departmental \nprotocol governs this practice. An essential element of this approach \nis based upon the intuitive, knowledgeable sense of the staff person \nreceiving the call. An attempt is made to identify matters that require \nimmediate response from others of a less immediate nature. In the event \nof a grave emergency, DES or the\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\non-scene commander, may request assistance from EPA's emergency \nresponders.\n  In the case where a site warrants an emergency response, the citizen \ninquirer would be given information as soon as the site was in control \nand the responders or other Division staff could be made available to \nprovide details. If the case is determined to be a new site, the \ncitizen would be responded to when an initial site drive by or on the \nground investigation had been made. In this case an inquirer would be \ntold what to expect for a response time, if a response were necessary.\n  An inquiry related to a known site which was not an emergency \nsituation would be addressed by the assigned Project Manager, who could \ncomment on planned or on-going work at the site and the nature or \ndegree of risk. DES also would seek to determine whether the inquirer \nhad new information that might be relevant. Most often, DES would make \nan initial response to an individual within 2-3 days.\n  As you can see, Senator Clinton, the State of New Hampshire has a \nvery responsive brownfields program that takes seriously all requests \nand inquires made by its citizens.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Senator Smith and Senator Voinovich. I think \neveryone would agree with you that it is important for states to be \nresponsive to citizens' concerns, and that many states are doing just \nthat.\n\n\n                         regarding information\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the ``information'' referred to in new \nsection 129(b)(1)(B)(iv) of S. 350 pertains to information that \nindicates that a site presents a threat requiring further remediation \nto protect public health or welfare or the environment. The committee \nexpects that the Administrator shall use her discretion in determining \nwhether this information is both credible and relevant to the site.\n  ``Information'' consists of information not known by the State on the \nearlier of the date on which cleanup was either approved or completed. \nThe ``information'' need not be specific to this site; however, it must \nbe relevant to the site in question. After careful consideration of the \nquality, objectivity and weight of the ``information'' regarding the \nsite, the Administrator shall decide whether this information is \nadequate to determine there is a threat to public health or welfare or \nthe environment.\n  This ``information'' triggers this section only if the Administrator \ndetermines that it indicates that such contamination or conditions at \nthe facility present a threat requiring further remediation to protect \npublic health or welfare or the environment. Do the chairman and \nranking member agree with this interpretation of ``information?''\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is correct. This provision is intended to ensure \nthat the public health and the environment are protected from such \nthreats.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I share my colleagues' interpretation of \nthis provision.\n\n\n                     regarding cattle dipping vats\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to confirm with the chairman \nand ranking Democratic member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that certain sites in my State would be eligible for the \nbenefits of this important brownfields legislation. In several States, \nincluding my State of Florida, there are a number of sites that were \ncontaminated in the early to mid-1900's by chemicals used for tick-\nprevention measures required by the United States Department of \nAgriculture. So-called cattle dipping vats were used to eliminate ticks \nthat threatened our Nation's cattle. It is my understanding that these \nsites would be eligible for the benefits of this important brownfields \nlegislation. Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator from Florida that sites \ncontaminated by the historic practice of dipping cattle to eliminate \nticks are eligible for benefits under this bill, so long as any \nparticular site meets the definitions and conditions in the bill.\n  Under the bill funding is available for assessment and cleanup of \n``brownfield sites,'' which are ``real property, the expansion, \nredevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or \npotential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or \ncontaminant.'' It is my understanding that the sites the Senator \ndescribes would meet this portion of the definition of eligible \nbrownfield sites under the bill.\n  The bill goes on to exclude certain categories of sites, such as \nthose that are listed or proposed for listing on the Superfund National \nPriorities List, and those that are subject to orders or cleanup \nrequirements under other Federal environmental laws. So long as the \nsites the Senator refers to are not within any of the exclusions they \nwould be eligible.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I can appreciate the concerns raised by \nthe Senator from Florida. I agree with Senator Reid that sites \ncontaminated as a result of former cattle dipping practices and which \nmeet the definitions and conditions for sites to obtain funding and \nliability relief under this bill will be eligible for the benefits of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the chairman and ranking Democratic member for \nthat clarification. I believe that since the federal government \nrequired these dipping vats to be constructed, the individuals who \ncomplied with that federal requirement should be excluded from all \nliability under Superfund. However, I also believe that the brownfields \nlegislation we are considering today is a critical step forward in our \nability to clean-up sites around the country. I look forward to working \nwith both of you and our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to take additional steps forward in the months to come.\n\n\n                 alaska native corporations eligibility\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Environment and Public Works Committee for developing a \nbill that has secured enormous bipartisan support in this Congress. \nThis is an important program for many states.\n  I have considered cosponsoring the measure. However I withhold \nsponsorship at this time because there is a problem relative to which \nnative entities in Alaska are eligible for such funding.\n  Alaska native corporations have no government powers but manage, as \nprivate landowners, twelve percent of our state.\n  The federal government has recognized 229 tribes in Alaska most of \nwhich do not have governmental power over land.\n  The bill is ambiguous as to whether Alaska native corporations, are \neligible entities as ``Indian Tribes.''\n  I have not raised this with the committee, but do request assurance \nthat the conference will address this matter.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would like to work with the Senator on \nthat issue.\n\n\n                   EDA and HUD developmental funding\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleagues, \nSenators Jeffords, Reid, and Smith from New Hampshire in a colloquy on \nthe Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of \n2001, S. 350. I am a co-sponsor and strong supporter of this \nbrownfields revitalization bill. I commend Senators Smith, Reid, Chafee \nand Boxer for their hard work on crafting bipartisan brownfields \nlegislation which will help communities return these former commercial \nand industrial properties back to productive use. The financial \nincentives and statutory reforms provided in S. 350 will dramatically \nimprove our communities' efforts to redevelop brownfields.\n  As cochairmen of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, Senator Jeffords \nand I will introduce bills to complement S. 350 by providing \ncommunities with economic resources to redevelop brownfield sites. Our \nfirst proposal would expand efforts of the Department of Commerce's \nEconomic Development Administration, or EDA, to assist distressed \ncommunities. The bill will provide EDA with a dedicated source of \nfunding for brownfields redevelopment and increased funding flexibility \nto help States, local communities and nonprofit organizations restore \nthese sites to productive use. Our second proposal would permit the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to make brownfields \neconomic development initiative grants independent of economic \ndevelopment loan guarantees, and set-aside a portion of the funding for \nsmaller communities. I hope that Senators Smith and Reid will work with \nus to get our proposed legislation enacted.\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n  These proposals would be very complementary to S. 350. Economic \ndevelopment funding through EDA and HUD along with the financial \nresources and liability clarifications contained in S. 350 would \nprovide communities with the help they need to return brownfields to \nproductive uses. Together, our proposals and S. 350, would provide \ncommunities with the financial assistance needed to leverage private \ninvestment in brownfields and accelerate reuse.\n  A number of national economic development organizations support this \nproposal, including the US Conference of Mayors, National League of \nCities, National Association of Counties, National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, National Association of Regional Councils, \nNational Association of Towns and Townships, Enterprise Foundation, \nNational Congress for Community Economic Development, Smart Growth \nAmerica, Council for Urban Economic Development, National Association \nof Installation Developers, and the National Business Incubator \nAssociation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President I join my colleague, Mr. Levin, in \ncommending Senators Smith of New Hampshire, Chafee, Reid, and Boxer for \ntheir efforts to promote brownfield revitalization. I am a co-sponsor \nand strong supporter of S. 350, and believe this legislation is long \noverdue.\n  Senator Levin and I have been working on complementary legislation. \nThe proposal would provide the Economic Development Administration \n(EDA) with a formal channel of funding to help communities turn \nbrownfields environmental liabilities into economic assets. This \nlegislation would provide targeted assistance to projects that \nredevelop brownfields. EDA funding for brownfields will help \ncommunities get the financial assistance needed to leverage private \ninvestment in brownfields. With over 450,000 brownfields sites \nnationwide, it is imperative that the federal government assist local \ncleanup efforts that in turn will stimulate economic revitalization.\n  The second legislative proposal addresses requirements on the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative (BEDI) grant program that are hampering \nsmall city brownfields revitalization efforts. BEDI's required link to \nSection 108 serves as a deterrent to many small towns in Vermont and \nthroughout the nation, who do not have the resources to commit to \nbrownfields. Our bill would permit HUD to make grants available \nindependent of economic development loan guarantees.\n  I am very hopeful that the Chairman and Ranking Member of Committee \non Environment and Public Works will work with us to advance this \nimportant legislative initiatives.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, and my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for \ntheir strong support of S. 350 and commend them for their efforts to \nprovide communities with economic development resources to redevelop \nbrownfields. I commit to my colleagues, Mr. Levin and Mr. Jeffords, \nthat I will work with Senator Smith to have a hearing on their Economic \nDevelopment Administration brownfield proposal. I look forward to \nworking with them to explore options to further address the reuse of \nbrownfields and look forward to working with them to protect our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank Mr. Jeffords and Mr. Levin for \ntheir support and co-sponsorship of S. 350. I appreciate their efforts \nto craft legislation complementary to S. 350. As such, I will look \nclosely at their proposals and work with them to further advance the \nissue of brownfield redevelopment.\n\n\n                             Indian Tribes\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I believe that this \nis a good piece of legislation that will promote the cleanup and reuse \nof business and industrial sites that now stand essentially abandoned. \nI would just like to clarify one point. I note that throughout much of \nthe Bill any reference to `States' is accompanied by a reference to \n`Indian Tribes'. However, this is not the case in section \n129(b)(1)(B)(ii), as added by section 301 of the Bill, regarding \nfederal enforcement actions in the event of contamination migrating \nacross a State line. Could the Senator confirm that it is the intention \nof the legislation that references in that section to `States' should \nextend to `Indian Tribes'?\n  Mr. REID. Yes Senator, that is the intention.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. \nHutchinson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the subject of \neducation, a subject about which we have been hearing a good deal in \nthe past several months.\n  I commend President Bush for putting forth a credible plan for \neducation improvement. The Bush Administration has worked with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to craft a policy compromise \nwhich will go along way to securing that all children have access to \nquality education. I also commend the distinguished Chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP, Committee for his tireless \nwork on this issue. As former chairman of the then Labor Committee, I \nknow my friend from Vermont has a job roughly akin to herding cats.\n  I also appreciate the Majority Leader's diligence and persistence in \ncontinuing to bring this measure up for Senate consideration and his \nefforts at brokering a compromise.\n  President Bush has made it a priority to ensure that State and local \neducation agencies have the discretion to make key decisions on how \neducation dollars are spent. I support the President's approach. I have \noften said that we should not be second guessing on a federal level the \nability of State and local school boards, educators and parents to \ndirect the education of students.\n  President Bush has made it a priority to link a reduction in the \nridiculous amount of red-tape that State and local education agencies \nface with real accountability measures.\n  Paperwork reduction is a decidedly pro-teacher priority, 80 percent \nof our nation's educators say that paperwork is their number one \nheadache. Teachers just want to teach, not fill out forms or go to \nmeetings required by federal regulations.\n  The President has made yearly testing a priority and I commend him \nfor that. In my State of Utah, we have already begun implementing an \nannual test. The Utah Performance Assessment System for Students, U-\nPASS, requires a statewide criterion referenced test for all students, \ngrades 1st through 12th in reading, language arts, and math. I am proud \nthat, once again, Utah educators are ahead of the curve when it comes \nto education innovation and reform.\n  I sincerely hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill not stall, delay or prevent the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, or as it is now called, BEST, the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act. We really need to pass this \nbill and set the country on a path toward meaningful education \nprogress.\n  The need for reform is great. A recent report from the National \nCenter for Education Statistics, NAEP, concluded that reading scores \nfor 4th and 12th graders failed to improve over their 1992 levels. This \nstudy also concluded that 58 percent of disadvantaged children in 4th \ngrade scored at the ``below basic'' level.\n  There also is an alarming disparity in skills between white students \nand African American students. According to the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, achievement gaps between white and African-\nAmerican 9-year-old students have not narrowed since 1975. The score \ngap in reading narrowed to its lowest, 18 points in 1988, and has since \nwidened to 29 points in 1999. For 17-year-old students, the gap in \nreading was also its lowest in 1988, 20 points and has since widened to \n31 points in 1999.\n  Clearly, the challenge is before us. And yes, we can do better.\n  Many local school districts are struggling. They are struggling with \nclass sizes that are too large and school buildings that are too small \nor dysfunctional. They are struggling to provide books, materials, and \nequipment that are appropriate for the 21st century.\n  They are struggling with resources, so they can pay their teachers \nbetter, increase professional development for educators, and provide \nessential music, art and sports opportunities for students as well. \nThey are struggling with transportation needs, especially in many rural \nUtah communities where children can be bused as many as 100 miles \nround-trip a day.\n  There is not a Senator in this body who doesn't want to help solve \nthese problems. Certainly, I have been a long-time advocate of federal \nsupport for education, and I will continue to make that a top priority.\n  I honestly believe that colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nsincerely and with good intentions want children to attend clean, safe \nschools with state of the art technology and teachers who are \nappreciated and well paid in reasonably sized classrooms and up-to-date \ntextbooks.\n  Sometimes, when the rhetoric gets too hot around these deeply felt \nissues, I think it would behoove us all to remember that no one gets \nelected to serve as an anti-education Senator.\n  So, if we are all pro-education then why the debate? Because, of \ncourse, while we all agree on the merits of reform and we all want \neducation progress, we disagree on the means to achieve this goal. We \ncannot afford to tie this bill up in partisan gridlock over a debate on \nhow much funding to provide. Where there is a will, there is a way, and \nwe simply have to find that way or we will be letting the American \npublic down.\n  While there are good intentions on all sides, some of my colleagues \nhonestly feel that education policy is best met at the federal level \nand that the answer to every education challenge is a new federal \nprogram. Others of us have markedly differing views.\n  I sincerely believe that State and local officials in Utah's 40 \nschool districts and 763 public schools are the best ones to decide \nwhether or not to target federal money on school construction, \ntechnology improvements, hiring new teachers, or anything else.\n  I trust the people of Utah to make these decisions. And, I believe \nUtahns are perfectly capable of debating these issues locally and \nchoosing a course.\n  I have repeatedly said that Utah does more with less than any State \nin the nation. Utah is a worst case scenario when it comes to school \nfinance, yet we consistently rank highly on student performance \nmeasures. We must be doing something right!\n  Actually, I think we are doing a lot that is right, and one of the \nthings that Utah parents do right is spend a lot of time with their \nchildren. An integral part of Utah's way of life involves family-\ncentered activities. This clearly has spill-over benefits for schools.\n  Utah can claim some well-deserved bragging rights. For example:\n  Utah is first in the nation in both advanced placement participation \nand performance on a per capita basis.\n  Utah's dropout rates are substantially lower than the nation's as a \nwhole.\n  In the Statewide Testing Program, the performance of Utah students on \nthe Stanford Achievement Test exceeds national performance in \nmathematics, reading, science reasoning, and the composite score.\n  Since 1984, Utah high school graduates have taken increasingly more \nrigorous programs of study with substantial increases in such areas as \nmathematics and foreign language.\n  Utah is second in the nation in the percentage of its adult \npopulation holding a high school diploma.\n  Utah has made a number of important commitments to advancing \ntechnology in education.\n  Utah provides incentives for school districts to acquire technology \ninfrastructure.\n  Utah installs Internet connections at every school and pays most of \nthe line charges.\n  Utah has launched a number of professional development efforts.\n  Utah provides in-service training opportunities and requires pre-\nservice teachers to complete a technology course as part of their \npreparation program.\n  Utah parents are educated and informed and take an active role in \neducating their children. I firmly believe that this is one of the \nreasons why Utah students perform so well.\n  But, what we need in my State is not a federal superintendent looking \nover the shoulder of our State-elected or locally elected school \nboards. We need additional resources, plain and simple. But, resources \nwith so many strings attached bog us down. Give us the flexibility to \nmanage these resources and apply them to the areas of greatest need in \nour State. Measure our children's educational progress. We will meet \nthe challenge.\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\n  I look forward to a challenging and informative debate. It is my \nsincere hope that we will be successful in crafting legislation which \nwill genuinely put children first. Children are America's greatest \nasset, and our future depends on their educational excellence. We must \nensure that no child is left behind. We must ensure that the \nachievement gap is closed between disadvantaged children and their \npeers. We must ensure that every child in this country is prepared for \nthe challenges and opportunities that await them in the years to come. \nFor it we fail, we have failed not only ourselves, but future \ngenerations.\n  I am confident we are up to the task.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3914-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I am committed to focusing a \nspotlight on the good work of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nin the area of long-term care. VA has hidden its light under a barrel \nfor too long.\n  The federally funded VA health care system, out of necessity, has \ndeveloped some of the most innovative ways to care for older people. \nThe necessity arises because approximately 34 percent of the total \nveteran population is 65 years or older, compared with approximately 13 \npercent of the general population. And by the year 2010, 42 percent of \nthe veteran population will be 65 years or older.\n  As a result of this demand, VA has led the nation in developing adult \nday health care programs, standardized clinical treatment protocols and \nspecialized units for Alzheimer's patients, home-based services, and \nrespite care. Our older veterans are leading richer lives because of \nthese innovations.\n  Today, I wish to highlight the Alzheimer's unit at the Salem VA \nhospital, which has received extraordinary praise from the son of a \nveteran who was treated there for Alzheimer's.\n  I know firsthand how difficult it is to care for a loved one \nafflicted by Alzheimer's. The special needs of Alzheimer's patients are \nall too frequently misunderstood and therefore go unmet. It seems, \nhowever, that the VA is up to the challenge. The family members of this \nparticular veteran found the care at the VA hospital to be first-rate, \nhumane and loving. By all accounts, the veteran suffering from \nAlzheimer's was well cared for up until the very end.\n  To quote from the article, ``His daily needs were met by the staff \nless from obligation or duty than from true, honest caring. His aimless \nwandering was confined behind secured doors, without restraints, thank \ngoodness. Dad's sleepless nights and constant babbling were `normal' \nthere. The staff was unshaken by any of his peculiar behavior.''\n  The Salem VA Alzheimer's unit is not one of a kind, thankfully. \nApproximately 56 VA hospitals have specialized programs for the care of \nveterans with dementia. These programs include inpatient and outpatient \ndementia diagnostic programs, behavior management programs, adapted \nwork therapy programs for patients with early to mid-stage dementia, \nAlzheimer's special care units within VA nursing homes (like Salem's) \nand transitional care units, and model inpatient palliative care \nprograms for patients with late stage dementia. There are also various \nprograms for family caregivers.\n  While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over \nthe past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share \nits learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development \nbeyond that which met the current needs at the time. For VA's expertise \nto be of greatest use to others, it needs both to better capture what \nit has done and to develop new learning that would be most applicable \nto other health care entities.\n  Those who would benefit by capitalizing on VA's long-term care \nexpertise are the health organizations, including academic medicine and \nresearch entities, with which VA is now connected, and the rest of the \nU.S. health care system. Ultimately, this expertise can benefit all \nAmericans who will need some form of long-term care services.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am \nenormously proud of VA's efforts in end-of-life care. However, I have \nalways been dismayed that my colleagues here in the Senate remain for \nthe most part unaware of VA's good work in this area. Those of us in \nthe health policy arena should sit up and take notice. We simply must \nstay ahead of the curve and explore the various ways to provide such \ncare, so all Americans will have the best choices available to them at \nthe time they need them.\n  I ask consent that a Roanoke Times article on VA Alzheimer's care by \nWayne Slusher, son of a veteran cared for at the Salem VA hospital, be \nprinted in the Record along with a press release on VA's newest end-of-\nlife care program, a fellowship in palliative care.\n  The material follows:\n\n              [From the Roanoke (VA) Times, Apr. 1, 2001]\n\n Succumbing to Alzheimer's--In the Hands of the VA, a Declining Father \n                            Got Genuine Care\n\n                           (By Wayne Slusher)\n\n       It started out seemingly innocent enough. Wrong turns on \n     familiar roads, daily tasks forgotten and numerous other \n     little things not so significant as to send up red flags, but \n     still enough that it registered in the back of the mind that \n     something was not quite right.\n       In the years following, it got worse. Faucets left on, \n     asking for dinner an hour after leaving the table, inability \n     to use the phone, failing to recognize home, and on and on. \n     It had happened,\n       ``If anything ever happens to me,'' my father would say \n     time and time again, ``you take me to the VA.'' It was a \n     frequent topic, since Dad was a deacon in his church and \n     spent a great deal of time visiting with the sick and the \n     elderly members in the community.\n       You spend your whole life hearing it, but reject the idea \n     that you'll actually have to act on it, much less take him to \n     the Veterans Affairs Medical Center so far from his home. \n     Even well-intentioned friends asked, ``Why the VA?''\n       But then, it had happened, and we decided that going to the \n     VA for help was what he had always wanted. There was \n     something so intrinsically important about honoring his wish, \n     especially when he was at a point of mental incapacity such \n     that he could no longer contribute to decision-making even \n     about himself.\n       So, in the middle of the night, we took him to the \n     emergency room. As we sat in the waiting room, Dad thought he \n     was in a train station on his way to visit old Army buddies, \n     and he was deliriously happy. Instead, the visit was with a \n     doctor who quickly determined that admission to the hospital \n     was warranted.\n       We doubt Dad ever fully understood what transpired that \n     evening. Leaving him there was one of the most difficult \n     tasks any of us had ever had to do.\n       That would be the beginning of our relationship with the VA \n     and, in particular, the staff providing services for those \n     with various levels of dementia.\n       Right away, we learned that the building to which he was \n     assigned was filled not only with people just like himself, \n     but also employed a staff of extremely skilled health-care \n     professionals who began the difficult job of taking care of \n     my father.\n       His daily needs were not met by the staff less from \n     obligation or duty than from true, honest caring. His aimless \n     wandering was confined behind secured doors--without \n     restraints, thank goodness. Dad's sleepless nights and \n     constant babbling were ``normal'' there. The staff was \n     unshaken by any of his peculiar behaviors. The specially \n     designed area provided as much of a homelike atmosphere as \n     possible, with bright colors, hanging plants and murals on \n     walls. The unit was always clean, always tidy.\n       The initial few weeks were full of all sorts of cognitive \n     tests, blood tests and scans. As the results of each test \n     came in, they ruled out, one by one, any chemical imbalances \n     or other underlying culprit that might bring on his state of \n     confusion. If there was a remote\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\n     possibility, it was tested for. Indeed, the unthinkable had \n     happened. Only now it had an official name: Alzheimer's.\n       In the months that followed, we watched the VA staff do \n     everything it could for Dad: bathing, dressing, feeding, \n     changing and hundreds of other daily tasks. Different \n     medications were tried, and in different combinations and at \n     different dosages, but his dementia had a mind of its own, \n     for lack of a better term. What had worked yesterday didn't \n     work today.\n       Each visit, Dad would be brought out to the visitation \n     area--a bright, sunny room with lots of plants, park benches \n     and a garden scene painted on the walls by the gifted wife of \n     another patient. The staff was always as glad to see us as we \n     were to see them, and it was during those months that we \n     began to realize that Dad, for all those years, had been \n     absolutely right about where he needed to be if it ever \n     happened.\n       The doctors, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, \n     occupational therapists, dieticians and others associated \n     with dementia services became more like family. It was \n     medicine administered in equal portions from the head and \n     from the heart. As Dad's mental state skidded deeper into a \n     quagmire, not one member of the staff ever complained. They \n     looked out for us just as much as they looked after my \n     father. When it appeared at one point that he might be stable \n     enough to consider releasing him to a long-term-care \n     facility, we were dismayed to think he might not receive the \n     same level of care he'd been getting at the VA. These folks \n     had come to know my father's needs, and we trusted them fully \n     with his care.\n       But the stability was short-lived and all too soon \n     interrupted by more difficulties. In particular, he's lost \n     his ability to swallow. In those last days and hours, he was \n     made as comfortable as possible. Even into the wee hours of \n     that final morning, the staff kept almost as constant a vigil \n     by his side as did the family.\n       The VA, we found, is full of immensely compassionate, \n     caring professionals who could not have done more for my \n     father. We think, too, perhaps they do not get recognition \n     and praise from the community as often as they should.\n       With my father's personal nightmare over, the staff at the \n     VA continues to care for others just as they cared for him. \n     They deal daily with patients who have long forgotten how to \n     say thank you. The staff never really knew my ``real'' \n     father, a man who would have been so humbled and grateful for \n     their help. We hope we said thank you enough on his behalf. \n     We will never forget their kindness.\n                                  ____\n\n     Department of Veterans Affairs,\n     Office of Public Affairs Media Relations,\n     News Release, April 20, 2001.\n\n              VA Sponsors New Program for End-of-Life Care\n\n       Washington.--Dying is never easy--not for an individual, \n     not for a family, not for the medical staff who administer \n     the care. But the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is \n     taking new steps to ease the process for everyone.\n       An initiative, called ``VA Interprofessional Fellowship \n     Program in Palliative Care,'' will develop health-care \n     professionals with vision, knowledge and compassion to lead \n     end-of-life care into the 21st century. Although aimed at \n     improving care for veterans, the program will affect how this \n     care--known as ``palliative care'' in medical circles--is \n     provided throughout the country.\n       ``As VA serves an increasingly higher percentage of older \n     and chronically ill veterans, the need for end-of-life care \n     similarly increases,'' said Dr. Stephanie H. Pincus, VA chief \n     officer for Academic Affiliations, a program that educates \n     more than 90,000 physicians, medical students, and associated \n     health professionals each year. ``This interdisciplinary \n     fellowship will jump-start palliative care as an important \n     field in health care. It will change the way physicians, \n     social workers, nurses and other caregivers approach patients \n     at an extremely difficult time in their lives.''\n       Historically, VA has taken a leadership role in the \n     promotion and development of hospice care and, more recently, \n     in a national pain management initiative. In 1998, VA's \n     Office of Academic Affiliations addressed the need for \n     clinicians trained in end-of-life care and was awarded a \n     $985,000 grant by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to \n     support further education. On March 1, 2001, the palliative \n     care fellowship program was announced and will involve up to \n     six sites, with four one-year fellowships provided at each \n     site.\n       ``The training changes the focus of health-care providers \n     who are treating the terminally ill,'' said Pincus. ``In the \n     past, doctors saw death as a failure, so they consequently \n     focused on medical cures and preventing death at any cost. We \n     are training medical care staff now to concentrate on symptom \n     management rather than disease management.''\n       Pincus further explained that the new fellowship program \n     has a large educational component. Trained clinicians are \n     expected to serve as leaders promoting development and \n     research. Selected training sites will be required to develop \n     and implement an ``Education Dissemination Project'' to \n     spread information beyond the training site through \n     conferences, curricula for training programs, patient \n     education materials and clinical demonstration projects.\n       And, of course, as resident doctors go out into the \n     community, they take their training with them. More than 130 \n     VA facilities have affiliations with 107 medical schools and \n     1,200 other schools across the country. More than half the \n     physicians practicing in the United States have received part \n     of their professional education in the VA health care system.\n       ``This is an important step for health-care providers. But \n     what does this mean to the chronically ill veteran?'' said \n     Pincus. ``It means that he will be more comfortable. It means \n     he might not have to die in ICU but instead be able to remain \n     in the secure surroundings of his home. It means he will be \n     treated by a caring, trained partnership of doctors, nurses, \n     chaplains and social workers. It means his family will be \n     included in decision-making and care giving.\n       ``There comes a time when all the modern medicine in the \n     world can't cure the illness. That's when treating the pain, \n     communicating with compassion and providing support and \n     counseling become paramount. And that's what these \n     fellowships are all about,'' said Pincus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3915-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3915-S3917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 50TH ANNIVERSARY MEMORIAL SERVICE OF THE 442ND REGIMENTAL COMBAT TEAM\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on March 25, 2001, I returned to my home \nState of Hawaii to attend the 50th Anniversary Memorial Service of the \n442nd Regimental Combat Team at the National Memorial Cemetery of the \nPacific. The memorial address was presented by Mr. H. David Burge, \nDirector of the Spark M. Matsunaga Veterans Affairs Medical & Regional \nOffice Center in Honolulu.\n  I was moved and impressed by his remarks, and I wish to share them \nwith the American people. I ask that Mr. Burge's address be part of the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       I am very honored to be the first speaker in the 21st \n     century at the 442nd Veterans Club's 58th Anniversary \n     Memorial Service here at the National Memorial Cemetery of \n     the Pacific.\n       This morning is time to remember and pay special tribute to \n     boyhood friends and classmates lost in battle, dear friends \n     and loved ones no longer with us, and cherished members of \n     the 442nd who continue to serve as good family and community \n     elders and leaders. As we enter the new millennium, this is a \n     time for members, families, and friends of the 442nd to \n     reflect on the past, to celebrate the present, and to \n     contemplate the future.\n       Our men of the 442nd are testament to the joys, heartache, \n     and major accomplishments of the 20th century both here in \n     Hawaii and the Nation. To reflect on the past, let's roll the \n     clock back to the 1940s and see that period through snapshots \n     familiar to many of you.\n       In 1940, the U.S. Government felt that war with Japan was \n     imminent. As such, Japanese Americans were released and \n     banned from employment at Pearl Harbor and other military \n     bases in Hawaii without explanation or justification. Despite \n     these early warning signs, Japanese Americans in Hawaii did \n     not feel an acute sense of crisis. While Japanese American \n     bashing was increasing on the mainland, most people in Hawaii \n     where all groups were minorities had no animosity towards \n     their Japanese neighbors.\n       My mother's 1941 McKinley High School Black and Gold \n     Yearbook, published six months before the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, provides a glimpse into the daily activities, \n     beliefs, and values of young Nisei in Hawaii prior to the \n     outbreak of World War II. In this regard, let me share with \n     you the introduction section of the yearbook:\n       In 1941, we find our sports-minded typical McKinley boy \n     standing five feet, six inches in height weighing 124 pounds \n     with naturally straight hair and brown eyes. The typical \n     McKinley girl is a petite lassie, five ft., one inch in \n     height, weighing a dainty 97 pounds, has black hair and is \n     brown-eyed. Both are Americans of Japanese ancestry.\n       Their trim figures and fresh complexions are accounted for \n     by their nine hours of sleep each night and their daily glass \n     of milk. Typical boy usually buys his lunch outside the \n     school. Not so typical girl. She knows the importance of a \n     healthy meal and depends on the school cafeteria for it.\n       The typical boy looks forward to weekend social activities. \n     He considers school dances tops and goes to as many of the \n     class, student body, and club dances as he possibly can, but \n     give jitter-bugging and waltzing only slight nod. He usually \n     goes stag to dances because of the small size of his \n     pocketbook. His favorite recreations are football, listening \n     to the radio, and going to movies with his friends.''\n       In general, the description of the typical Nisei student at \n     McKinley could have been a description of a typical student \n     at any American high school at that time. This is not \n     surprising since these high school students truly believed \n     that they were Americans and acted accordingly.\n       The Nisei students were heavily influenced by the McKinley \n     faculty almost entirely from the mainland with a heavy \n     concentration from the midwest. Their principal, Dr. Miles \n     Carey, indicated that his primary objective was in his words, \n     ``helping our young people to develop those attitudes, \n     dispositions, and abilities which we call the democratic way \n     of living together.''\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n       The results of a student survey included in the yearbook \n     reflected how strongly these young students embraced these \n     democratic beliefs. Moved by the growing crisis in Europe, \n     the Nisei students believed that the honor of the United \n     States should always be defended, even if it meant going to \n     war. They believed that common people should have more say in \n     the government. They also believed that all races were \n     mentally equal. It was also noteworthy that the Nisei \n     students firmly believed that the Hawaiian Islands would \n     be more efficiently run when they attained voting age.\n       My final observation in reviewing the yearbook was the \n     dedication page. It underscored the foundation for the Nisei \n     student's core values. It read, ``Respectfully dedicated to \n     our parents and the excellent home influence given us.''\n       Six months after publication of that yearbook, on the \n     morning of December 7, 1941, the lives of these young Nisei \n     were forever changed as they became part of one of America's \n     most dramatic stories--a story of shameful treatment by our \n     government, a story of heroic feats on the battlefield, a \n     story of major accomplishments in business and government \n     after the war, and finally a story of full vindication and \n     pride for all Americans of Japanese ancestry.\n       Just prior to the enemy attack on Hawaii, Washington \n     emphasized the danger of sabotage by the local Japanese \n     population to local military commanders. Follow on actions to \n     cluster aircraft in the middle of airfield to guard against \n     such local sabotage resulted in easy targets for attacking \n     enemy aircraft and needless destruction of most American \n     aircraft on the ground at Hickam, Wheeler, Bellows and Ford \n     Island.\n       After the attack, Hawaii Territorial Governor Poindexter \n     told President Roosevelt that what he feared most was \n     sabotage by the large Japanese community. Subsequently, 1,000 \n     innocent Japanese Americans--Buddhist priests, language \n     school teachers, civic and business leaders, fishermen, and \n     judo instructors--were arrested and detained in tents on Sand \n     Island. A number of these individuals and their families, \n     without any proof and without any due process, were \n     subsequently transported to prisoner of war camps on the \n     mainland.\n       Secretary of Navy Frank Knox who visited Hawaii the week \n     following the attack reported to the President and Congress \n     that the devastation at Pearl Harbor was the most effective \n     fifth column work that had come out of any war in history. \n     His sensational and totally unfounded assessment that \n     Japanese Americans in Hawaii had aided the enemy attack hit \n     the headlines in newspapers across America, and significantly \n     fueled anti-Japanese American sentiment. The follow on rumors \n     of sabotage and espionage emanating from Hawaii, although \n     untrue, were used by West Coast groups to demand and justify \n     the wholesale internment of Japanese American families living \n     in California, Oregon, and Washington into concentration \n     camps in remote areas far from their homes.\n       Immediately after the attack, at a time that Hawaii was \n     still very vulnerable to another raid and possible occupation \n     by enemy forces, 317 Japanese American members of the Hawaii \n     Territorial Guard were involuntarily discharged without any \n     explanation. In addition, 2,000 Japanese American soldiers \n     already on active duty were recalled to Schofield Army \n     Barracks, stripped of their weapons, and separated from their \n     non-Japanese buddies and under orders from Washington, they \n     were shipped to the interior of the mainland for security \n     reasons. Finally, Japanese Americans were declared ineligible \n     for military service and classified as enemy aliens. All of \n     these unthinkable actions occurred at a time that every able-\n     bodied man was needed to defend Hawaii.\n       The ultimate act of wartime hysteria in Hawaii occurred in \n     February 1942 when President Roosevelt ordered the evacuation \n     and internment of all Japanese Americans in Hawaii in \n     concentration camps on the mainland. Fortunately, the \n     military was unable to carry out the President's order since \n     there were not enough ships to conduct such a massive \n     evacuation and the evacuation of such a large number of \n     workers would have crippled the islands. As such, the \n     evacuation orders were delayed several times and finally \n     abandoned in 1943.\n       Could any of us today who did not experience this war time \n     hysteria truly understand and appreciate the impact of these \n     outrageous actions on Japanese American families, especially \n     young Nisei family members? Hawaii's Nisei truly believed \n     they were Americans. They were equally offended by the \n     vicious attack on their homeland and equally ready to serve \n     their country. As just teenagers the rejection and hostility \n     vented towards them and their families by their own \n     government were beyond comprehension.\n       But perhaps unconsciously they responded in a very Japanese \n     way by doing the only thing they could under such extreme \n     circumstances that is stepping forward. Stepping forward with \n     loyalty and courage in order to honor their families and to \n     demonstrate to their fellow countrymen that they were worthy \n     Americans. While there was more than sufficient justification \n     for turning inward and refusing to support the government \n     that had treated them so brutally and unfairly, Nisei young \n     men demanded the right to fight.\n       As we know today, the Nisei achieved their objective but at \n     a very high price. The 100th Infantry Battalion led the way \n     and after nine long months of bitter fighting from Salerno to \n     Anzio was joined in Rome by the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. \n     Thereafter the two Japanese American units remained as one \n     through the bloody fighting in northern Italy and France to \n     the end of the war.\n       Bill Mauldin, the Stars and Stripes cartoonist who created \n     the beloved infantry characters Willie and Joe, described the \n     Nisei unit as follows:\n       ``No combat unit in the army could exceed the Japanese \n     Americans in loyalty, hard work, courage and sacrifice. \n     Hardly a man of them hadn't been decorated at least twice, \n     and their casualty lists were appalling. When they were in \n     the line, they worked harder than anybody else. As far as the \n     army was concerned, the Nisei could do no wrong. We were \n     proud to be wearing the same uniform.''\n       This morning we gather to remember and honor the typical \n     McKinley boy and other young Nisei who fell on the \n     battlefields in Europe. They were good and brave Americans. \n     They brought honor to their families and great pride to all \n     citizens of Hawaii. It is unfortunate that these young men \n     did not live to see the full measure of their ultimate \n     sacrifices.\n       The insignia of the 442nd is the Statue of Liberty hand \n     holding the torch of freedom. This symbol is most appropriate \n     because it exemplifies the unit's steadfast belief in not \n     only freedom for all men but also through their actions and \n     sacrifices on the battlefield final freedom for Japanese \n     Americans in the form of real acceptance by their fellow \n     countrymen.\n       When President Truman welcomed home the 100th and 442nd, he \n     said to them, ``You are on the way home. You fought not only \n     the enemy, but you fought prejudice and you have won. Keep up \n     that fight and we will continue to win, to make this great \n     Republic stand for just what the Constitution says it stands \n     for: the welfare of all the people all the time.''\n       Perhaps President Truman did not fully realize the extent \n     to which the Nisei veterans would take to heart his challenge \n     to keep up the fight to ensure the welfare of all the people \n     all of the time. Although the war abroad was won, Nisei \n     veterans continued to forge ahead on the home front after the \n     war to ensure that their sacrifices in battle were not made \n     in vain. As many can attest today much hard work was needed \n     at the end of the war to accomplish President Truman's goal.\n       The enormity of the task at hand was reflected in comments \n     made at that time by the U.S. Speaker of the House, Sam \n     Rayburn. In voicing his opposition to statehood for Hawaii he \n     said, ``If we give them Statehood they'll send a delegation \n     of Japs here.''\n       This inflammatory statement was made by the powerful \n     Speaker from Texas whose Texas Lost Battalion was rescued two \n     years earlier in Europe by Nisei soldiers at a cost 800 Nisei \n     casualties to rescue 200 Texans. Unfortunately, much work \n     still remained to be accomplished at home, but the Nisei \n     veterans, as previously demonstrated in battle, were \n     undaunted in their quest and pressed on with unrelenting \n     effort.\n       These veterans were firm in the conviction they expressed \n     in that 1941 McKinley High School survey that the Nisei \n     generation would, in fact, make positive improvements in \n     Hawaii and our nation. More than a half-century later, we \n     know that our Nisei veterans were more than up to the task \n     and, as such, we have much to celebrate today.\n       Today a Sansei from Kauai, Eric Shinseki, serves as Chief \n     of Staff of the United States Army. This general of all \n     generals often relates stories of personal inspiration based \n     on the experiences of his Nisei family members who served in \n     World War II the same Nisei soldiers from Hawaii who were \n     once designated enemy aliens and denied the opportunity to \n     fight for their country.\n       Today 22 Nisei World War II veterans are Congressional \n     Medal of Honor recipients. I was honored to attend the \n     ceremonies last year in Washington and to witness the awards \n     made by President Clinton. At the White House ceremony, the \n     President attributed the lack of proper and timely \n     recognition for these individuals to three factors: war-time \n     hysteria, racial discrimination, and a complete breakdown in \n     national leadership. The President went on the praise all \n     Japanese Americans who served in World War II despite the \n     error of our nation in questioning their loyalty and \n     wrongfully interning their families.\n       Today we have the names of our new Nisei Medal of Honor \n     recipients forever etched in stone in the Hall of Heroes at \n     the Pentagon. In viewing the new inscriptions, I was moved to \n     see these names added along side the names of other American \n     heroes from every war in our nation's history. I was also \n     proud to see great sounding American names on the wall--\n     Hajiro, Hayashi, Inouye, Kuroda, Muranaga, Nakae, Nakamura, \n     Nishimoto, Okubo, Okutsu, Ono, Otani, Sakato, and Tanouye.\n       Today, a Nisei is the first and only Asian American to \n     serve as a Cabinet member. Norman Mineta, who served as \n     Secretary of Commerce for President Clinton and continues to \n     serve today as Secretary of Transportation for President \n     Bush, was a youngster in California when his family was sent \n     to an American concentration camp. He vividly recollects how \n     the military police took away his favorite baseball bat \n     because they viewed it as a weapon.\n       Today, a brand new National Japanese American Memorial \n     proudly stands on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The \n     Memorial,\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\n     the first and only memorial dedicated to any ethnic group in \n     our Nation's capitol, is dedicated to Japanese American \n     immigrants who valiantly fought for and attained their \n     full rights as citizens.\n       When I attended the dedication ceremony for the new \n     Memorial last fall, I was overwhelmed by the great honor \n     finally bestowed upon Japanese Americans by our great nation. \n     Think about it for a moment--America is a country of \n     immigrants--many waves of immigrants. And today, there is \n     only one memorial to honor any of these immigrants in the \n     shadow of our nation's Capitol--that is the Japanese American \n     Memorial.\n       And finally today, a brand new, state-of-art veteran's \n     medical center, named after the late Senator Spark M. \n     Matsunaga, now proudly serves all our veterans here in \n     Hawaii.\n       So today, I say to our Nisei veterans you have brought \n     great pride to your families as well as pride in their \n     heritage for future generations of Japanese Americans. More \n     importantly, you have ensured that your friends, who were \n     lost in battle, did not die in vain.\n       So at this juncture, where are our Nisei veterans headed \n     next? Are they declaring victory and passing the 442nd's \n     Statue of Liberty torch on to others?\n       While such action would certainly be justified, it would \n     not reflect the values ingrained into many Nisei by their \n     progressive high school teachers who exposed them to the \n     ideals of justice and equality and urged them to continually \n     reach out to others.\n       It is said that McKinley Principal Miles Carey got people \n     to do what he wanted because he treated them humanely and \n     considerately. If there was any fault with Dr. Carey, and \n     maybe it was not a fault, he was dreamer. But all of this was \n     due to his efforts to treat people right. And in this regard, \n     he did an outstanding job in getting his students to think \n     like him. So it is not surprising that the final chapters of \n     American's Nisei veterans are still being written.\n       Here in Hawaii, our Nisei veterans are currently developing \n     and endowing at the University of Hawaii a Nisei Veterans \n     Forum on Universal Values for a Democratic Society. The \n     purpose of this effort is to show current and future \n     generations of high school students the benefits of the \n     values drawn from the various ethnic groups here in Hawaii--\n     values similar to those of Nisei veterans that were used to \n     help them persevere through challenging times during their \n     lives. In this manner, Nisei veterans are passing on to \n     future generations of students the same type of beliefs and \n     values they were exposed to during their formative years.\n       On the national front, Nisei and Sansei from Hawaii and the \n     mainland are actively engaged in the important work of the \n     new Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The \n     Museum is the first and only national museum dedicated to an \n     ethnic group in America. Through both fixed and traveling \n     exhibits, the Museum shares the darkest and brightest moments \n     for Japanese Americans with others both at home and abroad. \n     It is noteworthy that the City of Los Angeles currently lists \n     the Museum as one of seven must see attractions in its \n     brochures provide to tourists.\n       The Museum has also received a large federal grant this \n     year, through the sponsorship of Senator Inouye, that will \n     use the experiences of Japanese American veterans from World \n     War II, Korea, and Vietnam as the foundation for a new Center \n     for the Preservation of Democracy. In this manner, the \n     sacrifices of our Nisei veterans will be captured and used to \n     construct a very real and moving American story. A story that \n     needs to be told over and over again to current and future \n     generations of Americans so that no group of Americans is \n     ever subjected to what Japanese Americans experienced.\n       Well, 60 years has now passed since that Black & Gold \n     Yearbook of 1941. Today, the typical McKinley boy from that \n     time is still five ft., six inches tall, but perhaps heavier \n     than the then reported 124 pounds. By contrast, I know that \n     the typical McKinley girl from that same period is still five \n     ft., one inch tall, and still weighs 97 pounds.\n       Regarding the results of that 1941 high school survey, I \n     say to our Nisei veterans you successfully carried through on \n     your convictions. You stepped forward to defend your country \n     and after the war worked hard to make Hawaii and our nation \n     better places to live.\n       You are grayer and wiser than you were 60 years ago. You \n     still believe in honor, duty, and country and have a proven \n     record to show these are not just words. You are still humble \n     and as such will not bathe yourselves in glory although most \n     of us realize you deserve such honor. And perhaps more \n     important, you truly care about your families and all \n     families in America. For it is through your story that your \n     children, grandchildren, and future generations will cherish \n     and take great pride in their Japanese American heritage. And \n     it is through this same story that other Americans will learn \n     that the preservation of our democracy requires constant \n     vigilance and courage to not allow hysteria of any kind to \n     strip innocent Americans of their basic rights.\n       That 1941 yearbook states, ``Respectfully dedicated to our \n     parents and the excellent home influence given us.'' Today I \n     say to our Nisei veterans who died in combat, to our Nisei \n     veterans who returned home and are no longer with us, and to \n     our Nisei veterans we are blessed to still have with us: We \n     dedicated this service to you and the excellent influence you \n     have had on us.\n       God bless our Nisei veterans and their families, God bless \n     their beloved Hawaii, and God bless the great nation they \n     served so well both in battle and in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3917-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3917-S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE CLEAN EFFICIENT AUTOMOBILES RESULTING FROM ADVANCED CAR \n                        TECHNOLOGIES ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address a bill I have just \nintroduced, S. 760, the ``CLEAR Act,'' which is short for the Clean \nEfficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies Act.\n  Let me begin my remarks by thanking the original cosponsors of S. \n760, Senators Rockefeller, Jeffords, Kerry, Crapo, Lieberman, Collins, \nChafee,  and Gordon Smith, all of whom have joined with me in drafting \nthis legislation which will help our country achieve a greater reliance \non alternative fuel technologies.\n  Our proposal relies on a system of tax-based incentives to encourage \ndevelopment of alternative fuel technologies and consumer acceptance of \nthese products. Rather than rely on a system of federal mandates, we \nuse tax credits to promote all of the advanced technologies being \npursued by auto manufacturers in a dramatic effort to reduce emissions \nand improve efficiency. These technologies include: fuel cell; hybrid \nelectric; alternative fuel; and battery electric vehicles.\n  It is significant that our bipartisan initiative is founded on a \nbelief that government should not be in the business of picking winners \nand losers in the free market. Rather, the CLEAR Act leaves it up to \nthe consumer to choose among the lowest emitting vehicles.\n  By promoting the technologies and fuels that improve air quality, S. \n760 helps to solve two of our nation's most difficult and expensive \nproblems, air pollution and energy dependence. These are issues of \ncritical concern in my home state of Utah. According to a study by \nUtah's Division of Air Quality, on-road vehicles in Utah account for 22 \npercent of particulate matter. This particulate matter can be harmful \nto citizens who suffer from chronic respiratory or heart disease, \ninfluenza, or asthma.\n  Automobiles also contribute significantly to hydrocarbon and nitrogen \noxide emissions in my state. These two pollutants react in sunlight to \nform ozone, which in turn reduces lung function in humans and hurts our \nresistance to colds and asthma. In addition, vehicles account for as \nmuch as 87 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide can be \nharmful to persons with heart, respiratory, or circulatory ailments.\n  While Utah has made important strides in improving air quality, it is \na fact that each year more vehicular miles are driven in our State. It \nis clear that if we are to have cleaner air, we must encourage the use \nof alternative fuels and technologies to reduce vehicle emissions.\n  Let me paint the picture on the national scale. In 1998, a year for \nwhich we have complete data, our nation had 121 regions that failed to \nattain the Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards, NAAQS. This status directly threatens the quality of \nlife of more than 100 million, or about one-third, of our citizens who \nmust bear the health and the economic burden associated with non-\nattainment. Non-attainment status can be costly, whether due to the \nloss of federal highway money, lost economic opportunities, or the \nexpensive measures required to reach attainment.\n  EPA has set new standards for both ozone and particulate matter, PM \n2.5. By the EPA's own estimates, the annual cost of achieving the new \nozone standard in 2010 was set at $9.6 billion. Additionally, the EPA \nput the annual cost of achieving the PM 2.5 standard at $37 billion, \nfor a combined cost of $47 billion annually. These staggering figures \npaint a graphic picture of why we need to invest more effort toward the \npromotion of alternative fuels. Every new alternative fuel or advanced \ntechnology car, truck, or bus on the road will displace a conventional \nvehicle's lifetime of emissions and reliance on imported oil.\n  This brings me to another important benefit of the CLEAR Act, \nincreased energy independence. Whether during\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nthe energy crisis in the 1970s, during the Persian Gulf War, or during \nour current energy crisis, every American has felt the sting of our \ndependency on foreign oil. And I might add, Mr. President, that our \ndependency on foreign oil has steadily increased to the point where we \nnow depend on foreign sources for more than 57 percent of our oil. Last \nmonth alone, it was over 60 percent. When enacted, the CLEAR Act will \nplay a key role in helping our nation improve its energy security by \nincreasing the diversity of our fuel options and decreasing our need \nfor gasoline. Our nation's energy strategy will not be complete without \nan incentive to increase the use of alternative fuels and advanced car \ntechnologies.\n  Historically, consumers have faced three basic obstacles to accepting \nthe use of alternative fuels and advanced technologies. These are the \ncost of the vehicles, the cost of alternative fuel, and the lack of an \nadequate infrastructure of alternative fueling stations. The CLEAR Act \nwould lower all three of these barriers.\n  First, we provide a tax credit of 50 cents per gasoline-gallon \nequivalent for the purchase of alternative fuel at retail. To give \ncustomers better access to alternative fuel, we extend an existing \ndeduction for the capital costs of installing alternative fueling \nstations. We also provide a 50 percent credit for the installation \ncosts of retail and residential refueling stations.\n  Finally, we provide tax credits to consumers to purchase alternative \nfuel and advanced technology vehicles. To make certain that the tax \nbenefit we provide translates into a corresponding benefit to the \nenvironment, we split the vehicle tax credit into two. One part \nprovides a base tax credit for the purchase of vehicles dedicated to \nthe use of alternative fuel or vehicles using advanced technologies. \nThe other part offers a bonus credit based on the vehicle's efficiency \nand reduction in emissions. In this way, we are confident that the \nCLEAR Act will provide the biggest possible ``bang for the buck'' in \nterms of providing a social benefit to our citizens.\n  We all recognize that in the future we will not use gasoline fueled \nvehicles to the same extent we do today. Our legislation is an attempt \nto bring benefits of cleaner air to our citizens sooner, to free our \ncities from expensive EPA regulations, and to reduce our consumption of \nforeign oil. S. 760 enables us to tackle these problems with \nincentives, not mandates.\n\n  Our proposal is the most comprehensive legislation ever brought \nbefore Congress to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles and \nadvanced car technologies among consumers. We urge our colleagues to \njoin with us in this forward-looking approach to cleaner air and \nincreased energy independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3918-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

In fact, this \nis the fourth time that the Central Falls High School team has won the \nstatewide competition!\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the ``We The \nPeople . . . The Citizen And The Constitution'' program is among the \nmost extensive educational specifically to ensure that young people \nunderstand the history and philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill \nof rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional \nhearing in which students are given the opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on \nhistorical and contemporary constitutional issues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We The People . \n. . The Citizen And The Constitution'' program provide an excellent \nopportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the \nsignificance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. It \nis heartwarming to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and \nparticipatory interest in public affairs.\n  I am very proud of Gabriel Arias, Jorge Bolivar, Andrew Castillo, \nKaren Corrales, Johnathan DePina, Kinga Dobrzycki, Kayla England, Renee \nFisher, Christina Garcia, Roseangel Gavidia, Karen Hurtado, Deborah \nNavarro, Jessica Pareja, Denisse Reyes, Erik Rua, Shirley Rua, Jesse \nSalazar, Janet Sanchez, Corey Stad, Monica Torres, Vladimir Uran, \nSirabel Uran, for making it to the national finals. I congratulate this \noutstanding group of young men and women for their hard work and \nperseverance. Also, I want to applaud Jeff Schanck, a fine teacher who \ndeserves so much credit for guiding the Central Falls High School team \nto the national finals.\n  Yesterday, I was pleased to visit with the students from Central \nFalls to offer my congratulations for what they have achieved. These \nstudents, with the guidance of Mr. Schanck, have learned much about the \nmeaning of our nation and what countless men and women have fought and \ndied to protect. No matter what the outcome of the contest, they have \neach earned the greatest prize of all: Knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3918-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3918-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3918-5", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3918-S3919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 1238(b) of the Floyd D.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to \n     nonindigenous species being released in the ballast water of \n     ships on the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, While the problems created by the introduction of \n     nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes from ballast water \n     are not new, this situation is raising greater concerns as \n     the damage done to this freshwater network becomes more \n     apparent. The alarming rate at which the zebra mussel has \n     spread demonstrates the serious problems that can result when \n     the area's delicate ecology is thrown out of balance; and\n       Whereas, In recent years, numerous proposals have been \n     advanced to halt the introduction of new species. Many of \n     these proposals involve strengthening laws and enforcement on \n     the release or treatment of ballast water; and\n       Whereas, In all discussions to address the issue created by \n     ballast water discharges in the Great Lakes, it is essential \n     that a regional approach be taken. With the multiple levels \n     of government, including states, provinces, and two federal \n     governments, it is important that there be a well-coordinated \n     effort on this matter. A quilt of regulations or practices \n     developed by the individual entities could provide more harm \n     than good, not only to the environment, but also to specific \n     communities and to specific uses of the lakes; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation that offers a regional solution to the problems \n     of nonindigenous species being released in the ballast water \n     of ships on the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, March 7, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3921-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3921-S3922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n       S. 771.

A bill to permanently prohibit the conduct of offshore \ndrilling on the outer Continental Shelf off the State of Florida, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBill Nelson, to introduce legislation that will protect the coast of \nFlorida in the future from the damages of offshore drilling.\n  In past Congresses, I have introduced similar legislation that sought \nto codify the annual moratorium on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of \nMexico and ensure that state's receive all environmental documentation \nprior to making a decision on whether to allow drilling off of their \nshores.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that takes these steps, plus \nseveral others. The Outer Continental Shelf Protection Act will protect \nFlorida's fragile coastline from outer continental shelf leasing and \ndrilling in three important ways.\n  First, we transform the annual moratorium on leasing and preleasing \nactivity off the coast of Florida into a permanent ban covering \nplanning areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, \nand the Florida section of the South Atlantic.\n  Second, the Outer Continental Shelf Protection Act corrects an \negregious conflict in regulatory provisions where an effected state is \nrequired to make a consistency determination for proposed oil and gas \nproduction or development under the Coastal Zone Management Act prior \nto receiving the Environmental Impact Statement, EIS, for them from the \nMineral Management Service.\n  Our bill requires that the EIS is provided to affected states before \nthey make a consistency determination, and it requires that every oil \nand gas development plan have an EIS completed prior to development.\n  Third, our bill buys back leases in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico which \nare an immediate threat to Florida's natural heritage and economic \nengine.\n  What does this bill mean for Florida? The elimination of preleasing \nactivity and lease sales off the coast of Florida protects our economic \nand environmental future.\n  For years, I have taken my children and grandchildren to places like \nGrayton Beach so that they can appreciate the natural treasures and \nlocal cultures that are part of both their own heritage and that of the \nFlorida Panhandle.\n  We have a solemn obligation to preserve these important aspects of \nour state's history for all of our children and grandchildren. Much of \nour identity as Floridians is tied to the thousands of miles of \npristine coastline that surround most of our state.\n  The Florida coastline will not be safe if offshore oil and gas \nresources are developed. For example, a 1997 Environmental Protection \nAgency, EPA, study indicated that even in the absence of oil leakage, a \ntypical oil rig can discharge between 6,500 and 13,000 barrels of waste \nper year. The same study also warned of further harmful impact on \nmarine mammal populations, fish populations, and air quality.\n  In addition to leakages and waste discharges, physical disturbances \ncaused by anchoring, pipeline placement, rig construction, and the \nresuspension of bottom sediments can also be destructive. Given these \nconclusions, Floridians are unwilling to risk the environmental havoc \nthat oil or natural gas drilling could wreak along the sensitive \nPanhandle coastline.\n  Because the natural beauty and diverse habitats of the Gulf of \nMexico, the Florida Keys, and Florida's Atlantic Coast attract visitors \nfrom all over the world and support a variety of commercial activities, \nan oil or natural gas accident in these areas could have a crippling \neffect on the economy. In 1996, the cities of Panama City, Pensacola, \nand Fort Walton Beach reported $1.5 billion in sales to tourists. \nFlorida's fishing industry benefits from the fact that nearly 90 \npercent of reef fish caught in the Gulf of Mexico come from the West \nFlorida continental shelf.\n  For the last several years, I have been working with my colleagues, \nformer Senator Connie Mack and now Senator Bill Nelson, Congressman Joe \nScarborough, and others to head off the threat of oil and natural gas \ndrilling. In June of 1997, we introduced legislation to cancel six \nnatural gas leases seventeen miles off of the Pensacola coast and \ncompensate Mobil Oil Corporation for its investment. Five days after \nthe introduction of that legislation and two months before it was \nscheduled to begin exploratory drilling off Florida's Panhandle, Mobil \nended its operation and returned its leases to the federal government.\n  While that action meant that Panhandle residents faced one less \neconomic and environmental catastrophe-in-the-making, it did not \ncompletely eliminate the threats posed by oil and natural gas drilling \noff Florida's Gulf Coast. Florida's Congressional representatives fight \nhard each year to extend the federal moratorium on new oil and natural \ngas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. But that solution is temporary.\n  Today we are introducing the Outer Continental Shelf Protection Act \nto make permanent our efforts to protect Florida's coastlines. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to move this legislation forward and protect the \ncoast of future generations of Floridians and visitors to Florida.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 772. A bill to permit the reimbursement of the expenses incurred \nby an affected State and units of local government for security at an \nadditional non-governmental property to be secured by the Secret \nService for protection of the President for a period of not to exceed \n60 days each fiscal year; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to provide fair \nreimbursement to state and local law enforcement organizations for \nadditional costs incurred by them in providing frequent assistance to \nthe Secret Service to protect the President of the United States.\n  Of course, the Secret Service has the principal responsibility for \nprotecting our Presidents. Without the assistance of state and local \nlaw enforcement organizations, however, providing that protection would \nbe more costly and more difficult, if not impossible. For the most \npart, state and local law enforcers provide this assistance with no \nneed for or expectation of reimbursement from the Federal government. \nIn some cases, however, reimbursement is appropriate. It is \nappropriate, for example, when state and local law enforcement \norganizations are required to incur substantial expenses on a frequent \nbasis in localities that are small and thus does not have adequate \nfinancial bases to provide the necessary services without \nreimbursement.\n  This is not a new idea. Dating back to at least the Administration of \nPresident Jimmy Carter, the Federal government has provided \nreimbursement to local and sometimes state organizations where sitting \nPresidents maintain a principal residence. In the early 1990s, \nreimbursement was provided for\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\nservices provided for then-President Bush's visits to Kennebunkport, \nMaine. Reimbursement is similarly available now to Crawford, Texas. The \nbill I am introducing will extend this authority to localities and \nstates other than the place of principal residence when the sitting \nPresident so designates.\n  I envision that it will help, for example, the Kennebunkport Police \nDepartment and associated law enforcement organizations in my home \nstate. I expect that the allure of summer in Maine will draw President \nGeorge W. Bush to the Bush family residence in Kennebunkport for \nseveral visits in the coming months. My bill will help ensure that the \ntown, with a population of only 3,720, will not have to shoulder alone \nthe substantial financial burden associated with these visits. In \naddition, however, I anticipate that in the future other localities \nwill benefit, for this bill has been carefully drafted to provide \nreimbursement to localities and states designated by future Presidents.\n  This bill will not result in an unlimited ``windfall'' to local and \nstate law enforcement organizations. It requires that the organizations \nrequesting reimbursement first incur the expenses and therefore will \nlikely discourage excessive expenditures. It also limits the number of \ndays for which reimbursements may be sought to not more than 60 days \nper fiscal year. In addition, it provides reimbursement only for \nservices provided in conjunction with visits to small localities with a \npopulation of no more than 7,000 residences. Finally, the total amount \nof reimbursement is limited to not more than $100,000 per fiscal year.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this modest, yet important and \nequitable provision of support to local and state law enforcement \norganizations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 773. A bill to provide for disclosure of fire safety standards and \nmeasures with respect to campus buildings, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Campus \nFire Safety Right-to-Know Act so that we can move forward in protecting \nour children at our colleges and universities. It is an unfortunate \nreality that it often takes great tragedies to highlight \nvulnerabilities in our laws.\n  On January 19, 2000, several New Jersey families experienced an \nunimaginable tragedy. A fire in a freshman college dormitory killed 3 \nstudents and injured 62 others. Investigations into the fire revealed \nthat the dorm was not equipped with a sprinkler system, which could \nhave saved lives. In addition, during that fatal evening, many students \ndelayed leaving the building because they assumed it was a false alarm, \nan all too common occurrence.\n  On March 19, 2000, a fire broke out at a fraternity house at a \nPennsylvania university, killing three students. This was not the first \nfire at that fraternity house, in 1994, five students were killed in a \nfraternity house fire.\n  On June 8, 2000, a student was killed in an early morning fraternity \nhouse fire at an Illinois University. Local authorities said the \nbuilding was not protected with an automatic fire sprinkler system.\n  And, as recently as April 1, 2001, a fire in a residence hall at a \nNew Hampshire college forced 100 students out of the building and \nseriously damaged at least two apartments. This was the second fire to \noccur at a residence hall at that college within two months.\n  This is a national crisis that endangers our children's lives.\n  Although the average number of college residence fires dropped 10 \npercent in the last decade, an average of 66 students still are injured \nin campus fires in dorms, and fraternity and sorority houses. In the 11 \ndeadly campus fires between 1900 and 1997, an average of two people \ndied in each.\n  The National Fire Protection Association reports that 72 percent of \ndorms, and fraternity and sorority houses that suffer fires are not \nequipped with life saving sprinkler systems, even though sprinklers are \nproven to cut by up to two-thirds the risks of death and property \ndamage in fires.\n  I have a proposal that will help make university housing safer. The \nCampus Fire Safety Right to Know Act would highlight the issue of \ncampus fire safety by requiring colleges and universities to provide \nannual reports that explains fire policies, frequency of false alarms, \nand whether dorms are equipped with sprinkler systems.\n  These reports would be straight-forward and based on the types of \nreporting that many campuses already do.\n  Colleges and universities could use these reports to highlight their \nsuccesses and progress with campus fire safety. They would be, in part, \na marketing tool to attract students and families.\n  The reports would also bring greater awareness about campus fire \nsafety to schools that have not made progress, and encourage them to \ntake action.\n  And, the reports would be a resource for students and their families, \nso that they know whether their dorms are fire safe and can work with \ntheir schools to improve fire safety.\n  My bill is supported by universities in my State, Seton Hall, Rutgers \nand Princeton, and is also endorsed by the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, the National Safety Council, and College Parents of \nAmerica.\n  We need to pass this measure so that we can ensure that the tragedies \nin New Jersey, Illinois, and Pennsylvania are the last of their kinds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 774. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 121 West Spring Street in New Albany, Indiana, as \nthe ``Lee H. Hamilton Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to \npay tribute to a good friend and a great man, former Congressman Lee \nHamilton. I am honored to introduce legislation designating the Federal \nBuilding and United States Courthouse located at 121 W. Spring Street \nin New Albany, Indiana, as the ``Lee H. Hamilton Federal Building and \nU.S. Courthouse.''\n  Lee Hamilton was born in Daytona Beach, FL, on April 20, 1931, and \nraised in Evansville, IN. He attended Evansville Central High school, \nwhere he excelled both in the classroom and on the basketball court. As \na senior, he led his team to the final game of the Indiana state \nbasketball tournament, and received the prestigious Tresler award for \nscholarship and athletics.\n  After graduation, Congressman Hamilton attended Depauw University, \nand earned his bachelor's degree in 1952. He went on to study for one \nyear in post-war Germany at Goethe University, before enrolling in law \nschool at Indiana University, where he received his Doctor of \nJurisprudence Degree in 1956.\n  In 1964, Lee Hamilton was first elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, where he went on to serve with distinction for 34 \nyears. During his long tenure in office, he established himself as a \nleader in International Affairs, serving as the chairman of the House \nForeign Relations committee, Intelligence Committee, and Iran-Contra \ncommittee. Mr. Hamilton was widely respected for his powerful intellect \nand impressive knowledge of foreign affairs, and remains unquestionably \none of our nation's foremost experts on foreign policy.\n  In addition to his record on foreign affairs, Mr. Hamilton also \nplayed an important role in reforming the institution of Congress \nitself. He cochaired the Joint Committee on the Organization of \nCongress where he worked to reform the institution by instituting the \ngift-ban, tightening lobbying restrictions, and applying the laws of \nthe workplace to Congress.\n  Even with all his success in Washington, however, Mr. Hamilton never \nforgot his Hoosier roots. He always remained down-to-earth and \naccessible to his Southern Indiana constituents. Over the years, he was \npresented with a number of opportunities to ascend to other offices, \nincluding the U.S. Senate, Secretary of State, and the Vice-Presidency \nof the United States. He chose instead to retain his House seat and \nfulfill his commitments to the people of Southern Indiana.\n  Today, Congressman Hamilton remains active in foreign policy and \ncongressional reform. He currently heads the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars in Washington, DC, and serves as the \ndirector of the Center on Congress at Indiana University.\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\n  Congressman Hamilton has received numerous public service awards \nincluding the Paul H. Nitze Award for Distinguished Authority on \nNational Security Affairs, the Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public \nService Award, the Phillip C. Habib Award for Distinguished Public \nService, the Indiana Humanities Council Lifetime Achievement Award and \nthe U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress' Statesmanship \nAward. It is only fitting that we recognize Congressman Hamilton's many \nyears of service to the people of Southern Indiana by naming the New \nAlbany Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in his honor.\n  It is my hope that the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse located \nat 121 W. Spring Street in New Albany will soon bear the name of my \nfriend and fellow Hoosier, Congressman Lee Hamilton.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 775. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit expansion of medical residency training programs in geriatric \nmedicine and to provide for reimbursement of care coordination and \nassessment services provided under the Medicare Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nGeriatric Care Act of 2001, a bill to increase the number of \ngeriatricians in our country through training incentives and Medicare \nreimbursement for geriatric care.\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort today by Senator Harry Reid of \nNevada. Senator Reid has been a pioneer in seeking real commonsense \nsolutions to the health care challenges facing our Nation's seniors. In \nfact, he has graciously allowed me to include in this bill components \nof a bill he introduced during the last Congress. Moreover, he has been \nan invaluable resource and ally to me as I have grappled with the \nsolutions to these challenges we are seeking.\n  Our country teeters on the brink of revolutionary demographic change \nas baby boomers begin to retire and Medicare begins to care for them. \nAs a member of the Finance Committee and the Special Committee on \nAging, I have a special interest in preparing health care providers and \nMedicare for the inevitable aging of America. By improving access to \ngeriatric care, the Geriatric Care Act of 2001 takes an important first \nstep in modernizing Medicare for the 21st century.\n  The 76 million baby boomers are aging and in 30 years, 70 million \nAmericans will be 65 years and older. They will soon represent one-\nfifth of the U.S. population, the largest proportion of older persons \nin our Nation's history. Our Nation's health care system will face an \nunprecedented strain as our population grows older.\n  Our Nation is simply ill-prepared for what lies ahead. Demand for \nquality care will increase, and we will need physicians who understand \nthe complex health problems that aging inevitably brings. As seniors \nlive longer, they face much greater risk of disease and disability. \nConditions such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and \nAlzheimer's disease occur more frequently as people age. The complex \nproblems associated with aging require a supply of physicians with \nspecial training in geriatrics.\n  Geriatricians are physicians who are first board certified in family \npractice or internal medicine and then complete additional training in \ngeriatrics. Geriatric medicine provides the most comprehensive health \ncare for our most vulnerable seniors. Geriatrics promotes wellness and \npreventive care, helping to improve patients' overall quality of life \nby allowing them greater independence and preventing unnecessary and \ncostly trips to the hospital or institutions.\n  Geriatric physicians also have a heightened awareness of the effects \nof prescription drugs. Given our seniors' growing dependence on \nprescriptions, it is increasingly important that physicians know how, \nwhen, and in what dosage to prescribe medicines for seniors. \nFrequently, our older patients respond to medications in very different \nways from younger patients. In fact, 35 percent of Americans 65 years \nand older experience adverse drug reactions each year.\n  According to the National Center for Health Statistics, medication \nproblems may be involved in as many as 17 percent of all \nhospitalizations of seniors each year. Care management provided by a \ngeriatrician will not only provide better health care for our seniors, \nbut it will also save costs to Medicare in the long term by eliminating \nthe pressures on more costly medical care through hospitals and nursing \nhomes. Quite clearly, geriatrics is a vital thread in the fabric of our \nhealth care system, especially in light of our looming demographic \nchanges. Yet today there are fewer than 9,000 certified geriatricians \nin the United States. Of the approximately 98,000 medical residency and \nfellowship positions supported by Medicare in 1998, only 324 were in \ngeriatric medicine and geriatric psychiatry. Only three medical schools \nin the country--the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in \nLittle Rock being one of them--have a department of geriatrics. This is \nremarkable when we consider that of the 125 medical schools in our \ncountry, only 3 have areas of residency in geriatrics.\n\n  As if that were not alarming enough, the number of geriatricians is \nexpected to decline dramatically in the next several years. In fact, \nmost of these doctors will retire just as the baby boomer generation \nbecomes eligible for Medicare. We must reverse this trend and provide \nincentives to increase the number of geriatricians in our country.\n  Unfortunately, there are two barriers preventing physicians from \nentering geriatrics: insufficient Medicare reimbursements for the \nprovisions of geriatric care, and inadequate training dollars and \npositions for geriatricians. Many practicing geriatricians find it \nincreasingly difficult to focus their practice exclusively on older \npatients because of insufficient Medicare reimbursement. Unlike most \nother medical specialties, geriatricians depend most entirely on \nMedicare revenues.\n  A recent MedPAC report identified low Medicare reimbursement levels \nas a major stumbling block to recruiting new geriatricians. Currently \nthe reimbursement rate for geriatricians is the same as it is for \nregular physicians, but the services geriatricians provide are \nfundamentally different. Physicians who assess younger patients simply \ndon't have to invest the same time that geriatricians must invest \nassessing the complex needs of elderly patients. Moreover, chronic \nillness and multiple medications make medical decisionmaking more \ncomplex and time consuming. Additionally, planning for health care \nneeds becomes more complicated as geriatricians seek to include both \npatients and caregivers in the process.\n  We must modernize the Medicare fee schedule to acknowledge the \nimportance of geriatric assessment and care coordination in providing \nhealth care for our seniors. Geriatric practices cannot flourish and \nthese trends will not improve until we adjust the system to reflect the \nrealities of senior health care.\n  The Geriatric Care Act I am introducing today addresses these \nshortfalls. This bill provides Medicare coverage for the twin \nfoundations of geriatric practice: geriatric assessment and care \ncoordination. The bill authorizes Medicare to cover these essential \nservices for seniors, thereby allowing geriatricians to manage \nmedications effectively, to work with other health care providers as a \nteam, and to provide necessary support for caregivers.\n  The Geriatric Care Act also will remove the disincentive caused by \nthe graduate medical education cap established by the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act. As a result of this cap, many hospitals have eliminated or \nreduced their geriatric training programs. The Geriatric Care Act \ncorrects this problem by allowing additional geriatric training slots \nin hospitals. By allowing hospitals to exceed the cap placed on their \ntraining slots, this bill will help increase the number of residents in \ngeriatric training programs.\n  My home State of Arkansas ranks sixth in the Nation in percentage of \npopulation 65 and older. In a decade, we will rank third. In many ways, \nour population in Arkansas is a snapshot of what the rest of the United \nStates will look like in the near future.\n\n  All of us today could share stories about the challenges faced by our \nparents, our grandparents, our families, our friends, our loved ones as \nthey contend with the passing years. These are\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nthe people who have raised us, who have loved us, who have worked for \nus, and who have fought for us. Now it is our turn to work for them, to \nfight for them, and this is where we must start.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to \nmodernize Medicare, to support crucial geriatric services for our \nNation's growing population of seniors. I also urge my colleagues to \nrecognize that this is only the beginning of what I hope will be a \ngrand overhaul of the way we think about and deliver care to our \nNation's elderly. There are many more things to discuss and to \naddress--adult daycare, long-term care insurance, just to name a few. \nBut it is essential that we begin soon, that we begin now in preparing \nthose individuals we will need 10 years from now in order to be able to \ncare for our aging population in this Nation.\n  Madam President, I also want to submit three letters of support for \nthis bill, along with a list of organizations that support this \nimportant legislation, and encourage all of my colleagues to recognize \nthe unbelievable responsibility we have today to prepare for the \nseniors of tomorrow. I ask unanimous consent that the items I mentioned \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The National Council\n\n\n                                                 on the Aging,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging (NCOA)--the nation's first organization formed to \n     represent America's seniors and those who care for them--I \n     write to express our organization's support for the Geriatric \n     Care Act of 2001.\n       A major shortcoming of the Medicare program is the grossly \n     inadequate, fragmented manner in which chronic care needs are \n     addressed. Some of the major problems include: specific \n     geriatric and chronic care needs are not clearly identified; \n     services are poorly coordinated, if at all; medications are \n     not managed properly, resulting in avoidable adverse \n     reactions; family caregivers are excluded from the care \n     planning process; transitions across settings are disjointed; \n     and follow-up care and access to consultation to promote \n     continuity are often unavailable. All of these serious \n     problems cry out for Medicare coverage of care coordination. \n     NCOA strongly supports your efforts to address these critical \n     shortcomings in the Medicare program.\n       NCOA also supports efforts to increase the number of health \n     care providers who have geriatric training. Given the aging \n     of our population and the coming retirement of the baby \n     boomers, it is important to have physicians trained to care \n     for older patients who may be frail and suffer from multiple, \n     chronic conditions. We applaud your efforts to meet this \n     challenge by introducing legislation to allow for growth in \n     geriatric residency programs above the hospital-specific cap \n     established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       We applaud your leadership on behalf of our nation's most \n     frail, vulnerable citizens and stand ready to assist you in \n     working to enact the Geriatric Care Act of 2001 into law this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Howard Bedlin,\n     Vice President, Public Policy and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Association of Homes\n\n\n                                   and Services for the Aging,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: I understand that you are introducing \n     legislation to provide incentives for the training of \n     geriatricians and to require Medicare reimbursement for \n     geriatric assessments and care management for beneficiaries \n     with complex care needs. The American Association of Homes \n     and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) strongly supports your \n     proposal, which would help to alleviate the serious shortage \n     of physicians trained to meet the special needs of older \n     people.\n       AAHSA is a national non-profit organization representing \n     more than 5,600 not-for-profit nursing homes, continuing care \n     retirement communities, assisted living and senior housing \n     facilities, and community service organizations. More than \n     half of AAHSA's members are religiously sponsored and all \n     have a mission to provide quality care to those in need. \n     Every day AAHSA members serve over one million older persons \n     across the country.\n       Residents of long-term care facilities rely on physician \n     services more than the general population does. The severity \n     of older people's medical conditions compounded by multiple \n     co-morbidities demand more time per visit than younger or \n     healthier people need. Many of these seniors would benefit \n     from the services of a geriatrician, who is trained in the \n     special medical needs of older people. Unfortunately, few \n     physicians elect to specialize in this field. In addition, \n     the Medicare Part B fee schedule does not recognize the \n     specialty services of geriatricians and the time and effort \n     they spend providing medical care of this older, more \n     vulnerable population. Nursing facilities have a difficult \n     time finding physicians, let alone geriatric specialists, to \n     serve residents. Geriatric clinic practices find it difficult \n     to provide the level of service this population requires and \n     deserves for the payment that they receive through the \n     Medicare fee schedule.\n       Your legislation would do much to address these issues, and \n     AAHSA is anxious to work with you toward its passage. Please \n     feel free to contact Will Bruno, our Director of \n     Congressional Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   William L. Minnix, Jr., D. Min.\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                     for Geriatric Psychiatry,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, April 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the American Association \n     for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), I would like to take this \n     opportunity to thank you for your introduction of the \n     ``Geriatric Care Act of 2001.''\n       Although geriatric psychiatry is a relatively small medical \n     specialty, it is one for which demand is growing rapidly as \n     the population ages and the ``baby boom'' generation nears \n     retirement. Arbitrary, budget-driven limits on Medicare \n     payment for graduate medical education, such as caps on the \n     aggregate number of residents and interns at a teaching \n     hospital, could discourage the expansion of training programs \n     in geriatric psychiatry and other fields that are extremely \n     relevant to the Medicare population. Your bill would help to \n     increase the number of physicians with the specialized \n     geriatric training that is needed to serve the growing number \n     of elderly persons in this country.\n       In addition, we support the provision of your bill, which \n     would provide Medicare reimbursement for assessment and care \n     coordination. This will help to provide those Medicare \n     beneficiaries with severe physical and mental disorders with \n     the access to the appropriate and coordinated care that they \n     deserve.\n       AAGP commends you for your commitment to ensuring that \n     America's senior citizens have adequate access to effective \n     health care, and we look forward to working with you on the \n     ``Geriatric Care Act of 2001.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen Bartels, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Supporters of the Geriatric Care Act of 2001\n\n       American Association for Geriatric Psychiatrists.\n       Alzheimer's Association.\n       Alliance for Aging Research.\n       American Geriatrics Society.\n       National Chronic Care Consortium.\n       National Council on Aging.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       American Association for Homes and Services for the Aging.\n       International Longevity Center.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself Mr. Enzi, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Wellstone):\n  S. 776, A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the floor treatment as an extremely low DSH State to 3 percent \nin fiscal year 2002; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Enzi, Baucus, and Wellstone, entitled the ``Medicaid \nSafety Net Hospital Improvement Act of 2001.'' This legislation is \nabsolutely critical to the survival of many of our nation's safety net \nhospitals. It would provide additional funding to address their growing \nburden of providing uncompensated care to many of our nation's 42.6 \nmillion uninsured residents, including 463,000 in New Mexico, through \nthe Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, program.\n  In recognition of the burden bourne by hospitals that provide a large \nshare of care to low-income patients, including Medicaid and the \nuninsured, the Congress established the Medicaid DSH program to give \nadditional funding to support such ``disproportionate share'' \nhospitals. By providing financial relief to these hospitals, the \nMedicaid DSH program maintains hospital access for the poor. As the \nNational Governors' Association has said, ``Medicaid DSH's funds are an \nimportant part of statewide systems of health care access for the \nuninsured.''\n  Recent reports by the Institute of Medicine entitled ``America's \nHealth Care Safety Net: Intact But Endangered,'' the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals entitled ``The Dependence of Safety Net \nHospitals'' and the Commonwealth Fund entitled ``A Shared \nResponsibility: Academic\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\nHealth Centers and the Provision of Care to the Poor and Uninsured'' \nhave all highlighted the importance of the Medicaid DSH program to our \nhealth care safety net.\n  As the Commonwealth Fund report, which was released just this last \nweek, notes: ``The Medicaid DSH program has had a beneficial effect on \npatient access. The average payment rate for Medicaid inpatient \nservices has increased dramatically. Medicaid payments for hospital \nservices were only 76 percent of the cost of providing this care in \n1989. By 1994, Medicaid payments had increased to 94 percent of \ncosts.''\n  Unfortunately, as the Commonwealth Fund report adds, ``. . . there \nare large inequities in how these funds are distributed among states.'' \nIn fact, for 15 states, including New Mexico, our federal DSH \nallotments are not allowed to exceed 1 percent of our state's Medicaid \nprogram costs. In comparison, the average state spends around 9 percent \nof its Medicaid funding on DSH. This disparity and lack of Medicaid DSH \nin ``extremely low-DSH states'' threatens the viability of our safety \nnet providers. In New Mexico, these funds are critical but inadequate \nto hospitals all across our state, including University Hospital, \nEastern New Mexico Regional Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Espanola \nHospital, and others.\n  In an analysis of the Medicaid DSH program by the Urban Institute, \nthe total amount of federal Medicaid DSH payments in six states was \nless than $1 per Medicaid and uninsured individual compared to five \nstates than had DSH spending in excess of $500 per Medicaid and \nuninsured individual. That figure was just $14.91 per Medicaid and \nuninsured person in New Mexico. Compared to the average expenditure of \n$218.96 across the country, such disparities cannot be sustained.\n  As a result, this bipartisan legislation increases the allowed \nfederal Medicaid DSH allotment in the 15 ``extremely low-DSH states'' \nfrom 1 percent to 3 percent of Medicaid program costs, which remains \nfar less, or just one-third, of the national average. I would add that \nthe legislation does not impact the federal DSH allotments in other \nstates but only seeks greater equity by raising the share of federal \nfunds to ``extremely low-DSH states.''\n  Once again, the Commonwealth Fund recommends such action. As the \nreport finds, ``States with small DSH programs are not permitted to \nincrease the relative size of their DSH programs .  .  . [C]urrent \npolicy simply rewards the programs that acted quickly and more \naggressively, without regard to a state's real need of such funds.'' \nTherefore, the report concludes, ``.  .  . greater equity in the use of \nfederal funds should be established among states.''\n  Again, this is achieved in our legislation by raising the limits for \n``extremely low-DSH states'' from 1 percent to 3 percent and not by \nredistributing or taking money away from other states.\n  Failure to support these critical hospitals could have a devastating \nimpact not only on the low-income and vulnerable populations who depend \non them for care but also on other providers throughout the communities \nthat rely on the safety net to care for patients whom they are unable \nor unwilling to serve.\n  As the Institute of Medicine's report entitled ``America's Health \nCare Safety Net: Intact But Endangered'' states, ``Until the nation \naddresses the underlying problems that make the health care safety net \nsystem necessary, it is essential that national, state, and local \npolicy makers protect and perhaps enhance the ability of these \ninstitutions and providers to carry out their missions.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the Senate will consider \nlegislation providing prescription drug coverage for senior citizens by \nJune 20, 2001. The resolution does not specify what form of coverage \nwill be considered; rather, it simply commits us to scheduling \nconsideration of this important legislation, and hopefully its passage, \nin the near future.\n  Many of us have promised the senior citizens of our states that \nCongress would enact this kind of program. As you know, last year the \n106th Senate was unable to reach agreement on whether to provide \nprescription drug coverage directly through Medicare, through \nsubsidized insurance policies, or another mechanism. While these \ndisagreements stymied any one measure's passage, it appeared that an \noverwhelming majority of Senators then supported some form of coverage.\n  I believe it is imperative that we get a program of financial \nassistance for hard-pressed senior citizens quickly enacted. While I \nhave my own preference for direct, voluntary coverage under Medicare, I \nam most concerned that some form of financial assistance be provided to \ndesperate senior citizens in\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nMinnesota and across the country, whose lives are being traumatized by \nthe unaffordable costs of their prescription medicines.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Dodd, \nCrapo, Kennedy, Inhofe, Feinstein, Craig, Murray, Spector, Edwards, \nMikulski, Helms, Biden, and Kerry to introduce a Senate Resolution \ndeclaring May 13-20, ``National Biotechnology Week.''\n  There have been phenomenal advancements in science over the last few \nyears that are allowing us to improve health care, increase crop \nyields, reduce the use of pesticides, and replace costly industrial \nprocesses involving harsh chemicals with cheaper, safer, biological \nprocesses. These advancements have occurred due to the hard work and \ndiligence of scientists and researchers in United States, and all \naround the world, who have spent their lives promoting and perfecting \nthe practice of biotechnology.\n  Biotechnology is the use of biological processes to solve problems or \nmake useful products. While the use of biological processes for these \npurposes is not new, the use of recombinant DNA technology and our \ngreater understanding of the role of genetics in our lives have led to \nthe creation of hundreds of products and therapeutic treatments with a \nwide variety of health, agricultural, and environmental benefits.\n  Through the analysis of genes and gene products, we will soon be able \nto forecast disease and create preventative therapies that will \ndrastically reduce the cost of health care by limiting the number of \ndrug treatments necessary and reducing the amount of time patients must \nbe in the hospital. This same technology will enable us to refocus \nhealth care on promoting health and preventing disease rather than \nrestoring health in the sick and treating the symptoms and effects of \nfull-blown illness in our nation's health care clinics.\n  With the publication of the human genome sequence, we are now one \nstep closer to understanding the mechanisms of disease. The \nidentification of which genes are activated, how, and the determination \nof the functional characteristics of their RNA and protein products are \nfrontiers that remain for our next generation of scientists. However, \nwe are quickly moving towards those frontiers, shedding light on the \ncomplex functions of our own bodies that have been shrouded in mystery \nand speculation for centuries.\n  In the area of agriculture, the benefits and potential for \nbiotechnology are no less stunning--allowing us to increase the yield \nof commodities while reducing the use of pesticides. As the world \npopulation continues to balloon and the amount of arable land available \ndecreases, we will increasingly look to biotechnology to meet the needs \nof people everywhere. Researchers in industry and academia are also \nexploring the possibilities for genetic traits that will yield maximum \nproduction, even in the face of inclement weather.\n  They are also looking for ways to use biotechnology to create novel \nplants that will provide food that has value added traits such as \nreduced fat content and increased levels of vitamins and minerals that \nour diets here in the United States or those in the developing world \nmay be deficient in. The potential for the product known as ``golden \nrice,'' which could substantially combat blindness and anemia in the \nthird world, is immense. In the next ten to twenty years, we will \nlikely be able to grow vaccines in plants, eliminating the difficulties \nof distribution in many areas of the world.\n\n  Industrial biotechnology also shows tremendous potential for reducing \nthe pollution and waste generated through industrial production. \nThrough the use of enzymes and other biological components, industries \nare able to minimize material and energy inputs while simultaneously \nmaximizing renewable resources. An added benefit of those processes is \nthat they limit the production of hazardous pollutants and wastes while \nproducing recyclables or biodegradable products. Industrial \nbiotechnology has been used to create environmentally friendly laundry \ndetergents with fewer phosphates and paper production treatments that \nreduce the discharge of chlorine. Industrial enzymes have also been \nused to create ethanol and other alternative fuels from corn and \nbiomass.\n  Aside from the environmental benefits of both agricultural and \nindustrial biotechnology, researchers have used this technology to \nactually solve environmental problems and clean up environmental \ndisasters. Through the use of bioremediation, the use of living \norganisms to degrade toxic waste into harmless byproducts, researchers \nand environmentalists have been able to clean polluted coastlines and \nareas where fuels have leaked into the soil. Cities and towns \nthroughout the world are now using microbes to remove pollutants from \ntheir sewage systems, and the EPA is now using bioremediation to clean \nup some of our nation's most serious waste sites.\n  With all of these marvelous benefits, there is no doubt that \nbiotechnology is touching our lives and improving our world.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Dodd, \nCrapo, Kennedy, Inhofe, Feinstein, Craig, Murray, Spector, Edwards, \nMikulski, Helms, Biden, and Kerry to introduce a Senate Resolution \ndeclaring May 13-20, ``National Biotechnology Week.''\n  There have been phenomenal advancements in science over the last few \nyears that are allowing us to improve health care, increase crop \nyields, reduce the use of pesticides, and replace costly industrial \nprocesses involving harsh chemicals with cheaper, safer, biological \nprocesses. These advancements have occurred due to the hard work and \ndiligence of scientists and researchers in United States, and all \naround the world, who have spent their lives promoting and perfecting \nthe practice of biotechnology.\n  Biotechnology is the use of biological processes to solve problems or \nmake useful products. While the use of biological processes for these \npurposes is not new, the use of recombinant DNA technology and our \ngreater understanding of the role of genetics in our lives have led to \nthe creation of hundreds of products and therapeutic treatments with a \nwide variety of health, agricultural, and environmental benefits.\n  Through the analysis of genes and gene products, we will soon be able \nto forecast disease and create preventative therapies that will \ndrastically reduce the cost of health care by limiting the number of \ndrug treatments necessary and reducing the amount of time patients must \nbe in the hospital. This same technology will enable us to refocus \nhealth care on promoting health and preventing disease rather than \nrestoring health in the sick and treating the symptoms and effects of \nfull-blown illness in our nation's health care clinics.\n  With the publication of the human genome sequence, we are now one \nstep closer to understanding the mechanisms of disease. The \nidentification of which genes are activated, how, and the determination \nof the functional characteristics of their RNA and protein products are \nfrontiers that remain for our next generation of scientists. However, \nwe are quickly moving towards those frontiers, shedding light on the \ncomplex functions of our own bodies that have been shrouded in mystery \nand speculation for centuries.\n  In the area of agriculture, the benefits and potential for \nbiotechnology are no less stunning--allowing us to increase the yield \nof commodities while reducing the use of pesticides. As the world \npopulation continues to balloon and the amount of arable land available \ndecreases, we will increasingly look to biotechnology to meet the needs \nof people everywhere. Researchers in industry and academia are also \nexploring the possibilities for genetic traits that will yield maximum \nproduction, even in the face of inclement weather.\n  They are also looking for ways to use biotechnology to create novel \nplants that will provide food that has value added traits such as \nreduced fat content and increased levels of vitamins and minerals that \nour diets here in the United States or those in the developing world \nmay be deficient in. The potential for the product known as ``golden \nrice,'' which could substantially combat blindness and anemia in the \nthird world, is immense. In the next ten to twenty years, we will \nlikely be able to grow vaccines in plants, eliminating the difficulties \nof distribution in many areas of the world.\n\n  Industrial biotechnology also shows tremendous potential for reducing \nthe pollution and waste generated through industrial production. \nThrough the use of enzymes and other biological components, industries \nare able to minimize material and energy inputs while simultaneously \nmaximizing renewable resources. An added benefit of those processes is \nthat they limit the production of hazardous pollutants and wastes while \nproducing recyclables or biodegradable products. Industrial \nbiotechnology has been used to create environmentally friendly laundry \ndetergents with fewer phosphates and paper production treatments that \nreduce the discharge of chlorine. Industrial enzymes have also been \nused to create ethanol and other alternative fuels from corn and \nbiomass.\n  Aside from the environmental benefits of both agricultural and \nindustrial biotechnology, researchers have used this technology to \nactually solve environmental problems and clean up environmental \ndisasters. Through the use of bioremediation, the use of living \norganisms to degrade toxic waste into harmless byproducts, researchers \nand environmentalists have been able to clean polluted coastlines and \nareas where fuels have leaked into the soil. Cities and towns \nthroughout the world are now using microbes to remove pollutants from \ntheir sewage systems, and the EPA is now using bioremediation to clean \nup some of our nation's most serious waste sites.\n  With all of these marvelous benefits, there is no doubt that \nbiotechnology is touching our lives and improving our world. But, along \nwith this technology comes the responsibility to understand and \ncarefully evaluate it. If there is to be a future for this technology, \nand we are to fully realize its benefits, elected officials and the \npublic must be informed and engaged about the basics of technology \nitself and its incredible benefits.\n  This is why my colleagues and I are pleased to introduce this \nresolution declaring May 13-20, 2001, as ``National Biotechnology \nWeek.'' It is our hope that public officials, community leaders, \nresearchers, professors, and school teachers across the country will \ntake this week to actively promote understanding of biotechnology in \ntheir communities and their classrooms.\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3929-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 352.

Madam President, I want to share a couple of thoughts \nregarding some reports that have appeared in the media in the last few \nhours regarding our colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  Some reports have been written during the last 24 hours about an \nincident that took place in Vietnam in February 1969, several weeks \nprior to Senator Kerrey receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor for \nthe secret mission on which he served. I read a couple of those \nreports. I want to express my personal concern about the approach of \nthe media to this issue, and express my personal support for Senator \nBob Kerrey, particularly for the nature and the circumstances of the \nmission which has been written about.\n  It is my hope that the media is not going to engage in some kind of \n32-year-later binge because there is a difference of memory about a \nparticularly confusing night in the delta in a free fire zone under \ncircumstances which most of us who served in Vietnam understood were \nthe daily fare of life in Vietnam at that point in time.\n  I served in the very same area that Bob Kerrey did. I served there at \nthe very same time that he did. I remember those free fire zones. I \nremember our feelings then and the great confusion many people felt \nabout the ambiguities we were automatically presented with then by a \nmilitary doctrine that suggested that certain areas were wholly and \ntotally ``enemy territory,'' but nevertheless to the naked eye we could \noften perceive life as we knew it in Vietnam being carried on in those \nareas.\n  Inevitably, there were older citizens, women, children, and others \nwho were often, as a matter of strategy by the Viet Cong, drawn into \nthe line of fire and put in positions of danger without regard, I might \nadd, for their side as well as ours.\n  To the best of my memory, most people worked diligently--I know \nSenator Kerrey did as well as others--to avoid the capacity for \nconfusion or for accidents. I know certainly within our unit there was \na great deal of pride on many occasions when orders were changed on the \nspot simply because perceptions on the spot made it clear that there \nwas the potential for innocents to be injured.\n  I fully remember what it was like to ``saddle up'' for a nighttime \nmission with no Moon, with no light, trying to move clandestinely and \ntrying to surprise people. The confusion that can ensue in those kinds \nof situations is not confusion that lends itself to a 32-year-later \njudgment.\n  There were occasions in Vietnam, as everyone knows, when innocents \nwere victims. There wasn't a soldier there at that time, or who has \ncome back to this country and home today, who doesn't regret that.\n  But I also know it is simply a disservice to our Nation and to the \nquality of the service and a person such as Bob Kerrey to have \ncondemnation after the fact which does anything to diminish the quality \nof service, or the unit's service, or the service of so many others who \nspent their sweat and blood and youth in that particularly difficult \nbattlefield.\n  So it is my hope that in the next days people will understand the \nappropriate perspective and put this issue in its appropriate \nperspective. Bob Kerrey served with distinction. He obviously feels \nanguish and pain about those events, but I do not believe they should \ndiminish, for one moment, the full measure of what he has given to his \ncountry and of what he represents. It is my hope that he personally \nwill not allow it to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/25/senate-section/article/S3930-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3930-S3931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I want to say a word about what President \nBush said this morning with respect to Taiwan because if what the \nPresident said is, in fact, what he means, or if it is indeed the new \npolicy of the United States, it has profound implications for our \ncountry. He made a far-reaching comment this morning on the American \ndefense of Taiwan, a comment which suggests that without any \nconsultation with Congress, without any prior notice to the Congress, a \npolicy that has been in place for 30 years is now summarily being \nchanged with implications that I believe are serious.\n  When asked by Charles Gibson, on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' \nwhether the United States had an obligation to defend Taiwan if Taiwan \nwere attacked by China, President Bush said:\n\n       Yes, we do, and the Chinese must understand that.\n\n  Charles Gibson then asked:\n\n       With the full force of the American military?\n\n  President Bush responded:\n\n       Whatever it took to help Taiwan defend theirself.\n\n  For almost 30 years, through Republican and Democrat administrations \nalike, the cornerstone of our approach to policy toward China and \nTaiwan has been the so-called ``one China'' policy: There is but one \nChina; Taiwan is a part of China, and the question of Taiwan's future \nmust be settled peacefully.\n  This policy was laid out in the 1972 Shanghai Communique issued by \nthe United States and China at the end of President Nixon's historic \nvisit. It was reaffirmed in subsequent bilateral communiques--in 1979, \nwhen the United States recognized the People's Republic of China and \nagain in 1982 on the question of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.\n  A consistent tenet of this policy is the U.S. expectation that the \nquestion of reunification of China and Taiwan will be settled \npeacefully. We have never stated what the United States would do if \nBeijing attempted to use force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland--\nuntil today. We have not stated it in the course of Republican and \nDemocrat administrations alike because we understood the danger of \ndoing so.\n  We have been deliberately vague about what the circumstances might be \nunder which we would come to Taiwan's defense, not only to discourage \nTaiwan from drawing us in by declaring independence but also to deter a \nChinese attack by keeping Beijing guessing as to what the response \nmight be.\n  Sometimes some people have talked about trying to reduce that \nambiguity and simplify it and simply say, of course we would come to \ntheir defense. But if you do that, you invite a set of consequences \nthat might carry with it its own set of dangers, and you may lose \ncontrol of the capacity to make a determination about what has happened \nand what the circumstances really are to which you need to respond.\n  President Bush's comments this morning on ``Good Morning America'' \nsuggest that the administration has decided to abandon the so-called \nstrategic ambiguity. If so, the President has made a major policy \nchange with absolutely no consultation with the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, or \nthe leadership of the Congress.\n\n  In my view, it is a policy change that serves neither our interests \nnor Taiwan's. Any situation which results in the use of force across \nthe Taiwan Strait is unlikely to be simply black and white, as clear as \ncan be. The Tonkin Gulf is a classic example of that.\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nTo this day, people debate over whether or not there really was an \nattack on the Maddox and the Turner Joy, and whether or not there was \nan appropriate response under those circumstances.\n  The scenarios which could lead to the use of force and the conditions \nunder which the United States might respond are simply too variable to \nlend themselves to a simple, clear declaration such as the declaration \nmade by the President this morning.\n  For example, if China attacked in response to what it sees as a \nTaiwanese provocation, would we then respond? Apparently so, according \nto President Bush. Or if Taiwan declared independence, and China \nresponded militarily, would we then come to Taiwan's defense? Have we \ngiven Taiwan a card it wanted all along, which is the capacity to know \nthat no matter what it does, the United States would, in fact, be there \nto defend it?\n  The answer to that question is the reason that we have carried this \nambiguity through President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, \nPresident Bush, the President's father, and President Clinton.\n  In a subsequent interview on CNN, the President reiterated that we \nmaintain the ``one China'' policy, and he hopes Taiwan will not declare \nindependence. But he remained vague as to what we would do if Taiwan \ndid declare independence and China attacked.\n  To remove the strategic ambiguity runs the risk of decreasing \nTaiwan's security rather than increasing it and of eliminating the \nflexibility that we will need to determine how to respond in any given \nsituation.\n  Notwithstanding President Bush's efforts to clarify that the United \nStates does not want Taiwan to declare independence, the new policy has \nthe automatic impact, if it is in place, and if it is the declaration \nthat was made, of emboldening Taiwan and, frankly, reducing our control \nover events.\n  Although I have argued that we need to inject more clarity into our \nengagement with China, I personally believe that on this question our \ninterests and Taiwan's are better served by the ambiguity that has \nexisted and would be better served by maintaining it. It not only \ndeters a Chinese attack, but it discourages Taiwan from misreading what \nthe United States might do.\n  President Bush has said that the United States has an obligation to \ndefend Taiwan. Certainly we want to help Taiwan preserve its thriving \ndemocracy and robust, growing economy. I have said previously that I \nthink this is enough of a message to the Chinese, that no American \nPresident could stand idly by and watch while that democracy that has \nbeen gained is set back, by force or otherwise. Nevertheless, we need \nto press both Taipei and Beijing to reinvigorate the cross-strait \ndialogue, without any misinterpretations about our role.\n  So let us be clear: The Taiwan Relations Act does not commit the \nUnited States to come to the defense of Taiwan in the event of an \nattack. The Taiwan Relations Act commits us to provide Taiwan with the \nnecessary military equipment to meet its legitimate self-defense needs. \nThe arms package that the Bush administration just approved for Taiwan, \nI believe, is the right mix and the right measure, and it will \nsignificantly increase the Taiwanese defensive capacities. I support \nthat package.\n  It may be the case that we would send American forces ultimately to \nTaiwan's defense if there were an attack, but that decision should not \nbe made by an American President in advance during a television \ninterview.\n  A decision of this magnitude, which holds the potential for risking \nthe lives of American military men and women, should be made in \nresponse to the circumstances at the moment, on the ground, in the air, \nand, most importantly, in consultation with the Congress of the United \nStates in the due performance of its responsibilities with respect to \nthe engagement of our forces overseas.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
