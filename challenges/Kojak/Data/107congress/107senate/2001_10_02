They have worked diligently and very closely, trying to work \non this most important piece of legislation.\n  I say to everyone, Democrats and Republicans, it would be a \ntremendous blow to these two men and how hard they have worked--as well \nas to the Senate and this country--if cloture is not invoked on this \nmost important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10027-7", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1438, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1438) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2002 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember or their designees.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I first thank the assistant majority \nleader for his words on this subject. I associate myself with the need \nto move forward on this bill. I am going to vote for cloture. I am \nabout to leave and go into my party's conference and so indicate and \nencourage others to do likewise.\n  Madam President, when I looked at the television this morning and saw \nour President with the leadership reconciling differences, such as the \nbudget, our President moving to make the tough decision, but it is a \ncorrect one given the security arrangements in place, to open National \nAirport, these are bold initiatives. Now the Senate has the opportunity \nto move forward and complete today a bill for the men and women of the \nArmed Forces, men\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\nand women who, with their families, are now preparing to face an \nunknown situation but facing it with commitment and courage. I hope \nthis Senate stands tall behind them and moves forward with this \nlegislation.\n  I ask my distinguished chairman to allocate a few minutes of his time \nto me. I have reserved the equal amount of time for those who may wish \nto come to the floor in opposition to this cloture motion. I stand \nstrongly in favor of it so America can move forward and we can support \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and their \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I thank my dear friend from Virginia for all his \nwork on this bill, for his comments, his determination to proceed on a \nbipartisan basis to a real test of wills. This vote we are now about to \ncast will decide whether we are going to have this year a Defense \nauthorization bill which will provide funds for our military, pay \nraises for our men and women in the military, housing allowances which \nare desperately needed, the equipment that they need in order to \nprepare and to go to war, should that be their fate, and it surely \nlooks as though that is now clearly ahead.\n  What we are hoping for, looking for this morning, is a strong \nbipartisan expression of national resolve and national unity by voting \nfor cloture on this bill. It is the only way we will complete action on \nthis bill. There has been an effort to debate matters on this bill that \nare unrelated, important matters but not matters that are directly \nrelated to providing and equipping the men and women in our forces.\n  This is the bill that provides the authorization required by the \nDepartment of Defense for their programs for the year 2002 that also \nincludes the provisions for the Department of Energy. The bill is \nconsistent with the national security priorities of the President of \nthe United States and the Secretary of Defense. At a time when we are \ndeploying forces around the world and mobilizing our National Guard and \nReserve units to augment our active forces, it is a bill which is \nessential to our national security.\n  I am hoping that any partisan differences will be set aside. I am \nhoping that differences over particular provisions can be set aside. \nNone of us agree with every provision in this bill. Some of us have \ntaken steps to make sure that this bill could pass on a bipartisan \nbasis and some of those steps have been very difficult steps for many \nof us to take. Many of us have had to take steps to preserve our rights \nto debate certain issues at a later time rather than at this moment in \nour history. I know that personally because I am one of those persons \nwho has had to make a decision on language which I crafted and fought \nso hard for in committee as chairman, to set aside that issue--not to \nbury it; we are talking here national missile defense, but to save that \ndebate for another day when two things could happen.\n  One, we could debate it in an environment which makes it possible for \nthe pros and cons of that issue to be debated; second, at least to have \na chance of prevailing on the issue, which is not possible under the \ncurrent circumstances.\n  Nonetheless, the point is, some of us, on both sides of the aisle, \nhave taken difficult steps. Some who oppose the BRAC provision, by the \nway--I am looking at our Presiding Officer--are faced with a decision: \nWill they vote for cloture on a bill which contains a provision to \nwhich they object? This was a close vote on BRAC, something like 53-47, \nif I remember. That means some of us who very much oppose that \nprovision are now faced with a cloture vote. Are they going to vote to \nbring to an end debate on a bill that contains a provision to which \nthey so strongly object? I am confident that most of the Senators who \nvoted against the BRAC provision nonetheless will see that the bill \noverall is essential to our national security and to the well-being of \nour forces and to their success.\n  This bill contains a pay raise for military members that ranges from \n5 percent to 10 percent depending on grade, the largest pay raise in \ntwo decades. We have been making progress on pay by the way. The last \nadministration, as well as this one, has been making significant \nprogress in making more adequate our pay for men and women in the Armed \nForces. So we have the largest pay raise in two decades. We have \nauthority and authorization for funding to increase the basic allowance \nfor housing to eliminate the difference between the allowance that \nmilitary members receive and the actual out-of-pocket expenses, and we \nare doing this now, a full 2 years earlier than the Defense \nDepartment's plan. So we are trying to eliminate that differential a \nlot faster than we had planned.\n  Our bill extends and modifies the authority to pay 18 different \nbonuses and special pays to military members in order to recruit and \nretain a high-quality force. We authorize new accession bonuses for \nmilitary services to offer officers in critical skills. We authorize \nfunding for a new TRICARE for Life Program that we enacted last year \nfor military retirees over the age of 65.\n  All of this is hanging in the balance. The question is whether or not \nthose who favor a debate on a comprehensive energy bill are going to \nuse that issue and their inability to get it debated on this bill as an \nexcuse to vote against this bill, or whether or not some who oppose the \nBRAC provision are now going to vote against cloture in order to bring \ndown a bill which contains provisions which are so critical to the \nwell-being of the men and women in the military and the success of \ntheir operations.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill which I will just \nbriefly summarize. We have multiyear authority for the F-18E/F and the \nC-17 aircraft programs. We have a new round, as I have mentioned, of \nbase closures in the year 2003, which the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have told us is critically needed \nfor the improvement of DOD facilities in the future. We repeal a limit \non the dismantlement of certain strategic delivery systems.\n  The last administration wanted us to get rid of this restriction. The \nuniformed military wanted us to get rid of this restriction. Their \ncivilian leadership wants to get rid of this restriction. This \nadministration wants to get rid of the restriction in order to reduce \nthe size of our offensive nuclear forces. We have missiles that our \nmilitary does not want--nuclear-capable missiles with nuclear warheads \non them. The military says: we do not want them; we do not need them; \nit costs us money to maintain them. Yet Congress has forced the \nmilitary to keep these systems that they do not want. This \nadministration says please get rid of this limit. The last \nadministration said please get rid of it. Again, our administration and \nmilitary want us to get rid of it.\n  Congress now has a chance to get out of this artificial and costly \nand ineffective restriction on the limitation/reduction of nuclear \nforces.\n  We have had a lot of opportunities to amend this bill. We have been \ndebating it over the course now of 6 days. We have adopted 76 \namendments. Two amendments have been tabled. One amendment has been \nwithdrawn. We have tried to get a finite list of amendments so debate \ncould be finally brought to an end, so we could finally have a bill. As \nis usually done in the Senate, an effort is made to say bring your \namendments here, tell us what you want to offer, and let's agree on a \nso-called finite list of amendments.\n  There has been an unwillingness to do that. The people who are trying \nto bring to the floor a debate on a matter unrelated to the matters in \nthis bill have said they will not agree to such a finite list. So here \nwe are in a situation where we have no way to bring debate on this bill \nto an end without cloture. We are more than willing to consider any \nrelevant amendment, any germane amendment. But what we cannot do is \njust set aside the Defense authorization bill to begin a week-long or \nmonth-long debate on an energy bill. That is what we cannot do if we \nare going to act on behalf of the men and women in the Armed Forces, \nand to try to assure their success when they go into combat.\n  So that is the dilemma that we have had. The managers have worked \nhard, as Senator Reid has mentioned. I thank him very much for his \ncomments. Our leadership has worked hard to get that finite list. We \nhave not been able to do it. Now we face a very clear\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nvote as to whether or not we are going to demonstrate the support for \nour Armed Forces by voting for cloture on this bill. That is the simple \nissue. It has come down to that. We are not trying to preclude anybody \nfrom offering a relevant or germane amendment. Quite the opposite. We \nhave been here now for days saying bring your amendments to the floor.\n  It is going to come down to this vote. I am very much afraid that \nunless we get cloture the Defense authorization bill, so important to \nour forces, is going nowhere this year. That would be a horrendous \nmessage to send to the men and women and to the Nation and to the \nworld. I hope that message will not be sent; rather, a message of unity \nand determination will be sent by a strong bipartisan vote for cloture \non this bill.\n  Madam President, I know there are others who are going to want to \nspeak between now and 10 o'clock. I will reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I know Senator Warner has his time, the remainder, reserved. I \nwonder if we could ask the Chair how much time we each have reserved?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 2 minutes and the \nminority has 10 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I do not see anyone else who wants to \nspeak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The second assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oregon be granted 3 minutes without changing the time for the \nvote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support Chairman \nLevin on cloture this morning.\n  As our country prepares to go to war against terrorism, this is not \nthe time to be taking urgently needed national defense legislation \nhostage.\n  Protecting our Nation's energy infrastructure from attacks may well \nneed to be part of our national defense strategy. But there is not one \nsingle provision in the energy legislation that some want to graft onto \nthe defense bill that will in any way help protect our energy \nfacilities from attack.\n  In fact, one of the bills that some are claiming is urgently needed \nfor our energy security would actually undermine the security of our \noil supply--by allowing Alaskan oil to be exported overseas.\n  While the House energy bill would restrict exporting of oil from the \nArctic refuge, a Senate version of that bill would allow that same \noil--that some are claiming we need to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil--to be exported overseas. Those who claim we need to address energy \npolicy as part of the defense bill can't even seem to agree whether we \nneed to restrict Alaskan oil exports in order to increase our energy \nsecurity.\n  The issue of energy security and the role of Alaskan oil ought to be \ndebated in the Senate, but it should be done as part of the debate on \nenergy policy.\n  I think this is particularly important for all the residents of the \nwest coast of our country because it is clear that it is a very tight \nmarket on the west coast of the United States. We have seen again and \nagain evidence that the markets on the west coast have been \nmanipulated, that oil has been sold to Asia at a discount, and the \ncompanies then make up for it by sticking it to consumers in Oregon, \nWashington, and California.\n  This is an extraordinarily important issue. One version that has been \npresented to the Senate would allow the oil that is so important to our \ncountry to reduce our dependence on foreign oil to be exported. We \naren't going to improve our Nation's energy security by short-\ncircuiting the process on this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Chairman Levin and support cloture \nthis morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in the weeks since September 11, \nCongress has risen to the occasion and worked in a bipartisan manner to \naddress the many problems caused by the atrocities committed against \nour country. The American public can be proud of how their elected \nrepresentatives have responded to this grave national emergency. I am \nproud of our performance.\n  But I am worried that in a few minutes, the Senate may undo all our \ngood work of the past three weeks, bring an end to the bipartisan \ncooperation that has distinguished this institution, and give the \npublic a reason to be ashamed of us.\n  Obviously, with America at war, the Defense authorization bill may be \nthe most important legislation we will pass since September 11. \nRecognizing that importance, Democrats and Republicans on the Armed \nServices Committee have worked together to resolve differences that \nmight have imperiled the bill's passage and threaten our bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Levin, has agreed at the \nminority's urging to remove a provision in the bill restricting the \nadministration's ability to develop a ballistic missile defense. I \ncommend the Senator for that act of statesmanship, and for keeping his \npriorities straight in this critical hour.\n  Regrettably, some senators have decided that passing a defense \nauthorization bill should take a backseat to fighting over our \ndifferences on energy policy and to denying the President, the Joint \nChiefs and the Secretary of Defense the ability to reorganize our \nmilitary to respond to the new threats that confront this nation.\n  Every civilian and uniformed leader of the United States armed forces \nhas recognized that an additional round of base closings will be \nnecessary to reorganize the military. We cannot, in this national \nemergency, let our parochial concerns override the needs of the \nmilitary.\n  Nor should we insist on fighting over our differences on energy \npolicy if the consequence of our insistence is that we fail to provide \nthe military with the resources they need to maintain their readiness \nas they prepare to wage what the President has correctly called a ``new \nkind of war.'' There will be time enough for that debate. But not now, \nnot on this bill.\n  I beg my colleagues to continue to distinguish themselves and the \nSenate by keeping the national interest first, second and last, to work \ntogether, as the country expects and needs us to, and to surrender, if \nonly temporarily, the habits of partisanship and parochialism that have \nno place in this crisis.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from Secretary \nRumsfeld and Chairman Shelton to Senators Levin and Warner be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to underscore the importance we \n     place on the Senate's approval of authority for a single \n     round of base closures and realignments. Indeed, in the wake \n     of the terrible events of September 11, the imperative to \n     convert excess capacity into warfighting ability is enhanced, \n     not diminished.\n       Since that fateful day, the Congress has provided \n     additional billions of taxpayer funds to the Department. We \n     owe it to all Americans--particularly those service members \n     on whom much of our response will depend--to seek every \n     efficiency in the application of those funds on behalf of our \n     warfighters.\n       Our installations are the platforms from which we will \n     deploy the forces needed for the sustained campaign the \n     President outlined last night. While our future needs as to \n     base structure are uncertain and are strategy dependent, we \n     simply must have the freedom to maximize the efficient use of \n     our resources. The authority to realign and close bases and \n     facilities will be a critical element of ensuring the right \n     mix of bases and forces within our warfighting strategy.\n       No one relishes the prospect of closing a military facility \n     or even seeking the authority to do so, but as the President \n     said last evening, ``we face new and sudden national \n     challenges,'' and those challenges will force us to confront \n     many difficult choices.\n       In that spirit, I am hopeful the Congress will approve our \n     request for authority to\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\n     close and realign our military base facilities. Thank you for \n     the opportunity to provide our views in this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald Rumsfeld.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                               September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: As the full Senate deliberates the FY \n     2002 Defense Authorization Bill I would like to reiterate how \n     critically important it is that Congress authorize another \n     round of base closures and realignments.\n       Last Thursday the President outlined a sustained campaign \n     to combat international terrorism. The efficient and \n     effective use of the resources devoted to this effort will be \n     the responsibility of the Services and the Combatant \n     Commanders. The authority to eliminate excess infrastructure \n     will be an important tool our forces will need to become more \n     efficient and serve as better custodians of the taxpayers \n     money. As I mentioned before, there is an estimated 23 \n     percent under-utilization of our facilities. We can not \n     afford the cost associated with carrying this excess \n     infrastructure. The Department of Defense must have the \n     ability to restructure its installations to meet our current \n     national security needs.\n       I know you share my concerns that additional base closures \n     are necessary. The Department is committed to accomplishing \n     the required reshaping and restructuring in a single round of \n     base closures and realignments. I hope the Congress will \n     support this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Henry H. Shelton,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the attempt to add energy legislation to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This debate comes at a moment of historic challenge. We are a nation \npoised for battle against a shadowy enemy that has as its aim the \ndestruction of America and all that we stand for. Our President has \nprepared us for a sustained military campaign, and at this time there \ncan be no higher priority than to pass this critical legislation to \nsupport our armed services and the men and women who we will send into \nthis war to, literally, defend our freedom. In that context, the \namendment is an unnecessary and divisive distraction from that high \npurpose, which ultimately will do little to strengthen our national \nsecurity.\n  My friend from Oklahoma is right to be concerned about our national \nenergy policy. In fact, I believe we must take a fresh look at our \npolicies in light of the terrible events of September 11. In \nparticular, we must look at the vulnerability of our energy \ninfrastructure to terrorist attack, and refocus our energy policy to \nensure that we address our weaknesses.\n  On that point, let me quote from a recent letter from a former \nDirector of the CIA, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand the former National Security Adviser to President Reagan:\n\n       Our refineries, pipelines and electrical grid are highly \n     vulnerable to conventional military, nuclear and terrorist \n     attacks. Disbursed, renewable and domestic supplies of fuels \n     and electricity, such as energy produced naturally from wind, \n     solar, geothermal, incremental hydro, and agricultural \n     biomass, address those challenges.\n\n  The authors of the letter continue by stating that we must limit our \nvulnerabilities and increase our energy independence by passing, among \nother things, a Renewable Portfolio Standard. The energy proposal under \nconsideration, however, does not include this innovative measure, or \nmany of the other steps we can and must take to protect and enhance the \nsecurity of energy infrastructure because it was drafted long before \nthe terrible events of September 11 forced us to rethink our positions.\n  Just as problematic, these amendments would open the priceless Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for oil production. In the view of many, \nmyself included, opening the refuge to drilling is not just bad \nenvironmental policy, it is bad energy policy and would do next to \nnothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In fact, as we have \nrepeatedly pointed out, the refuge would not provide a drop of oil for \nat least a decade. This 10-year figure is a conservative estimate that \nwas made by the Department of Interior under President Reagan, and \nproof positive that ANWR is not the answer or even an answer to our \ncurrent crisis, let alone our long-term needs.\n  What this proposal would do, however, is severely threaten a national \nenvironmental treasure, which is the last thing the American people \nwould expect us to do at this moment of crisis. In times such as these, \nmany of us found solace in nature, including many people at the heart \nof these horrific terrorist attacks. The New York times reported in the \ndays following the attacks that Manhattan citizens were flocking to a \ngarden in lower Manhattan to seek comfort, to grieve, and to connect \nwith each other in sharing our grief.\n  In my view, we need to know that vast natural areas such as the \nArctic refuge exist as we cope with the events of the past month. \nNature reminds us of the eternal rhythms of life of which we are a part \nand which will endure over time. Ensuring an enduring refuge in the \nArctic, no matter how uncertain other parts of our life may seem right \nnow, provides us solace and perspective in these trying times. This \ncrisis has reawakened us to the importance of protecting our values, \nand I believe that the Arctic wilderness has a place on that list.\n  The time to debate the merits of energy policy is not today, and not \nas an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. Debating the merits \nof these, and other, provisions will take time, time we do not have \nnow. There will be deep divisions and much disagreement. As Senator \nMurkowski said just last week, consideration of energy legislation on \nthe defense bill is ``inappropriate.'' ``[T]here is a place for the \nconsideration of domestic energy development.  . . . That belongs in \nthe energy bill where it should be debated by all individual members.''\n  We should leave this Arctic refuge debate for another day and focus \nwith intensity on the task at hand: supporting and strengthening our \nArmed Forces. This is not the time for the distraction and division \nthat this amendment would create.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am pleased to say that my colleague, \nSenator McCain, and I think one or two others in our conference \nstrongly support cloture. I am pleased to say that I think momentarily \nthe Senate will see a very strong vote in favor of cloture and for \nmoving ahead on this bill. I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nArizona, and others for their support in this matter.\n  I say to the chairman we will make as much progress as possible \ntoday, and we will have to vigilantly enforce the rules with regard to \ngermaneness if we are to achieve our results. But we have stood \nsteadfast on both sides of the aisle on behalf of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces. I am proud of the Senate on this day.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I know the hour of 10 has arrived. I \nthank my good friend from Virginia for his work in his conference. I am \noptimistic, with his words now and with Senator McCain's efforts and \nothers in the Republican conference, that we now have an opportunity to \nget cloture. We hope that is true. We will find out shortly. The stakes \nhere are great.\n  I yield any time that I have.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wonder if we might extend the time of \nthe vote by 2 minutes to allow the Senator from Alaska to address the \nSenate, and then the vote will take place at 10:02.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, good morning. And I thank my good \nfriend, Senator Warner.\n  Let me indicate my support for the DOD authorization bill. It has \nnever been my intent to block this legislation. However, as a \nconsequence of the manner in which the objections were heard relative \nto the DOD authorization bill, and the effort to put H.R. 4, the House \nenergy bill, as an amendment on it, I felt compelled to come before \nthis body and ask the majority when we might take up an energy bill, a \nnational energy security bill that addresses protecting the critical \nenergy infrastructure of our Nation, whether it be electric \nreliability, pipeline safety, and provisions of the administration's \nenergy security proposal. There were other issues relative to securing \ndomestic supplies: Price Anderson, clean coal, ANWR, hydro provisions,\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\nand a title reducing demand and increasing efficiencies.\n  I felt it imperative, based on the requests from the White House, the \nVice President, and the Secretaries of Energy and Interior, that we \nhave some assurance that the Senate will complete its work on a \nnational energy security package. The House has done its work. H.R. 4 \nhas passed the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, the majority \ndid not see fit to give us an indication of whether or not we would \nlikely take up an energy bill in the remainder of this session.\n  That was my request relative to the authorization bill pending before \nus this morning. We still have not received any assurance from the \nmajority that they intend to take up a national energy security bill \nthis session. I encourage them to reconsider that. I advise my \ncolleagues that I will be pressing this issue on other opportunities \nbefore this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) The Senator's time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and wish the occupant of the chair a \ngood day. And I thank my friend, Senator Warner.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     163, S. 1438, the Department of Defense authorization bill:\n       John Kerry, Jon Corzine, Debbie Stabenow, Byron Dorgan, \n     Maria Cantwell, Patty Murray, Harry Reid, Zell Miller, Daniel \n     Inouye, James Jeffords, Richard Durbin, Kent Conrad, Jack \n     Reed, Charles Schumer, Joseph Lieberman, John Edwards, Tom \n     Daschle, and Carl Levin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the quorum call under \nthe rule is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. \n1438, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2002 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 289 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider that vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized to bring up \nan amendment. Prior to that, I yield no longer than 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not hear what was asked.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have asked to be recognized to bring up \nan amendment that is at the desk. However, in deference to the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Oregon, I have yielded them 5 \nminutes, but I want to retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I wonder whether or not that amount of time is sufficient for \nboth of them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is sufficient.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 10 minutes if they need it?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not to exceed 10 minutes. I amend my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not take more than 1 minute because \nwe need to move forward with this legislation. In fact, we need to move \nforward with it urgently. I hope there will be time agreements and \namendments decided on so we can finish this bill today. We have to move \non to airport security and other important issues.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain and Mr. Wyden are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1735\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1735, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1735.\n\n     (Purpose: To add an expression of the sense of the Senate on \ncomprehensive national energy legislation that ensures the availability \n            of adequate energy supplies to the Armed Forces)\n\n       On page 47, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (e) Sense of Senate on Availability of Energy-Related \n     Supplies for the Armed Forces.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should, before the adjournment of the first \n     session of the 107th Congress, take action on comprehensive \n     national energy security legislation, including energy \n     production and energy conservation measures, to ensure that \n     there is an adequate supply of energy for the Armed Forces.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to reread that because this is \nvery simple. This is not the comprehensive amendment I had which would \nhave put H.R. 4 into the Defense authorization bill.\n  There is no one in this Chamber who wants to have a Defense \nauthorization bill more than I do. I will not jeopardize that. However, \nthis amendment is simply a sense of the Senate on availability of \nenergy-related supplies for the Armed Forces. It is the sense of the \nSenate that the Senate should, before the adjournment of the first \nsession of the 107th Congress, take action on the comprehensive \nnational energy security legislation, including energy production and \nenergy conservation measures, to ensure there is an adequate supply of \nenergy for the Armed Forces.\n  The reason I am bringing this issue up is I cannot imagine that \nsomeone would not want to support it. Right now we are, as we all \nknow--you have heard me say this many times--56.6-percent dependent \nupon foreign sources of oil for our ability to fight a war. Roughly \nhalf of that comes from the Middle East and the largest, fastest \ngrowing contributor to energy, to oil that is imported by the United \nStates, is Iraq.\n  So what we are saying is we are dependent upon Iraq for our ability \nto fight a war against Iraq. Now, that is insane.\n  The very least we can do is recognize that energy is a national \ndefense issue. So I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before we recessed subject to the call of \nthe Chair, I called up amendment No. 1735. I want to read it again \nbecause, as I stated before, to even consider that our energy \ndependence upon foreign sources is not a defense issue I think is \nludicrous.\n  Instead of offering the long amendment, I have merely offered a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that says:\n\n       Sense of Senate on Availability of Energy-Related Supplies \n     for the Armed Forces.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Senate should, before the adjournment of the first session of \n     the 107th Congress, take action on comprehensive national \n     energy security legislation, including energy production and \n     energy conservation measures, to ensure that there is an \n     adequate supply of energy for the Armed Forces.\n\n  I think the strongest point we can make about our dependency upon the \nMiddle East is the fact that the most rapidly growing contributor to \nour energy supply in the Middle East, Iraq, is a country with which we \nare at war. It is absurd not to at least make this commitment as a \nsense of the Senate to get this done.\n  I ask this amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a motion that the Chair rule this \namendment is dilatory.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator withhold that motion for just a moment \nso I can ask a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I assure you, if you make the motion and the Chair rules \nit is not in order--I think if the Chair read it very carefully, it \nwould be in order, but if it rules that it is not in order, I will not \nchallenge the ruling of the Chair for obvious reasons. I do want as \nmuch as anyone in the Senate an authorization to pass, and pass \nquickly. I know if we had that motion and overruled the ruling of the \nChair, that would open it up and it would be disaster and we would not \nget a bill. So I would not do that. I am not going to.\n  I ask you not make that motion, but if you do make the motion, I \nencourage the Chair to realize and read--this is not the amendment I \nhad before. This is merely directly relating to defense.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been advised by my friend from \nDelaware he wishes to speak, and of course postcloture he has a right \nto speak for up to an hour. I would not stand in his way of doing that, \nso I withdraw my previous point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wanted to speak on a matter of strategic \nairlift capability, but I do not want to get in the way of the sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I would like to \nsay this, if I could. Obviously, we are not going to vote on the energy \npackage that the House passed as an amendment to this bill. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and I have spoken. I don't think that is appropriate. \nHaving said that, if we have not learned any other lesson from the \nevents of 3 weeks ago, I hope we have learned that this country needs \nan energy policy.\n  I finished my active-duty tour of the Navy in 1973 and went to the \nUniversity of Delaware on the GI bill. My first recollection of being \nin Newark, DE, was sitting in a line trying to buy gas for my car. That \nwas 28 years ago. We did not have an energy policy then; we don't have \nan energy policy today; and we need one today a lot more than we did \nthen.\n  Mr. President, 28 years ago about a third of the oil we consumed in \nthis Nation was coming from places outside of our Nation's border. \nToday it is almost 60 percent, and we still have no energy policy. My \nhope is that by the time we adjourn from this first session later this \nyear, we will have taken up the legislation we are working on in the \nEnergy Committee on which I serve and be in a position to go to \nconference with the House on a very important matter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to my friend from Delaware, that is exactly what \nthis amendment does. It is a sense of the Senate to do exactly what he \nhas suggested. I certainly think it would be appropriate at this time \nto include this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I retain my time. Whether this is germane \nor not I don't know, but I know the issue is relevant and it is an \nimportant issue for our country and for this body. It is my hope, \nspeaking to my friend and our leader from Nevada, that before we leave \nhere we will have taken up and passed a comprehensive energy policy for \nour country, which we desperately need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the majority leader many \ntimes in the last week about this issue of energy policy. The majority \nleader, myself, and Senator Levin--if he were here--recognize the \nimportance of developing an energy policy. I agree with my friend from \nDelaware.\n  I was Lieutenant Governor of the State of Nevada during that time. I \ncame back and had meetings with Vice President Ford as a representative \nof the National Lieutenant Governors Conference. The purpose of that \nmeeting was to talk about energy.\n  The first energy czar was a man named Bill Simon, who later came to \nthe Department of Energy.\n  There is no question we need to do something about energy policy in \nthis country. There is no question about it. Senator Daschle, the \nmajority leader, realizes that. He wants to move to an energy bill just \nas quickly as is possible. But we have lots of problems in this country \nas a result of what happened on September 11 in New York.\n  It only exacerbates the problem as it relates to energy. We \nunderstand that. I have spoken to Senator Bingaman several times in the \npast week. He is doing his very best to report out a bill. I have \nspoken to the minority leader. The place that Republicans and Democrats \nwant to go is basically the same. Probably 75 to 80 percent of the \nthings that both parties want energywise we can all agree on. Some of \nthe other things we can't agree on. One example, of course, is ANWR, \nwhich is a real problem.\n  We understand the intentions of the Senator from Oklahoma. I have \nspoken to him many times on this issue.\n  The majority leader is going to get to the energy bill--hopefully \nthis year--as quickly as he can. We know we have to do something with \nan airline safety bill. We have a stimulus package. We have workers who \nhave been displaced. We have to do something about that. We have to \nfinish this very important Defense bill. It is important. We are so \nhappy that the Senate invoked cloture. We have 13 appropriations bills \nwe have to complete. We have a lot of work to do. The majority leader \nrecognizes that more than anybody else.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment filed by my \nfriend from Oklahoma is dilatory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't know what the order is right now. \nThe Senator from Delaware may have the floor. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The floor is open.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand what the Senator from Nevada, \nthe distinguished assistant majority leader, said. The problem is that \nwe have been talking about this now--I personally, since the eighties \nwhen then-Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel and I would tour the \nNation to explain to the Nation that our dependency on foreign sources \nof oil for our ability to fight a war was not an energy issue; it was a \nnational security issue. At that time, we were 37-percent dependent on \nforeign sources of oil for\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\nour ability to fight a war. Now it is much more serious. We have gone \nthrough the 1990 Persian Gulf war. I think everyone realizes that.\n  The problem I have is the statement of the Senator from Nevada that \nnothing is going to happen, that this is merely a sense of the Senate. \nI know the Chair has ruled it is not germane. I will not challenge that \nand put in jeopardy the Defense authorization bill. I don't want to do \nthat.\n  I only say this: Talk is cheap. We have been sitting around talking \nabout it. The statement made by the Senator from Nevada is the same \nstatement they made back in the 1980s and all during the 1990s. Every \ntime we try to bring up an energy bill, they say: Yes, we all want it. \nYet do they really want it?\n  We will continue in our efforts. I will continue in such a way as to \nnot jeopardize in any way the Defense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I say from this side of the aisle that we \nwelcome the decision not to challenge the bill so that we can go \nforward. The points the Senator made are well taken. Our Nation's trade \ndeficit this year will exceed $300 billion. We consume oil from other \nplaces around the world. As sure as we are meeting here today, some of \nthose billions of dollars we are paying for oil from other sources--\nincluding from places where people do not like us very much--are surely \ngoing to fuel the kind of terrorism which happened 3 weeks ago this \nmorning for a whole host of reasons.\n  I pledge to work with my friend from Oklahoma and others on the \nEnergy Committee to get this legislation moving and out of committee. \nThere is a lot on which we can agree. ANWR may be one. On some points \nwe disagree. A lot we can agree on. We need to do that and move.\n  I really want to say this morning a word or two with respect to the \nDefense authorization bill as it pertains to our strategic defense \ncapability.\n  The tragedy of 3 weeks ago this morning left many dead. There are a \nnumber of uncertainties that grow out of those attacks: Who planned \nthem? Who executed them? Who funded them? Who supported them? Who \nharbors the terrorists today? How will we respond?\n  Amid those uncertainties, there are a number of things we know for \nsure. They include the fact that this war is going to be unlike any war \nwe have fought in my lifetime and before--unlike World War II, in which \nmany of our fathers served, unlike Korea, unlike Vietnam, where my \ngeneration served, and unlike the Persian Gulf war barely a decade ago.\n  This we know: Our success in this war against terrorism will depend \non many factors:\n\n  The readiness of our forces we are deploying;\n  Our ability in gathering the support of the other civilized nations \nof the world to join us in this war;\n  The quality of the intelligence, the reliability of the intelligence \nthat we gather and that we receive from others with whom we work;\n  Our ability to understand our intelligence and to act effectively in \na timely manner in response to that intelligence;\n  Our ability to deploy covert operations and do so successfully.\n  And our success in the world also depends in no small part on our \nability to move quickly at a moment's notice large numbers of men and \nwomen and materiel from the United States to other parts of the world.\n  There are many military bases around the world, out of which I used \nto operate as a naval flight officer, that are closed today. While we \nwork with nations that are sympathetic to our cause against terrorists \nin order to try to secure air space and to try to secure airfields to \nuse, the fact of the matter is we simply don't have the bases to deploy \ntroops that we used to at airfields and ports. We depend more than ever \non an air bridge that is going to be comprised of C-17s and on an air \nbridge that will be comprised of C-5s.\n  When I was a member of the active-duty forces, even though I was in \nthe Navy, I flew a fair amount on C-141s, a transport aircraft that the \nAir Force uses. They are the workhorse for the Air Force. C-5s were \nintroduced, and we had a combination of the C-141 and the C-5 to \nprovide an air bridge in earlier wars.\n  The C-141 is old today. It is being retired. Its place is being taken \nby the C-17, a terrific aircraft. The C-17 carries about half the load \nof a C-5. While it has pretty good legs and can travel a pretty long \ndistance, it doesn't have the legs or the ability to travel far \ndistances that the C-5 enjoys. The C-5 has been with us more than two \ndecades--C-5As and now C-5Bs. The aircraft is about half the age of the \nB-52.\n  I was struck when we started to ratchet up to see B-52s being called \non again to serve our Nation. It has been around 50 years and is still \nready to work for us. The C-5, having half the years and age of the B-\n52, is certainly able to work a bit longer alongside the C-17.\n  Someone gave me a sheet of paper today with a picture of the C-5. \nThis picture shows some idea of the life remaining in the C-5 with \nrespect to its ability to play a major role in our strategic airlift \ncapability. The fuselage is good for another 30-plus years; \nstabilizers, another 40-plus years; wing service, over 50 years; the \nfuselage, another 50-plus years; forward fuselage, there is plenty of \ndurability left in the C-5 aircraft.\n  There are two things the C-5 needs in order for us to be able to \nmaximize its effectiveness in this war and in any other war that may \ncome our way over the next 40 years. One is an avionics package. When \nyou sit in the cockpit of the C-5 and look at the instrumentation, you \nthink you are looking at a plane that is 25 years old; and you are. The \naircraft needs a new avionics package. The bill before us today \nprovides a very substantial step to enable us to put that avionics \npackage in place in the C-5 to enhance its capability.\n  Another major component of this bill deals with the engines that are \nmounted on the wings of the C-5. Most of the new airliners that are \nflying in our skies and around the world today have engines that can \ngenerally fly for 10,000 hours before they need to be changed. The \nengines on the C-5s, which I said earlier are over 20 years old, those \nengines need to be changed about every 2,500 hours. We need to \nreengine, if you will, the C-5s. If we do that, with modern engine \ntechnology, we will be able to get 10,000 hours between engine changes, \nas they do in the commercial fleets.\n  The combination of those two steps--to introduce into and incorporate \ninto our C-5 aircraft, the C-5As and C-5Bs, a modern avionics package, \nand to also reengine the aircraft in years going forth--will enable us \nto fully benefit from the 30 or 40 years that are still left in those \nplanes. There are a lot of air miles to be traveled, a lot of troops to \nbe carried, a lot of tanks and helicopters and trucks to be moved. The \nC-5 and the C-17 can do it.\n  With the adoption of this legislation, our air bridge from this \ncountry to other troubled points around the world will be reinforced \nand made stronger for this generation and for generations to come.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. It is a \nfiled amendment. It is amendment No. 1760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hatch, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Specter, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 1760.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the condition precedent for the effectiveness of \n        the dual compensation authority provided in section 651)\n\n       Beginning on page 207, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 209, line 12, and insert the following:\n       (d) Effective Date.--(1) The amendments made by this \n     section shall take effect on October 1, 2002.\n       (2) No benefits may be paid to any person by reason of \n     section 1414 of title 10, United State Code, as added by the \n     amendment\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\n     made by subsection (a), for any period before the effective \n     date under paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment along \nwith Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nEdwards, Mr. Specter, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. \nCantwell, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDorgan, and Mr. Bill Nelson.\n  Our amendment will correct an inequity for veterans who have retired \nfrom our Armed Forces with a service-connected disability.\n  This amendment is identical to the bill I sponsored on January 24, S. \n170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001. The Retired Pay \nRestoration Act currently has almost 80 cosponsors, 80 Senators, \napproximately. This clearly illustrates the bipartisan support for this \nlegislation.\n  As with the bill, this amendment will permit retired members of the \nArmed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive \nmilitary retired pay concurrently with veterans disability \ncompensation.\n  In 1891, the original inequitable 19th century law was passed to \nprohibit the concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA \ndisability compensation. When this original law was enacted, the United \nStates had an extremely small standing army. Only a portion of our \nArmed Forces consisted of career soldiers.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of Federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability. The law simply discriminates against career \nmilitary men and women. I repeat, under the current law, if you retire \nfrom the military and have a service-connected disability, you have to \nwaive your retirement pay. When I first heard about this, I could not \nbelieve it. I thought my staff had given me bad advice. They had not.\n  But adding to this injustice is the fact that the Federal employee \nhas been able to collect VA disability compensation while working for \nthe Federal Government--but not if you are in the military. You can \nwork for the Department of Energy or the Park Service, and if you have \na service-connected disability, you can draw your whole retirement pay. \nBut if you retire from the military, no chance, you have to waive that \nor a portion of it. The civil service retiree may receive both his \ncivil service retirement and VA disability with no offset at all.\n  Disabled military retirees are only entitled to receive disability \ncompensation if they agree to waive their retirement pay or a portion \nof it equal to the amount of the disability compensation. This \nrequirement clearly discriminates unfairly against disabled career \nsoldiers by requiring them to essentially pay their own disability \ncompensation.\n  If you are in the military, and you get out with a service-connected \ndisability, you can draw all that pay unless you retire from the \nmilitary. If you work for Sears & Roebuck, or if you work for the \nInterior Department, you get it all, but not if you are retired from \nthe military. How unfair.\n  To understand the law's unfairness, one must look at why the \nGovernment pays retirees and disabled veterans. Military retirement pay \nis earned compensation for the extraordinary demands and sacrifices \ninherent in a military career. It is the promised reward for servicing \nat least two decades, and many times more, under conditions most \nAmericans find intolerable. You are told when to get up, when to go to \nbed, where you are going to live, and what you are going to do. That is \nwhat the military is all about.\n\n  Veterans disability compensation, on the other hand, is recompense \nfor pain, suffering, and lost future earning power caused by a service-\nconnected illness or injury.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation were earned and \nawarded for entirely different purposes. Current law ignores the \ndistinction between these two entitlements.\n  One of our valued staff on the minority side, every time there is a \nmilitary bill, comes in this Chamber proudly wearing on his lapel a \nmedal, the Silver Star. He wears that very proudly. But if he has a \nservice-connected disability--and he may have one--he can draw that \nbecause he is not a retiree from the military or, if he is, he cannot. \nIt does not make sense. It is not fair. Current law ignores the \ndistinction between these two entitlements. Military retirement pay and \ndisability compensation were both earned and awarded for entirely \ndifferent purposes.\n  This amendment represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice \nthat has existed for a long, long time, for far too long. Allowing \ndisabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation concurrently will restore fairness to Federal \nretirement policy.\n  It is unfair for our veterans not to receive both of these payments \nconcurrently. Today we have 560,000 disabled military men and women who \nhave sacrificed a lot for this country. Today nearly one and a half \nmillion Americans dedicate their lives to the defense of our Nation. \nAnd that is going up as we speak. The U.S. military force is unmatched \nin terms of power, training, and ability. Our great Nation is \nrecognized as the world's only superpower, a status which is largely \ndue to the sacrifices that veterans have made during the last century.\n  This past weekend I read a book written by Stephen Ambrose. It is his \nlatest book. It is about B-24s. It is the history of these bombers \nduring World War II. It is a fascinating history. The losses of B-24 \npilots and crews were unbelievable. They were shot down all the time. \nThey were big, heavy, awkward airplanes, and very hard to fly. And they \nlost a lot of them in noncombat situations. But it is an example of the \nsacrifices made by people who have served our country in the military.\n  Why should not someone who flew a B-24, has a service-connected \ndisability, and has retired from the military, be able to draw that \ndisability compensation as a result of being hurt flying a B-24?\n  Rather than honoring their commitment and bravery, the Federal \nGovernment has chosen instead to perpetuate a 110-year-old injustice.\n  I know the Senate will seriously consider passing this amendment. \nWith almost 80 cosponsors, it is a fair statement that this amendment \nshould pass. I hope the Senate will pass this amendment to end at last \nthis disservice to our retired military.\n  Some believe this amendment may be too expensive. This country has \nsaved lots of money by not doing the right thing in years past. We have \n1,000 World War II veterans who die every day. From today to tomorrow, \nthere will be 1,000 funerals held for World War II veterans. Since last \nJune, we have fallen a little short. It has not been quite 1,000 a day. \nIt has been close. Since then we have lost 465,000 veterans. These \ndedicated service people will never have the ability to enjoy their two \nwell-deserved entitlements. To delay any action on this amendment means \nwe will continue to deny fundamental fairness to thousands of our \nNation's retirees.\n  If we can pass this legislation and give a World War II veteran 1 \nmonth of the compensation they deserve before they pass on, we should \ndo that.\n  This amendment is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations--I cannot name them all--the Military Coalition, the \nNational Military/Veterans Alliance, the American Legion, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, and the Uniformed Services Disabled Retirees, plus many \nmore.\n  This is the right thing to do, and we must eliminate this century of \nsacrifice. Our veterans have earned this. Now is our chance to honor \ntheir service to the Nation.\n  I hope this legislation passes overwhelmingly and that it is not \ntaken out in conference. We passed the amendment last year. Out of 100 \npercent of what we needed, we maybe got 2 percent to help just a few \npeople. We need to help them all.\n  It is not easy for me to stand here and say that 1,000 World War II \nveterans die every day, but that is a fact. They do. Many of those \nWorld War II veterans are today receiving unfair payments by this \nGovernment. They are not able to receive their retirement and their \ndisability. They have to waive part of their retirement. That is \nunfair.\n  I hope this amendment is adopted. I am not going to require a vote on \nit. I am not one who believes a big heavy vote helps in conference. \nEveryone\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\nknows this has almost 80 Senate cosponsors. It is something the \nveterans community supports wholeheartedly.\n  I was talking to one of the Armed Services staff people today. They \nget more mail on this issue than any other issue because people are \ndesperate. They know they are dying off.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted. I repeat, I am not going to \nrequire a recorded vote. But the conscience of this Senate calls out \nfor recognizing the sacrifices made by these veterans and that we adopt \nthis amendment in the Senate and make sure the same happens in \nconference because they deserve this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. REID. Are we going to take action on this amendment? Is the \nSenator from Kansas speaking on my amendment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I was not planning to, unless the \ndistinguished Senator would ask me to do so. I have worked with him at \ngreat length on the Ethics Committee. Is the amendment ethical?\n  Mr. REID. The two managers are not here, Mr. President. I have no \nobjection, if the Senator from Kansas is going to file another \namendment, to setting mine aside.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think the agreement was, at least as far as this \nSenator understood, that I was going to have 20 minutes to talk about \nan amendment I had planned on introducing. I am not in a position to \nacquiesce to the Senator's request. I would have to check with our \nleadership in that regard. I have no doubt the Senator has an \noutstanding amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has every right under postcloture to speak for \nan hour on anything relating to defense as he wishes. I know he has \nbeen a very stalwart member of the committee and has done so much for \ndefense issues over the years. I certainly look forward to listening to \nhim for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n   Establishing a Select Committee on Homeland Security and Terrorism\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in the interest of germaneness and to \nmove this bill along, I am acceding to the request by the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and Senator \nWarner, our distinguished ranking member, in that I had intended on \nintroducing an amendment. I am going to speak to the amendment. I think \nmy decision will be to simply lay down the amendment as a freestanding \nbill.\n  Having said that, I rise this morning to warn my Senate colleagues \nabout an urgent issue facing the Senate and this Nation. This issue has \nbeen identified many times now by various respected commissions, by \nleaders within the military, the academic, political, and national \nsecurity communities. Whether we admit it or not, the need for action \nis instinctively understood by most Members of this body.\n  However, despite months and years of hearings, testimony, and \nwarnings, until September 11 there was little sense of urgency or \ndesire to make changes to the structure of the Senate required to \naddress the problems of homeland security and terrorism.\n  I know the distinguished majority leader and our Republican leader \nand a few other Senators and staff have certainly given this \nrecognition serious and careful consideration. As the former chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities within the \nArmed Services Committee, now the ranking member--the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu is now the chairman--I come to \nthis issue after 3 years of hearings and testimony from virtually all \nthe experts and more than 40 agencies of the Government.\n  It gives me little solace and a great deal of frustration to find the \nfine members of the subcommittee and our excellent staff in the role of \nPaul Revere, but unable to awaken the Federal Government, our \ncolleagues, and the American people.\n\n  Let me share two paragraphs from the very first report our \nsubcommittee issued to the Congress, to the press, and to the public:\n\n       The terrorist threat to our citizens, both military \n     personnel and civilians at home and abroad is real and \n     growing. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     individual acts of terrorism have dramatically raised the \n     stakes and increased the potential of massive casualties in \n     the event of the terrorist attack.\n\n  I further quote from the first report of the subcommittee:\n\n       Further, the serious prospect that known terrorist Osama \n     bin Laden or other terrorists might use biological and \n     chemical weapons as well as individual acts of terrorism is \n     of great concern. His organization is just one of \n     approximately a dozen terrorist groups. bin Laden, for \n     example, has called the acquisition of these weapons ``a \n     religious duty'' and noted that how to use them is up to us.\n\n  My colleagues, that was 3 years ago. We also stressed in our report \nthat to confront this continuing and growing threat, it was critical \nthat our governmentwide efforts to combat terrorism be coordinated and \nclearly focused. We noted at that time there were approximately 40 \nFederal departments and agencies with jurisdiction in the fight against \nterrorism.\n  Last spring, members of the Intelligence, Armed Services, and \nAppropriations Committees for the first time joined together and asked \nthese same agencies to testify. All claimed jurisdiction. Many claimed \nthey were in charge. We asked them three things: What is your mission? \nWhat do you really do? Who do you report to?\n  The bottom line: The hearings demonstrated that too many Federal \nagencies do not have a firm grasp of their roles and responsibilities \nfor preventing and preparing for and responding to acts of domestic \nterrorism.\n  This patchwork quilt approach is not a substitute for a national \nstrategy, the purpose of which would be to coordinate our Federal \nagencies into an effective force. It seems to me the administration is \nnow working overtime to get that job done. Obviously, the \nadministration has the attention of all Members of the House and Senate \nand the American people.\n\n  Along with that summation, the three committee chairmen and two \nsubcommittee chairmen sent a list of recommendations to the Bush \nadministration. We responded after those hearings. Now that situation \nhas dramatically changed. The attack on the United States, the deaths \nof more than 6,000 Americans, and the very real probability that other \nattacks on the United States by terrorists are not only possible but \nprobable require--require--that the Senate take action now to create a \nsingle entity to focus the action of the Senate--not the Federal \nagencies, not the House, but the Senate--on homeland security and \nterrorism.\n  I remind my colleagues that as tragic as September 11 was, it was not \nthe first act of terrorism in this regard: The 1993 bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center, the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole --the Intelligence \nCommittee, by the way, is still progressing on an investigation in \nregard to the U.S.S. Cole--and the bombing of our embassies. These \nearlier attacks and the promises and threats that prefaced them should \nhave been the clarion call to prepare adequately for homeland security. \nThey were not. If we now fail to properly organize and coordinate our \nactions in the Senate as the Nation fights a war against terrorism, we \nwill be part of the problem, not the solution.\n  We do not now speak with one voice. As a body and as individual \nMembers, we do not know all of the actions being taken within the \nvarious committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction or self-declared \njurisdiction over homeland security and terrorism. I know this for sure \nin regard to reading about hearings that were held 2 weeks before, \nhearings we held in the Emerging Threats Subcommittee with the same \nwitnesses, or that there were hearings planned 2 weeks down the road \nfrom hearings we had planned, not that we had the exact answer to the \nproblem by any means. Bluntly put, the Senate cannot be a contributing \npartner with the Executive to win the war against terrorism unless we \nare properly organized.\n  On the other hand, we have done some good work. Last year, the \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, in an attempt to reduce \nconfusion and focus action, required the Department of Defense to \nestablish a single Assistant Secretary to speak for the Department. \nMembers of the Senate Appropriations Committee have worked hard to \nrequire a similar single point of responsibility in the Department of \nJustice.\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\n  Last Thursday, the President of the United States designated \nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a former colleague of ours in the House, \nto head up a new Cabinet-level organization to focus attention and to \nspeak for the administration on homeland security.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives of the United States \nestablished a subcommittee to be the single voice for the House. The \nSenate leadership knows, I am sure--I have talked with them at length--\nthat we must create a single committee in some form to coordinate and \nto prioritize initiatives and programs concerning homeland security and \nterrorism.\n  Mr. President, we have not done so. I say to my colleagues, it is our \nturn to act. The select committee I am recommending with this \nlegislation will allow us to speak with one voice and be a key partner \nwith the administration and the House of Representatives in the war on \nterrorism.\n  Before I outline my proposed legislation, let me give some background \nregarding this urgent need.\n\n  First, there is precedent for creating a select committee to address \na very significant problem. The Truman committee: Convinced that waste \nand corruption were strangling the Nation's efforts to mobilize itself \nfor war in Europe, President Truman conceived the idea for a special \nSenate committee to investigate the national defense program. Many \nconsider this to be one of the most productive committees in the \nSenate's history.\n  The Arms Control Observer Group provided a way for Senate leaders to \nobserve arms reduction talks and anticipate issues that might block \neventual ratification.\n  Y2K was created to examine the year 2000 problem in the executive and \njudicial branches of the Federal Government, State governments, and the \nprivate sector operations in the United States and abroad. Everybody \nowes a debt of thanks to the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett, for his leadership in that regard.\n  Each of these organizations was created to solve a particular problem \nin extraordinary times, and they proved to be invaluable. This is an \nextraordinary time.\n  To combat terrorism and protect our homeland is an issue demanding \nunity of effort in the Senate. Several studies and commissions have \nbeen conducted on the threat of terrorism and the preparedness of \nAmerica to cope with an attack. We all know what they are. There is the \nBremer commission, the Hart-Rudman commission, the Gilmore commission, \nand a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies; the \nacronym is CSIS. Each had elements of agreement. They all recommended \nthe following:\n  No. 1, the threat to our homeland is real. It is not a matter of if \nbut when. Sadly, we know the answer to when. The people who planned the \nterrorist attack and killed 19 of our service men and women on the \nU.S.S. Cole are the same kind of people who planned the attack in New \nYork and Washington and the same kind of people who are planning the \nnext attack.\n  Point No. 2, from all of these commissions, all of these experts: The \nexecutive branch is fragmented and poorly organized to prepare or deal \nwith such an attack. The President is stepping up to that issue. So is \nTom Ridge.\n  Point No. 3, the Nation needs a strategy to address the problems in \ninternational terrorism. I think the President is doing a good job on \nthat respect with the help of his Cabinet, with the help also of the \ninternational community.\n  Point No. 4--and this is the point I want to make as of today--the \nCongress is as poorly organized and fragmented as the executive branch.\n  Finally, if we need another example of why we must coordinate our \nactions on this issue, we need only look at the various legislative \nproposals moving through the Senate to direct the administration to \nreorganize the executive branch to face this war on terrorism. These \nactions are certainly well meaning.\n  I do not oppose each or any of them, and I do not perjure their \nintent or the intent of the distinguished Senators who have introduced \nthe bills. But, I say to my colleagues, could we not better serve the \nNation in this critical time if there were a single select committee to \ncoordinate and prioritize our efforts?\n  Could not a single committee serve the Nation better and work more \nclosely with the President than all of the various committees we have \nnow with some measure of jurisdiction over homeland security and \nterrorism?\n\n  How many committees and subcommittees must the administration meet \nwith to take action now, to put politics second and America first?\n  How many chairmen and ranking members must Governor Ridge meet with \nand convince before he can take action?\n  Could not a single coordinating and prioritizing committee better \nserve the Nation during this war on terrorism and serve the Senate as \nwell?\n  During the hearings of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, we asked \nall the witnesses to state what keeps them up at night, what was their \nbiggest worry, and to prioritize homeland security threats.\n  Their suggestions mirror the threats now receiving national press \nattention and the priority challenges that now face Governor Ridge as \nhe comes to the Senate asking for immediate consideration and expedited \naction.\n  The first concern mentioned by our witnesses was the danger of an \nattack using bioterrorism. Goodness knows, we have seen headlines about \nthat. The probability is low or perhaps medium, but the risk is severe, \nif not chaotic. Were I to be asked by Governor Ridge and his staff, I \nwould recount that concern and recommend immediate funding and policy \nreforms.\n  I see the distinguished former chairman of the full Armed Services \nCommittee, the ranking member, the gentleman I like to refer to as the \n``chairman emeritus,'' the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who is \nvery much aware of an exercise that was just taken at Andrews Air Force \nBase called ``Dark Winter,'' the use of biological weaponry. The \nresults were very grim.\n  I think both Senator Warner and this Senator would meet with Governor \nRidge and say: Tom, this is something that must be addressed and is \nbeing addressed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nSecretary Thompson. But on whose door will the Governor knock? \nCertainly, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; \ncertainly the Armed Services Committee; perhaps our subcommittee; the \nIntelligence Committee; and the Government oversight committee, and, of \ncourse, the Appropriations Committee and the appropriate subcommittee \non the Appropriations Committee. And let's not ever forget the growing \ndanger of agriterrorism. So, obviously, he better knock on the door of \nthe sometimes powerful Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  The second priority concern stressed by the experts was the danger of \na cyber-attack, or information warfare. So Director Ridge doubtlessly \nwould knock on the door of the Commerce Committee again, as well as the \nArmed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee, doubtlessly the \nBanking Committee and others. Now I could go on, but I think my point \nhas been made.\n  The third priority concern was the danger of a chemical attack, and \nthe fourth, the danger of any possible use by a state organization or a \nnonstate organization of terrorists using a weapon of mass destruction.\n  As the September 11 tragedy demonstrated, there were few threats that \nwere not discussed or that will be as Governor and now Director Ridge \ncomes to the Senate to brief Senators to ask for our advice, our \nexpertise, and our support, and we have that. We have had many \nhearings. We have many staff experts, and we have good judgments as \nevidenced by the Senator from Virginia and others who have worked so \nhard on this issue. That is how it should be.\n  We have a great many Senators, as I have indicated, who have \nconsiderable expertise and experience. They can, and we will, be part \nof the answer, but we do not have time to introduce bill after bill and \nhold hearing after hearing and request Governor Ridge to knock on \nvirtually every committee and subcommittee door of the Senate in a \nmerry-go-round of turf contests.\n  I know that senior committee chairmen and senior ranking members and \neven subcommittee members and ranking subcommittee members care about\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nturfs. Scratch their turf, and it is like Ferdinand the bull. He does \nnot smell flowers; he gets upset.\n  I say again, the House has acted. The administration has acted. We \nhave not. It is time. Last Sunday, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld issued \nthe long awaited Quadrennial Defense Review. In his forward he states:\n\n       The vast array of complex policy operational and even \n     constitutional issues concerning how we organize and prepare \n     to defend the American people are now receiving unprecedented \n     action throughout the United States Government. Importantly, \n     since the scope of homeland defense security responsibilities \n     span an array of Federal, State, and local organizations, it \n     will also require enhanced interagency processes and \n     capabilities to effectively defend the United States against \n     attacks.\n\n  Then he went on to say: The recent establishment of the Office of \nHomeland Security will galvanize this vital effort.\n  That is the word, ``galvanize.'' ``Galvanize,'' that is the word, to \nbe sure. Various dictionaries define ``galvanize'' as follows, and I \nquote:\n\n       To arouse to awareness and action; to spur; to startle.\n\n  Erskine Childers of dictionary fame said:\n\n       A blast in my ear like the voice of 50 trombones galvanized \n     me into full consciousness and action.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate of the United States will not be able to \ngalvanize or even play a significant part in winning the war against \nterrorism if in coming to the Senate the President, Tom Ridge, and the \nAmerican people have to knock on 100 doors and listen to 100 different \ntrombones. That is not galvanizing anything.\n  My proposed legislation would do the following: First, establish a \nSelect Committee on Homeland Security and Terrorism. It would be \ncochaired by the majority and the minority leaders. It would have \nmembership designated by the leadership from committees with preeminent \nand primary jurisdiction. Note I said preeminent and primary \njurisdiction over homeland security and terrorism. And it would be \nresponsible to coordinate and prioritize initiatives and programs of \nthe U.S. Government concerning homeland security and terrorism.\n  It would submit to the Senate appropriate proposals for legislation \nand report to the Senate concerning such activities and programs.\n  This is a modest proposal. It is not written in stone. This proposal \nis not perfect. There is no such thing as a perfect bill. It is one \nthat does not take authority away from committees, despite a lot of \ndiscussion that that might be the thing to do; the committees that \ncertainly currently have the jurisdiction over these matters. It does \nallow the Senate to have a single voice and a single point of contact \nthe administration can deal with as we fight this war on terrorism.\n  It is the right thing to do. It must be done now if the Senate is to \nbe a key player and a meaningful partner in this Nation's war on \nterrorism.\n  I have a more detailed summary of the bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Roberts Resolution Establishing a Select Committee\n\n       1. Establishes a Select Committee on Homeland Security & \n     Terrorism.\n       2. Select Committee would coordinate and prioritize federal \n     initiatives toward genuine homeland security and preventing \n     incidents of terrorism in the U.S.\n       3. Select Committee will have a legislative jurisdiction \n     and shall have referred to it all legislation substantively \n     connected to addressing homeland security and terrorism \n     challenges.\n       4. Composition of Select Committee would be: two co-\n     chairmen (Majority Leader and Minority Leader), two vice-\n     chairmen (appointed by majority and minority leaders), \n     chairmen and ranking members of Senate committees with clear \n     jurisdiction (as determined by leaders), four members not \n     sitting on such committees, and four members with expertise \n     in the area of homeland security and terrorism (these eight \n     members will also be appointed by the majority and minority \n     leaders).\n       5. The Select Committee will hold hearings, compel the \n     attendance of witnesses, draft legislation, report \n     legislation, and generally be the focal point for the \n     Senate's legislative and policy response to the challenge of \n     keeping the American homeland safe and prepared in regards to \n     incidents of terrorism and the phenomenon of 21st century \n     terrorism (where each incident is exponentially more \n     catastrophic than the last).\n       6. Select Committee will periodically report to the Senate \n     and the committees of the Senate on the federal long term \n     policy response to challenge of homeland security and \n     terrorism.\n       7. Select Committee will require an annual report from the \n     President outlining the coordinated federal long term policy \n     response to challenge of homeland security and terrorism.\n       8. Select Committee is to compliment (by coordination and \n     prioritization) the work of other committees in the Senate on \n     homeland security and terrorism. Other committee jurisdiction \n     is not removed by this proposal.\n       9. After introduction, the resolution will be referred to \n     the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for further \n     consideration.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my distinguished \ncolleague, a member of the Armed Services Committee. Let the Record \nreflect he was the chairman of the Emerging Threat Subcommittee, which \nas a new chairman I created many years ago. Many of us on the \ncommittee, preeminent and foremost our distinguished colleague, Senator \nRoberts, in his tireless efforts, brought to the attention first of the \ncommittee, then the Senate as a whole, the serious looming threats \nacross the board. Often he was alone in those efforts, but he had me by \nhis side. I say the two of us, I suppose, in some respects at times had \nto forge ahead.\n  I do not say that in a partisan way because both sides of the aisle, \nin terms of our committee, at times had to push hard to get measures \nthrough and to eventually get what money we could from the \nAppropriations Committee to support the initiatives of the former \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats.\n  We are fortunate the Senator remains as the ranking member under the \nchairmanship of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  I have not had an opportunity to examine the format of the Senator \nfor this important initiative that must be taken at some point by the \nleadership of the Senate and hopefully the endorsement of the full \nSenate. From what I have heard of the Senator's remarks, I think it is \na landmark place from which to begin to examine this question.\n  If I might inquire, perhaps in the Senator's extended remarks he \ncovers the budgetary authority. That, as the Senator knows, is very \nimportant. For example, in our bill now pending before the Senate for \nthe Armed Forces for fiscal year 2000, we have a number of billions of \ndollars directed towards the President's initiatives, the initiatives \nof the Congress of the United States, to thwart terrorism. How would \nthat be treated under the proposal the Senator from Kansas has? Would \nthat jurisdiction over those funds--would we have, should we say, \ncoequal authority of, say, the Armed Services Committee and other \ncommittees that have jurisdiction over portions of terrorism?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to respond. \nThe second point, which will be inserted in the Record following my \nremarks, the select committee would coordinate and prioritize the \nFederal initiatives toward genuine homeland security and preventing \nincidents of terrorism.\n  It would have a legislative jurisdiction and have referred to it all \nlegislation substantially connected to addressing homeland security and \nterrorism challenges, but the budget authority, of course, stemming \nfrom the Budget Committee and all the work they do and all the work the \nappropriators do would still remain in the Armed Services Committee. It \nis more of a clearinghouse.\n  I suspect Director Ridge would come to the select committee, indicate \nhis advice and counsel from the National Security Council, all that he \nhas talked to, that we have the top five priorities and that, as a \nresult, would go to our committee. We would recommend to the committees \nof jurisdiction, which I would think would be no more than four or \nfive. They would not lose their jurisdiction.\n  There was a great deal of concern, when I talked to various ranking \nmembers and chairmen of these committees, that they did not want to \nlose jurisdiction. Some thought about making them ex officio, but in \nterms of the budget authority, obviously the Senator from Kansas and \nthe distinguished\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\nchairman of the Armed Services Committee would have a direct say in \nterms of the authorization. It would be like everything else we do that \nis subject to our work with the appropriators.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might continue, one area of work of the Senator, as \nthe former chairman, and I presume now in this bill the current \nchairman, is to prioritize those funds that go to the National Guard \nsupport teams. We started out 3 years ago with I think 4, 5, 6. Our \ncommittee each year increased the number of teams, increased the \nfunding for the teams. Their teams would be the first responders; or \nmaybe the local police, fire, and other authorities would be the first \nresponders.\n\n  There was a problem because we only had so many teams for the 50 \nStates. How many teams are we up to now?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the distinguished Senator will continue to yield, we \nincreased that number by 22. There was a GAO report, as the Senator \nknows. He always sat as the presiding chair and now ranking member at \nthe subcommittee because of his intense interest. We would not have the \nsubcommittee focus on this problem without the leadership and \ninspiration of the Senator from Virginia.\n  The GAO issued a rather critical report in regard to the teams, what \nwe call civil support teams, the idea being that very well trained \nNational Guard units could be within 4 hours of any community to be one \nof the first responders and signal back to the Federal Government--now \nwith the FBI, with FEMA, with the Red Cross, with everybody concerned--\nexactly what the problem was.\n  That report found no fault in the raid teams. That report focused on \nthe lack of direction and leadership within the Department of Defense. \nWe fixed that problem with the help of the able staff, including the \nable staff member sitting to the Senator's right. He goes on periodic \ninspections to make sure these raid dreams are up to snuff. It means \nwithin 4 hours of anywhere in the United States you will have a crack \nprofessional and well-trained National Guard team to come in to \nimmediately recognize the problem, indicate to the first responder, and \nalso Washington, exactly what the problem is, and respond as fast as \npossible.\n  It was that initiative that the distinguished Senator mentioned to \nthis Senator, and we were able to increase the number of teams even \nbefore the Department of Defense clearly recognized that need.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wanted to discuss that. There was a clear and historic \nbipartisanship in the work by the committee.\n  I pose it as a question now: Supposing in a future budget coming \nbefore the Congress from President Bush's team, and Mr. Ridge would \nhave a voice, of course, and say, arbitrarily, he needed another 10 \nteams, and that funding is in the Department of Defense budget, and our \ncommittee decided we ought to have 20 teams. However, the new committee \nthat you envision would, I presume, get the budget request, as would \nthe Armed Services Committee, and would either have to agree with our \ncommittee or disagree, and if there is a disagreement, how do you \nresolve it?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The same way we resolved the problems with Y2K. The \nleadership would have to make a decision in regard to the \nprioritization of what the distinguished Senator is talking about.\n  I point out No. 8 in the summary of the bill. The select committee is \nto complement--complement, by coordination and prioritization--the work \nof other committees in the Senate on homeland security and terrorism. \nOther committee jurisdiction is not removed by this proposal. I cannot \nimagine that the Select Committee on Homeland Security and Terrorism \nwould not adhere to the recommendations of the Armed Services \nCommittee, more especially the subcommittee on which I serve, and also \nthe budget as submitted by the administration. The budget authority is \nmore of a notification authority to this select committee. It is not \n``triplication''--if there is such a word--in terms of the Budget \nCommittee.\n\n  I do not want in any way to tread on the expertise and the knowledge \nof the distinguished chairman and all the members of the committees \nthat have jurisdiction. The Senator might remember we had a chart that \nwe showed weeks ago, before September 11. The Senator may remember he \nwas an active participant when we had the 40 agencies that came in. We \nasked: What is your mission? Who do you report to? Who is in charge? As \na matter of fact, I think you were the Senator who showed up with the \nchart that showed it was a hodgepodge. It would be impossible for \nanyone to figure it out. I held up a much smaller chart of \n``stovepipes,'' if you will.\n  At that time, I thought there were five major committees that had \njurisdiction that somehow could recommend or at least be part of this \nselect committee, either ex officio or official. We had decided now to \nmake them members because I didn't want to scratch that term. I have \nsince found out there are eight, and there may be nine, and it may be \ngrowing more than that. It did affect our budget.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Record should reflect the important contribution by \nthat group of Senators. Senator Judd Gregg was in the leadership at \nthat time. You were present. Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator \nLevin attended a lot of these. We had 2 full days of hearings.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Senator Mikulski was very active, Senator Hollings was \nvery active, Senator Stevens was there, as I have indicated, and \nSenator Shelby on the Intelligence Committee. We had the Armed Services \nCommittee, Intelligence, and the appropriators.\n  Mr. WARNER. That was an important piece of work we did.\n  Again, if no standing committee gives up any jurisdiction, I am still \nhaving difficulty understanding exactly how this new committee will \nfunction. I ask the question in a supportive manner and in no way to \ninfer that I am not supporting the ultimate objective, especially of \nthe leadership itself, to establish such a format. If we don't have \nsome yielding of jurisdiction, I am not sure how that committee \nfunctions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield again, I will try to do this \none more time. We had plans A, B, C. The first plan was to create a \ntask force. Then we thought after September 11 that yet another task \nforce was not the thing to do. The task force was to be a clearinghouse \nof all the major committees that had that jurisdiction. The task force \nwas to at least let everybody know that the left hand knew what the \nright hand was doing. We have had meetings like that. Members come \nonce, staff members come later, and simply protect the turf of the \nsubcommittee or the committees.\n  We said: We will hold a hearing on that. Why would you want to hold a \nhearing when we already held one? With whom are you working downtown in \nterms of the agencies? And round and round and round. So we decided the \ntask force would not fit the bill.\n  Then we had another plan. This plan I call the Bennett plan, although \nI am not sure the distinguished Senator from Utah would take credit for \nit, or even should. But it was based on the committee that he chaired \nin regard to the Y2K challenge we had. In this particular case, you had \nthe majority leader, the minority leader designating two designees to \nbe vice chairmen, which we do. He called it the worker bees, so they \ncould get that done. They basically were in charge of that particular \neffort. It didn't mean that the Commerce Committee--I do not remember \nthe other main committee involved; perhaps it was the Governmental \nAffairs Committee; I may be misspeaking--could not introduce \nlegislation and have budget authority, which they did. It was an effort \nto make sure that the Senate of the United States was on top of this \nissue and everybody knew what was occurring.\n\n  When the leadership would come to Senator Bennett or Senator Dodd, \nthe other participant, they would say: This is our best recommendation.\n  I will say any senior committee chair who has a strong feeling, I \nunderstand that, but in the end it will have to be a decision by the \nexecutive, by our leadership, hopefully by a single committee that can \nserve as a clearinghouse to prioritize. I don't think we get into the \nbudgets that much.\n  Plan C is the one I have introduced to make sure your senior \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\nchairmen, or at least part of the action, are not ex officio. Plan C \nwas put in. First, this is flexible; this is not ``the'' plan.\n  I am trying to prompt action. Frankly, what I am trying to do when we \nhave a problem in Dodge City, and you have to use a cattle prod and \nstart to push a little bit, that is what we are doing. I think it is a \npretty good bill, but it may not be the best bill, and there may be \nanother way to approach this.\n  The distinguished Senator knows what has happened. We have been \ntalking about this now for 6 months.\n  Mr. WARNER. In fairness, Senator Lott has hosted several meetings--\nyou and I have been present--so he could look at all options on it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, I have been present.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to follow this carefully.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have discussed this with the minority leader. I gave a \nsimilar plan, and I said it is not so much whether it is this plan or \nthat plan, we must have a single select committee. We thought about a \nstanding committee, and we said: No, that is going too far. You know \nand I know that if you tread on the turf of an important committee \nchairman, they will say no to the leadership. That is precisely what \nhas happened. I am not going to get specific, but we have been working \non this for 6 months to a year, and if we just get into personalities \nand turf fights, there ought to be a way to work this out. So this \nselect committee would prioritize and coordinate with Tom Ridge. My \nword, if he can do it with 40 agencies, we can do it here with all the \nsubcommittees and committees we have in the Senate. If we do not, we \nwill not be part of the answer.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator is aware that I, in my \ncapacity as ranking on Armed Services, have not objected to what \nSenator Lott has put out as some format. To the contrary, I have \nindicated to him my strongest support for whatever evolves, hopefully \nwith his leadership and others'--yourself--out of this effort.\n  I commend the Senator but I am prepared to make whatever adjustments \nare necessary in order for this very important concept to be formalized \nand instituted in the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for his help, support, leadership, \nand advice, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his continuing \nleadership. He was an absolutely marvelous chairman of the Emerging \nThreats Subcommittee and took that committee in a direction that really \nforesaw some of the activities that we have seen in the year since he \nbegan that effort. For that foresight we are all in his debt. He has \ncontinued that as ranking member of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee \nnow, with Senator Landrieu as Chair.\n  But he has really been way, way ahead of his time. He has prodded us, \nas he used the image, in more ways than one and more times than just a \nfew. I know the leadership is discussing some kind of a select \ncommittee. Hopefully they will come to some kind of conclusion so we \ncan act with one voice.\n  He has been sometimes a lone voice, often a voice with a lot of \nsupport--but nonetheless a strong voice in that direction. I thank him \nagain as I often have publicly and privately for his extraordinary work \non our committee and in the Senate.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman and my good friend \nand colleague for his very kind remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask we return to amendment No. 1760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the record, the amendment is accepted \non this side.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am proud to be lead Republican \nsponsor of the concurrent receipt amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Reid. Now is the time to restore \nfairness to our military retired. Men and women who served our country, \nwho dedicated their lives to the defense of freedom have earned fair \ncompensation.\n  Our veterans have earned and deserve fair compensation. I have been a \nlongstanding supporter of efforts to repeal the 110-year-old law that \nprohibits military retirees from collecting the retired pay that they \nearned as well as VA disability compensation.\n  This amendment will correct the inequity of disability compensation \nfor our Nation's military retirees. Today, our military retirees are \nforced to fund their own disability compensation. Essentially, it is \nthe view of this government, that those that have already given so much \nfor our Nation must provide more. These are worthy Americans who \nanswered our Nation's call for 20 years or more. They are veterans who \nstood the line, defending our Nation, during peacetime and conflict.\n  Today as we face a new enemy we have the duty to show our men and \nwomen in uniform that we as a nation fully support them, that the \nUnited States Senate recognizes their sacrifice. I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1760) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1834\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Thomas and Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Thomas, for \n     himself and Mr. Gramm, proposes an amendment numbered 1834.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike the material beginning with page 264, line 21 and \n     ending with page 266, line 6.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sure we all remember the lengthy, \nspirited debate on the question of whether or not private businesses in \nthis country should have an opportunity to bid on items which the \nGovernment is buying or whether they ought to be preempted from being \nable to bid on those items by the monopoly position of Federal Prison \nIndustries. The Senate spoke and spoke loudly. Senator Gramm strongly \nopposed it. He had some suggestions afterward which I find acceptable, \nSenator Thomas finds acceptable, and those suggestions are now \nincorporated in the amendment which we have sent to the desk. It leaves \nintact the thrust of our amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the amendment be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Last week, the Senate voted 74-24 to table an amendment \nthat would have removed the Federal Prison Industries provision from \nthe bill. This vote was an overwhelming victory for those who believe, \nas I do, that Federal Prison Industries should not be able to prohibit \nprivate sector companies and their employees from bidding on federal \ncontracts that are paid for with their tax dollars.\n  Under Section 821 of the bill, which has now been endorsed by the \nfull Senate, FPI's ``mandatory preference''\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nwould come to an end, and Federal Prison Industries would have to \ncompete for future Department of Defense contracts. Under this \nprovision, the Department of Defense, not Federal Prison Industries, \nwould be responsible for determining whether Federal Prison Industries \ncan best meet the Department's needs in terms of price, quality, and \ntime of delivery. If DOD determines that the FPI product is not the \nbest available in terms of price, quality, and time of delivery, the \nDepartment is directed to purchase the product on a competitive basis.\n  Today, we are agreeing to an amendment that would modify the Federal \nPrison Industries provision. In particular, this amendment would delete \nlanguage from the bill which specifically addresses: (1) DOD purchases \nof integral or embedded products from FPI; (2) DOD purchases of \nnational security systems from FPI; and (3) DOD purchases in amounts \nless than the micropurchase threshold of $2500.\n  The first thing that I would like to emphasize about this amendment \nis that it does not in any way alter or undermine the key language in \nthe provision, which would end FPI's mandatory preference and allow \nprivate companies to compete against FPI for Department of Defense \ncontracts. Would the Senator from Wyoming agree with this?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to end FPI's \nmandatory preference on DOD contracts, and we have not and would not \nagree to any amendment that would undermine that action. As Senator \nLevin stated, last week's vote sent a clear message that the Senate \nfully supports eliminating FPI's mandatory source status.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would now like to address the language that we are \nremoving from the bill.\n  First, we are removing language that would have expressly stated that \nDOD may not be required to purchase integral or embedded products from \nFederal Prison Industries. This provision was intended to address FPI's \npractice of using its mandatory source status to insist that it get a \nshare of projects that would ordinarily be performed by a single \ngeneral contractor.\n  While we believe that some of FPI's practices in this area have been \nabusive, we are dropping this language from the bill because we do not \nbelieve that it is necessary. Since the language in the bill would end \nFPI's mandatory source status, FPI would no longer have the leverage it \nhas used in the past to insist that contracts be divided up, that \ncontract specifications specifically require the use of FPI products, \nor that subcontracts be awarded to FPI.\n  Let me be clear. We expect FPI's abusive practices to end under this \nprovision. It is our belief that with the elimination of the mandatory \npreference, these practices will come to a stop. Would the Senator from \nWyoming agree with this?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I agree. The only reason for dropping this language from \nthe bill is that it is redundant.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Second, we are removing language from the bill that would \nhave expressly stated that DOD may not be required to purchase national \nsecurity systems from FPI.\n  There are certain types of products that are inappropriate to produce \nin our prisons. I don't think we want guns produced in our prisons. I \ndon't think we want missile guidance systems to be produced in prisons. \nI don't think we want rocket launchers to be produced in prisons. I \ndon't think we want bullet proof vests to be produced in prisons.\n  We have agreed to drop the language in the bill because it is \nunnecessary. With the elimination of the mandatory preference, DOD will \nno longer be required to purchase any product from FPI, unless the \nDepartment determines that FPI offers the best product and the best \nprice, and with a delivery schedule that meets the Department's needs. \nFor this reason, we do not believe that is necessary to retain the \nlanguage singling out national security systems.\n  Would the Senator from Wyoming agree with this?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I do agree and in fact, I think the American public would \nbe shocked to learn that under a depression-era statute the DOD is \nrequired to purchase national security products from Federal prisoners.\n  In addition, FPI's entry into services generally, and data services \nrelated to mapping and geographic information in particular is \ntroubling. This is an inappropriate area for prison work for a number \nof reasons. First, Congress has included mapping and geographic \ninformation services within the statutory definition of professional \narchitect-engineer (A/E) services. This law requires Federal agencies \nto award A/E contracts (including those for surveying or mapping \nservices) to firms based on their ``demonstrated competence and \nqualification'' subject to negotiation of a fee ``fair and reasonable \nto the government'', rather than awarding such contracts to the lowest \nbidder. The vast majority of States have also adopted this process in \ntheir codes and it is recommended by the American Bar Association in \nits Model Procurement Code for State and Local Governments.\n  Public health, welfare and safety is dependent on the quality of work \nperformed by professionals in the fields of architecture, engineering, \nsurveying and mapping. To add to these highly technical and \nprofessional services the drawings, maps and images processed by prison \ninmates is questionable to the public interest.\n  There are prisons engaged in a variety of digital geographic \ninformation services, including converting hard copy maps to electronic \nfiles; plotting maps at various scales; creating databases with \ninformation on homeowners, property appraisal and tax assessment; \ndigitizing, and other computer aided design and drafting and geographic \ninformation services. FPI is involved in a program to provide support \nservices to some of the Nation's most classified and sensitive mapping \nprograms. I believe it is highly inappropriate for prisoners to be \ninvolved in programs where their work later becomes classified.\n\n  It is unwise to provide inmates access to information about \nindividual citizens' property and assets, address information, and \nother data that carries serious civil liberty implications. I want to \nemphasize that inmates working for FPI in geographic information \nservices often have access to homeowner data, property appraisal and \ntax assessment records and other information that most citizens would \nnot want in prisoners' hands. It is equally dangerous in today's \nclimate to give prisoners access to underground utility, infrastructure \nor power system location data.\n  Moreoever, to train prisons in imaging techniques and technologies \nmakes the potential for utilizing such skills in nefarious \ncounterfeiting operations upon release from incarceration too tempting.\n  These are examples of where prison industries has gone too far and \nwhere constraints are needed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. finally, we are removing language from the bill that would \nhave stated that DOD may not be required to make purchases with a value \nless than the micropurchase threshold of $2500 from FPI.\n  The micropurchase threshold is important, because the removal of \nstatutory requirements on small purchases makes it possible for DOD and \nother agencies to use efficient purchasing methods, including credit \ncards. For this reason, DOD has long sought, within the executive \nbranch, an exemption from FPI's mandatory source requirement for \npurchases less than $2,500. So far, FPI has been willing to grant an \nexemption only for purchases up to $250.\n  We are removing this language from the bill so that the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Justice can continue efforts to work it \nout within the executive branch. It is our hope that, with the \nelimination of the mandatory preference for DOD purchases from FPI, the \ntwo agencies will be able to work this issue out in a constructive \nmanner. Would the Senator from Wyoming agree with this?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I agree with the good Senator from Michigan and want to \npoint out that FPI has been fighting such changes for more than 5 \nyears. Furthermore, FPI's reluctance to increase the micropurchase \nthreshold points to FPI's unwillingness to recognize the legitimate \nneeds of its Federal agency customers.\n  Lastly, I want to point out that this amendment does nothing to \naddress the numerous other competitive advantages that FPI enjoys. As I \npointed out\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\non the Senate floor last week, FPI will retain advantages such as: \npaying inmates between $.23--$1.15 per hour; not having to pay Social \nSecurity or Unemployment compensation; not having to pay for employee \nbenefits; exemption from paying Federal and State income tax, excise \ntax, and State and local excise taxes; and utilities being provided by \nthe host prison.\n  Under this amendment FPI will continue to enjoy these, and other, \ncompetitive advantages. In no way does this amendment shut down FPI. In \nfact, FPI will continue to produce products for DOD contracts because \nthe private sector cannot compete against not having to pay market \nwages, employee benefits, and Federal and State taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the chairman, Senator Thomas, \nand the senior Senator from Texas for reconciling differences on an \nissue which was of great importance to all parties. I urge adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1834) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1805\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week I offered an amendment that \nwould allow a needed land transfer agreement to take place in North \nChicago among the Navy, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the \nFinch Medical School.\n  The managers of this bill accepted my amendment and I thank them for \ntheir help. I want to take this opportunity to explain what the \namendment does.\n  The Navy's only boot camp facility is at the Great Lakes Naval \nTraining Center in North Chicago, IL. Its Recruit Training Center area \nis a very long, thin stretch of land hemmed in by railroad tracks and \nby land that the Navy transferred to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, many years ago. This layout forces recruits to do so much \nmarching simply in the course of moving about the area in a normal day \nof training that these 19-year-olds have been suffering from overuse \ninjuries.\n  Both the barracks and the large drilling facilities used by recruits \nwere built hastily during World War II and are in desperate need of \nreplacement. These military construction projects have been endorsed by \nthe Navy and by Congress, but the layout of the Recruit Training Center \nmust be modified before all the buildings needing replacement can be \nbuilt.\n  The VA land adjacent to the Recruit Training Center was leased to the \nFinch Medical School, which is affiliated with the North Chicago \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The VA also has more \nland and buildings than it needs for veterans health care delivery \ntoday.\n  The Navy, the VA, and the Finch Medical School have been in \nnegotiations to set up a land swap that would benefit all concerned. \nThe Finch Medical School is amenable to giving up the land on which it \ncarries a 99-year lease so that the Navy can use that land. The VA is \nwilling to transfer the land the medical school has leased for other VA \nproperty that the VA no longer needs. I commend all the parties for \ntheir willingness to work together, compromise, and find a solution \nthat benefits all parties. The details of this agreement are still \nbeing worked out, and a public hearing will be held on it as well.\n  This amendment simply authorizes the Navy to use up to $2 million of \nOperations and Maintenance funds to fulfill its obligations, once a \nfinal agreement is reached.\n  I appreciate the support from the bill's managers on this amendment. \nThe rebuilt Recruit Training Center area will allow a major improvement \nin the training environment as well as the quality of life for new \nrecruits. This amendment is absolutely necessary for the Navy to carry \nout the plans for its new Recruit Training Center.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is now the understanding that we will recess until 2:15 \nand that we will be back at that time. We hope to be able to work out a \npending amendment or two so we can complete consideration of this bill, \nhopefully before the briefing which has been scheduled for, I believe, \n2:30. It would be our goal that we can use that 15 minutes to resolve \nthese pending amendments, that we can then go to final passage right \nafter the 2:30 briefing. That would be my goal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share that goal. After carefully \noffering opportunity to my colleagues, I understand, if we resolve the \nmatters with Senator Allard, that may conclude the amendments. It won't \nseal them off, but we have made a great deal of progress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Allard, Senator Nelson of Florida and others, \nSenator Dodd, are working hard to see if we can come up with something \nwhich moves in the direction we all want to move in terms of voting \nrights for our military personnel and that does so in a way that we can \nprotect against any unintended consequences. That is our hope over the \nlunch period. We will come back at 2:15 with high hopes and, if not, we \nwill have to resolve it in other ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10041-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, please. Is there an amendment \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1724\n\n(Purpose: To protect United States military personnel and other elected \n    and appointed officials of the United States government against \n criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the \n                      United States is not party)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1724 and ask that \nit be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself, \n     Mr. Miller, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bond, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 1724.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have worked with our colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Miller, to craft legislation to protect our soldiers \nand officials from illegitimate prosecutions by the International \nCriminal Court. Senator Miller and I and Senators Lott, Warner, Hatch, \nShelby, and Murkowski together introduced the American Service Members \nProtection Act on May 9 of this year. We have worked since that time \nwith the administration to craft the pending amendment, and the \nadministration favors this amendment quite strongly.\n  Our soldiers and decisionmakers will be all the more exposed to the \nrisk of illegitimate prosecution as they proceed with ``Operation \nEnduring Freedom,'' as it has been named, against those who on \nSeptember 11 committed mass murder against innocent American civilians.\n  The pending amendment ensures that countries, or overzealous \nprosecutors and judges, will never be able to use this court to \npersecute American military personnel carrying out war against \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n  At this time of national mobilization to fight terrorists who killed \nthousands of American citizens in New York and Pennsylvania and right \nnear us at the Pentagon, there is a consensus in Congress that we \nshould give the President the tools he needs to carry out the mission.\n  Chairman Henry Hyde, of the House International Relations Committee, \nand I have painstakingly negotiated refinements to the American Service \nMembers Protection Act with the Bush administration, and this revised \nversion of the bill gives the President the flexibility and authority \nto delegate provisions in the legislation to Cabinet Secretaries and \ntheir deputies in this time of national emergency.\n  As a result of these careful negotiations, I have a letter dated \nSeptember 25, 2001, from the Assistant Secretary of State for \nLegislative Affairs. His name is Paul V. Kelly. He indicates in his \nletter that the administration supports enactment of the precise \nlanguage in my amendment to the Defense authorization bill. By the way, \nI submitted that letter for the Record last week, specifically on \nSeptember 26.\n  So it will be a matter of record again, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter from Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs \nPaul V. Kelly be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of State,\n\n\n                                Bureau of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, House of \n         Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter advises that the \n     Administration supports the revised text of the American \n     Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), dated September 10, \n     2001, proposed by you, Senator Helms and Mr. DeLay.\n       We commit to support enactment of the revised bill in its \n     current form based upon the agreed changes without further \n     amendment and to oppose alternative legislative proposals.\n       We understand that the House ASPA legislation will be \n     attached to the State Department Authorization Bill or other \n     appropriate legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul V. Kelly,\n                         Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor. \nDoes the Senator from North Carolina yield the floor?\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will indicate why he is seeking \nrecognition, I will be glad to consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentleman from North Carolina has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As manager of the bill, I say to my friend from North \nCarolina I did not hear that last unanimous consent request. I am \nsorry.\n  Mr. HELMS. I just inserted a letter in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is speaking. \nThe Senator will continue speaking, and the Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  We have a responsibility as Senators to enact an insurance policy for \nour troops and our officials--such as Secretary of State Powell--to \nprotect them from a U.N. Kangaroo Court where the United States has no \nveto. That is precisely what this amendment is all about. Let me state \nfor the record, to be absolutely certain there is no mistake made about \nit, (1) this amendment will prohibit U.S. cooperation with the court, \nincluding use of taxpayer funding or sharing of classified information; \n(2) it will restrict a U.S. role in peacekeeping missions unless the \nUnited Nations specifically exempts U.S. troops from prosecution by \nthis international court; (3) it blocks U.S. aid to allies unless they \ntoo sign accords to shield U.S. troops on their soil from being turned \nover to the court; and (4) it authorizes the President to take any \nnecessary action to rescue U.S. soldiers, any service man or woman, \nimproperly handed over to that Court.\n  Now, then, my very good friend from Connecticut, and he is my \nfriend--we have worked together on a number of things--Senator Dodd, \nhas made comments about this legislation which I feel obliged to \naddress. This past Wednesday, September 26, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, here on the Senate floor, said:\n\n       ``This amendment is called, ironically [Senator Dodd said], \n     the American Servicemen's Protection Act. It is anything but \n     [said Senator Dodd]. The establishment of this amendment \n     places our men and women in uniform in greater jeopardy than \n     they would be if we were to participate in trying to develop \n     the structures of this court to minimize problems.\n\nNow that is quoting Senator Dodd, my friend, a friend of all of ours.\n  But that's not the case. I hope I might persuade Senator Dodd to \nwithdraw that statement because it is not the case. Let me repeat for \nemphasis, it is not the case at all. The pending amendment does nothing \nwhatsoever to preclude the Bush administration from taking any action \nit deems necessary to address our concerns during the Preparatory \nCommission meetings of the International Criminal Court.\n  However, we should not be misled: the negotiators of this Court have \nno intent to amend the treaty creating the Court to meet our \nobjections. In fact, negotiators voiced a loud cheer when they finished \nnegotiation of the treaty in 1999--over the objections of the United \nStates of America.\n  Senator Dodd himself acknowledged that the Rome Treaty creating the \nCourt is fatally flawed, when he stated:\n\n       In fact, if, for some reason, miraculously the proposal \n     were brought to this Senate Chamber this afternoon, and I \n     were asked to vote on it as is, I would vote against it \n     because it is a flawed agreement.\n\n  Also, when President Clinton signed the Rome Treaty on December 31, \n2000, he stated that he would not send the treaty to the Senate for \nratification and recommended that President Bush not transmit it \neither, given the remaining flaws in the Court.\n  So let me be, as the saying goes, perfectly clear. The pending \namendment would shield American service people, men and women, from a \ncourt run amok. U.N. bodies often run amok. For instance, filled with \ndictatorships, the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemned the only \ndemocracy in the Middle East, Israel, in multiple resolutions earlier \nthis year.\n  And just five weeks ago, the United Nations Conference on Racism in \nDurban South Africa, became an agent of hate rather than against hate. \nIf U.N. commissions and conferences run amok, a permanent court, not \nsubject to Security Council approval--and immune to a U.S. veto--could \nwell turn on us, and on our democratic allies (the most likely one \nbeing Israel).\n  We need only to look back to the Kosovo War when the Bosnian \nTribunal's chief prosecutor attempted to undertake an investigation of \nNATO for war crimes abuses.\n  Mr. President, despite the importance of this pending amendment with \nmy sponsorship and that of others, opponents may want to hide behind \nprocedural objections in an effort to just make our amendment go away. \nUnfortunately, this kangaroo court is not going away, it will be there, \nand the risk to our service men and women will exist as long as it is \nthere unless we do something, as described in this amendment.\n  In the meantime, our Secretaries of State and Defense are telling us \nand the American people at the same time to get ready for a long \ncampaign against global terrorists. We owe it, don't we, to our men and \nwomen representing this country, both in the military and in civilian \nagencies, to ensure their actions are not the subject of second-\nguessing by United Nations judicial bodies?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the Senator kindly yield for me to \nmake this observation?\n  It had been the intention of the leadership of the Senate, and the \nmanagers, in order to accommodate Senators desiring to attend the \nbriefing, to go into recess subject to the call of the Chair. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator from North Carolina \nallowing us to interrupt. We have a number of people attending from the \nadministration.\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course. I understand.\n  Mr. REID. We would be happy to allow the Senator to complete his \nstatement, and as soon as that statement is completed, we ask the \nSenate be in recess subject to the call of the Chair, and at some \nsubsequent time after we come back, I understand some people may want \nto raise a point of order against this amendment.\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand the same thing. I have about 2 minutes more. \nI will stop now.\n  Mr. REID. No, no. We thought the Senator from North Carolina was \ngoing to speak much longer. We would be happy to wait until----\n  Mr. HELMS. I wouldn't think of putting you in that position.\n  Mr. President, let me yield to the Senator on condition that I will \nhave the floor when the Senate reconvenes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator would want the floor \nwhen the Senate comes back in session?\n  Mr. HELMS.

I want to serve notice to the \nmanagers of the bill that I shall not contest or try to contest any \nmotion that may be made on this amendment. I do hope the managers will \ngive some thought as to whether they will support my offering this \namendment freestanding as a bill, but that is up to them.\n  Mr. President, to complete my statement that I began earlier, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has sent me a letter in \nsupport of my amendment. I want to read part of it. It is from Robert \nE. Wallace, the Executive Director. It is addressed to all Members of \nthe Senate, dated October 2. It says:\n\n       On behalf of the 2.7 million members of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary, I \n     want to express our strong support for amendment number 1690 \n     to the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 1438, the \n     ``American Service Members' Protection Act of 2001.'' We \n     think this legislation brought forward by Senators Jesse \n     Helms (R-NC) and Zell Miller (D-GA) is an appropriate \n     response to the threat to American sovereignty and \n     international freedom of action posed by the International \n     Criminal Court. Also, we believe it is essential that our \n     nation's military personnel be protected against criminal \n     prosecution under procedures inconsistent with our \n     Constitution.\n       We oppose the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its \n     present form. We believe it poses a significant danger to our \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, who are deployed \n     throughout the world. U.S. military personnel and other U.S. \n     Government officials could be brought before this court even \n     though the United States is not a party to the treaty. The \n     court will claim jurisdiction to indict, prosecute, and \n     imprison persons accused of ``war crimes,'' ``crimes against \n     humanity,'' ``genocide,'' and other ``crime of aggression'' \n     (not yet defined by the ICC.)\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2001.\n     To: All Member of the U.S. Senate.\n     From: Robert E. Wallace, Executive Director.\n       On behalf of the 2.7 million members of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary, I \n     want to express our strong support for amendment number 1690 \n     to the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 1438, the \n     ``American Service Members' Protection Act of 2001.''

Also, we believe it is essential that our \n     nation's military personnel be protected against criminal \n     prosecution under procedures inconsistent with our \n     Constitution.\n       We oppose the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its \n     present form. We believe it poses a significant danger to our \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, who are deployed \n     throughout the world. U.S. military personnel and other U.S. \n     Government officials could be brought before the court even \n     though the United States is not a party to the treaty. The \n     court will claim jurisdiction to indict, prosecute, and \n     imprison persons accused of ``war crimes,'' ``crimes against \n     humanity,'' ``genocide,'' and the ``crime of aggression'' \n     (not yet defined by the ICC). These crimes are expansively \n     defined by the treaty and would be interpreted by the court's \n     judges, who will be appointed with no input from the United \n     States. The ICC will not be required to provide Americans the \n     basic legal protections of the constitution. We think it is \n     wrong to expect our servicemen and women to serve their \n     country under this threat.\n       Also, it is equally important the President, cabinet \n     members, and other national security decision-makers not have \n     to fear international criminal prosecution as they go about \n     their work. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that \n     Americans are not brought before an international criminal \n     tribunal for simply performing their duty to their country.\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States supports \n     enactment of this amendment to S. 1438 as written. Therefore, \n     we strongly urge you to support this amendment offered by \n     Senator Helms and others, and vote for the amended bill when \n     it comes to the floor of the Senate for vote.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I hope Senators will support this \nlegislation, to protect soldiers and their civilian leaders from this \nnew U.N. court. The President and his national security team support \nthe legislation and have raised no concerns about acting on it now. In \nfact, there is greater need to enact this legislation now. We must not \nsend our troops out to fight terrorists, or any other aggressors, \nwithout protection from trumped-up claims that they committed ``war \ncrimes'', ``crimes against humanity'' or some new, undefined, catch-all \n``crime of aggression'' before the Court.\n  I urge support for this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will momentarily make a parliamentary \ninquiry as to germaneness. I say to my friend, who has been by my side \nin the Senate the 23 years I have been here, I was a cosponsor from day \none. Should the Senator elect to pursue this as a freestanding or in \nother measures legislatively, I would like to be a cosponsor.\n  At the appropriate time--I see another colleague who wishes to \naddress the issue--I will make the inquiry with regard to germaneness. \nThe distinguished chairman and myself have made clear, in order to \nmanage this bill, I will have to move for those amendments on my side, \nand he is going to move accordingly on germaneness for amendments on \nhis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand the postcloture situation we \nare now in and the germaneness argument that the Senator from Virginia \nhas just placed.\n  I stand in support of the concept and the intent that Senator Helms \nbrings to the floor as it relates to the International Criminal Court.\n  I, along with Senator Helms and a good many others, have worked for \nsome time to clarify this Nation's position in relation to the Rome \ntreaty and the International Criminal Court. We became signatories to \nthat in the final days of the Clinton administration and even then \nPresident Clinton spoke about it with concern. We are now faced with \nparticipating or not participating in something that we believe, as the \nSenator has just spoken to, puts our men and women in uniform at risk \nand the possibility that an international body, as adjunct of the \nUnited Nations, might choose to prosecute them, even though they were \nunder the direct orders of our Commander in Chief in the execution of \ntheir duties.\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\n  If we were to gain on an International Criminal Court a rogue \nprosecutor, it is also arguable that civilians serving at the behest of \nthe United States could become subject to the same prosecution. In \nother words, what is happening, by engaging in and/or participating in \nwhat we believe to be an illegitimate body and the formation of that \nbody, it appears we are beginning to agree or to associate ourselves \nwith it for certain purposes.\n  I don't believe we ought to be doing that. In fact, when we were \ndealing with Justice-State-Commerce appropriations, we passed, by voice \nvote, an amendment that would prohibit any moneys being spent for the \npurpose of the ICC preparatory commission and/or direct participation \nin the International Criminal Court.\n\n  What is at question? Our sovereignty, the right of this country to \nprotect its citizens under our judicial system, but to hand that system \nand the absence of that protection off to an international body.\n  Senator Helms has spoken to what we deem are rogue adjuncts of the \nUnited Nations--the conference that was held in Durban, South Africa \nthat we had to withdraw from, along with the State of Israel, because \nof racist expressions that that conference was willing to make \nconcerning certain nations with which we could not agree. The \nInternational Criminal Court stands alone by the characteristics of the \ndefining language within the Rome treaty. In other words, once it is \nratified, it isn't just a question of our men and women in uniform \nbecoming subject to it. It is a question of any citizen of the world 18 \nyears of age or older or any nation in the world becoming subject to \nit.\n  That is why I believe we ought to disassociate ourselves and, in \nfact, reverse our policy and work to deny its ratification.\n  I have a second-degree amendment I would offer, but I understand \nthere will be a question of germaneness. If that question fails, then I \nwould offer that second degree. It does not disallow the protection the \nSenator from North Carolina has brought but says that we protect \nothers--and that is, citizens --in that we don't associate ourselves \nwith the International Criminal Court, nor do we allow on special cases \nconfidential information to flow from our Government to the court. In \nother words, we should not be facilitators to a court that by its very \ndefinition denies our citizens the right of sovereignty and the \nprotection under our judicial system. That is what is at issue. None \nwho study it deny that.\n  Those who have joined with me in my second degree are Senators Lott, \nNickles, Allen, Smith, Crapo, Kyl, and a good many others. It is a \nsubject that deserves a stand-alone debate on the floor and full \nconsideration by the Senate. At stake, I believe, are everything \nSenator Helms has spoken to and, additionally, what I have just spoken \nto. That is why it is important that at some time this Senate \ncollectively speak out against the whole of the ICC and the \nillegitimacy that we think it creates and the denial of the sovereignty \nof our citizens within the construct of the judicial system of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \namendments introduced by Senators Helms and Craig relating to the \nproposed International Criminal Court. Regardless of how one feels \nabout the court, this amendment could have the unintended but \ndevastating effect of alienating our allies and undermining the global \ncoalition against terrorism. By imposing sweeping limitations on the \nPresident's capacity to cooperate with other countries on security and \nintelligence matters, and by taking a unilateral approach to an \nimportant global issue, this amendment weakens the United States hand \nin pursuing the most urgent foreign policy priority before us--building \nan strong and lasting coalition to fight terrorism.\n  I recognize and share many of the concerns with the proposed \nInternational Criminal Court, but this bill would not accomplish its \nprimary objective of protecting American service members. It could in \nfact have the opposite effect, particularly as it stands to jeopardize \nour country's ongoing diplomatic efforts to build a broad coalition in \nopposition to terrorism. I urge you to oppose the amendment at this \nextraordinary moment in our national history.\n  Let me just highlight a few of the ways in which this amendment could \ntie the hands of our President and our diplomats as they move forward \nin building a coalition to combat terrorism. The amendment, if fully \nenacted, would limit the ability of our President to enter into global \nsecurity alliances at a time when such alliances may be more important \nto our national interest than ever before. The amendment could also \nlimit our ability to share essential security information with some of \nour closest allies in the war against terrorism. This limitation is \nparticularly offensive, as it comes at a time when we are asking those \nsame allies to share their intelligence information with us as we track \nthe global terrorist networks that may have been involved in the \ndevastating attacks of September 11.\n  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, a much noted provision in \nthe Helms bill would allow the President ``to use all means necessary \nand appropriate to bring about the release'' of certain U.S. citizens \ndetained by, or at the request of, the International Criminal Court. As \nsuch, the bill has been labeled the ``Hague Invasion Act'' by some \nopponents, a point that serves to highlight how provocative the measure \nmay appear to even our closest allies. Of course, our first priority \nmust be to protect our service members. But this amendment would not \naccomplish that goal, and we simply cannot afford to create a rift in \nour growing global alliance against terrorist networks by adopting such \na troubled amendment. This is the wrong amendment. And this amendment \nis offered at the wrong time; it is offered just as we are beginning to \nrealize important diplomatic successes in building a global coalition \nagainst terrorism. I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry regarding the \ngermaneness of the amendment by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair rules that the amendment is not \ngermane.\n  Would the Senator from Virginia state the question? Would the Senator \nfrom Virginia restate the question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I asked the Chair as to the parliamentary status of this \namendment. The Chair has responded. I was awaiting the Chair's ruling. \nI raised a point of order, but I mean, the Chair then rules that the \namendment falls, am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. If the Senator will bring the \npoint of order, the Chair will rule.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have done that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair rules that the amendment is not \ngermane. The amendment falls.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I wonder if the managers of the bill would \nbe willing to support a suggestion by me and perhaps Senator Craig that \nthis be converted into a freestanding bill, as suggested by the Senator \nfrom Idaho, and be considered immediately following passage of this \npending legislation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I cannot exercise the decision of the \nleaders as to when it would be brought up.\n  It certainly can be introduced today as a freestanding measure, again \nwith the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Idaho. I indicated \nI would like to be a cosponsor. As to the time it will be considered by \nthe Senate, that is within the purview of the two leaders.\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan will comment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is objection to scheduling debate on a subsequent \nbill. I have to object, if that is a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not sure I understood it as a unanimous consent. It \nwas an inquiry to the managers. I certainly have indicated my support \nfor it, and Senator Levin and I are of the opinion it is a matter that \nhas to be addressed by the leadership as to the schedule.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we will be here on another day in another \nway. I thank the Chair and the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have the matter of the Allard \namendment. That is the only amendment on this side I have knowledge of, \nI so advise the chairman. I am advised that Senator Allard is on his \nway. I wonder if the chairman might comment on his knowledge. Senator \nAllard indicated to me he believed his amendment had reached a \nresolution and that it could be cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my understanding, and there will be a voice vote \non this matter. The Allard amendment is germane. My understanding is he \nwill modify that amendment, and he will then agree to a voice vote on \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. On our side, I know of no further amendments. May I \ninquire of my colleague, the chairman?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know of no further germane amendments anyone intends to \noffer. If there are such germane amendments that have been filed, I \nhope somebody will let us know very quickly. Otherwise, as soon as we \ndispose of the Allard amendment, we will want to presumably go to third \nreading.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked that I advise \nthe Senate there will be two votes beginning at 4:45, one on final \npassage of this bill and the other dealing with another matter, the \nVietnam trade bill, a motion to proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposal of the Allard \namendment there be no amendments in order and that we could then go to \nthird reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with that unanimous consent agreement having \nbeen granted, we can start the vote at 4:30. I ask unanimous consent \nthe vote begin at 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1755\n\n   (Purpose: To maximize the access of uniformed services voters and \n recently separated uniformed services voters to the polls, to ensure \n      that each of the votes cast by such voters is duly counted)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call up the amendment numbered 1755.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1755.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1755, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1755), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 147, beginning with line 13 strike through page \n     154, line 16 and insert the following:\n\n             Subtitle F--Uniformed Services Overseas Voting\n\n     SEC. 571.

I ask to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, would you add the following cosponsors: \nSenator Warner, Senator Allen, Senator Hagel, Senator Cleland, and \nSenator Bill Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In 1864, in the midst of a civil war, the United States \nof America held an election. In 1944, in the midst of a world war, the \nUnited States of America held an election. And in 2002, and in 2004, no \nmatter what military actions we are involved in for the current war on \nterrorism, the United States of America will hold elections. It is a \nfundamental part of our system, of our democracy. Our claim to being \nthe world's foremost champion of ``liberty and justice for all'' \ndepends on the regular, free, and pure exercise of citizen's voting \nrights. And now that we are deploying troops overseas as the beginning \nof this campaign, it is our duty to correct the flaws in the absentee \nmilitary voting system that became so glaringly obvious during the last \nelection. To that end I introduced S. 381, which after much helpful \ninput from the co-sponsors has been modified into what is before us \ntoday. Let me briefly describe this amendment so we can move forward. \nThis amendment prohibits States from disqualifying our men and women in \nthe military from voting based on their ballot's lack of postmark, \naddress, notarized witness signature, or a reasonably similar \nsignature. The current language in the bill only offers military voters \na ``meaningful opportunity to exercise voting rights.'' This does not \nensure that our fighting men and women will be able to vote. Our \namendment will instead move us toward that goal. The amendment also \nfacilitates voting for men and women in the services who are separated \nbefore an election and because of residency requirements previously \nfaced problems voting. There is a provision for electronic voting, \nstrongly endorsed by Senator Bill Nelson, that sets up a demo for that \npurpose. There is a requirement for a report that will be filed with \nthe Department of Defense by the States, reporting to them on how the \nStates are addressing existing problems with their absentee military \nvoting requirements, so our military men and women will have an \nopportunity to vote.\n\n  That is basically the amendment. I hope we can move forward with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to compliment our colleague. This amendment was \nworked on on both sides. I believe that is included in the Record.\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is important to include that in the Record. I thank \nthe Senator for that reminder. It was worked on diligently by both \nsides. There is mutual support to move forward. I thank the Senator for \nhis help and for the support of Senator Levin.\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Senator from Florida as well as Senator Dodd worked \non this amendment. I appreciate their input.\n  Mr. WARNER. In our early discussions today, the Senator from Florida \nworked some constructive changes. The Rules Committee has overall \njurisdiction of voting in elections. Senator Dodd, the ranking member \nof the Rules Committee, collaborated on this issue, and it was badly \nneeded. We suffered, as a nation, when we had the problems in Florida. \nI am not suggesting guilt anywhere, but there was a lot of confusion \nwith the unexpected situation. There was great controversy over the men \nand women in the Armed Forces, particularly those beyond our shores \nserving in posts overseas, as to their ballots, when they were finally \nreceived in that State--and indeed we found other States had problems, \nso it was not exclusively a problem for Florida.\n  This amendment will go a long way toward clarification.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Senator from Virginia has a lot of constituents from \nhis State who have dedicated their lives to protecting the citizens of \nthis country, and I have a lot of citizens in Colorado who have \ndedicated their lives to serving in the military and protecting and \nsecuring the interests of the United States. This is a moral issue. We \nneed to make sure they have an opportunity to vote and do not lose that \nright.\n  I thank the manager of the bill for his effort in working on this \ncompromise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard, Senator Warner, and \nothers who worked so hard on this amendment. We made some very \nimportant progress in the bill that came from committee on assuring \nvoting rights for men and women in the Armed Forces and those who leave \nthe Armed Forces, for a short period of time after their departure.\n  Senator Allard has worked hard and has suggested some additional ways \nin which we can give that assurance that every eligible voter serving \nin our military does have a meaningful opportunity to vote and that \nproperly cast ballots will be counted. I commend him.\n  Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, Senator Dodd, and Senator Max Cleland \nworked so hard. I ask unanimous consent someone who has also worked \nextremely hard on this issue and made wonderful contributions, Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana, be added as a cosponsor to this modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition, Mr. President, I express my thanks to Senator \nAllard. This is a complicated issue, and it is important we hear from a \nnumber of sources, including secretaries of state of the various \nStates, between now and the time we go to conference. We will be \nseeking to get their input on this language. We have not had a chance \nto do that. There may need to be some additional work.\n  In the meantime, I support the amendment and hope we will adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard.\n  The amendment (No. 1755), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement \nadopted a few minutes ago, no further amendments are in order.\n  Senator Torricelli, Senator Biden, and I have expressed a strong \ninterest in an issue that cannot be addressed on the floor through \namendment and, as it turns out, may not need to be offered through an \namendment. I want to take a moment to speak to that before we come to \nthe vote. Before doing so, I again compliment Senator Levin, the \nChairman of the committee, and the ranking Republican, Senator Warner, \nhelping us to navigate through some difficult waters as we come to the \nclose of debate on this bill.\n\n  The issue that Senator Torricelli and Senator Biden and I expressed \nconcern about involves the Department of Defense. The Department of \nDefense, it turns out, is the only consumer of a military grade \npropellant which is manufactured through a joint venture between two \ncompanies, General Dynamics Ordnance Tactical Systems and Alliant \nTechsystems.\n  Previously, nitrocellulose, which is used to make this propellant had \nbeen provided to General Dynamics by two sources: Alliant Techsystems, \nand Expro, Inc. Green Tree Chemical Technologies, which it turns out \nhas operations in the State of the Presiding Officer and is \nheadquartered in the State of Delaware, provided Expro with base \ncomponents used to manufacture nitrocellulose. Since the joint venture \nwith Alliant Technologies, General Dynamics terminated their contract \nwith Expro, Inc.\n  Concerns have been expressed by Green Tree Technologies that with the \ncurrent joint venture we would end up with a sole source provider for \nnitrocellulose. This propellant is used to make, among other things, \nweapons; and if there is only one provider of nitrocellulose we may put \nourselves in some jeopardy as a nation if we should lose that one \nsource.\n  There are further concerns that have been raised with respect to \npossible antitrust violations. For this reason, the Federal Trade \nCommission has opened an investigation concerning the joint venture \nbetween General Dynamics and Alliant Techsystems. Since the Department \nof Defense is the only purchaser of military-grade nitrocellulose, they \nhave the determining role in whether or not the FTC moves forward with \ntheir review.\n  Senator Torricelli prepared an amendment. It is not going to be \noffered, but it is an amendment that says we need the Department of \nDefense, specifically the Army, to signal to the FTC that they have an \nunderstanding of the concerns over the possible antitrust issues and \nconcerns over permitting this joint venture to go forward, limiting \nourselves to one source for nitrocellulose.\n  The amendment encourages the Department of Defense to express its \nview of the Federal Trade Commission investigation within 30 days of \nenactment. It is my understanding that the Department of Defense will \nformally indicate their view of the FTC investigation in the coming \nweek.\n  What we had sought to accomplish through amendment appears to have \nbeen accomplished without the adoption of this amendment, which I \nbelieve is good news, not just for Green Tree Technologies, but I think \nit is good news for the Department of Defense and ultimately for the \ntaxpayers of this country. With sign off from the Department of \nDefense, the FTC is free to move forward and to make whatever rulings \nor decisions they see fit.\n  While the amendment will not be offered, I want to say to Senator \nTorricelli, thank you very much for raising this issue and providing \nthe leadership here in the Senate for the committee to make sure we \naddress these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sorry I did not have an opportunity to \nhear all of Senator Carper's words, but I think I understand enough to \nknow what he has indicated, that apparently there has been now a \nstatement from the DOD to the FTC on this matter. If so, that was the \npurpose of the Torricelli amendment which was supported, I believe, by \nthe Senator from Delaware and one other Senator.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. And Senator Biden.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Biden as well. If that information for whatever \nreason turns out not to be accurate, Senator Torricelli, Senator \nCarper, Senator Biden, and others have my assurance that I will be \nputting tremendous weight on the Department of Defense between now and \nconference to be certain those views are expressed, whatever those \nviews are. It is not up to me, at least, to express an opinion as to \nthe substance of the matter. I do not know enough about it. But they \nhave apparently now expressed those views. If\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\nthey have not, I will do everything within my power to make certain \nthey do between now and the time this bill comes back from conference.\n  I thank Senator Torricelli and Senator Carper for their position on \nthis matter now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I also add the Chairman and I had to \nmake a decision to move on the question of germaneness. I do it on my \nside; the chairman was prepared to do it on his side. There was clearly \na question of germaneness.\n  We have a number of Senators--another one just appeared. We had a \nlist of over 100 amendments. We have been waiting. We stayed here until \nlate last night and tried to consider them. I regret if there was a \nmiscommunication. As captain of the ship, I take responsibility. But in \ngood conscience, I have claimed many times and stated at lunch today \namong my colleagues that we were moving to final passage. As far as I \nknew, no amendments were going to be brought up.\n  I regret profusely, I say to my friend, and I yield the floor if he \nwants to make a few comments.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Very briefly, again to Senator Warner, I understand the \ndifficult position he and Senator Levin found themselves in with \nrespect to germaneness. I thank Senator Levin very much for the \nassurances he has given us. We look forward to working with the Senator \nto a satisfactory conclusion.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I want to state for the record why I voted \nin support of the request from President Bush for an authorization of a \nBase Realignment and Closure Commission in fiscal year 2003.\n  I support a BRAC round in 2003 for three reasons: First, I am \nconfident that with an objective analysis of their military value, \nVirginia bases will score well compared to other installations \nthroughout the Nation. I am sensitive to the fact that BRAC is an \nemotional issue. As unemotional as we would like to make it, we cannot \nget completely away from the emotion that is involved with closing \ninstallations and potentially uprooting people's lives. While I am \nsensitive to the emotions involved, I am confident that Virginia will \ncome out well.\n  Virginia bases have, in past years, demonstrated their military value \nand will do so again this time. As Governor of Virginia, I, in 1994, \nestablished the Virginia Office of Base Retention and Defense \nAdjustment. We coordinated an effective State effort to assess the \nattributes of our military facilities to protect Virginia interests in \nthe 1995 BRAC rounds. Indeed, after the 1995 BRAC, some 4,000 jobs were \nreturned to Virginia that were lost in the 1993 BRAC round.\n  Finally, Fort Pickett was on the 1995 BRAC list until we negotiated a \ntransfer to the Virginia National Guard to serve as Headquarters of the \nCommonwealth's Department of Military Affairs. So our bases are not \nonly operationally important to their own services but they are \ninterwoven in a web of joint-ness in which our military puts great \nvalue. We are operating at peak capacity in Virginia. We are efficient \nand we are ready to serve our national interests and meet the \nchallenges of a BRAC round.\n  Second, the Department of Defense has indicated that a BRAC is needed \non the merits. They have indicated there is a 25 percent excess \ninfrastructure throughout our military installations. The Bush \nadministration believes we could save $3.5 billion by consolidating \noperations. We then have a responsibility to work for more efficiency \nso that our resources can be allocated where they are needed most. \nThese resources can be used to improve pay for our Soldiers, Sailors, \nAirmen, and Marines. Savings can be used to acquire upgraded, more \ntechnologically advanced equipment, armaments, and spare parts; all to \nbetter protect our uniformed personnel. Indeed, these savings can even \nbe used to upgrade facilities in which our services are located.\n  Finally, during this time of national emergency, we should give due \ndeference to the decisions of the President, Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Pentagon. The administration has said we, as a nation, need to \nauthorize a commission. Secretary Rumsfeld called it ``imperative to \nconvert excess capacity into war-fighting ability.'' During a time of \nnational emergency and throughout our ``war on terrorism,'' it is \nimportant to support the National Command Authority in their decisions \nto wage war and structure an efficient war machine. Again, because this \nis a highly emotional issue and affects the lives of people throughout \nthe land, Congress must have confidence in the recommendations of the \nadministration, Department of Defense, and the commission. I am \nconfident of the Secretary's ability to ensure the integrity of the \nBRAC process which is so important to the accurate assessment of our \nfuture operational needs and force structure.\n  Again, I am aware of the concerns that many of my fellow Virginians \nfeel as we approach BRAC once again. But I remain committed to \nsupporting the Bush administration during this time of national \nemergency. When thinking objectively, everyone understands the urgency \nof utilizing our assets in the most effective manner possible. I am \nconfident in the Secretary and commission's ability to conduct an \nobjective assessment of the Nation's defense infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1438, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002. At the outset, \nI must commend Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin for \nagreeing to a compromise to the committee-reported version of the \ndefense authorization bill, by restoring $1.3 billion for the \nPresident's missile defense proposal, and removing language that would \nhave harmed timely deployment of a missile defense system for America. \nI was deeply concerned during committee consideration when the \nrestrictive bill language on missile defense was added and the cut in \nthe missile defense program occurred, causing committee Republicans to \nvote unanimously against reporting out the bill.\n  In my 18 years in Congress, I had never seen a Defense authorization \nbill reported out of committee strictly on party lines. I am very \nproud, however, of the unified efforts and spirit of my colleagues \nsince the tragic attacks on September 11, and I am pleased that we are \nworking together to enhance our national security at this crucial time \nin our country's history.\n  It is tremendously important to me that the committee included \nlanguage in the defense authorization bill and report that would \nauthorize payment of retired pay and disability pay for military \nretirees and other eligible veterans--a practice known as ``concurrent \nreceipt.'' For the past 10 years, I have offered legislation on this \nissue. This matter is of great significance to many of our country's \nmilitary retirees, because it would reverse existing, unfair \nregulations that strip retirement pay from military retirees who are \nalso disabled, and costs them any realistic opportunity for post-\nservice earnings. I am pleased that the committee, for the first time, \nhas included language that describes this offset as unfair to disabled \ncareer service members.\n  My friends, we must do more to restore retirement pay for those \nmilitary retirees who are disabled. I have stated before in this \nchamber, and I am compelled to reiterate now--retirement pay and \ndisability pay are distinct types of pay. Retirement pay is for service \nrendered through 20 years of military service. Disability pay is for \nphysical or mental pain or suffering that occurs during and as a result \nof military service. In this case, members with decades of military \nservice receive the same compensation as similarly disabled members who \nserved only a few years; this practice fails to recognize their \nextended, clearly more demanding careers of service to our country. \nThis is patently unfair, and I will continue to work diligently to \ncorrect this inequity.\n  In the legislation we are considering today, there are several \nprovisions that will significantly improve the lives of active duty \nmembers, reservists, military retirees, veterans, and their families. \nIt will come as no surprise, however, that I would like to emphasize \nthat this year's Defense authorization bill contains nearly $1 billion \nin pork--unrequested add-ons to the defense budget that deprive our \nmilitary of vital funding for priority issues. While this year's total \nis far less than in previous years, it is still $1 billion too\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\nmuch. Given the grave circumstances facing our nation today, we need to \ndemonstrate to all Americans that we can do better.\n  Over the past six years, Congress has increased the Presidents' \ndefense budgets by nearly $60 billion in order to address the military \nservices' most important unfunded priorities. Still, I think it is \nworth repeating, until the message sinks, in, that the military needs \nless money spent on pork, and more money spent wisely to redress the \nserious readiness and modernization problems caused by a decade of \ndeclining defense budgets.\n  Every year as we work on defense authorization legislation, however, \ncertain items are funded that are not on the Service chiefs' unfunded \nrequirements list and, frankly, whose merits are questionable. For \nexample, I have noticed in the fiscal year 2002 bill a total increase \nof nearly $55 million for advanced automotive technology and related \nfuel cell technology research--it sounds like the Motor City will be \npleased, but what about the Service Chiefs? The auto industry also must \nbe pleased with funding for the National Automotive Center's SmarTruck \nArmy program. In a Washington Post investigative report last year, it \nwas revealed that the SmarTruck, which was envisioned as a modified \nFord F-350 pick up, has developed into a vehicle that looks like it \nshould be in the next James Bond movie--all paid for with American \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money.\n\n  I am also concerned that despite the President's clear budget request \nfor the procurement of 2 C-130J aircraft for the Air Force, the \ncommittee voted by the narrowest margin to add $99 million for an \nadditional, unrequested C-130J for the Little Rock Air Force Base. DoD \nand GAO have regularly criticized the C-130J program for serious cost \noverruns and development delays; moreover, there is a significant \nsurplus of this platform in the Air Force inventory--called ``an \nembarrassment of riches'' by the Air Force Chief of Staff. This \ncontinued procurement clearly makes the contractor happy,but what about \nthe Service Chiefs? For the $99 million cost of 1 C-130J, our Navy \ncould have procured 2 additional F/A-18 E/Fs, to respond directly to \nthe critical need of replacing aging Navy aircraft inventory--an \ninventory whose airplanes average 18 years old. In fact, the CNO, \nAdmiral Vernon E. Clark, USN, testified before the committee this year \nthat he needs to procure 180 jet aircraft per year just to sustain the \n1997 Quadrennial Defense Review level, considerably more than the 48 F/\nA-18 E/Fs provided in our bill.\n  Just as discouraging, given its pork barrel nature, is a provision \nthat would delay the B-1B Lancer bomber force restructuring or \ndownsizing at a cost of $165 million to U.S. taxpayers. This provision \nhas literally made it illegal for the Secretary of Defense to reduce, \nretire, dismantle, transfer, or reassign the Air National Guard B-1B \nLancer bomber force by 33 aircraft until the following reports have \nbeen prepared: The National Security Review, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, the Revised Nuclear Posture Review, the Secretary of Defense \nReport on the B-1B Lancer Bomber, the Bomber Force Structure Report, \nand a Comptroller General Report on the B-1B Lancer Bomber I have never \nwitnessed a more absurd illustration of congressional micro-management, \nand at such a great cost; the service chiefs will be unable to make \nwise use of this $165 million in fiscal year 2002 and the taxpayers' \nmoney will again be spend imprudently.\n  I would like to mention one further example of wasteful spending. For \nthe last several years, Congress has added money for cultural and \nhistoric preservation activities, which is funded through a program \ncalled the Legacy Resource Management Program, fancy terminology for \npork. The fiscal year 2002 defense authorization bill will add $8 \nmillion to this program, principally for recovery and preservation of \nthe C.S.C. Virginia, which ran aground near Craney Island near the \nJames and Elizabeth Rivers and was set on fire after being abandoned in \nMay 1862. Now, my friends, can't we agree that there are much more \npressing needs, such as improving military readiness and providing \nquality-of-life benefits to our service men and women, than raising \nthis Civil War ironclad?\n  I also hope that we can re-focus our attention on reforming the \nbureaucracy of the Pentagon. With the exception of minor changes, our \ndefense establishment looks just as if did 50 years ago. We must \ncontinue to incorporate practices from the private sector, like \nrestructuring, reforming, creating efficiencies, and streamlining to \neliminate duplication and capitalize on cost savings.\n  More effort must be made to reduce the growth trend of headquarters' \nstaff and to decentralize the Pentagon's morass of bureaucratic \nfiefdoms. Although nearly every military analyst shares these views, \nthis bill instead moves significantly in the direction of increasing \nthe size of headquarters staff, thereby eliminating any incentive for \nthe Pentagon to change its way of doing business with its bloated \norganization and outdated practices.\n  In addition, I appreciate that the Administration and the majority of \nmy colleagues supported one round of Base Realignment and Closure in \n2003, but more must be done to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative \nmilitary contracts and military installations. Every U.S. military \nleader, civilian and uniformed, has testified about the critical need \nfor further BRAC rounds. We can redirect at least $6 billion per year \nby eliminating excess defense infrastructure. There is another $2 \nbillion per year that we can put to better purposes by privatizing or \nconsolidating support and maintenance functions, and an additional $5 \nbillion that can be saved each year by eliminating ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions that undermine U.S. competitiveness overseas. Despite \nthese compelling facts, the defense bill did not address many of these \ncritical issues. And, unfortunately, it includes several provisions \nthat move expressly in the opposite direction. Again, I am pleased that \nmany of my colleagues voted to support Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and \nGeneral Henry H. Shelton, USA, and approve another round of BRAC by a \n53 to 47 rollcall vote.\n\n  In addition, sections in this bill designed to preserve depots, and \nto funnel work in their direction irrespective of cost, are examples of \nthe old philosophy of protecting home-town jobs at the expense of \ngreater efficiencies. And calling plants and depots ``Centers of \nExcellence'' does not, Mr. President, constitute an appropriate \napproach to depot maintenance and manufacturing activities. \nConsequently, neither the Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence \nnor the Center of Excellence in Service Contracting provide adequate \ncloaks for the kind of protectionist and parochial budgeting endemic in \nthe legislating process. Similarly, whether the Center of Academic \nExcellence in Information Assurance Education through the information \nassurance scholarship program is worthy of the $5 million earmarked in \nthe budget is certainly not academic, but clearly debatable.\n  Last year the Defense appropriations bill included a provision \nstatutorily renaming National Guard armories as ``Readiness Centers,'' \na particularly Orwellian use of language. By legally relabeling \n``depot-level activities'' as ``operations at Centers of Industrial and \nTechnical Excellence,'' we further institutionalize this dubious \npractice, the implications of which are to deny the American public the \nmost cost-effective use of their tax dollars. When will it end?\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate my strong commitment to \ncontinuing to work for enactment of meaningful improvements for active \nduty and Reserve service members. They risk their lives to defend our \nshores and preserve democracy, and we can not thank them enough for \ntheir service. But, we can pay them more, improve the benefits for \ntheir families, and support the Reserve Components in a similar manner \nas the active forces. Our service members past, present, and future \nneed these improvements.\n  We owe so much more to the honorable men and women in uniform who \ndefend our country. They are our greatest resource, and I feel they are \nwoefully under-represented. At this time of national sorrow, \nresoluteness, when we in Congress have witnessed so many moving \ndemonstrations of American patriotism, is there any greater duty facing \nus than to work in unity in full support of our service men and women? \nWe must pledge to do our best on their behalf.\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that a list of items added \nto the Defense authorization bill by Congress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION

Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2001 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  This body is understandably focused right now on the issues of \nterrorism and homeland defense. It is entirely appropriate. With the \nimminent release of the Quadrennial Defense Review, however, we should \nnot lose sight of the broader picture of U.S. foreign policy and \nnational security for the decades ahead. While we can and will wage the \nwar against international terrorism that is our duty, we cannot afford \nto ignore other future national security concerns that will most \nassuredly require the United States to maintain a large and robust \nconventional military capability.\n  Chief among our concerns to U.S. national security and alliance \nrelations remains the threat to Taiwan, and to U.S. interests in the \nAsia Pacific of an emerging China. My intent here is not to beat the \ndrums of war, for the events of September 11 have already heightened \nour emotions and awareness of the dangers that confront us in the 21st \ncentury. It would be irresponsible of us, however, to ignore Chinese \nmilitary modernization and its implications for U.S. national security. \nThat is why I believe it imperative that the United States be more \naware of the nature of China's modernization programs. An integral part \nof those efforts is China's acquisition of advanced technologies, \nincluding dual-use technologies.\n  My amendment is simple. It requires the Secretary of Defense to \nprovide an assessment of China's efforts at acquiring certain military-\nrelated technologies, how its military strategy relates to its \ntechnology requirements, and the impact those technology requirements \nand that military strategy have on our ability to protect our interests \nin the Pacific. The amendment would also require the Secretary of \nDefense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to develop a \nlist of technologies that, for purposes of national security, should be \ndenied the People's Republic of China.\n  This amendment is entirely consistent with Congress' overwhelming \nsupport for such initiatives as the creation at the National Defense \nUniversity of a Center for the Study of the Chinese Military, and with \nthe emphasis we have place in force structure discussions on the future \nchallenge of China's growing military strength. It is a commonsense \namendment that I hope will have bipartisan support.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in reviewing S. 1438, I came across a \nprovision that would have disastrous consequences, no matter what its \noriginal intentions might have been.\n  I am talking about section 1062, making it unlawful for individuals \nto possess any ``significant military equipment'' ever owned by the \nDepartment of Defense that is not demilitarized and giving the Attorney \nGeneral the authority to seize such items. ``Significant military \nequipment'' can mean a wide variety of goods; for example, it can \ninclude military vehicles, aircraft, ammunition, firearms and parts. \n``Demilitarization'' can mean a number of things, too, including \ncutting or destruction.\n  The Department of Defense already can, and does, demilitarize some \nmilitary equipment before surplusing it. I am not advocating a change \nin that current authority.\n  However, section 1062 of S. 1438 goes well beyond this current \nauthority. By making possession of such equipment illegal, it would \ncreate tens of thousands of lawbreakers overnight, veterans, \ncollectors, sportspeople, even museums that have been legally \npurchasing surplus equipment from the government for decades. Worse, \nthis section provides for the confiscation and destruction of items \nthat are now private property.\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\n  Consider the chaos and injustice that would result from enactment of \nthis provision. Veterans service organizations across the country who \nhave acquired military firearms to use for ceremonial purposes, they \nwould be criminals. Americans who learned to shoot and acquired a \nfirearm through the government's own Division of Civilian Marksmanship \nprogram would find themselves being served with a warrant by the same \ngovernment for the same firearm. Museum displays or airshows featuring \nmilitary vehicles or crafts would be threatened. A firearm containing a \nmilitary surplus replacement part would now be subject to confiscation \nand destruction or begin rendered inoperable. In my own state, a \ncollector of military Jeeps would risk losing his investment and his \ncollection through no fault of his own.\n  This provision is breathtaking in its reach and unfairness, capturing \nmillions of items and their law-abiding owners. This is why an even \nless-onerous provision in the last DOD Authorization bill was dropped \nduring the House-Senate conference on that bill. That same conclusion \nmust be reached by the conferees on S. 1438; this provision must be \ndropped in order to prevent certain harm.\n\n\n            Private Insurance Products of BRAC Installations\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is well known that \nconcerns about future liability have been a significant impediment to \nthe remediation and reuse of military installations closed through the \nBRAC process. Private insurance products have proven an effective tool \nfor addressing the liability concerns of local governments, contractors \nand developers of BRAC installations. With these products in hand, \nlocal governments, contractors, and developers of BRAC installations \nhave been willing to accept the early transfer of contaminated DOD \nsites, and they have been willing to accept fixed price arrangements \nwith DOD to complete the cleanup of sites. These arrangements encourage \nthe better coordination of remediation and reuse, accelerating both, \nthey save the Federal Government significant money in the process. \nWould the distinguished managers of the bill agree that the military \nservices should consider the use of private insurance products as a \nmethod for expediting the remediation and reuse of BRAc installations, \nwhen appropriate cost savings can be achieved?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do believe the services should consider such insurance \nproducts.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address the subject of our \nNation's security needs in the context of the Defense authorization \nbill presently before the Senate.\n  I believe we must provide the best possible training, equipment, and \npreparation for our military forces, so they can effectively carry out \nwhatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, war-fighting, or other missions \nthey are given. They deserve the targeted pay raises of 5-10 percent \nand deferred maintenance for base housing included in this bill. For \nmany years running, those in our armed forces have been suffering from \na declining quality of life, despite rising Pentagon budgets. The \npressing needs of our dedicated men and women in uniform, and those of \ntheir families, must be addressed as they mobilize for duty in response \nto the attacks of September 11th. This bill does largely address those \nneeds, and I will vote for it today.\n  Even so, I have a number of concerns about the bill, especially about \nits missile defense provisions. The initial committee language would \nhave cut total funding for missile defense programs from $8.3 billion \nto $7 billion. In addition, it would have required that President Bush \nreturn to Congress with a specific request for funds for any missile \ndefense tests that would violate the ABM Treaty, with congressional \napproval then required to spend those funds. I am disappointed that \nthis language was removed.\n  I oppose the plan to deploy a national missile defense shield for \nmany reasons. The crucial question is whether a missile shield will \nmake the United States more or less secure. After studying the matter \ncarefully, I have concluded that deploying a missile shield is likely \nto make us less secure, and that we would be better off using these \nfunds to finance key anti-terrorism initiatives.\n  The new funding language in the bill allows the President to choose \nbetween missile defense research and development and combating \nterrorism. I believe that fighting terrorism should take priority over \nmissile defense, and should receive most or all of the new funding. I \nfurther believe that spending to combat terrorism is more important \nthan digging silos at Fort Greely, AK. Crews there have already begun \nconstruction of a 135-acre missile field and are planning to begin \nbuilding silos in the Spring of 2002. Russian officials have said they \nwould view construction of the Fort Greely missile silos as a violation \nof the ABM Treaty.\n  Moreover, Moscow has said it would react to U.S. treaty withdrawal by \nabandoning all arms and nonproliferation treaties with Washington and \nmight respond to the missile shield by putting multiple nuclear \nwarheads on some of its missiles. Is it worth jeopardizing the system \nof stable nuclear deterrence that has worked for almost 40 years to \nbuild a very costly system that we don't know will work? I believe it \nis urgent that we strongly support the renewed efforts of Senator Levin \nand others to require the President to seek congressional approval \nbefore spending funds for missile tests that would breach the ABM \nTreaty.\n  I believe in maintaining a strong national defense. We face a number \nof credible threats in the world today, including terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We must make sure we \ncarefully identify the threats we face and tailor our defense spending \nto meet them. We could do a better job of that than this bill does, and \nI hope that as we move to conference, the committee will make every \neffort to transfer funds from relatively low-priority programs to those \ndesigned to meet the urgent and immediate anti-terrorism and defense \nneeds of our forces.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to express my support for this bill. \nOn balance, I believe it will greatly benefit our national defense and \nour country. Importantly, we have taken steps to increase pay and \nbenefits for our men and women in uniform and reverse the neglect of \nour Armed Forces over the past decade. For this alone, the legislation \nis an important priority.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight a few of the bill's other \nprovisions that have special significance.\n  First is the amendment I supported concerning the waiver authority \nfor the 50/50 rule which governs outsourcing of maintenance depot work. \nThe amendment moves waiver authority to the Secretary of Defense from \nthe service secretaries. It also requires the Secretary to explain how \nhe will meet the requirements if he requests a waiver. This is vitally \nimportant in order to maintain our depot infrastructure which is a \ncrucial national asset.\n  Also of great interest to our veterans is a provision in the bill \nthat addresses the concurrent receipt problem. For too long, we have \npenalized our disabled military retirees by forcing them to give up \ntheir retirement in order to receive disability pay. Senator Reid's \namendment fixes this by allowing our military retirees to receive both \ntheir retirement pay and their disability pay. The sacrifice of \ndisabled veterans should not be diminished by this unfair penalty, and \nI am happy to have cosponsored Senator Reid's amendment which rectifies \nthis inequity.\n  I am also pleased that S. 1438 includes another provision which would \naddress a gross inequity in the law. Currently, a retirement-eligible \nservice member who dies in the line of duty is not considered vested in \nthe military retirement program. The bill we are passing today will \nallow for the posthumous retirement of the member and thus provide \nadditional benefits to the surviving spouse and children.\n  The bill also includes an additional $5 million for consequence \nmanagement training involving weapons of mass destruction. This will \nmake use of the unique training capabilities that exist at Dugway \nProving Ground in Utah. I think we will all agree this is very timely \ngiven the terrorist threats our nation is facing.\n  I am committed to ensuring adequate resources are available to train \nunits, civil support teams and other teams and individuals in combating \nterrorism. To that end, I support the bill's\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\nprovision to require the Secretary of Defense to report back on the \ncapabilities of defense installations, such as Fort Leonard Wood and \nDugway Proving Ground, to train first responders.\n  Along with the positive aspects of the bill, there are still \nprovisions with which I disagree. First and foremost of these is the \nauthorization for a round of base closures in 2003. This is simply not \nthe moment to spend inordinate amounts of time and federal tax dollars \npreparing for base closings. The Nation's military bases and the \nmilitary establishment need to be focused on the war effort. I hope \nthat this unwise language will be dropped by the conferees.\n  Additionally, I oppose the provision concerning the Federal Prison \nIndustries. Any change to Federal Prison Industries should be part of a \ncomprehensive overhaul rather than piecemeal changes in an unrelated \nbill. The ability to put prisoners to work greatly contributes to their \nrehabilitation. Without a market for the goods, an important tool is \neliminated. Again, I am hopeful this provision will be dropped in \nconference.\n  I was very disappointed, that the bill did not include the Service \nMembers Protection Act. By prohibiting the Government from cooperating \nin any way with the International Criminal Court, this legislation \nwould protect our service members from unjust and arbitrary \nprosecutions for carrying out policies of the United States Government. \nI will continue to work with Senator Helms, the author of the \nlegislation, to secure its passage.\n  Before closing, I also want to discuss Senator Domenici's amendment \nto make spending for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund \nmandatory. I am heartened the amendment will be included in the bill we \nare about to pass. I strongly support this amendment and commend \nSenator Domenici on a job well done.\n  Over the past months, Senator Domenici and I have worked together to \nmake needed improvements to the RECA program. We have been joined in \nthis effort by Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Senators Bingaman, Reid, \nCampbell, Wellstone and Johnson.\n  I feel safe in speaking for all of us when I express the shock and \noutrage we felt upon learning that the RECA trust fund was empty and \nthat our constituents were receiving IOUs for the compensation they \ndeserved. We vowed to our constituents that we would work day and night \nto ensure that funding for RECA would be guaranteed, and when this \namendment is enacted, that promise will be fulfilled for the next \ndecade.\n  As my colleagues are aware, earlier this year, I introduced \nlegislation, S. 898, which includes language similar to the Domenici \namendment. This language would also make spending for RECA mandatory, \nso that the appropriators would automatically fund the program each \nyear. It will guarantee that all eligible individuals would receive \ntheir compensation in a timely manner.\n  Despite all of our efforts, despite the RECA claimants' good faith, \nand despite the hard work of Justice Department officials administering \nthe program, the Trust Fund became depleted in March of 2000. This \nsituation was simply unacceptable. RECA claimants began receiving \n``IOU'' letters from the Federal Government in lieu of checks until we \napproved this year's supplemental appropriations bill, which covered \nthe past IOUs and all claims approved as of September 30, 2001. \nHowever, many new claims will be approved in the coming years and, \ntherefore, it is imperative that spending for this program become \nmandatory.\n  And while these mandatory funds will provide a substantial amount of \nmoney to the RECA trust fund from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year \n2011, it is important to know that this will not completely solve our \nconstituents' concerns, we will still need more Federal money to \nprovide compensation to all RECA victims. Let me assure these \nindividuals, especially my fellow Utahns, that I will continue to fight \nthis battle until all individuals are compensated by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  On a whole, this is a very good bill crafted by very good lawmakers. \nIt begins to provide the Defense Department with adequate resources \nafter 10 years of erosion. However, this is only the first installment; \nthere is yet much to be done. I hope to work with my colleagues in the \ndays and months ahead to ensure that we strengthen our defense posture \nas quickly and as effectively as possible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, under normal circumstances, it is likely \nthat I would have opposed this bill. Under normal circumstances, I may \nhave offered amendments to realign the Pentagon's lingering cold war \nmentality with the realities of the post-cold war world. Under normal \ncircumstances, there would have been a more comprehensive debate on the \nproposed national missile defense system.\n  But as we all know, these are not normal times. The tragedies that \nbegan to unfold in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania on \nSeptember 11, and the bold strike against terrorism that this country \nand our men and women in uniform are about to launch, demand a unified \nCongress and a unified nation. For those reasons, I will vote in favor \nof this bill.\n  The events of the past three weeks have crystalized support for our \nArmed Forces and have made it very clear that we should ensure that \nthey have the resources necessary for the daunting task that lies \nahead. But this strong sense of unity does not require Congress to \nabdicate its responsibility to review closely the funding requests of \nthe President, and it does not prohibit discussions about the direction \nof federal spending, including defense spending.\n  Each year that I have been a member of this body, I have expressed my \nconcern about the priorities of the Pentagon and about the process by \nwhich we consider the Department of Defense authorization and \nappropriations bills. I am troubled that the Department of Defense does \nnot receive the same scrutiny as other parts of our Federal budget. \nThis time of unprecedented national crisis underscores the need for the \nCongress and the administration to take a hard look at the Pentagon's \nbudget to ensure that scarce taxpayer dollars are targeted to those \nprograms that are necessary to defend our country in the post-cold war \nworld and to ensure that our Armed Forces have the resources they need \nfor the battles ahead.\n  I look forward to reviewing carefully the recently released \nQuadrennial Defense Review, a document which I believe should have been \nsubmitted in conjunction with the fiscal year 2002 defense budget \nrequest. At a time when the Department of Defense has rightly \nundertaken a comprehensive review of our military and its missions, it \nis troubling that we will pass yet another defense bill that is largely \nrooted in the long-ended cold war. I commend the Secretary of Defense \nfor acknowledging the impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks on \nour future defense strategy, and urge him to continue to analyze of the \nrole of our Armed Forces in combating terrorism and other challenges of \nthe post-cold war world.\n  This bill is not perfect. To be sure, there are some good things in \nit. I am pleased that the committee has reduced the President's \nprocurement request for the troubled V-22 Osprey from 12 aircraft to \nnine. I remain concerned, however, that those nine aircraft, and the \nOspreys that have already been built and are currently being built, \nwill require costly and extensive retrofitting following the ongoing \nreview of the program. Since it remains unclear whether many of the \nproblems with this aircraft can be fixed, and since the Department of \nDefense's decision on whether to move forward with this program remains \na long way off, I am pleased that the committee has included language \nin its report requiring the Department of Defense to study alternatives \nto this aircraft.\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to provide them with safe, \neffective equipment. Their safety should be the principle that guides \nthe important decision as to whether to proceed with this program. We \nshould not move forward until we know for certain that this aircraft is \nsafe and that the design flaws addressed in numerous reports have been \ncorrected.\n  We also owe it to our military personnel and their families to \nprovide them with decent facilities and housing. For that reason, I \nstrongly support the provision of this bill that authorizes another \nround of base closures. We should continue to reassess our base \nstructure to ensure that we are maximizing the use of our defense \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\n By closing bases that are no longer needed, we can help to ensure that \nour military personnel and their families are not being forced to live \nand work in hazardous conditions. The decision to move forward with \nanother round of base closures is an example of the hard decisions that \nthis body will have to make as we face the realities of the Federal \nbudget.\n  I am also concerned that this bill again focuses on procurement of \ncostly weapons systems at a time when we should be redirecting more \nfunding to readiness and to quality of life programs for our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families. I regret that this bill authorizes \nthe conversion of four Trident I submarines to carry conventional \nweapons when the Defense Department requested the conversion of two \nsubmarines and the retirement of two submarines. I also regret that we \ncontinue to procure cold war-era weapons such as the Trident II \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missile and that we continue to operate \nthe Navy's Extremely Low Frequency communications system.\n  This is a time for the administration, the Congress, and the country \nto stand together in the face of the horrific attacks on September 11. \nWe must do everything we can to support our military personnel as they \nprepare to combat the forces of evil who perpetrated these vicious \ncrimes and those who offer them financing, shelter, and support. While \nthis bill is far from perfect, I will vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are about to vote in 2 or 3 minutes; am \nI not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like at this time again to thank all colleagues \nfor their assistance in getting this very important piece of \nlegislation up and carefully considered over a period of several days.\n  I thank the staffs--on my senior staff, Les Brownlee, who hopefully \nwill be moving on to other assignments here in the near future, and \nDavid Lyles, his counterpart, and others. I am most grateful. Senator \nLevin and I have been on this committee 23 years. I guess this is our \n23rd bill. We have had tremendous cooperation from colleagues, staff, \nand otherwise.\n  This morning it was quite clear there was unanimity on both sides of \nthe aisle to proceed with this bill.\n  I thank my distinguished chairman. It is a pleasure to work with him. \nWe had some hard decisions to make and I think we made them basically \ntogether. We eliminated from the bill many provisions which the \nchairman felt very strongly about regarding the missile defense funding \nlanguage. But it was done, and done in a spirit to get this bill up and \npassed in the Senate, so now we go to the House and conference and \nhopefully we will send up to the President a very fine bill on behalf \nof the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Warner, his staff, and all the Members of \nthe Armed Services Committee for working in such a spirit of unity.\n  Our committee always is able to come together on national security \nmatters. It has always been a joy to work on the Armed Services \nCommittee because that committee works in such a bipartisan spirit.\n  There are differences from time to time, but those differences are \nresolved in ways which contribute to the security of this Nation. Now \nthat we are in an emergency situation, more than ever it is essential \nthat this committee help lead the way, in a way that does not avoid \ndebate on issues but, where we were unable to resolve issues, that they \nbe deferred. There are some issues that have been deferred to a later \ndate for reasons I expressed at great length yesterday. The Presiding \nOfficer had an opportunity to listen to that.\n  We have preserved our position on that. It is an important position, \nand we will raise that if and when the circumstances are appropriate. \nBut for the time being, what is important is that this Senate now has a \nchance to express with one unified voice support for the men and women \nin the military, to make sure they have everything they need; that they \nhave the resources, training, the equipment; that they have the pay; \nthat they have the housing.\n  We have done everything we can, working with the administration, to \nspeak with one strong and unified voice that the men and women in the \nmilitary should be able to count on us in normal times and surely they \nought to be able to count on us in these emergency times. I believe \nvery firmly this bill does exactly that.\n  It could not have been accomplished, again, without the assistance of \nour staffs.\n  They are extraordinary. Again, Senator Warner, as always, has worked \nvery closely to make sure we could act together. For that I am \ngrateful. I think the Nation is in his debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have nothing but accolades for the \nchairman and for the distinguished Senator from Virginia. This was a \ntough bill to put together. This is not the first time that it was \ntough and we got it done. We have had some where we didn't get it done. \nWe had some that didn't reach conference until some events which \nweren't planned broke and it gave the bill momentum.\n  I am not here to complain about their efforts, their diligent work. \nBut I am a little concerned about the fact that I had some very good \namendments pending. There is a very serious misunderstanding because it \nseems to me that my staff was working with staff on a number of these \namendments.\n  I was preparing to pull some of the amendments in a negotiation \nprocess. I want to state two of them that would have been very \nimportant to have. It has cosponsors, such as Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Landrieu, and Senator Thurmond.\n  It has to do with trying to make sure the United States in its \nworkings with Russia on plutonium disposition programs, which I happen \nto have something to do with--$200 million was appropriated to start \nthis program in an urgent supplemental 2 years ago. You all know we \nhave been having some very difficult problems carrying that \nnonproliferation agreement to fruition. It was supposed to be for \nAmerica getting rid of some of its plutonium and Russia getting rid of \nsome of theirs in a kind of collateral way. And we were putting up $200 \nmillion to get it going.\n  The administration has decided to change the program by cutting two \nor three pieces of the program but offered no plan.\n  All this says is when you have a plan, send it up, and we will \nconsider it. In the meantime, we don't think you should pick a piece \nout of the program without telling us how you are going to keep it \nintact.\n  I think anybody around here would have accepted that, or at least \nwould have thought it was something very serious, unless they do not \ncare about the program. There are some who do not think the plutonium \ndisposition program is very good. But they don't have the luxury of \ndeciding that it is not good. It is the law of the land right now. It \nis hard and difficult to get it done.\n  An example of another one: Senator Bingaman, Senator Lugar, and \nSenator Hagel. This is on the coordination of nonproliferation programs \nand assistance thereto.\n  There is no question on the part of those experts around who looked \nat this issue that we have to coordinate these programs. We have come \nto the word ``coordination'' after this terrorist attack as it applies \nto a lot of programs. We must coordinate better between the FBI and \ntheir information system, the CIA and theirs, and DOE and theirs. We \nfinally decided to get something coordinated.\n\n  Frankly, on the nonproliferation programs, we are desperately in need \nof coordination. God forbid that something happens and we will say, \nWhere was the coordination? At least we can say we have been trying for \na long time to get coordination. We didn't get it in this amendment \nbecause for some reason somebody here had a misunderstanding with us--\nneither of these two\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\nSenators--or they just didn't think we ought to be doing this kind of \nthing on this bill.\n  In a sense, the cloture may very well have closed these off, but in \nthe middle of negotiations we thought we should probably not have \nthought that. We probably should not have. Unless it gets done, we \nshouldn't think that in negotiations.\n  Having said that, I want to put these two amendments in by way of \nsome thought that will go into what I was talking about. I will choose \nto take the remainder of my amendments and put them in now so that \nsomebody at some point will be able to look and see if their amendments \nwere reasonably good amendments. I believe with the exception of one or \ntwo, which I was prepared to change or withdraw, they are very good \namendments. Ultimately, they are needed and should be paid for.\n  I will submit the package for perusal by those who might want to take \na look to see if we could have made the bill a bit better, and at least \nbe given some reasonable consideration.\n  I thank the Senators. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might for 1 minute, I think the \nSenator from New Mexico has some very constructive suggestions. I am \nfamiliar with them. I spoke just this morning with Senator Lugar about \na letter which he wrote to the Secretary of Defense, which is the \nsubject matter of one of these amendments. I would have signed the \nletter with him. Yesterday I was engaged here. I hope in the context of \nthe conference and otherwise we can address these important matters.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It will be in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield, \nlet me also say, as someone who supports those amendments, that I will \nbe working very hard in conference to see if we can find some way that \nis permitted in conference to get some of those issues resolved. I \nhappen to be one who strongly supports those amendments. I thank him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Michigan has attended a number of \nmeetings where these issues were discussed. They are really serious \nissues. They will be coming along in a very good way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate our two managers for the \noutstanding job they have done in getting us to this point. It was not \neasy. I am grateful to my chairman and to our ranking member for the \nexcellent job they did in maneuvering and orchestrating the effort to \nthis point. I expect we will have a very good vote, thanks in large \nmeasure to their leadership.\n  After this vote, it is my intention to move to the Vietnam trade \nbill. There may be a request to have a vote on the motion to proceed. \nIt would be my desire to have the vote, if it is required, immediately \nfollowing the vote on the Defense authorization bill. I urge Members to \nstay until we can clarify whether or not a second vote is required. If \nit is not required, the vote on the Defense authorization bill will be \nthe final vote for the day.\n  We will be on the Vietnam trade bill either way--either on the motion \nto proceed, which I don't expect, or on the bill itself.\n  As my colleagues I am sure know, there is a 20-hour time limit. It is \nmy hope and my plea that we don't feel the need to spend all 20 hours \non this bill. It is an important piece of legislation. I don't minimize \nit. But we have a lot of work to do in what is a short workweek once \nagain. We will take up the bill. I am hopeful we can have a good debate \ntonight and then vote on it tomorrow, and hopefully early in the day.\n  I ask my colleagues to stay on the floor until we know for sure \nwhether there is a second vote. I urge my colleagues as well to come \nand debate this bill so we can move it along and, hopefully, vote on \nits final passage sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, could I add my thanks to the majority \nleader for his very strong and determined leadership to bring this bill \nto a close. I must say it could not have happened without the \ndetermination of the majority leader to finally just simply file \ncloture. That is what it came to. We were not able to bring this to \nclosure without that cloture motion.\n  The majority leader's leadership has been absolutely superb and \nessential. That is going to permit us to have a strong vote and a \nunified, bipartisan voice in support of our troops. Both the majority \nleader and the Republican leader at an earlier time had sought to limit \namendments to some kind of procedure. I thank both the majority and \nRepublican leaders for that effort. They did not succeed in achieving \nthat, but the next step will be taken. The majority leader took that \naction. That is the true mark of leadership, and the Nation is very \nmuch in his debt.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the chairman for his comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in thanking the Republican and \nDemocrat leadership for their assistance in getting us to this point. \nSenator Lott and Senator Nickles also were on the floor last night \nuntil 8 o'clock, as was Senator Reid. We thank them.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nThurmond), is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Thurmond) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor the Senate to proceed en bloc to the consideration of the following \ncalendar items: Calendar No. 156, S. 1417; Calendar No. 157, S. 1418; \nand Calendar No. 158, S. 1419; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, en bloc; that the following divisions of S. 1438, as passed \nthe Senate, be inserted as follows: Division A, S. 1419; Division B, S. \n1418; and Division C, S. 1417; that the bills be read a third time, \npassed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; \nand that the consideration of these items appear separately in the \nRecord. I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to S. 1438, \nS. 1417, S. 1418, and S. 1419, as passed the\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nSenate; that if the Senate receives a message from the House with \nrespect to any of these bills, the Senate then proceed to the House \nmessage; that the Senate disagree to the House amendment or amendments, \nagree to the request for a conference on the disagreeing votes of the \ntwo Houses, or request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses; and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees with the above occurring with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, sometimes seemingly small issues take \non a great significance in large debates. I raised the prospect of \nobjecting to going to conference on this bill because of an issue that \nboth in my State and potentially in my country looms very large.\n  A week ago, I raised with the committee my concerns that because of a \nmerger by General Dynamics and another corporation, the United States \nof America is being left with one producer of smokeless gunpowder. One. \nOne plant, one company, one location.\n  It is a highly volatile matter. Aside from the questions of what this \ndoes to the competitiveness for cost for the Pentagon, the waste it may \nproduce, there is the danger of loss of production.\n  I remind my colleagues this is what fuels the TOW missile, hundreds \nof which are probably now making their way to the Middle East for \nantitank operations; our strategic forces with the Trident, the \nHellfire missile that is used from aircraft and helicopters, one \nmanufacturer.\n  It is my understanding the Pentagon is now considering acquiescing to \nan action by the Federal Trade Commission because of concerns about \nwhat this will do to government costs, monopoly status, safety and \nquality for what is a matter of great significance to our Armed Forces.\n  It was my hope and intention to include an amendment in the \nlegislation that would have put the Senate on record that indeed the \nFederal Trade Commission should investigate and, if appropriate, take \nthe proper action.\n  In my judgment, the right action is for the Pentagon to indeed ensure \nthere are two suppliers and to divide the contract as we do with so \nmany other items that are important for national security.\n  Because of the cloture vote, I could not include this amendment in \nthe legislation, but it is my understanding the Secretary of Defense \nhas now decided on the merits, on his own volition, to accede to the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  I inquire of the chairman of the committee his understanding of this \naction and whatever actions he might be taking in coming days in regard \nto this concern.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from New Jersey for a number of things: \nFirst, for voting for cloture in a very difficult situation where he \nhad an amendment about which he feels so strongly, which I happen to \nsupport. The amendment was also, of course, cosponsored by Senators \nCarper and Corzine. Even though this amendment would not be in order \nafter the cloture vote, the stakes were so great in terms of the \nNation's security to get this bill passed that we had a strong vote for \ncloture nonetheless. This was true of the Senator from New Jersey and a \nnumber of other Senators who knew their amendments would not be in \norder if cloture, in fact, were invoked. I thank him for putting that \nneed of this Nation so high that even though this amendment which is so \nimportant then could not be made germane, nonetheless cloture was voted \nfor.\n  We understand the Defense Department is going to express a view on \nthis matter to the Federal Trade Commission, if it has not already done \nso, within the next few days. While I am not in a position to take a \nposition on the merits because I do not know enough about the merits, \nand I would not do it anyway, I nonetheless believe it is important \nthat the Department of Defense express itself, as the Senator's \namendment provided for, since the amendment simply said it was the \nsense of the Senate the Department of Defense should express its views \non the antitrust implications of the joint venture described in \nsubsection A to the FTC not later than 30 days after enactment.\n  I felt that was a very reasonable approach. It did not weigh in on \nthe merits. It simply said this matter was so important the Defense \nDepartment should express its views.\n  The Senator has my assurance that if for any reason the Defense \nDepartment does not express its views to the FTC before we complete \nconference, or if it has not already done so, I would take whatever \nsteps I could to make sure that, in fact, it does so before we bring \nback the conference report to the Senate.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Levin, for his consideration and his support. I \nbelieve the Secretary of Defense will make a proper communication to \nthe Federal Trade Commission. If for any reason he does not, I am very \ngrateful the chairman of the committee will express his own views at \nthe appropriate time.\n  Obviously, if this is not successful in conference with this matter, \nwe will return on the appropriations bill. What matters most is not \nsimply the Greentree Chemicals and these few hundred people in Parlin, \nNJ, and those who work in Delaware. They matter to me and they matter \nto me enormously. More significantly, at a time when we have seen the \nvulnerability of our country and at a time of national emergency, the \nNation, for principal defense items, cannot either on this specific \nitem or speaking more broadly in national defense generally ever limit \nitself to single suppliers or create choke points in supplying our \nArmed Forces.\n  Today I am rising on behalf of a small company in New Jersey, but \ntomorrow it could be somebody in any city in any State in America. The \nprinciple still stands. We live in an age of terrorism, and even if we \ndid not, we live in a time where simple industrial accidents cannot \nimpair the ability of our country to supply ourselves or our Armed \nForces.\n  I thank the Secretary of Defense for the action he has promised with \nthe Federal Trade Commission, and I am particularly grateful to the \nSenator from Michigan for his own statement of support.\n  I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  The bill (S. 1417) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2002 \nfor defense activities of the Department of Energy, and for other \npurposes, was considered, ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nread the third time, and passed.\n  (See Division C of S. 1438, which will be printed in a future edition \nof the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10055-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  The bill (S. 1418) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2002 \nfor military construction, and for other purposes, was considered, \nordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read the third time, and \npassed.\n  (See Division B of S. 1438, which will be printed in a future edition \nof the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10055-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10055-S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  The bill (S. 1419) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2002 \nfor military activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe \npersonnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for \nother purposes, was considered, ordered to be engrossed for a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n  (See Division A of S. 1438, which will be printed in a future edition \nof the Record.)\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon and I, along with \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and others have been working for years on the \nissue of Internet tax. We still have not reached an agreement. The \nmoratorium expires very soon.\n  We will be introducing legislation today for another 2-year extension \nof the Internet tax moratorium. I hope we can get agreement on that, \nand in calmer and quieter times, we will be able to address and debate \nthe issue of international taxation, which is a very difficult, very \ncomplicated, and an increasingly important issue to Governors, \nlegislators, mayors, and city council members.\n  At this point in our American history, we need an extension of a \ncouple years so in calmer and quieter times we can come to some \nagreement on this very important issue. That does not mean the Senator \nfrom Oregon and I are opposed to Internet taxes per se, but we have a \nlong way to go before we are in agreement, so we will be introducing \nlegislation today. I hope we can get unanimous agreement on it and move \nforward.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today with Senators McCain and Leahy, I am \nintroducing legislation that would extend the moratorium on \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.\n  Senator McCain is absolutely right. The moratorium expires in a few \ndays, and we are very hopeful the bipartisan bill we are going to \nintroduce today is going to help bring the Senate together on what has \nsurely been a very contentious issue.\n  Considerable confusion even exists as to what the current law \nentails. For example, there are countless stories written that say \nthere is a ban on Internet taxes. That is absolutely incorrect. The \nonly thing that is banned today is taxes that single the Internet out \nfor discriminatory treatment. We are extending that ban.\n  As Senator McCain has noted, there are strong feelings on both sides \nof this issue. I happen to believe very strongly that no jurisdiction \nin this country has shown they have been hurt by their inability to \ndiscriminate against the Internet. Certainly folks in State and local \ngovernment feel very strongly about it, and they have a right, at this \ntime of economic concern, to know where the revenue is going to be for \ntheir essential needs.\n  Senator Dorgan, Senator Kerry, Senator Hollings, and I intend to \ncontinue the very constructive conversations we have had literally for \n18 months on the issue, but because it is important to move forward \nquickly, given the fact the moratorium expires, Senator McCain, Senator \nLeahy, and I are introducing our bipartisan effort today and plan to \ncontinue our conversation with our colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10056-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 17, \n2001 in Helena, MT. An openly gay student at Carroll College withdrew \nfrom school 14 days after being knocked unconscious and beaten in his \ndorm room. The victim did not initially report the incident due to fear \nof further retribution. Someone struck the student in the head with a \nbottle as he returned to his room from the dorm showers early in the \nmorning and then beat him while he was unconscious. The attacker also \nwrote ``Die Fag'' on his body with an ink marker.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10056-5", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10056-S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        HONORING DEAN DORT, CHARLES ORLEBEKE, AND DAVID WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call attention to \nthe death, August 26, 2001, of a good friend and distinguished Kansan, \nDane Gray Bales of Logan, KS.\n  Mr. Bales was born in 1918 to a pioneer Kansas family. He served in \nthe Army Air Corps in WWII and returned home to Kansas to work for the \nHansen Oil Company.\n  Throughout his life he was a community builder and civic leader known \nacross the State. Fort Hays State University gave him its Distinguished \nService Award in 1985.\n  Mr. Bales is best known for his untiring support for higher education \nin Kansas. With his wife, Polly, he was life member of the University \nof Kansas Chancellor's Club, the School of Business Dean's Club, the \nSchool of Fine Arts Dean's Club, the Williams Fund, Jayhawks for higher \neducation, the Mt. Oread Fund and other organizations.\n  They were major contributors for the Dane and Polly Bales Organ \nRecital Hall and the Wolff Organ and they established the first organ \nprofessorship at the University of Kansas.\n  I submit for the record a recent article from the Hays Daily News \nthat comments on Mr. Bales' outstanding life of service to Kansas and \nthe eulogy delivered by Kenneth Tidball, superintendent of schools in \nLogan.\n  I ask that the article and eulogy be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Hays Daily News, Sept. 2, 2001]\n\n                              Logan Legacy\n\n       Flags flew at half-staff. Downtown businesses closed early. \n     For at least an hour on Wednesday afternoon, this small \n     Phillips County community closed up shop to pay its respect \n     to a man who was more than just a lifelong resident.\n       Dane Bales embodied the tradition of small-town Kansas. \n     While he carried the portfolio of an accomplished \n     businessman, political activist and world traveler, Bales' \n     appreciation and love for his hometown was one of his \n     greatest attributes.\n       It was something he had learned at an early age.\n       His uncle, Dane G. Hansen, the namesake of a multimillion-\n     dollar trust fund and not-for-profit foundation in downtown \n     Logan, exemplified the same characteristics.\n       Hansen never married, and at the time of his death in 1965, \n     his estate, valued at between $9 million and $16 million, was \n     left to a foundation bearing his name. Those funds were to be \n     used explicitly for the betterment of area residents.\n       That money had grown first from a simple general store, \n     handed down to Hansen by his parents, Danish immigrants who \n     were part of Logan's original settlement in the late 19th \n     century. His business dealings later developed into a \n     lumberyard, then road construction and finally the oil \n     business. Ultimately, Hansen's success developed into exactly \n     what he wanted, innumerable opportunities for Kansas \n     residents.\n       For 36 years, it all overseen by his nephew, the lone \n     descendant of the Hansen family.\n       At the time of Hansen's death, Bales was named to head the \n     family trust and also was one of seven men handpicked by his \n     uncle to head the Hansen Foundation. Now, Bales' widow, \n     Polly, said the family legacy will continue, just without a \n     family patriarch heading the board.\n       The couple's only son, Dane G. Bales Jr., died of leukemia \n     in May 1998. His widow, Carol, now of Atchison, still serves \n     as a trustee for the trust and foundation.\n       Polly Bales said legal documents stipulate that the trust \n     will continue for 20 years after the death of the Hansen \n     family's final descendant. That now ensures it will continue \n     through 2021.\n       Although his life was surrounded by great experiences and \n     people of all walks of life, this week Bales was remembered \n     as a man who loved a few simple things.\n       The Rev. Ron Lowry told the hundreds of people who packed \n     into the Logan United Methodist Church for Bales' funeral \n     that he frequently tries to ``find the unique'' things in a \n     person. That was a simple task this week, he said. ``There \n     were so many unique things about Dane.''\n       Neighbor Kenneth Tidball talked about Bales' passion for \n     golf. And while he loved Kansas football and basketball, golf \n     had been his game for a number of years. He played his last \n     round of 18 holes less than a month ago.\n       Following a lifelong admiration for airplanes, at age 46 he \n     learned to fly and bought his first plane. Also an \n     accomplished ham radio operator, Lowry said he shared that \n     hobby with Bales. As he talked to Polly Bales about it, she \n     joked with Lowry that if he's ever able to send a message to \n     Bales' signal, he was to notify Bales that she also expected \n     to hear from him.\n       ``I appreciated the kind of love they had for each other,'' \n     Lowry said. ``They were such a complement to each other.''\n       The two met while students at the University of Kansas. \n     Polly Bales said her husband of nearly 60 years was dating \n     her roommate while they were in school.\n       ``I was trying to get the two of them together,'' she \n     recalled.\n       Then one night, Bales called and asked if she wanted to go \n     to Kansas City to attend an Ella Fitzgerald concert.\n       ``I said, `Oh I sure did.' That's how it started. We dated \n     for at least a year and a half. I wasn't trying to get him. I \n     didn't really notice him, but that's how it worked out,'' she \n     said.\n       Their love of the Jayhawks was a shared passion. They were \n     members of countless school-related organizations and \n     activities, all dedicated to the promotion of higher \n     education.\n       For 21 years they have hosted the area KU Honors Program, \n     and in recent years have welcomed KU Chancellor Robert \n     Hemenway's Wheat State Whirlwind Tour to the Dane G. Hansen \n     Memorial Museum and Hansen Plaza. They were among the first \n     to tour with the KU Flying Jayhawks and traveled with the \n     group on 30 international trips.\n       They were major contributors for the Dane and Polly Bales \n     Organ Recital Hall, adjacent to KU's performing arts center \n     in Lawrence, and the couple since have established the \n     university's first organ professorship.\n       Although Polly Bales said at first they ``protested a \n     little bit'' the name of the recital hall, school officials \n     told them that the Board of Regents already had decided on \n     its name.\n       ``So much of what we have is because of the Hansens. We \n     thought that would be the name attached to it, but they said \n     it was done. That was what they had decided,'' said Polly \n     Bales, a former organ student at KU. ``What an honor.''\n       In 1985, the couple were awarded the Fort Hays State \n     University Distinguished Service Award. Two years later, they \n     were included in the KU Gallery of Outstanding Kansans, and \n     both have received the Fred Ellsworth Medallion from the \n     university.\n       ``We were in pretty heady company,'' Polly Bales said with \n     a smile.\n       Earlier this year, the couple received the Volunteers of \n     the Year award from a 10-state district of the Council for \n     Advancement and Support of Education.\n       All of those recognitions, which Polly Bales said they both \n     cherished, hang in the hallway of the couple's home, built on \n     the same stretch of land where Bales was born and where he \n     died, and just across the street from Hansen Plaza.\n       ``I always told him he didn't go too far,'' Polly Bales \n     said of her husband, joking that he was born, worked and even \n     died in an area equivalent to the size of a couple of city \n     blocks.\n       His steadfast commitment to his hometown has not gone \n     unnoticed. His death in fact brought an end to a long-\n     standing record in Logan, 130 continuous years of business by \n     a member of the Hansen family.\n       This week's issue of the Logan Republican, the weekly \n     newspaper, refers to Bales on its front page as ``a legend.''\n       ``The love he had for our community was extraordinary. He \n     could have chosen to make his home anywhere in the world but \n     he chose to stay in Logan, Kansas, where his family roots had \n     long been a part of our community. The recognition and \n     prestige he gave our little town will forever be \n     remembered.''\n       Even among all of their success and fortune, Polly Bales \n     said she knows her husband would be floored by all the \n     attention showered on him this week. Floral shops delivered \n     more than 80 arrangements in his name, and just one day's \n     mail, full of sympathy cards and condolences, filled a couple \n     of shoeboxes.\n       ``He would be so thankful. I know he would,'' she said as \n     tears filled the corners of her eyes. ``I'm so lucky that I \n     fell into this family. They're so loving, and they've always \n     taken care of me. But I'm going to miss him.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Eulogy for Dane Gray Bales\n\n (By Kenneth Tidball, Superintendent of Schools, Logan, KS, August 29, \n                                 2001)\n\n       A reporter from a big city newspaper called me Monday at my \n     office to ask me why I was doing the eulogy for Dane Gray \n     Bales. He said why isn't the governor or the chancellor of KU \n     or Congressman Moran doing it. I told him I didn't know why, \n     but I could tell him this, no one could be more honored, no \n     one could feel more privileged than I did to talk about what \n     a wonderful, kind, loving man Dane was.\n       I told that reporter that I felt so inadequate to do \n     justice to the man we've come to honor today. There are so \n     many of you gathered here that have had a much longer \n     relationship with Dane that I have; some of you did business \n     with Dane; some of you played golf with Dane; some of you \n     flew, or skiied, or traveled or went to ballgames or \n     supported KU or loved chocolate or did several of those \n     things that made up such a\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n     large part of Dane's life; I didn't have those special \n     opportunities.\n       My special opportunity was that Dane was my neighbor. When \n     we moved back to Logan, God saw to it that we had the special \n     privilege of moving next door to the Bales. There I learned \n     to respect and admire a descendent of true pioneer stock, a \n     man with more determination and tenacity than most of us have \n     bones in our body, a man who could do hand-to-hand combat \n     with his fountain in the yard, or underground sprinkler and \n     make them work again. He could also talk about world affairs, \n     the stock market, education and consumer prices.\n       But a special delight was I always knew things were right \n     with the world when I would look out my east window and see \n     Dane up on his roof with his leaf blower, or getting ready to \n     go play golf; wrestling with his fountain or getting ready to \n     play golf; filling his bird feeder, putting ears of corn out \n     for the squirrels, or getting ready to go play golf. There's \n     no doubt about it, Dane loved to play golf.\n       Some of his golfing buddies have told me stories about \n     Dane's game. Rich Wallgren says his special putting \n     technique, the jump-n-putt, should be adopted by the PGA \n     tour.\n       Jerry Patterson gave me the following observation from \n     which I now quote:\n       ``I have played a lot of golf with Dane, all over the state \n     of Kansas and in a few other states as well. Dane was a very \n     honest person in all that he was involved in. At the age of \n     83 his golf game wasn't as good as it might have once been \n     and after tallying up, say an 8 on a hole, the scorekeeper, \n     which was usually Rich or I, would try to make it a little \n     easier on him. We'd ask Dane, `You had a 7 didn't you?' He \n     would answer back `No, I had a dag-blasted 8.' If you are a \n     golfer you know when someone offers to give you one less \n     stroke on a hole, it tests your honesty. Dane always \n     declined.\n       Dane loved the game of golf and when we had finished for \n     the day, he would often ask, `Where are we going tomorrow?' \n     The answer from the rest of us usually was, `I don't care, \n     wherever you guys want to.' ''\n       Dane played 18 holes less than a month ago.\n       As dedicated as he was to his golf, he was even more \n     dedicated to the responsibility of his office. Less than \n     three weeks ago, Dane came back from KU medical center to \n     work in his office for two hours because the trustee meeting \n     was the following day. Dane faithfully felt the \n     responsibility and the importance of carrying out the wishes \n     of his Uncle Dane and rarely missed a meeting of either the \n     Foundation or the Trust. As they traveled around the world, \n     to 60 different countries, I always knew they would be home \n     for the third Friday of the month.\n       There is no doubt that Dane was respected by important \n     people and men of position. He was invited by then Secretary \n     of Defense Dick Cheney to become a member of the Joint \n     Civilian Orientation Committee and later the Defense \n     Orientation Conference Association. With these organizations, \n     Dane visited U.S. military installations in the U.S. and \n     abroad.\n       Dane was among the first six men inducted into the Kansas \n     Oil Pioneer Hall of Fame.\n       He and Polly were awarded the Fred Ellsworth Medallion for \n     unique and significant service to KU and the Distinguished \n     Service Award from Fort Hays State University. He and Polly \n     received the Volunteer Award for District 6 for the \n     Advancement and Support of Education.\n       He was a member of the Chancellor's Club, School of \n     Business Dean's Club, Williams Fund, School of Fine Arts \n     Dean's Club, Friends of the Lied Center, Friends of KU \n     Libraries, Friends of Spencer Museum of Art.\n       Dane and Polly were honored by the KU Gallery of \n     Outstanding Kansans in 1987.\n       There is no doubt about it, Dane has made his mark on the \n     face of this earth. In the oil industry, in defense, in \n     education, in the world of music with his role in the \n     construction of the Bales Recital Hall at KU, and in cancer \n     research.\n       A few years ago, I wrote Dane a short letter congratulating \n     him for some recent honor bestowed upon him. I'm going to \n     share with you the gist of that letter. ``In 1964 my father \n     met D.G. Hansen. When he came back from that meeting he told \n     me he had just met the smartest man he'd ever met. I would \n     say the smartest man I ever met was Dane Bales.''\n       You know something, Dane would not like for us to make over \n     him this way, he would be uncomfortable and embarrassed.\n       But I can't help it. I admired him so, I respected him so, \n     and I, like the rest of you, will miss him so.\n       Dane was not a demonstrative person, but his love for Polly \n     was legendary, and although they won't get to celebrate their \n     60th wedding anniversary this November, the last sentence \n     that Dane said to Polly was ``I love you.'' What a beautiful \n     memory.\n       I'm going to close with a quotation from a letter written \n     by a grand-nephew of Dane's just last week. ``A man who \n     spends his life doing God's work and helping others, is a man \n     that will be remembered forever in the hearts of loved ones \n     and all who have known him. I feel my life has been enriched \n     having been able to say that Dane is my uncle. I know in the \n     Bible that a `proud person' is a sinner, but I will be \n     forever `honored' for what my Uncle Dane stands for and \n     believes in. With all my love, Michael.''\n       My life has been enriched having been able to say that Dane \n     was my neighbor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10058-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10058-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10058-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Leahy):\n       S. 1481.

A bill to extend the moratorium enacted by the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act for 2 years, and encourage States to simplify their sales \nand use taxes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to add my support to promoting \nelectronic commerce and keeping it free from discriminatory and \nmultiple State and local taxes. I am pleased to join the senior Senator \nfrom Oregon and the senior Senator from Arizona as an original \ncosponsor of the Internet Tax Moratorium Extension Act. I commend \nSenator Wyden and Senator McCain for their continued leadership on \nInternet tax policy.\n  Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in \nits infancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and \ncreating new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing \nto do. E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply \nto other commerce.\n  Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different \njurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or \nmultiple Internet taxes on E-commerce. Let's not allow the future of \nelectronic commerce, with its great potential to expand the markets of \nMain Street businesses, to be crushed by the weight of discriminatory \ntaxation.\n  We also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional \nState and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected \nfairly and uniformly. This two-year extension of the current moratorium \ngives our Governors and State legislatures time to simplify their sale \ntax rules and reach consensus on a workable national system for \ncollecting sales taxes on E-commerce.\n  E-commerce is growing, our moratorium law is working, and we should \nkeep a good thing going. I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax \nMoratorium Extension Act to encourage online commerce to continue to \ngrow with confidence. I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Allard, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Craig, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\n  S. 1482. A bill to consolidate and revise the authority of the \nSecretary of Agriculture relating to protection of animal health; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nAnimal Health Protection Act, AHPA, of 2001. I am proud that my good \nfriend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, stands with me today, as well as \nSenators Hatch, Dayton, Akaka, Johnson, Allard, Crapo, Craig, Lincoln, \nand Helms. This legislation modernizes and consolidates important \nanimal health statutes. We support the AHPA as a means towards improved \ndomestic livestock protection.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, is currently more prepared to protect our Nation's \nplants from foreign pests and diseases than to protect our domestic \nlivestock from the same threats. Last year, the Plant Protection Act, a \nbill that greatly improved plant protection regulations, was signed \ninto law. We need similar action to protect animal agriculture. The \nAHPA will expand USDA's legal authority to protect animals to that \ncurrently afforded for plant agriculture.\n  The AHPA updates and consolidates animal quarantine and related laws, \nsome of which date back to the late 1800's and replaces them with one \nflexible statutory framework. USDA will be better prepared to take more \neffective, expeditious action to protect animal health.\n  This legislation also gives USDA authority to specifically address \nmodern threats to all aspects of animal health. One such threat is \nfoot-and-mouth disease. As our friends in Great Britain can attest, an \noutbreak of this destructive disease can cost a Nation billions of \ndollars and millions of livestock. In the U.K. alone, over one million \nanimals had to be destroyed as a result of FMD. If we do not update our \nlaws, I worry that our Nation will be vulnerable to the introduction \nand spread of foreign animal diseases like FMD or ``mad cow disease'', \nBSE. The recent discovery of BSE in Japan shows that the threats are \nstill current. The price of prevention is vigilance.\n  Finally, this legislation has become even more important since the \ntragic events of September 11. Concerns about biosecurity and possible \nbiological or chemical attacks directed at our Nations food supply must \nbe taken very seriously. This legislation is crucial to fully protect \ndomestic livestock and the U.S. food supply from these threats.\n  I hope that the Senate will be able to move quickly on this \nlegislation, and I thank Senator Lugar and others for working with me \nto get it introduced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend Family Violence Prevention and Services Act \nto reduce the impact of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking \non the lives of youth and children and provide appropriate services for \nchildren and youth experiencing or exposed to domestic violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today, \nwith Senator Murray, that would address one of the most challenging and \ntragic crimes in our society. This bill is the Children Who Witness \nDomestic Violence Act. It is a comprehensive first step towards \nconfronting the impact of domestic violence on children. This bill \naddresses the issue from multiple perspectives by providing funds for \nseveral key programs.\n  The bill would support multi-system interventions for children who \nwitness domestic violence by providing nonprofit agencies with funding \nto bring various service providers together to design and implement \nintervention programs for children who witness domestic violence. These \nworking partnerships would take advantage of local resources such as \ncounselors, courts, schools, health care providers and battered women's \nprograms to best address the needs of children in violent homes.\n  The bill would also create opportunities for domestic violence \ncommunity agencies and elementary and secondary schools to work \ntogether to address the needs of children who witness and experience \ndomestic violence. For example, domestic violence agencies could work \nwith schools to provide domestic violence training to school officials \nand to students so they can make appropriate referrals and can \nunderstand how witnessing domestic violence impacts children's behavior \nand achievement. The groups could provide anger management and other \neducational programming to students so they can learn about and deal \nwith the problem as they experience it.\n  The bill would also provide training to child welfare, and where \nappropriate, to court and law enforcement personnel to assist them in \nrecognizing and treating domestic violence as a serious problem \nthreatening the safety and well being to both children and adults. \nTraining would include teaching staff to recognize the overlap between \nchild abuse and domestic violence and to better identify the presence \nof domestic violence in child welfare cases. Staff would also be taught \nhow to increase the safety and well-being of child witnesses of \ndomestic violence as well as the safety of the non-abusing parent so \nthat children can stay with their non-abusing parent when it is safe to \ndo so.\n  The bill would provide funds to shelters so they can run programs to \naddress the physical, emotional and logistical needs of children who \nstay there. The bill also would give funds to States to assist private \nand public agencies and organizations in expanding crisis nurseries--\ntemporary respite care for children who are at risk of abuse in their \nhomes. Such nurseries have proven effective in preventing child abuse \nand in keeping families together in a safe way, when possible.\n  Finally, the bill would fund comprehensive research to investigate \nthe link between domestic violence and child abuse, the link between \nchildhood exposure to domestic violence and violent behavior in youth \nand adults, and other key issues that can provide insight into \nappropriate remedies for this devastating problem.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this legislation today, because, as I have \nsaid before, nowhere is violence more isolated from view, more \ndifficult to combat and more far reaching in its impact than violence \nin the home. To turn a blind eye to the suffering of the victims of \ndomestic violence and their children is to be, however unwittingly, \ncomplicitous in the crime because it is out of sight and behind closed \ndoors that domestic violence thrives.\n  This bill reflects the fact that the effects of domestic violence \nextend far beyond the moment when violence occurs. One of the most \ncompelling marks that violence against women leaves is on our children. \nI am reminded of the voice of Quinese Robinson, a teenager from \nMinneapolis, who just last year, came home to find that her mother's \nhusband had brutally murdered her mother. Quinese simply said, ``My Mom \nis the most important person in our life. When he killed her, he \nbasically killed all four of us, because we do not have a mother.''\n  This is one story among millions. It is estimated that as many as 10 \nmillion children witness violence in the home each year, and much of \nthis violence is repetitive. As many as 70 percent of children who \nwitness domestic violence are also victims of child abuse. If we are \nserious about helping children and reducing youth violence, we cannot \nignore the impact of domestic violence on children.\n  Studies indicate that children who witness their fathers beating \ntheir mothers suffer emotional problems, including slowed development, \nsleep disturbances, and feelings of hopelessness, depression, and \nanxiety. Many of these children exhibit more aggressive, anti-social, \nand fearful behaviors. They also show lower social competence that \nother children.\n  Children in homes where their mothers were abused have also shown \nless skill in understanding how others feel when compared to children \nfrom non-violent households. Even one episode of violence can produce \npost-traumatic stress disorder in children. Children who witness \ndomestic violence are at higher risk of suicide.\n  Jeffrey Edleson and others at the Minnesota Center Against Violence \nand\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nAbuse at the University of Minnesota collected multiple studies on the \ndevastating results of this trauma. The examples are painful, but they \ndeserve telling. One 4 year old girl named Julie witnessed her father \nstab her mother to death. In describing the event, Julie consistently \nplaced her father at the scene of the crime and recounted her father's \nefforts to clean up after the crime. She could not describe her \nfather's actions but when the district attorney saw Julie stabbing a \npillow and crying ``Daddy pushed Mommy down,'' he was sure that the \nfather had committed the crime.\n  A child who was being treated at San Francisco General Hospital saw \nhis father cut his mother's throat. For a period of time after the \ncrime, the child could not speak.\n  Not surprisingly, Edleson found that children growing up in violent \nfamilies are more likely to engage in youth violence and that the \nsocial and economic risk factors for youth violence correspond to the \nrisk factors for domestic violence and child abuse.\n  The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. \nDept. of Justice identifies family violence as a major risk factor in \nthe lives of serious, violent and chronic juvenile offenders. It is \nestimated that as many as 40 percent of violent juvenile offenders come \nfrom homes where there is domestic violence.\n  In addition to increasing violence, witnessing domestic violence \ndirectly hinders school achievement. Child witnesses have higher \nincidences of impaired concentration, poor school attendance, being \nlabeled an underachiever, and difficulties in cognitive and academic \nfunctioning.\n  As this overwhelming research indicates, domestic violence and \nviolence against women permeate our entire society. People who try to \nkeep family violence quiet and hidden behind the walls of the home \nignore its tragic echoes in the hearts and minds of our children, in \nour schools, on the streets and in our human relationships.\n  In the face of this devastating situation, I call on my colleagues to \nsay to these child witnesses around the country, that they will not \nsuffer in silence, for that is what their abusers want them to do. \nTheir cries will not be muffled behind closed doors and by the fear \ninflicted by abusive parents. We need to provide these children with a \nway out of violence and a way to deal with the pain of violence.\n  This bill represents a modest step to address this devastating \nproblem. I urge my colleagues, in the names of all of these children, \nto support this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1484. A bill to prevent fraud in the solicitation of charitable \ncontributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Nation's armies of compassion have \nrallied in response to the events of September 11 and thus far have \ncontributed more than $676 million to our Nation's charities. But this \nlargess have proven an irresistible target to criminals who prey upon \nthe generous and good-hearted nature of Americans in this time of \nnational emergency. We heard reports of false charities exploiting \nwell-intentioned Americans during the Gulf War and after the Oklahoma \nCity bombing and we now hear similar reports that the September 11 \nattacks have given these unusually heartless criminals new \nopportunities to perpetrate fraud.\n  Almost daily we hear of American citizens receiving solicitations \nfrom phony charities. News reports from more than a dozen States, from \nNew York to Florida to California, reveal that Americans are being \nasked to contribute to what turn our to be bogus victim funds, phony \nfirefighter funds and questionable charitable organizations. The \nfraudulent solicitation of charitable contributions is a problem all \nacross our Nation.\n  Well-meaning Americans unwittingly contribute an estimated $1.5 \nbillion per year in contributions to fraudulent charities. This $1.5 \nbillion is intended to feed rescue workers, shelter the homeless, and \ncare for those who have lost loved ones. Instead, this money is \nsiphoned into the pockets of cold-hearted criminals. In the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the amount of misappropriated contributions will \nsurely increase. The Better Business Bureau reports that inquiries from \nconsumers about dubious fund-raising practices have increased \napproximately 40 percent since September 11. Unfortunately, these \ncriminals frequently prey upon our Nation's seniors, whose fervent \npatriotism and generous hearts can make them easy marks for a grifter's \nscam.\n  These crooks often try to confuse their victims by using names that \nsound like reputable charities and relief efforts. For example, some \nscam artists ask for donations to the Red Cross of America or the \nArmenian Red Cross, not the legitimate relief organization known the \nworld over as the American Red Cross. Other crooks use the name \n``firefighter fund'' or ``victim's survivors fund'' in their fraudulent \nappeals.\n  While an informed donor is the first line of defense against sham \nsolicitors, there also are steps Congress should take in addressing \nthis problem. Current Federal law targets fraudulent solicitations and \ntelemarketing scams related to the sale of products and services and \nsweepstakes and contests, but does not specifically cover the \nfraudulent solicitation of charitable contributions. That is why I rise \ntoday to offer legislation, the Crimes Against Charitable Americans \nAct, which would authorize law enforcement and regulatory agencies to \nspecifically target these fraudulent solicitation.\n  My bill, the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act, strengthens \nFederal law by first, making it a Federal crime to fraudulent solicit \ncharitable contributions or donations. This crime would be punishable \nby a fine and imprisonment for 5 years, or both, and those convicted \nwould be ordered to provide restitution to their victims. Second, my \nbill increases the penalty from 1 year to 5 years for those convicted \nof impersonating members or agents of the Red Cross in order to solicit \ncontributions. Third, my bill directs the Federal Trade Commission, the \nFederal agency with primary enforcement against consumer fraud, to \ninclude charitable solicitations within its definition of telemarketing \nand to promulgate rules designed to end such fraudulent practices. \nThese FTC regulations also give local and state officials the authority \nto persecute violators, which will increase the possibility that scam \nartists will be caught and punished. Finally, this legislation broadens \nthe definition of telemarketing in federal law to include charitable \nsolicitations and provides for up to a 10-year sentence enhancement for \nanyone who fraudulently solicits charitable contributions in connection \nwith the commission of other Federal crimes. This maximum sentence \nenhancement of 10 years is reserved for those criminals who target our \ngenerous seniors with fraudulent appeals for money.\n  There are more than half-a-million federally recognized charities in \nAmerica that raised more than $200 billion in contributions last year. \nThose who seek to profit from tragedy, especially the events of \nSeptember 11, deserve a special degree of society's scorn and a special \npunishment under federal law. Not only do they steal valuable resources \nfrom the most worthy of recipients, but they erode the trust of the \nAmerican people in legitimate charitable organizations. America is a \ngenerous and compassionate Nation and we must preserve the integrity of \nour charities and their ability to help others. The Senate can protect \nthe noble work of our Nation's charities by passing the Crimes Against \nCharitable Americans Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a letter of \nendorsement from the Bluegrass Area Chapter of the American Red Cross, \nand information sheets from the Federal Trade Commission and the AARP \nabout fraud and charitable donations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and the additional material were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If \n     you're thinking about donating to the cause, here are some \n     tips to help you give wisely:\n       Donate to recognized charities you have given to before. \n     Watch out for similar sounding names. Some phony charities \n     use names that sound or look for those of respected, \n     legitimate organizations.\n       Give directly to the charity, not solicitors for the \n     charity. That's because solicitors take a portion of the \n     proceeds to cover their costs. That leaves less for the \n     victims.\n       Do not give out personal or financial information--\n     including your Social Security number or credit card and bank \n     accounts numbers--to anyone who solicits a contribution from \n     you. Scam artists use this information to commit fraud \n     against you.\n       Check out charities. Contact the Better Business Bureau's \n     Wise Giving Alliance: 4200 Wilson Blvd, Suite 800, Arlington, \n     VA 22203; (703) 276-0100; www.give.org.\n       Don't give cash. For security and tax record purposes, pay \n     by check. Write the official name of the charity on your \n     check. Or you can contribute safety online through \n     www.libertyunites.org.\n       Ask for identification if you're approached in person. Many \n     states require paid fund-raisers to identify themselves as \n     such and to name the charity for which they're soliciting.\n       To report a fraud, contact the Federal Trade Commission \n     toll-free: 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or use the \n     complaint form at www.ftc.gov. The FTC works for the consumer \n     to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business \n     practices in the marketplace and to provide information to \n     help consumers spot, stop and avoid them. The FTC enters \n     Internet, telemarketing, identify theft and other fraud \n     related complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online \n     database available to hundreds of civil and criminal law \n     enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From AARP Bulletin Online, Oct. 2001]\n\n               Tragedy Can be Opportunity for Con Artists\n\n       Be very cautious of anyone soliciting money to help \n     rescuers and victims of the recent tragic events in New York \n     and Washington, D.C. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and \n     other law enforcement agencies, are warning people about \n     phone calls, e-mails or any other attempts to obtain \n     donations.\n       Shortly after the tragedy, con artists claiming to \n     represent victims, firefighters, law enforcement or charities \n     were asking for money. If you want to donate, contact \n     legitimate charities yourself rather than responding to \n     requests.\n       Older consumers report that, on average, they get more than \n     six calls or letters seeking charitable donations every week. \n     That's more than 300 calls or letters every year. More than \n     two-thirds of older consumers are not confident that unknown \n     callers ``really represent the organization they say they \n     do.'' [For more information, visit the AARP website's \n     Telemarketing Fraud section.]\n\n\n                       tips for charitable giving\n\n       Before you give, get more information:\n       Ask the charity's full name, address and telephone number.\n       Ask how much of your donation goes to the program that the \n     request describes--and how much goes to administrative costs.\n       Call your state Attorney General or Secretary of State's \n     office to see if the charity is registered.\n       Depending on your state, charities must file financial and \n     other disclosure statements; get copies, and review them.\n       Don't provide your credit-card number or personal \n     information to telephone or e-mail solicitors.\n\n\n                    be sure you know who is calling\n\n       If a fundraiser calls, call the charity directly to ask if \n     it is really sponsoring a fundraising drive.\n       Also beware of phony charity names that sound similar to \n     legitimate organizations. Don't assume that you know a group \n     because the name or symbols seem familiar.\n\n\n                    protect your charitable dollars\n\n       To ensure that your contributions actually benefit those in \n     need, follow these guidelines:\n       Pay with a check or money order made out to the charity--\n     not the fundraiser itself.\n       Don't give money at the door to a courier or messenger--nor \n     by leaving a check under the doormat. Send your contribution \n     directly to the charity.\n       Don't feel pressured to make a donation on the spot. There \n     will be plenty of opportunities to contribute in the future.\n       Keep records of your donations and pledges, and check your \n     records if someone says you made a pledge that you don't \n     recall.\n       Know the difference between tax deductible and tax exempt. \n     Donations to tax-exempt organizations are not necessarily tax \n     deductible for you. If your donation is tax deductible, get a \n     receipt.\n\n\n                             online giving\n\n       The AARP Bulletin is providing links to some of the \n     legitimate charities collecting money to help the victims of \n     the September 11 tragedies.\n       The following Web sites can provide additional information \n     on charitable giving and charity fraud.\n       Federal Trade Commission: If you suspect charity fraud, you \n     can file a report online with the Federal Trade Commission. \n     http://www.ftc.gov/.\n       Better Business Bureau: The Better Business Bureau has much \n     advice on charitable giving, including donating used cars and \n     tax deductibility issues. http://www.give.org/tips/index.asp.\n       Wise Giving Alliance: Want to check out national charities? \n     This site has reports on hundreds of charities, how much of \n     the money raised goes to administrative or fund raising \n     costs, contact information and charitable missions. http://\nwww.give.org.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10066-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10066-S10067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 165--ESTABLISHING A SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND \n                         SECURITY AND TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS submitted the following resolution; which was referred\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise with 31 of my Senate \ncolleagues to submit a resolution condemning bigotry and violence \ntoward Sikh-Americans.\n  Last week, Amrith Kau Mago, a student at George Washington \nUniversity, from my home State of Illinois, came to my office and \nbrought the serious issue of hate crimes against Sikh-Americans in the \nwake of terrorist attacks on September 11, to my attention.\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\n  On the morning of September 11, 2001, our world as we knew it changed \nforever. On September 11, terrorists coordinated an attack on the \nAmerican people by hijacking four commercial airplanes and flying them \nas missiles into occupied office buildings, the World Trade Center in \nNew York and the Pentagon in Virginia. The staggering loss of life of \nover 6,000 innocent people, more than in any other day in our Nation's \nhistory; firefighters and police officers crushed under the rubble as \nthey risked their lives to assist victims; shaken sense of security and \nconfidence in our society; and a national anxiety about our future.\n  While we search for understanding, we must do our duty as Americans. \nWe bury our dead. We comfort the wounded. We honor our heroes. And we \nwork to protect and defend our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, in the aftermath of September 11, there are those, who \nin misguided anger and fear turned on their neighbors and fellow \nAmericans. They mistook symbols of religious belief, such as turbans \nand beards, for distrust, terror, and destruction. In a twisted gesture \nof revenge, some vigilantes across America have taken it up on \nthemselves to threaten, harass, and even kill our fellow Americans \nsimply because some share some outward appearance of these terrorists, \nturbans, beards, olive skin.\n  In the past three weeks, the Sikh community has received nearly 300 \nreported incidents of threats, assaults, violence, and even death. Of \ncourse this is wrong and every American must speak out against it. \nSikhism, like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and \nCatholicism, is a religion based on teachings of peace, love, and \nequality. Over 22 million Sikhs around the world today follow there \nvalues everyday. That is why it was so painful to me to learn that Sikh \nAmericans are suffering from injustice targeted at them simply for \ntheir dress and customs.\n  We must embrace the diversity that makes America what it is, a \ndiversity that our enemies cannot understand or accept. We are a land \nof immigrants, and from the beginning of our Nation's history, we have \nalways welcomed people from other nations.\n  Of the thousands who perished that tragic day of September 11, \ncitizens of over 80 countries were included among Americans.\n  Recent terrorist attacks should never cloud our judgment when it \ncomes to our fellow Sikh-Americans. Sikh-Americans share with us the \npain and sorrow of September 11 tragedy. Hate crimes and violence, \nespecially violence stemming from bias and bigotry should never be \ntolerated.\n  That is why today I am submitting a resolution condemning bigotry and \nviolence against Sikh Americans. I am pleased to say that 31 of my \nSenate colleagues have already cosponsored the resolution and we expect \nthat many others will join us in condemning hate crimes against Sikh-\nAmericans. Representatives Honda and Shays have expressed interest in \nintroducing the exact same resolution in the House. Our country stands \nunited with all Americans, including Sikh-Americans.\n  More than ever before, this is a time for us all to stand together. \nWe are, of course, the United States of America. But today, we are a \nUnited America. As we stand together strongly against terrorism, let us \nalso stand together as a country against prejudice and injustice \ntargeted at each other.\n  Our enemies may hate us but we cannot be guided by hate, and we in \nAmerica cannot hate one another. We are brothers and sisters under \nGod's eyes. We are fellow American's under our Nation's flag and with \nthis battle we must stand together, united by love and understanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/02/senate-section/article/S10068-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10068-S10103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1821.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is a fundamental and incontrovertible \n     right under the Constitution.\n       (2) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by reaffirming that the right \n     to vote is a fundamental right under the Constitution.\n       (3) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by reaffirming that the \n     United States is a democratic Government ``of the people, by \n     the people, and for the people'' where every vote counts.\n       (4) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by eliminating procedural, \n     physical, and technological obstacles to voting.\n       (5) There is a need to counter discrimination in voting by \n     removing barriers to the exercise of the constitutionally \n     protected right to vote.\n       (6) There is a concern that persons with disabilities and \n     impairments face difficulties in voting.\n       (7) There are practices designed to purge illegal voters \n     from voter rolls which result in the elimination of legal \n     voters as well.\n       (8) State governments have already begun to examine ways to \n     improve the administration of elections and to modernize \n     mechanisms and machinery for voting.\n       (9) Congress has authority under section 4 of article I of \n     the Constitution of the United States, section 5 of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and \n     section 2 of the 15th amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States to enact legislation to address the equal \n     protection violations that may be caused by outdated voting \n     systems.\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\n       (10) Congress has an obligation to ensure that the \n     necessary resources are available to States and localities to \n     improve election technology and election administration and \n     to ensure the integrity of and full participation of all \n     Americans in the democratic elections process.\n\n         Subtitle A--Commission on Voting Rights and Procedures\n\n     SEC. __11.
