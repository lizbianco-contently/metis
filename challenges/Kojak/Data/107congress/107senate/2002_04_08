The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the energy bill. This will be \nthe 14th day--at least that is my understanding of the time the Senate \nhas spent on this bill.\n  Prior to the Senate recessing for the spring break, the minority and \nmajority staff exchanged a proposed list of amendments in order to the \nenergy bill.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Leader Daschle, I wish to state for the \nrecord that an ongoing effort is being made to secure a finite list of \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the bill and hopefully this effort \nwill be successful today so that we can file this finite list. I \nencourage Members who have indicated they have amendments to come forth \nwith those amendments. We need to finish this bill.\n  Mr. President, I was somewhat disturbed in reading in today's press--\nat least I read it today, it could have been out earlier, for example, \nin one of the Hill publications, Rollcall, I believe that is where I \nread this--that Republican leaders are considering pulling\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nthe plug; that is, not wanting to go forward on the energy bill unless \nit authorizes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  If this is such an important issue, as indicated in this piece in the \nnewspapers, then why hasn't this amendment been offered? As I have \nindicated, this is, as I have said, I believe the 14th day we have \nworked on this legislation. These are 14 legislative days. That is a \nlot of time on a bill. No one has come forward with this amendment we \nhave heard for years is the most important part of this legislation.\n  Perhaps there has been some focus on the fact that there aren't \nenough votes to pass this legislation. There is some realization we \ncannot produce our way out of the problem with petroleum products. Out \nof the 100 percent of the petroleum reserves in the world today, the \nUnited States, including whatever is believed to be in the Arctic, has \n3 percent. Mr. President, 97 percent is in other places, such as \nVenezuela, the North Sea, Great Britain. Two countries have 47 percent \nof the petroleum reserve: Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n  We can't produce our way out of this. I would say, and for the \nPresiding Officer--I think maybe I can speak for him--maybe what we \nshould try to do is try to figure out a way to use our mass of coal. We \nhave more coal than anyplace in the world. Rather than spending the few \ndollars we do on clean coal technology, maybe we should declare a war, \nin effect, and spend a lot of money on clean coal technology because we \nhave lots of coal. But it is polluting and we need to do a better job--\nmake it cleaner.\n  I would also say that we have, in this bill, tried to develop \nalternative energy levels. We have struggled to do that, but we need to \ndo that.\n  Anyway, to think that we can produce our way out of this with \npetroleum products--we can't do it. The United States has 3 percent of \nthe reserves in the world and we can't do it by production. We tried \nthrough increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. We didn't get \nenough votes for that. It is my understanding the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, is going to come back with an amendment that will \nrevisit that issue. Senator Carper certainly understands what his \namendment is better than I do, but I have spoken to him and he feels \nhis amendment is one that will allow this country to go forward, saving \n1 million barrels of oil a day by setting fuel efficiency standards.\n  So I hope they will allow us to go forward in an orderly process with \nthis legislation, to get a finite list of amendments and complete the \nlegislation this week. We had a good debate on ANWR that took place for \na good long day and part of the night. We could dispose of that issue. \nThere are not 60 votes. In fact, I think there would be a real struggle \nfor them to get 50 votes because the ANWR issue will be defeated on a \nbipartisan basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/08/senate-section/article/S2346-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, there is tremendous need in this country to \ndo something with antiterrorism insurance. A group of people just left \nmy office. One man indicated that sitting on his desk is $2.2 billion \nworth of loans that he will not initiate because he cannot obtain \nantiterrorism insurance.\n  Why don't we pass antiterrorism legislation first thing in the \nmorning or tomorrow afternoon? The reason is simple: some would like to \nturn this into a debate about comprehensive tort reform. There can be a \ncase made that perhaps some tort reform is needed. I have always \nbelieved it should be done on a State-by-State basis, but regardless of \nhow I personally feel about tort reform, or anyone else feels about \ntort reform, if this issue is so important, the antiterrorism insurance \nbill should not be turned into a larger debate about comprehensive tort \nreform.\n  We should be able to pass an antiterrorism insurance bill today. \nAddressing this very real problem should be something everyone agrees \nwith. I think we could pass it without even having a vote. People know \nhow important this is. Why do we have to concentrate and try to do \ncomprehensive tort reform on legislation that is not tort reform? If \npeople want tort reform, let them introduce legislation and go through \nthe process. Refer it to the Commerce Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee, but do it in an orderly process and not on something as \nimportant as antiterrorism legislation.\n  I say to all of my friends and to the people who came to my office \ntoday--most of them I never met before--that what they should do is go \nout to talk to those people who want tort reform legislation and delete \nit. We need immediate attention to this issue.\n  I have had the opportunity during the 2 weeks we have been off to \ntalk about some of President Bush's policies. On some I agreed with him \nand on some I disagreed with him. One thing I agree with him on is that \nantiterrorism legislation is important. We need to do it quickly. I \nhope he will weigh in with us and get tort reform out of this.\n  One other area I agree with him on is foreign policy. We need to do \nsomething to get the Middle East crisis resolved. I personally think \nthis administration should have been involved in this much earlier but \nbetter late than never. I agree with him that Chairman Arafat has not \nbeen candid with the President. The President said he has not lived up \nto his word with him. Time and again Chairman Arafat has shown he is \nnot to be trusted. President Clinton offered him the best deal in the \nworld and he walked away from it. He has repeatedly shown that he is \nwilling to say one thing in Arabic and something totally opposite in \nEnglish. I hope that the Palestinians under his leadership would try to \nlive up to the commitments that he has made. This is a situation we \nneed to have resolved. But I do agree with the President of the United \nStates when he said yesterday that Chairman Arafat has not lived up to \nwhat he told the President he was doing. He has not lived up to the \ntrust that the President felt he should have.\n  Not seeing much going on on the floor, I hope there will be some \nactivity on this energy bill. But it appears to me that there is not \ngoing to be any. I say to staff and others who are working on this \nlegislation that I wish they would work to get a finite list of first-\ndegree amendments so we can at least complete that today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I heard my good friend from Nevada make a \nstatement earlier today concerning our delay in getting around to \nproducing an ANWR amendment. Let me assure the Senator, we do have an \nANWR amendment, and we will present it as soon as it is finalized, as \nit is taking some time.\n  I have come to the Senate Chamber right now, though, to make some \nremarks about Iraq. I am certain that everyone in the Senate knows that \nIraq has announced today it will suspend its oil exports for the next \n30 days.\n  Libya and Iran have immediately expressed support for that action and \nwarned they will follow suit if other Arab oil-producing countries also \ncurtailed their shipments of oil. In other words, we are on the verge \nof another embargo.\n  Without any question about it, we have now seen that Iraq is using \noil as a weapon to deal with our policies with regard to the Middle \nEast.\n  During the year 2001, the United States imported nearly 287 million \nbarrels of oil from Iraq.\n  I have in the Chamber a chart that shows where those 287.3 million \nbarrels of oil went throughout our Nation.\n  The average price of crude oil in 2001 was $22.93 per barrel. That \nmeans, with simple arithmetic, the United States paid Iraq $6.58 \nbillion for its oil last year.\n  The Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq confirmed last week that Saddam \nHussein has paid $25,000 to the families of each of the Palestinian \nsuicide bombers. Let's think of that again. Iraq alone has paid to the \nfamilies of the suicide bombers in Palestine $25,000 per incident. In \nother words, we are paying that. We are giving Iraq the cash to reward \nthose who are committing suicide while bombing innocent people in \nIsrael.\n  Furthermore, I want the Senate to know that today Venezuela announced \na multiday strike at the Government-owned oil-producing facilities. \nVenezuela is one of the top three suppliers of oil to the United \nStates.\n  This morning, the President expressed his concern that increased \ngasoline prices would slow down our economic recovery. There is no \nquestion about that.\n  Recently, the U.S. News & World Report has changed its editorial \npolicy concerning ANWR. I want to call the attention of the Senate to \nan article entitled, ``A Waste of Energy?'' on page 25 of the U.S. News \n& World Report of April 1. It is a very interesting article when one \nconsiders the past editorial policy of that great national magazine.\n  Make no mistake about it, we are very close to a vote that would be \nquite similar to the one that took place when Alaska finally obtained \npermission to go ahead with the oil pipeline. At that time, however--\nand I say this respectfully--even though the then-majority leader, Mike \nMansfield, opposed our amendment, even though the committee chairman, \nSenator Jackson, opposed our amendment, no filibuster was threatened, \nno filibuster took place in consideration of the oil pipeline \namendment. Why? Because we all knew then, as we all should know now, \nthat oil is a matter of national security.\n  As we proceed this week, we will bring out proof of the statesmen who \nhave led this country since the 1940s. Each and every one has said oil \nis a matter of national security. Yet we are facing the prospect that \nthe ANWR amendment, when we offer it, is going to be facing a \nfilibuster--again, with due respect --led by the majority leader and \nthe majority side of the Senate.\n  There should never be--there should never be--a filibuster against a \nmatter of national security. I really believe that before we are \nthrough, before this week is out, the American citizens are going to be \ndemanding there be an up-or-down vote on the ANWR amendment and no \nfilibuster. And if, God forbid, by Thursday or Friday of this week we \nhave a full-blown embargo, and we have the gas lines we all remember \nfrom the 1970s, I do hope we will understand this bill has to be \nconsidered, the ANWR amendment adopted, and the bill sent to the \nPresident as soon as possible.\n  If we had been permitted to proceed with ANWR as we sought to proceed \nwhen President George Bush, the 41st President of the United States, \nrequested Congress to allow us to proceed, we would have ANWR oil on \nline now.\n  During the height of the Persian Gulf war, 2.1 million barrels of oil \na day were sent down the Alaska oil pipeline. When I was there last \nweek, I was told it was 925,000 barrels a day. Where are we getting the \nbalance of the oil? We are currently getting it from Iraq. And now it \nis going to be shut down.\n  I have asked the oil industry to tell us whether it is possible that \nthey might proceed to produce in an uneconomic manner to refill that \nbarrel, if this shortage continues. There is oil in northern Alaska now \nthat could fill that barrel, but it would be uneconomic to produce it \nat the rates that would be required because the reserves are not that \ngreat anymore without our opportunity to drill in the area known as \nANWR, which is part of the 1.5-million acre tract that was set aside in \n1980 by an amendment sponsored by Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas \nfor oil and gas exploration. I will be going into that at length this \nweek, too.\n  They promised me and committed to me that one of the things they \nwould go along with, if we would finally approve the so-called ANILCA, \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, was that 1.5 \nmillion acres in the Arctic would be left available for oil and gas \nexploration. I will produce the letters that were exchanged by those \ntwo Senators with all of the Senate, and the comments they made at the \ntime. I will even show you a photograph of Senator Jackson, Senator \nTsongas, and I standing there at the passage of the bill in which the \npromise was made that oil and gas exploration\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\ncould be continued in that 1.5 million acres we all knew was part of \nthe Arctic that has enormous promise for production of oil and gas.\n  The main reason for speaking now is to say to the Senate, the time is \nright. There is no longer any time for partisan debate on this issue. \nThis is a matter of national security. Before the week is out, we are \nagain going to see gas lines in this country. I cannot emphasize too \ngreatly my feeling about the delay that has taken place now since 1980.\n  In 1980, Senators Jackson and Tsongas committed to help us get that \noil exploration going to determine if oil and gas could be produced in \nsubstantial quantities from that Arctic coast area. That promise has \nnot been kept because of the opposition that has come from the radical \nportion of the environmental lobbying group in this city. It is time to \nput radical environmentalists behind us and realize this country is \nunited in trying to fight this war against global terrorism.\n  I am also going to bring in a nice big poster. Do you know who is on \nthat poster? General Dwight D. Eisenhower. He is saying to the oil and \ngas workers in World War II: Stay on the job because we need oil. \nWithout oil, our military cannot function.\n  That same thing is true now. The military is consuming vast \nquantities of oil, and we have to have oil to fight this war.\n  I hope the Senate is willing to listen to me for a long time this \nweek because as this situation gets worse, I will remind the Senate \nagain and again and again. The ANWR issue should have been closed out \nin 1981. Now, 21 years later, at the time the crisis we all feared has \ncome, we still are facing a filibuster against approval of what the \nSenate and the President of the United States agreed to when that bill \nwas passed in 1980.\n  I thank my friends for allowing me to speak at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/08/senate-section/article/S2348-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2348-S2349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3210\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is now a \nunanimous consent request pending; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from Oklahoma has reserved \nthe right to object. Let me for a couple minutes speak to several \nissues before he determines whether or not he is going to object to \nthis request.\n  In the wake of September 11, a number of insurance companies are \ndeclining to provide coverage from losses which result from terrorist \nattack. At 2:30 today, I had a meeting in my office with a large number \nof real estate people in desperate need to have their projects go \nforward. They are not able to obtain antiterrorism insurance.\n  I know it is a serious problem. We continue to hear from the General \nAccounting Office and others that those insurance policies that are \navailable are priced so high that they are really not affordable, even \nthough they may be available. It is unfortunate that last year before \nadjournment we heard objections to our unanimous consent request to \ntake up H.R. 3210, the House terrorism bill, and amend it with a \nsubstitute offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and \nothers. We believed that our effort to move forward was in good faith \nand addressed a present need. We found that some of our colleagues \ninsisted on the consideration of amendments that made it difficult to \ncomplete the work on this issue, and it was not completed.\n  Today, we are again seeking unanimous consent on Senator Dodd's \nproposal which provides the safety net needed to keep insuring against \nterrorist risks. In turn, that coverage would allow builders to keep \nbuilding, businesses to keep growing, and hopefully prevent further \neconomic setbacks.\n  This amendment was a product of extensive bipartisan negotiations. It \nwas developed with extensive consultation with a number of Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans, including Senator Gramm of Texas, as well as \nthe White House and the Treasury Department. While we were unable to \nreach agreement on every point, the proposal incorporated, line-by-\nline, suggestions by our colleagues from both sides of the aisle and \nthis administration. It represented a compromise.\n  It requires substantial payments by insurance companies before the \nFederal Government provides a backstop. The proposal would require the \ninsurance industry to retain the responsibility to pay up to $10 \nbillion in losses in the first year, and up to $15 billion in losses in \nthe second year, or around 7 to 10 percent of the annual premiums for \neach affected company.\n  This legislation would ensure stability in the insurance market so \nthat businesses can afford to purchase insurance.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, this is imperfect, but we cannot \nlet the perfect stand in the way of the good. We need to move forward.\n  What others are trying to do is too much. It is just not going to \nhappen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Still reserving the right to object, I ask my friend and \ncolleague, if I understand his request, it is to take up the House-\npassed bill and the substitute and pass without further amendment the \nDodd-Sarbanes-Schumer substitute; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. He is saying let's take up the House-passed bill. The \nrequest I was going to make, and I ask my colleague if he would agree \nwith this, is let's take the House-passed bill and let's have an \namendment on each side, one amendment, an amendment, whichever--maybe \nit is the Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer amendment. I believe the amendment I \nwas hoping our side would offer would be the Dodd-Gramm amendment.\n\n  I ask my colleague, would he modify his request to allow one \namendment offered to the House substitute, one proposed by the majority \nleader, and one proposed by the minority leader, and make that small \nmodification?\n  Mr. REID. The problem, I say to my friend through the Chair, is that \nwe have other Senators, committee chairs, for example, who believe they \nhave to have a few amendments of their own. They believe, as I have \nheard my friend from Oklahoma speak on a number of occasions, that \ncommittees need to be heard more. My whole point in offering this \nunanimous consent request is that this may be imperfect, but it is \nreally a big bound forward. If we try to say we will have one amendment \non your side and one on our side, then we have to go through this \nsomewhat never-ending process of saying: What is the amendment going to \nbe on this side? What is the amendment going to be on your side? Are we \ngoing to have time agreements on the amendments?\n  I just think we would be so much better off looking at what was \nnegotiated. We came within hours of finalizing this before we recessed \nlast year.\n  I say to my friend, I appreciate very much his good-faith effort. \nThat is something that is worth pursuing. But it is going to be so \ndifficult, and by pursuing that, people who want to obtain loans--one \nman in my office today had over $2 billion worth of projects on his \ndesk they wanted to go forward on. He can't because he can't get \ninsurance. I shouldn't say he can't get it, but he can't afford it.\n  So I hope we can have this consent that I suggest be agreed to. If we \ncan't, I think it is too bad. We will be happy to go back and look at \nthe amendment process. We should not do that. We should move on with \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object to the Senator's request.\n  I ask unanimous consent--this is going to be a very slight \nmodification--that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nCalendar No. 252, at the majority leader's call, at his time of \nchoosing; that we can consider Calendar No. 252, H.R. 3210, the \nTerrorism Risk Protection Act, and that two amendments be in order, one \nby the majority leader and one by the minority leader; that time \nagreements be entered into; that the Senate consider both amendments, \nand then the remainder of the Senator's request--that after the \namendments are dealt with, the bill be read the third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements thereon appear in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend that in a \nshort\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\ntime I will object because I think we really need to move forward with \nsomething as quickly as possible. At some subsequent time--I think time \nis so critical in this--we will reoffer our unanimous consent request.\n  I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do, but one of the things \nthat might be considered is--and I have no authority for this \nwhatsoever--I believe we should move forward on my consent at this \ntime, but maybe if we cannot work something out--which I think would be \na shame--I would be happy to talk with the Senator to see if there is \nsomething we can do. We might want to start out with agreeing that the \nvehicle we would be amending would be the Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer \nsubstitute amendment and offer two amendments to that, rather than to \nthe House bill.\n  Anyway, at this time I object for the reasons previously stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nevada. I \nhope we can work this out. I am happy to meet with him. I think our \nobjectives are similar. We would like to pass the legislation dealing \nwith terrorism risk protection. We realize there is a serious problem. \nJust to say we are going to take the House-passed language and pass an \namendment that Senators Dodd, Sarbanes, and Schumer have agreed to \nleaves out Senator Gramm, who also came up with the agreement that I \nbelieve Senators Dodd and Sarbanes had agreed to earlier.\n  I hope we can come up with something. You pick the underlying bill, \nand maybe the underlying bill would be the Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer \nproposal, but give us an amendment and let's vote. We can come up with \nfairly short time constraints--at least on this side; hopefully, we can \non both sides--and we can pass something and get to conference. The \nHouse-passed bill is significantly different, as my colleague knows. We \nhave to work out the differences with the House. I think this is \nimportant legislation and it needs to pass, as the Senator from Nevada \nmentioned. It needs to pass quickly. Hopefully, bipartisan leadership \nin the Senate can orchestrate a procedure where we can get this done in \nthe very near future.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/08/senate-section/article/S2349-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2349-S2350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A THREAT BY SADDAM HUSSEIN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Stevens \nfrom Alaska, for his statement dealing with the threat--and maybe the \nthreat implemented today--by Saddam Hussein of Iraq, saying he is going \nto have an oil embargo against the United States.\n  I think Senator Stevens mentioned we imported 263 million barrels of \noil from Iraq last year--maybe 273 million barrels. Right now, it is \nover a million barrels per day. That is a significant amount. I heard \ncommentators say today that we don't import that much. I don't know \nwhose figures they are looking at, but a million barrels per day is a \nlot. Selectively, right now, we are importing 60 percent of our \nNation's oil needs.\n  You need to compare that to the shortages we had in 1973 and 1979. In \n1973, I believe we were importing about 34 percent. In 1979, it was \nabout 44 percent. And we had embargoes because of conflicts in the \nMiddle East. As a result, we had significant curtailments in the United \nStates. They embargoed exports coming from the Middle East. We had \nshortages in the United States, and we had gas lines.\n  I don't quite agree with Senator Stevens that we are going to have \ngas lines this week, but if the embargo were expanded and lasted for a \nsignificant period of time, we could have significant shortages. I \nthink you will see price escalation. How significant it will be depends \non how many other countries get involved. He mentioned there might be \nstrikes in Venezuela. That will compound the problem. If you take away \na couple million barrels of oil, you are going to see prices go way up, \nand you may see shortages in the not-too-distant future. Gasoline \nprices will be going up in the summertime. You can see demand going up \nand you can see shortages.\n  So I think the Senator from Alaska is very timely in saying we need \nto do what we can to help make sure that Saddam Hussein doesn't have \ntoo big of a grip on the U.S. economy. One of the things we definitely \ncan do is increase exploration and production in Alaska. Senator \nStevens mentioned that in Prudhoe Bay, which used to produce about 2 \nmillion barrels per day, now is producing less than a million. We need \nto supplement that. When it was 2 million barrels per day, it was 25 \npercent of our domestic production. Now it is less than an eighth. We \nneed to really have that increase, and we can do that in an \nenvironmentally safe and sound manner by production in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. We are going to have a vote on that this \nweek.\n  I also agree 100 percent with Senator Stevens when he said that while \ntalking about national security, people should not filibuster. Let's \nfind out where the votes are. Are we going to vote to increase domestic \nproduction or are we going to allow Saddam Hussein to be able to \nsuffocate the world economy, and certainly the economy of the United \nStates? Are we going to give him that kind of leverage and power or \nwill we do what we can to minimize it?\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a fresh look at ANWR--at this 2,000 \nacres from which we are talking about producing. It is an area similar \nin land size to the State of South Carolina. That is a 2,000-acre \nfootprint, similar to the size of Dulles Airport or the Oklahoma City \nAirport; it is not that large of an area. If you haven't visited the \ncoastal region of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it is not the \nprettiest area, and work can be done in a way that will protect and \npreserve the native wildlife species, including the caribou. If you \nhave been to Prudhoe Bay, you found that the caribou love the Alaska \npipeline; you saw a lot of caribou hanging around the pipeline. So \ncertainly it can be done in a way to protect the wildlife and the \nenvironment, and it will also help alleviate some of the energy \nshortages we may experience in the not-too-distant future. We are very \nvulnerable. We are importing 60 percent of our oil needs today. We need \nto reduce that or it will be 70 percent in another 10 years.\n  We need to open exploration in ANWR. I hope my colleagues will not \nfilibuster. I hope my colleagues will say: Let's debate it and let's \nvote on it. This is a national security issue. We cannot have national \nsecurity without having energy security, and we do not have energy \nsecurity today.\n  My compliments to the administration for giving us a national energy \nplan for the first time in decades. They presented an energy plan, the \nHouse has passed one, and the Senate has not been able to do one. We \ndid not even have a markup on this bill in the Senate Energy Committee.\n  I have been on that committee for 22 years. I did not get to offer \none amendment to this bill. This is the bill. It is 590 pages. It did \nnot have ANWR in it. Why? Because we were not able to offer an ANWR \namendment because we were told not to mark it up.\n  This bill came from Senator Daschle and Senator Bingaman, and they \nlaid it on our desks. It changed substantially from the previous bill. \nANWR was not in it. We had the votes in committee, quite frankly, to \nput ANWR in the bill. People would try to take ANWR out, but I do not \nthink they have the votes to take it out. I believe that is the reason \nSenator Daschle told Senator Bingaman not to mark up a bill.\n  We now have to try to put an ANWR amendment in the bill, and some of \nmy colleagues say: We have to filibuster. I think they are wrong to do \nthat. Senator Stevens is right, we need national security and we cannot \nhave national security unless we have energy security. In light of the \nfact Saddam Hussein is now talking about and may be implementing an oil \nembargo against the United States, I urge my colleagues to do what we \ncan to protect our national security with energy security, and that \nincludes exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will address the issue of defense \nexpenditures and the rapidly rising appropriations for defense, \nparticularly for the war on terrorism, and do it in light of the fact \nthat probably within the next couple of weeks the budget will be before \nthe Senate.\n  The 9-11 attack wiped out any lingering doubts I or anybody else had \nabout the intention of terrorists. Their intentions are now crystal \nclear: Kill as many Americans as possible and bring a lot of \npsychological trauma on the American people. I do not doubt for a \nsecond they will strike again when they think the time is right. If \nthey do not, we will be lucky, but if we do not plan on it, we will be \nstupid.\n  We must not allow American citizens to live with constant fear that \nmoment will come again. This is a threat to our way of life. As \nAmericans, we cannot accept that threat to our way of life. The \nterrorist threat must be eliminated.\n  President Bush is doing everything possible to restore and maintain \nour security at home and to win the war on terrorism abroad. The war on \nterrorism will not come cheaply. We must all accept that. Right now we \nhave no choice. So I am not going to quibble with the details of the \nDepartment of Defense budget and the recommendations from the Senate \nBudget Committee. Secretary Rumsfeld and the President have my support \nin the war against terror.\n  We ought to look at history and think in terms of other times the \ndefense budget has been ramped up very quickly and the considerable \namount of waste that accompanied it. The situation of the 1980s, when \nthis last happened, obviously, was somewhat different from what the \nsituation is today when we are in the midst of a war. Back then, we \nwere in the cold war. There was some understanding we needed to do \nmore, but in the process of not fighting a war and not having a \ndemonstrated need that was as conclusive as this war on terrorism is \nnow, there was an opportunity for waste.\n  I want to warn Secretary Rumsfeld about waste. Big budgets breed \nwaste, and the Pentagon has shown a world class reputation for waste \nand mismanagement. It seems to be lurking in the shadows waiting for \nthe Secretary of Defense to open the money spigot. If he fails to keep \na lid on waste, support for President Bush's defense buildup will \nevaporate quickly, particularly if there is a downturn in the war on \nterrorism where there is not quite as evident to the public at large of \nthe need for the amount of money we are now appropriating when one \nmight say the war is very active.\n  If this were to happen, the support for the defense buildup would \nevaporate and troops in the field would end up on the short end of the \nstick. If we do have this waste, this Senator will be on the \nSecretary's back.\n  A little piece of local history might help everyone in the Senate \nunderstand where I am coming from. Back in the early 1980s, at the \nheight of the cold war, President Reagan launched a massive military \nbuildup that was fiercely debated in the Senate for 3 or 4 years. I \nchallenge my colleagues to understand this was a defining experience \nfor me and it still shapes my thinking on defense. I was convinced \nalmost from day 1 that President Reagan's defense Secretary, Cap \nWeinberger, was bent on throwing new sums of money at problems better \nsolved by structural reform and real leadership. So joining a lot of my \ncolleagues, we made an effort to stop it probably 2 or 3 years after we \nshould have. As a conservative Republican, this was not easy for me to \ndo but it was the right thing to do, and we should be prepared to watch \nhow this money is spent in this ramp-up and be cognizant, watching for \nwaste.\n\n  During this time in the early 1980s, I offered an amendment to freeze \nthe defense budget. This was in the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution. \nMy amendment was adopted May 2, 1985, by the slimmest of margins: 50 to \n49. I think the Senate, by making that decision and through that act \nalone, threw a monkey wrench into the last big plan to ramp up the \ndefense budget.\n  There was quite a case built for doing that at that particular time. \nEven though $750 pliers, $750 toilet seats, and $7,000 coffee pots are \nnot the reason for defense waste in its entirety, they are clear-cut \nexamples that everybody understands.\n  Those examples helped make a case for the freezing of the defense \nbudget. The spare parts horror stories were a turning point. They \nconvinced many that the Pentagon defense buildup was a colossal \ntaxpayer rip-off. It undermined the credibility of the planned defense \nbuildup and it turned many into defense reformers, to watchdogging, \ndigging into the waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon.\n  I was at it that day, today, and I will be at it tomorrow. That is my \nwarning to the people at the Defense Department, from Secretary \nRumsfeld on down, and, in the process of spending more money, find a \nway to control waste.\n  Unfortunately, the Secretary has a major obstacle to overcome before \ngetting waste under control. It is a simple rule that you cannot begin \nto control waste until you know what things cost. You will never get a \nhandle on the cost until the books of account are in order. Every shred \nof evidence I have examined over the years tells me that the books at \nthe Defense Department are in shambles. The chief financial officer, \nMr. Zakheim, knows exactly what I am talking about. I have had \nopportunities to discuss this with him.\n  The best barometer on the quality of bookkeeping at the Pentagon is \nthe annual audit of financial statements. The results are dismal. There \nis over $150 billion in financial actions for which there is no \nsupporting documentation. Those are accumulative, over some years.\n  Criminals, quite frankly, could be tapping into the money pipeline at \nthe Department of Defense. People there would never know it. During \nSecretary Rumsfeld's nomination hearing last year, he was grilled by \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia about the very same problem. As a \nresult of that exchange, Senator Byrd and I cosponsored a financial \noversight initiative, section 1009 of the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n  Having accurate financial information at your fingertips is a key to \ncontrolling waste. And to do it right now, we don't have that tool. The \nDefense Department needs to get it. I believe they are working on \ngetting it. I believe I can speak for Senator Byrd and for myself that \nwe want to help the Defense Department get there. The Secretary has his \nwork cut out. For starters, he is going to need a junkyard dog. Now \nthat there is an inspector general in place, I believe that will help. \nWith the Pentagon's money spigot wide open--once again in a way that \nnobody at this point is going to raise any questions because you only \ngo to war to win a war or else you do not have any business going to \nwar--the new inspector general has to be operating on a high state of \nalert.\n  A 3-year oversight investigation of the office of the inspector \ngeneral tells me that is not the case today. That office has serious \nmanagement problems. The new inspector general will need to clean \nhouse. We are obviously asking the Secretary to control waste, do it by \ncleaning up the books, get a handle on costs, and do not fritter away a \ngolden opportunity to rebuild the Armed Forces.\n  Waste is a constant danger at the Pentagon. When we send military \npersonnel into harm's way, we should all be confident they have what \nthey need to get the job done. If we allow waste to spin out of \ncontrol, our troops on the front lines will be the first to suffer; we \nwill be back making the same cases as we did in the mid-1980s.\n  I believe there is some reason to think this Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Rumsfeld, sees a need to overcome these problems more so than a lot \nof his predecessors. There are two reasons I say that. No. 1, 2 or 3 \nweeks ago I was\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nable to speak to a House committee on the sloppiness of how credit \ncards are handled by Department of Defense personnel and the tremendous \nwaste of taxpayer money by the purchase of personal items on a card \nthat says ``for official government business only.'' Within 2 days of \nthose remarks, the Secretary of Defense told the comptroller of the \nDefense Department to get this matter under control. There has been put \nin place immediately a task force to accomplish that goal. I publicly \nthank Secretary Rumsfeld for responding as he has in that particular \ninstance.\n  Last, I refer to a speech that Secretary Rumsfeld gave on September \n10, 1 day before the infamous day of September 11. It seems to me, \nwithout anticipating the terror that was going to be brought against \nAmerica with that dastardly act of September 11, he recognized in this \nspeech the importance of being on top of the taxpayers' dollars as \nspent on defense.\n  I read from his speech delivered on September 10:\n\n       Every dollar squandered on waste is one denied to the \n     warfighters. That's why we're here today challenging us all \n     to wage an all-out campaign to shift Pentagon resources from \n     bureaucracy to the battle field, from tail to tooth.\n       We know the adversary. We know the threat. And with the \n     same firmness of purpose that any effort against a determined \n     adversary demands, we must get at it and stay at it.\n       Some might ask, how in the world could the Secretary of \n     Defense attack the Pentagon in front of its people? To them I \n     reply, I have no desire to attack the Pentagon; I want to \n     liberate it. We need to save it from itself.\n       The men and women in this department, civilian and \n     military, are our allies, not our enemies. They, too, are fed \n     up with bureaucracy. They, too, live with frustrations. I \n     hear it every day. And I'll bet a dollar to a dime they, too, \n     want to fix it. In fact, I bet that they even know how to fix \n     it, and if asked, will get about the task of fixing it. And \n     I'm asking.\n\n  I say parenthetically, I think what the Secretary of Defense did 2 \nweeks ago, in getting the comptroller on that credit card situation in \nthe Department of Defense, is an example of his willingness to ask and \nhopefully get it done.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       They know the taxpayers deserve better. Every dollar we \n     spend was entrusted to us by a taxpayer who earned it by \n     creating something of value with sweat and skill--a cashier \n     in Chicago, a waitress in San Francisco. An average American \n     family works an entire year to generate $6,000 in income \n     taxes. Here we spill many times that amount every hour by \n     duplication and inattention.\n\n  Then in the last paragraph I am going to quote he says:\n\n       That's wrong. It's wrong because national defense depends \n     upon public trust, and trust, in turn, hinges on respect for \n     the hardworking people of America and the tax dollars they \n     earn. We need to protect them and their efforts.\n\n  There is a lot more from this speech that Secretary Rumsfeld gave \nback on September 10 to employees of the Defense Department. But these \nfew paragraphs, I hope, will give you hope, as they give me hope, that \nSecretary Rumsfeld will get on top of the situation at the Defense \nDepartment, an environment that encourages waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney, and will see through the process of financial management reform \nand all that will do for controlling the waste.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed, \nonce again, to the energy bill and the Feinstein amendment, and the \nReid second-degree amendment be pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3079\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I commend the senior Senator from California \nfor her amendment and her work on this very difficult issue of \nderivatives regulation.\n  To critics of the amendment, I suggest you put yourselves in Senator \nFeinstein's shoes. She represents the largest State in the United \nStates, whose gross domestic product is larger than most countries of \nthe world. In fact, I understand that it has about the seventh largest \ngross domestic product of any entity in the world.\n  Last year's energy crisis threatened California's prosperity and \nbrought home to all of us that we are in unchartered territory with \nenergy deregulation. We felt the same problems in Nevada.\n  The collapse of Enron, a supposed leader in energy trading and \nmarkets, makes me wonder: How can we have a company such as Enron in \nthis country, a publicly owned company, that changes in 1 year from a \nhigh flying, worldwide megacompany to a bankrupt loser with hundreds, \nif not thousands, of ruined lives in its wake? We have many \ncongressional committees and prosecutors looking for the answers to \nthat question, and many other questions.\n\n  We owe Senator Feinstein a debt of gratitude for her interest in this \nissue and her work in proposing changes to the Commodity Exchange Act \nthat will ensure that trading in energy derivatives is done in the \nopen, with transparency, in a way that inspires public confidence in \nthe markets.\n  My amendment is necessary to restore metals derivatives trading to \nexempt commodity status. Senator Feinstein's amendment inadvertently \nincluded metals derivatives with the energy derivatives that are the \nintended target of her amendment. Like other derivatives, metals \nderivatives markets help companies manage the risk of sudden and large \nprice changes.\n  In recent years, derivatives and other so-called hedging transactions \nhave helped the mining companies in my State cope with a steadily \ndeclining gold price by selling mining production forward. The last \ncouple of years illustrate the function and the value in the \nmarketplace of these transactions.\n  Some companies decided not to hedge, betting that the gold price \nwould rise and that hedging contracts would lock them into below-market \nprices. Most of those companies are no longer around because the gold \nprice stayed relatively low.\n  In contrast, other companies hedged some or most of their production. \nThese companies have survived, and survived well, and some have even \nthrived. By choosing to manage their risk, they accepted the risk that \nthe gold price could rise, but they stabilized company performance, \ncontinued to provide jobs, and continued to contribute to the \ncommunities in Nevada where they are so important.\n  Unlike energy derivatives, which raise questions because of the \nrecent energy crisis, metals derivatives have been traded over the \ncounter for many years. The 2000 amendments to the Commodity Exchange \nAct did not change this; they only clarified and confirmed the legality \nof these markets. Lumping metals derivatives together with energy \nderivatives would impose regulatory burdens that have never existed, \neven before the 2000 amendments, without any justification.\n  The amendment I have offered would not allow metals derivatives \nmarkets and participants to trade derivatives without accountability \nand transparency.\n  The Commodity Exchange Act already requires adequate recordkeeping \nfor these otherwise ``exempt'' transactions. This amendment adds \nadditional recordkeeping requirements for exempt commodities that are \ncomparable to those already in the Feinstein amendment for energy \ncommodities.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now on \nthe Feinstein amendment and the second-degree amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3079, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw my second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3081 to Amendment No. 2989\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on my \nbehalf, and we will wait until tomorrow to affix the name of Senator \nCrapo to this amendment. I believe he wants to cosponsor it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3081 to amendment No. 2989.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have given a statement in relation to the \namendment just withdrawn. This basically is the same but does not \ninclude some redundant requirements for recordkeeping. I simply state \nthat I think the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is trying to \ndo the right thing. But unless we adopt this amendment, the second \nlargest industry in Nevada--mining--will be hurt very badly. Senator \nFeinstein's amendment would inadvertently harm mining companies in my \nstate and throughout the United States.\n  The metal derivatives market has been going on for many years. \nLumping metal derivatives with energy derivatives would impose \nregulatory burdens that have never existed, even before the 2000 \namendments to the Commodity Exchange Act, without any justification. \nUnlike energy derivatives, which raise questions because of the recent \nenergy crisis, metal derivatives have been traded over the counter for \nyears and years with no problem. My amendment is necessary to restore \nmetals derivatives trading to ``exempt'' status, which is critical to \nthe health of the mining industry.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have a member of my staff who as a \nGirl Scout loved Girl Scout cookies so much she went into debt selling \nherself cookies. She said she had every variety of cookie in her \npossession, for her own consumption, hidden from her little brother and \nthe family dog. Her parents had to give her a low-interest loan so she \ncould pay off her obligation.\n  I don't recommend her financial habits, but I definitely recommend \nGirl Scout cookies, and most of all, for girls to become Girl Scouts.\n  The organization just celebrated its 90th anniversary, and it shows \nno signs of going out of style. There are 3.7 million Girl Scouts \nnationwide--2.7 million girl members and 915,000 adult members. My \nstate of Iowa has 53,000 members.\n  I see why scouting has such broad appeal. The Girl Scouts offer \ncommunity service, field trips, camping, science awareness, sporting \nand fitness development, health education and many more activities to \ngirls ages 5 to 17. These programs teach girls not only about the world \naround them, but also about themselves. They learn leadership skills, \nself-confidence, respect for others, companionship and responsibility. \nThey also learn egalitarianism. Girl Scouting is open to all girls of \nthe eligible age. A girl just has to have the will to participate and \nenjoy. Given the competitiveness of so many extracurricular activities \nfor kids, it's refreshing to have an outlet for girls to interact as \nequals.\n  Girl Scouting also engages family members and adults in their \ncommunities. Almost all adults involved with Girl Scouting are \nvolunteers, and the organization sponsors activities for mothers to \nspend special time with their daughters away from the distractions of \neveryday life.\n  I congratulate the Girl Scouts on 90 years of success. Like all \nclassics, the Girl Scout Promise and the Girl Scout Law remain as fresh \nand relevant today as ever. Here they are, for the Congressional \nRecord, for posterity, for the girls of today, and for the women of \ntomorrow.\n  The Girl Scout Promise: On my honor, I will try: to serve God and my \ncountry; to help people at all times; and to live by the Girl Scout \nLaw.\n  The Girl Scout Law: I will do my best to be honest and fair, friendly \nand helpful, considerate and caring, courageous and strong, and \nresponsible for what I say and do, and to respect myself and others, \nrespect authority, use resources wisely, make the world a better place, \nand be a sister to every Girl Scout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/08/senate-section/article/S2352-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         HONORING MURRAY STATE UNIVERSITY MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the Murray \nState University men's Basketball team for their success on the court \nthis season.\n  The Racers, led by Coach Tevester Anderson and leading scorer Justin \nBurdine, overcame injuries and illness, playing their last 15 games \nwith just nine players in uniform, to finish the season at 19-13 and \nearn a trip to the NCAA tournament. After getting off to a fast start, \nthe Racers experienced a severe setback, losing eight of ten games at \none point to drop to 9-11, after beginning the season an impressive 7-\n3. Entering the Ohio Valley Conference tournament, the Racers looked as \nif they had no shot to beat the heavily-favored Golden Eagles of \nTennessee Tech. However, the Racers decided to forget about the \nrankings and experts and simply play the game with pure heart and \ndetermination. They knocked off Morehead State to advance to the OVC \nchampionship game, where they beat Tennessee Tech on a miraculous last-\nsecond shot by team leader Justin Burdine. The Racers entered the NCAA \ntournament extremely hot, having won 10 of their last 11 games. \nUnfortunately, the Racers were unable to feed off their momentum late \nin the season against the University of Georgia, losing to the Bulldogs \nin the first round of the tournament.\n  Overall, the Murray State Racers had a very successful and productive \nseason. They overcame numerous hurdles to win the OVC championship and \nearn their 11th invitation to the NCAA tournament. They worked as a \nteam all year to prove their critics wrong, and showed that they have \nthe hearts of champions. I applaud Coach Anderson and his players for \nall that they accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/08/senate-section/article/S2352-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2352-S2353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING MR.

A native of \nHuntington, he received his undergraduate degree from Concord College \nin Athens, WV, and attended graduate school at Xavier University in \nCincinnati, OH.\n  Mr. Sanford's public service career has been filled with remarkable \nachievements. Previous to his most recent appointment, he was the Chief \nof the Civil Works Policy Division, Headquarters, United States Army \nCorps of Engineers. In 1992, he served as a Water Resources Advisor, \nthrough a Congressional fellowship, to the distinguished Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan from New York, then Chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  Mr. Sanford has been the recipient of several public service awards. \nHe has been honored by the United States Department of the Army for his \nsignificant contributions to national policy issues related to water \nresources and military infrastructure.\n  Through the years, many Members of Congress have relief on Mr. \nSanford's insight and advice. He is trusted and respected throughout \nWashington and the Federal Government. Additionally, he has mentored \nmany young people within the Corps of Engineers, encouraging them to \nserve their Nation to the best of their ability.\n  David Sanford, Jr., has dedicated nearly 34 years to the United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, serving with honor and distinction. The \nCorps' public engineering services are renowned as world class. David, \nas a career member of the Corps elite force, has exhibited the kind of \ncharacter and leadership that has been associated with the Corps.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2074. A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2002, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am tremendously pleased to introduce legislation \nthat will authorize a cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, to veterans' \ncompensation for next year.\n  Every year, Congress fulfills its obligation to provide a cost-of-\nliving adjustment to veterans disability benefits. While we can never \ntruly repay the debt that we owe to these individuals for their \nsacrifices to our country, what we can do is ensure that the benefits \nwe provide for the men and women who are disabled while serving in \nplaces such as Afghanistan retain their value and are not eroded by \ninflation.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2002 \ncontinues this tradition of fulfilling our obligation to America's \nveterans by directing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as \nof December 1, 2002, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, as \nwell as compensation for eligible dependents and surviving spouses. \nThis increase would be the same percentage as the increase Social \nSecurity Act beneficiaries will receive.\n  The COLA is enormously important to veterans and their families. It \nis critical that veterans' disability compensation rates keep pace with \nthe increasing cost of living. Without it, many disabled veterans might \nnot be able to afford the simple necessities of life--warm clothes, \nfood, and shelter. I, therefore, encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this very important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Rate Adjustment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, effective on December 1, 2002, increase the dollar \n     amounts in effect for the payment of disability compensation \n     and dependency and indemnity compensation by the Secretary, \n     as specified in subsection (b).\n       (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) Compensation.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts in effect under sections 1115(1) of such \n     title.\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n       (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount in effect under \n     section 1162 of such title.\n       (4) New dic rates.--The dollar amounts in effect under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1311(a) of such title.\n       (5) Old dic rates.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1311(a)(3) of such title.\n       (6) Additional dic for surviving spouses with minor \n     children.--The dollar amount in effect under section 1311(b) \n     of such title.\n       (7) Additional dic for disability.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1311(c) and 1311(d) of such title.\n       (8) DIC for dependent children.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of such title.\n       (c) Determination of Increase.--(1) The increase under \n     subsection (a) shall be made in the dollar amounts specified \n     in subsection (b) as in effect on November 30, 2000.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), each such amount \n     shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage \n     by which benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective \n     December 1, 2002, as a result of a determination under \n     section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).\n       (3) Each dollar amount increased pursuant to paragraph (2) \n     shall, if not a whole dollar amount, be rounded down to the \n     next lower whole dollar amount.\n       (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation payable \n     to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public Law 85-\n     857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of compensation \n     payable pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n\n     SEC. 3.
