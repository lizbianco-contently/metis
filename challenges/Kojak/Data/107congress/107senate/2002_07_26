On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 0. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this morning we moved closer to the \nconfirmation of Judge Julia Smith Gibbons of Tennessee to the 6th \nCircuit Court of Appeals. In so doing, we will bring relief to a \nCircuit with a 50 percent vacancy rate, with 9 empty seats out of 18, \ndespite the fact that the President nominated 6 fine public servants to \nfill those seats on May 9, 2001, well over 400 days ago. I look forward \nto confirming her finally.\n  I rise this morning to express my most profound concern for the \ncourse of judicial confirmations in general and my support for the \nconfirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen of Texas. The Judiciary \nCommittee gave Justice Owen a 5-hour hearing earlier this week, which I \nam afraid did not do credit to the Committee.\n  I will comment on Justice Owens' qualifications, and to address some \nof the deceptions, distortions and demagoguery orchestrated against her \nnomination, that we have all read in the national and local papers.\n  I would like first to comment on the two jingos that are being used \nabout her record as if they had substance: namely, that Justice Owen is \n``conservative'' and that she is ``out of the mainstream.'' Of course, \nthis comes from the Washington interest groups, in many cases, who \nthink that mainstream thought is more likely found in Paris, France, \nthan Paris, Texas.\n  I must admit that it's curious to hear it argued that a nominee twice \nelected by the people of the most populous State in the Circuit for \nwhich she is now nominated is ``out of the mainstream.'' Texans are no \ndoubt entertained to hear that.\n  Listening to some of my colleagues' commentary on judges, I sometimes \nthink that main-stream for them is a northeastern river of thought that \ntravels through New Hampshire early and often, widens in Massachusetts, \nswells in Vermont, and deposits at New York City. Well, the mainstream \nthat I know, and that most Americans can relate to, runs much broader \nand further than that.\n  The other mantra repeated by Justice Owen's detractors is that she is \n``conservative.'' I believe that the use of political or ideological \nlabels to distinguish judicial philosophies has become highly \nmisleading and does a disservice to the public's confidence in the \nindependent judiciary, of which the Senate is the steward.\n  I endorse the words of my friend, and former Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Biden, when he said some years ago that:\n  ``[Judicial confirmation] is not about pro-life or pro-choice, \nconservative or liberal, it is not about Democrat or Republican. It is \nabout intellectual and professional competence to serve as a member of \nthe third co-equal branch of the Government.''\n  I believe it is our duty to confirm judges who stand by the \nConstitution and the law as written, not as they would want to rewrite \nthem. That was George Washington's first criterion for the Federal \nbench, and it is mine. I also want common sense judges who respect \nAmerican culture. I believe that is what the American people want.\n\n  I believe we do a disservice to the independence of the Federal \njudiciary by using partisan or ideological terms in referring to \njudges.\n  My reason was well stated by Senator Biden when he said that: ``it is \nimperative [not to] compromise the public perception that judges and \ncourts are a forum for the fair, unbiased, and impartial adjudication \nof disputes.''\n  We compromise that perception, I believe, when we play partisan or \nideological tricks with the judiciary. Surely, we can find other ways \nto raise money for campaigns and otherwise play at politics, without \ndragging this nation's trust in the judiciary through the mud, as some \nof the outside groups continue to do.\n  All you have to do to see my point is read two or three of the fund-\nraising letters that have become public over the past couple of weeks \nthat spread mistruths and drag the judiciary branch into the mud, as \nmany recent political campaigns increasingly find themselves.\n  On a lighter note, while on ideology, let me pause to point out that \none of the groups deployed against Justice Owen is the Communist Party \nof America, but then I don't know that they have come out in favor of \nany of President Bush's nominees. I suspect after the fall of the \nBerlin Wall, they must have a lot of time on their hands.\n  Today I wish to address just why a nominee with such a stellar \nrecord, a respected judicial temperament, and as fine an intellect as \nJustice Owen has, who graduated third in her class from Baylor's law \nschool, a great Baptist institution, when few women attended law \nschool, let alone in the South, who obtained the highest score in the \nTexas Bar examination, and who has twice been elected by the people of \nTexas to serve on their Supreme Court, the last time with 83 percent of \nthe votes and the support of every major newspaper of every political \nstripe, I would like to address just why such a nominee could get as \nmuch organized and untruthful opposition from the usual leftist, \nWashington special interest groups that we see. I will peel through \nwhat is at play for those groups. We need to expose and repel what is \nat play for the benefit and independence of this Senate.\n\n  And I would like to address also the reasons why I am confident that \nshe will be confirmed notwithstanding. Not least of which is that, far \nfrom being the ``judicial activist'' some would have us believe her to \nbe, she garnered the American Bar Association's unanimous rating of \n``well qualified.'' The Judiciary Committee has never voted against a \nnominee with this highest of ratings.\n  The first reason for the organized opposition, of course, is plain. \nJustice Owen is from Texas, and Washington's well paid reputation \ndestroyers could not help but attempt to attack the widely popular \nPresident of the United States, at this particular time in an election \nyear, by attacking the judicial nominee most familiar to him. Justice \nOwen, welcome to Washington.\n  But as I prepared more deeply for the Hearing earlier this week, the \nsecond reason became apparent to me. In my 26 years on the Judiciary \nCommittee I have seen no group of judicial nominees as superb as those \nthat President Bush has sent to us, and he has sent both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  In reading Justice Owen's decisions, one sees a judge working hard to \nget it right, to get at the legislature's intent and to apply binding \nauthority and rules of judicial construction. It is apparent to me that \nof all the sitting judges the President has nominated, Justice Owen is \nthe most outstanding nominee. She is, in my estimation, the best, and \ndespite what her detractors say, she is the best judge that any \nAmerican, any consumer and any parent could hope for.\n  Her opinions, whether majority, concurrences or dissents, could be \nused as a law school text book that illustrates exactly how, and not \nwhat, an appellate judge should think, how she should write, and just \nhow she should do the people justice by effecting their will through \nthe laws adopted by their elected legislatures. Justice Owen clearly \napproaches these tasks with both scholarship and mainstream American \ncommon sense. She does not\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nsubstitute her views for the legislature's, which is precisely the type \nof judge that the Washington groups who oppose her do not want.\n\n  She is precisely the kind of judge that our first two Presidents, \nGeorge Washington and John Adams, had in mind when they agreed that the \njustices of the State supreme courts would provide the most learned \ncandidates for the Federal bench.\n  So in studying her record, the second reason for the militant and \ndeceptive opposition to Justice Owen became quite plain to me. In this \nworld turned upside down, simply put, she is that good.\n  Another reason for the opposition against Justice Owen is the most \ndemagogic, the issue of campaign contributions and campaign finance \nreform. Some of her critics are even eager to tie her to the current \ntrouble with Enron.\n  Well, she clearly has nothing to do with that. Neither Enron nor any \nother corporation has donated to her campaigns, in fact, they are \nforbidden by Texas law to make campaign contributions in judicial \nelections. It was embarrassing to me, as it would be to any American \nwho watched the hearing earlier this week, to see Justice Owen defeat \nthese demagogic allegations, but being a Texas woman, she did so with \nstyle, elegance, and grace--and without embarrassing her questioners.\n  Not that there was even a need for more questions. The Enron and \ncampaign contributions questions were amply clarified in a letter to \nChairman Leahy and the Committee dated April 5 by Alberto Gonzales. I \nwill ask unanimous consent, to place this and other related letters \ninto the Record. And I would place into the Record a retraction from \nThe New York Times saying that they got their facts wrong on this Enron \nstory. Such retractions don't come often, not as often as the invention \nof facts by the smear groups. And despite the retraction, CNN was \nrepeating the same wrong facts just this week!\n\n  Notably, at the hearing Justice Owen received no questions from my \nDemocrat colleagues on her views on election reform and judicial \nreform, of which she is a leading advocate in Texas. She is also a \nleader in Gender Bias Reform in the courts and a reformer on divorce \nand child support proceedings. But my colleagues seemed to take little \ninterest in this, nor in her acclaimed advocacy to improve legal \nservices and funding for the poor.\n  All of these are aspects of her record her detractors would have us \nignore, I certainly did not read these positive attributes in those \nfancy documents, or should I say booklets, released prior to the \nhearing by the Washington radical special interests lobby.\n  I will also ask unanimous consent, to place into the Record letters \nfrom leaders of the Legal Society and 14 past presidents of the Texas \nBar Association, many of whom are leading Texas Democrats.\n  The fourth reason for the opposition to Justice Owen is the most \ndisturbing to me. For some months now, a few of my Democrat colleagues \nhave strained to point out when they believe they are voting for \njudicial nominees that they believe to be pro-life. I have disputed \nthis when they have said it because the record contains no such \ninformation of personal views from the judges we have reported \nfavorably out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Each time they assert it, my staff has scoured the transcripts of \nhearings and turned up nothing. What does turn up is that each time my \ncolleagues have asserted this, they have done so only for nominees who \nare men.\n  I am afraid that the main reason Justice Owen is being opposed, is \nnot that personal views, namely on the issue of abortion, are being \nfalsely ascribed to her, they are, but rather because she is a woman in \npublic life who is believed to have personal views that some maintain \nshould be unacceptable for a woman in public life to have.\n  Such penalization is a matter of the greatest concern to me because \nit represents a new glass ceiling for women jurists. And they have come \ntoo far to suffer now having their feet bound up just as they approach \nthe tables of our high courts after long-struggling careers.\n  I am deeply concerned that such treatment will have a chilling effect \non women jurists that will keep them from weighing in on exactly the \nsorts of cases that most invite their participation and their \nperspectives as women.\n  The truth is that Justice Owen has never written or said anything \ncritical of abortion rights. In fact, the cases she is challenged on \nhave everything to do with the rights of parents to be involved in \ntheir children's lives, and nothing to do with the right to an \nabortion.\n  Ironically, the truth is that the cases that her detractors point to \nas proof of apparently unacceptable personal views are a series of \nfictions. This is what I mean about exposing the misstatements of the \nleft-wing activist groups in Washington. I will illustrate just three \nof these fictions.\n  The first sample fiction is the now often-cited comment attributed to \nthen Texas Supreme Court Justice Alberto Gonzales, written in a case \nopinion, that Justice Owen's dissent signified ``an unconscionable act \nof judicial activism.'' Someone should do a story about how often this \nlittle shibboleth has been repeated in the press and in several \nwebsites of the professional smear groups. The problem with it is that \nit isn't true. Justice Gonzales was not referring to Justice Owen's \ndissent, but rather to the dissent of another colleague in the same \ncase.\n\n  The second sample fiction is the smear group's misrepresented \nportrayal of a case involving buffer zones and abortion clinics. In \nthat case, the majority of the Texas Supreme Court ruled for Planned \nParenthood and affirmed a lower court's injunction that protected \nabortion clinics and doctor's homes and imposed 1.2 million dollars in \ndamages against pro-life protestors. In only a few instances, the court \ntightened the buffer zones against protestors. Justice Owen joined the \nmajority opinion and was excoriated by dissenting colleagues, who were, \nby that way, admittedly pro-life.\n  When describing that decision then, abortion rights leaders hailed \nthe result as a victory for abortion rights in Texas. Planned \nParenthood's lawyer said the decision ``isn't a home run, it's a grand \nslam.''\n  Of course, that result hasn't changed, but the characterization of it \nhas. This is how Planned Parenthood describes this same case in their \nfact sheet on Justice Owen: ``[Owen] supports eliminating buffer zones \naround reproductive health care clinics . . .''\n  In fact, her decision did exactly the opposite.\n  The third and most pervasive sample fiction concerns Justice Owen's \nrulings in a series of Jane Doe cases which first interpreted Texas' \nthen-new parental involvement law. The law, which I think is important \nto emphasize was passed by the Texas legislature, not by Justice Owen, \nwith bipartisan support, requires that an abortion clinic give notice \nto just one parent 48 hours prior to a minor's abortion. Unlike States \nwith more restrictive laws such as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and North \nCarolina, consent of the parent is not required in Texas. A minor may \nbe exempted from giving such notice if they get court permission.\n\n  Since the law went into effect, over 650 notice bypasses have been \nrequested from the courts. Of these 650 cases, only 10 have had facts \nso difficult that two lower courts denied a notice bypass, only 10 have \nrisen to the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Justice Owen's detractors would have us believe that in these cases, \nshe would have applied standards of her own choosing. Ironically, in \neach and every example they cite, whether concurring with the majority \nor dissenting, Justice Owen was applying not her own standards but the \nstandards enuniciated in the Roe v. Wade line of decisions of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, which she followed and recognized as \nauthority.\n  For example, detractors take pains to tell us that Justice Owen would \nrequire that to be sufficiently informed to get an abortion without a \nparent's knowledge, that the minor show that they are being counseled \non religious considerations. They appear to think this is nothing more \nthan opposition to abortion rights. They are so bothered with this \nreligious language that various documents produced by the abortion \nindustry lobby italicize the word religious. But this standard is not \nJustice Owen's invention, but rather the words of the Supreme Court's \npro-choice decision in Casey.\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\n  Should she not follow one Supreme Court decision, but be required to \nfollow another? Is that what we want our judges to do, pick and choose \nwhich decisions to follow? That appears to be the type of activist \njudge these groups want, and this Senate should resist all such \nattempts.\n  The truth is that rather than altering the Texas law, Justice Owen \nwas trying to effect the legislator's intent. No better evidence of \nthis is the letter of the pro-choice woman Texas Senator stating her \n``unequivocal'' support of Justice Owen.\n  Senator Shapiro says of Justice Owen: ``Her opinions interpreting the \nTexas [parental involvement law] serve as prime example of her judicial \nrestraint.'' I understand why the Washington left-wing groups don't \nlike that in a judge, but the Senate and the Judiciary Committee should \napplaud and commend such restraint and temperament.\n  The truth is that, rather than being an activist foe of Roe, Justice \nOwen repeatedly cites and follows Roe and its progeny as authority. She \nhas to, it's what the Court has said is the law. Compare this to \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who wrote in 1985 that the Roe v. Wade \ndecision represented ``heavy handed judicial intervention'' that was \n``difficult to justify.''\n  In relation to this, I would like briefly to comment on the mounting \noffensive of some to change the rules of judicial confirmation by \nasking nominees to share personal views or to ensure that nominees \nshare the personal views of the Senator on certain cases.\n  To illustrate my view, I'll tell you that many people have recently \ncalled on the Judiciary Committee to question nominees as to their \nviews on the pledge of allegiance case. My full-throated answer to this \nis no, as much as I think that that case was wrongly decided. I also \nhappen to think that the recent School Voucher case is the most \nimportant civil rights decision since Brown but I am not going to ask \npeople what they think about that case either.\n  Such questions threaten the heart of the independent judiciary and \nattempt to accomplish by hidden indirection what Senators cannot do \nopenly by constitutional amendment. It is an attempt to make the courts \na mere extension of the Congress.\n  I speak against this practice in the strongest terms, and, in my \nview, any nominee who answers such questions would not be fit for \njudicial office and would not have my vote.\n\n  The truth is that there are many who, like Justice Ginsburg, think \nthat cases like Griswold or Roe were wrongly decided as a \nconstitutional matter even if they agree with the policy result, just \nas the great liberal Justice Hugo Black did in his dissent in Griswold.\n  A few weeks ago we heard testimony from Boyden Gray, a former White \nCounsel and a former Supreme Court clerk, that Chief Justice Warren \nthough that Brown v. Board of Education was his worst ruling as matter \nof constitutional law, but not his least necessary to end \ndesegregation.\n  Some of Justice Owen's detractors have made much about the fact that \nshe is not afraid to dissent. Of course, they fail to mention dissents \nlike her opinion in Hyundai Motor v. Alvarado, in which Justice Owens' \nreasoning was later adopted by the United States Supreme Court on the \nsame difficult issue of law.\n  They also overlooked here dissent in a repressed memory/sexual abuse \ncase where she took the majority to task with these words: ``This is \nreminiscent of the days when the crime of rape went unpunished unless \ncorroborating evidence was available. The Court's opinion reflects the \nattitudes reflected in that era.''\n  Perhaps, they thought that this dissent showed her too representative \nof American women. Despite deceptive opposition I think that Justice \nOwen should be confirmed.\n\n  I will ask unanimous consent to place into the Record an editorial of \nearlier this week from The Washington Post, a liberal publication, \ncalling on us to be fair and calling on this Senate to confirm Justice \nOwen.\n  I have hope that my Democrat colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nwill be led by the time-tested standards well-stated by Senator Biden, \nand look again to qualifications and judicial temperament, not base \npolitics. Whether the Biden standard will survive past our time, will \nbe tested now.\n  If we fail the test we will breach our responsibility as auditors of \nthe Washington special interest groups and the Judiciary's stewards on \nbehalf of all the people, and not just some.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the documents to which I \nhave referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: In our recent conversations, you \n     suggested that the White House should examine whether \n     contributions Justice Owen received for her campaigns for the \n     Texas Supreme Court raise any legitimate issue with respect \n     to her fitness to serve on the Fifth Circuit. We have done as \n     you have suggested, and I see no basis to question Justice \n     Owen's fitness to serve on the Fifth Circuit. The record \n     reflects that she has at all times acted properly and in \n     complete compliance with both the letter and the spirit of \n     the rules relating to judicial campaign finance.\n       I am certain you will agree that it was entirely proper for \n     Justice Owen's campaign to receive contributions. Article 5 \n     of the Texas Constitution provides that candidates for the \n     state judiciary run in contested elections, which are \n     partisan under Texas election law, and Canon 45(1) of the \n     Texas Code of Judicial Conduct provides that the candidates \n     may solicit and accept campaign funds. Like Senators, \n     therefore, candidates for the state judiciary in Texas may \n     receive contributions to finance their campaigns.\n       To be sure, Justice Owen and many others would prefer a \n     system of appointed rather than elected state judges. In \n     fact, Justice Owen has long advocated appointment of judges \n     (coupled with retention elections). She has written to fellow \n     Texas attorneys on the issue, committed to a new system in \n     League of Women Voters publications, and appeared as a pro-\n     reform witness before the Texas Legislature. She has \n     explained even to partisan groups why judges should be \n     selected on merit. But the people in some states, including \n     Texas, have chosen a system of contested elections for \n     judges. Elected state judges certainly are not barred from \n     future appointment to the federal judiciary; on the contrary, \n     some notable federal appellate judges whom President Clinton \n     nominated and you supported were state judges who had run and \n     been elected in contested elections--Fortunato Benevides and \n     James Dennis, for example, from the Fifth Circuit.\n       I am also certain you would find nothing inappropriate \n     about the sources from which Justice Owen's campaign received \n     contributions. In her 1994 and 2000 elections, Justice Owen's \n     campaign quite properly received contributions from a large \n     number of entities and individuals, with no single \n     contributor predominating. In the 1994 election cycle, her \n     campaign received approximately $1.2 million in contributions \n     from 3,084 different contributors. Included in that total was \n     $8,800 from employees of Enron and its employee-funded \n     political action committee. Employees of Enron thus \n     contributed less than 1% of the total contributions to her \n     campaign. And Justice Owen's campaign, of course, received no \n     corporate contributions from Enron or any Enron-affiliated \n     corporation, as such corporate contributions are not \n     permissible under Texas law. Notably, in the 1994 election, \n     not only did Justice Owen comply with all campaign laws, she \n     went beyond what the law required and voluntarily limited \n     contributions when many other judicial candidates did not do \n     so.\n       In the 2000 election cycle, Justice Owen's campaign \n     received approximately $300,000 in contributions from 273 \n     different contributors. In that cycle, her campaign received \n     no contributions from Enron or its affiliates, from employees \n     of Enron, or from Enron's political action committee. In \n     addition, Justice Owen ultimately had no Democratic or \n     Republican opponent in the 2000 election cycle, and she \n     closed her campaign office and returned most of her \n     unspent contributions, an act that I believe is unusual in \n     Texas judicial history.\n       It was entirely proper for Justice Owen's campaign to \n     receive campaign contributions, including the contributions \n     from Enron employees. Indeed, seven of the nine current Texas \n     Supreme Court Justices received Enron contributions, and \n     several of them received more than Justice Owen's campaign \n     received. As this record demonstrates, elected judges \n     certainly did not act improperly in the past, before anyone \n     knew about Enron's financial situation, by receiving \n     contributions from employees of Enron--any more than it could \n     be said that Members of Congress acted improperly in the past \n     by receiving contributions from Enron.\n       If, as is evident from the foregoing discussion, there was \n     nothing amiss with the fact that Justice Owen received \n     donations or with the sources from which she received them, \n     the only other possible area of concern with her conduct \n     relating to campaign contributors would be her decisions from \n     the bench. Texas Code of Judicial Conduct Cannon 3(B)(1) \n     provides that a judge ``shall hear and decide matters \n     assigned to the judges except those in which disqualification \n     is required or recusal is appropriate.'' And it is\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\n     well-established that judicial recusal is neither necessary \n     nor appropriate in cases involving parties or counsel who \n     contributed to that judge's campaign. See Public Citizen, \n     Inc. v. Bomer, 274 F.3d 212, 215 (5th Cir. 2001); Apex Towing \n     Co., v. Tolin, 997 S.W.2d 903, 907 (Tex. App. 1999), rev'd on \n     other grounds, 41 S.W.3d 118 (Tex. 2001); Aguilar v. \n     Anderson, 855 S.W.2d 799, 802 (Tex. App. 1993); J-IV Invs. v. \n     David Lynn Mach., Inc., 784 S.W.2d 106, 107 (Tex. App. 1990). \n     Indeed, in any state with elected judges, any other rule \n     would be unworkable. The primary protections against \n     inappropriate influence on judges from campaign contributions \n     are disclosure of contributions and adherence to the \n     tradition by which judges explain the reasons for their \n     decisions. If the people of a state deem those protections \n     insufficient, the people may choose a system of appointed \n     judges rather than elected judges, as Justice Owen has \n     advocated for Texas.\n       Surmising that the concerns you raised would likely focus \n     on her sitting in cases in which Enron had an interest, we \n     have undertaken a review of her decisions in such cases. We \n     have reviewed Texas Supreme Court docket records and Enron's \n     1994-2000 SEC Form 10Ks to determine the cases in which Enron \n     or affiliates of Enron were parties to proceedings before the \n     Court since January 1995 (when Justice Owen took her seat). \n     The decisions of the Texas Supreme Court since January 1995 \n     in proceedings involving Enron have been ordinary and raise \n     no questions whatsoever.\n       A judge's decisions are properly assessed by examining \n     their legal reasoning, not by conducting any kind of \n     numerical or statistical calculations. But even those who \n     would attempt to draw conclusions based on such calculations \n     would find nothing in connection with these Enron cases. To \n     begin with, we are aware of no proceeding involving Enron in \n     which Justice Owen cast the deciding vote. In six proceedings \n     in which we know that Enron was a party, Justice Owen's vote \n     can be characterized as favorable to Enron in two cases and \n     adverse in two cases. With respect to the remaining two, one \n     cannot be characterized either way, and she did not \n     participate in the other case because it had been a matter at \n     her law firm when she was a partner. Eight other matters came \n     before the Court in which we know that Enron or an affiliate \n     was a party, but the court declined to hear them. In those \n     matters, the Court's actions could be characterized as \n     favorable to Enron in four cases, adverse in three cases, and \n     one was dismissed by agreement of the parties. We will supply \n     the Judiciary Committee copies of the cases on request.\n       There has been some media attention on one case involving \n     Enron in which Justice Owen wrote the opinion for the Court. \n     See Enron Corp. v. Spring Creek Independent School District, \n     922 S.W.2d 931 (Tex. 1996). The issue in that case concerned \n     the constitutionality of an ad valorem tax statute that \n     allowed market value of inventory to be set on one of two \n     different dates. The Court held that the statute did not \n     violate the state constitution--and the decision was \n     unanimous. I understand that two Democratic Justices who sat \n     on the Court at that time (Justice Raul Gonzalez and Rose \n     Spector) have written to you to explain the case, indicating \n     that Justice Owen's participation in the case was entirely \n     proper. Moreover, the lawyer who represented a part opposing \n     Enron in this case (Robert Mott) recently was quoted as \n     saying that criticism of Justice Owen for her role in this \n     case is ``nonsense'' Texas Lawyer (April 1, 2002). In my \n     judgment, this case raises no legitimate issue with respect \n     to Justice Owen's confirmation.\n       Finally, I am informed that, if confirmed, Justice Owen \n     will donate all of her unspent campaign contributions to \n     qualify tax-exempt charitable and educational institutions, \n     as is contemplated under section 254.205(a)(5) of the Texas \n     Election Code.\n       I trust that the foregoing will resolve all questions \n     concerning the propriety of Justice Owen's activities in \n     relation to financing her campaigns. As you know, I served \n     with Justice Owen, and I am convinced from my work with her \n     that she is a person of exceptional integrity, character, and \n     intellect. Both Senators from Texas strongly support her \n     nomination. The American Bar Association has unanimously \n     rated Justice Owen ``well qualified,'' and one factor in that \n     rating process is the nominee's integrity.\n       Despite her superb qualifications and the ``Judicial \n     emergency'' in the Fifth Circuit declared by the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States, Justice Owen has not \n     received a hearing for nearly 11 months since her May 9, \n     2001, nomination. We respectfully request that the Committee \n     afford this exceptional nominee a prompt hearing and vote.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    April 1, 2002.\n     Re Justice Priscilla Owen.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We served on the Texas Supreme Court \n     with Justice Priscilla Owen when the case of Enron \n     Corporation et al. v. Spring Creek Independent School \n     District, 922 S.W.2d 931 (Tex. 1996) was decided. The issue \n     in this case was the constitutionality of an ad valorem tax \n     statute that allowed market value of inventory to be set on \n     two different dates. In a unanimous opinion, all justices, \n     Democrats and Republican alike, agreed with the opinion \n     authored by Justice Owen that the choice of the valuation \n     date in ad valorem tax statute did not violate a provision of \n     the State Constitution requiring uniformity and equality in \n     ad valorem taxation. We found the decision of the United \n     States Supreme Court and other states instructive on this \n     issue.\n       In our ruling, we agreed with the rulings of the Harris \n     County Appraisal District and the trial court.\n           Cordially,\n     Raul A. Gonzalez,\n         Justice, Texas Supreme Court, 1984-1998.\n     Rose Spector,\n         Justice, Texas Supreme Court, 1992-1998.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Perdue, Brandon,\n\n\n                              Fielder, Collins & Mott, L.L.P.,\n\n                                        Houston, TX, July 1, 2002.\n     Re Justice Priscilla Owen.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: My name is Robert Mott. I was the \n     legal counsel for the Spring Independent School District in \n     the case of Enron Corporation et al. v. Spring Independent \n     School District, 922 S.W.2d 931 (Tex. 1996). We were the \n     losing party in this case.\n       I have been disturbed by the suggestions that Justice \n     Priscilla Owen's decision in this case was influenced by the \n     campaign contributions she received from Enron employees. I \n     personally believe that such suggestions are nonsense. \n     Justice Owen authored the opinion of a unanimous court \n     consisting of both Democrats and Republican. While my clients \n     and I disagreed with the decision, we were not surprised. The \n     decision of the Court was to uphold an act of the Legislature \n     regarding property valuation. It was based upon United States \n     Supreme Court precedent, of which we were fully aware when we \n     argued the case.\n       I firmly believe that there is absolutely no reason to \n     question Justice Owen's integrity based upon the decision in \n     this case.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Mott.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  De Leon, Boggins & Icenogle,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, June 26, 2002.\n     Re nomination of the Honorable Priscilla Owen to the U.S. \n         Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This correspondence is sent to you in \n     support of the nomination by President Bush of Texas Supreme \n     Court Justice Priscilla Owen for a seat on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       As the immediate past President of Legal Aid of Central \n     Texas, it is of particular significance to me that Justice \n     Owen has served as the liaison from the Texas Supreme Court \n     to statewide committees regarding legal services to the poor \n     and pro bono legal services. Undoubtedly, Justice Owen has an \n     understanding of and a commitment to the availability of \n     legal services to those who are disadvantaged and unable to \n     pay for such legal services. It is that type of insight and \n     empathy that Justice Owen will bring to the Fifth Circuit.\n       Additionally, Justice Owen played a major role in \n     organizing a group known as Family Law 2000 which seeks to \n     educate parents about the effect the dissolution of a \n     marriage can have on their children. Family Law 2000 seeks to \n     lessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings \n     surrounding marriage dissolution. The Fifth Circuit would be \n     well served by having someone with a background in family law \n     serving on the bench.\n       Justice Owen has also found time to involve herself in \n     community service. Currently Justice Owen serves on the Board \n     of Texas Hearing and Service Dogs. Justice Owen also teaches \n     Sunday School at her Church, St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission \n     in Austin, Texas. In addition to teaching Sunday School \n     Justice Owen serves as head of the altar guild.\n       Justice Owen is recognized as a well rounded legal scholar. \n     She is a member of the American Law Institute, the American \n     Judicature Society, The American Bar Association, and a \n     Fellow of the American and Houston Bar Foundations. Her \n     stature as a member of the Texas Supreme Court was recognized \n     in 2000 when every major newspaper in Texas endorsed Justice \n     Owen in her bid for re-election to the Texas Supreme Court.\n       It has been my privilege to have been personally acquainted \n     with various members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit. The late Justice Jerry Williams was my \n     administrative law professor in law school and later became a \n     personal friend. Justice Reavley has been a friend over the \n     years. Justice Johnson is also a friend. In my opinion, \n     Justice Owen will bring to the Fifth Circuit the same \n     intellectual ability and integrity that those gentlemen \n     brought to the Court.\n       I earnestly solicit your favorable vote on the nomination \n     of Justice Priscilla Owen for a seat on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your attention to this correspondence.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Hector De Leon.\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                 Texas Association\n\n\n                                     of Defense Counsel, Inc.,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, June 19, 2001.\n     Re nomination of Justice Patricia Owen for the United States \n         Fifth Circuit of Appeals.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I have had the privilege of knowing \n     Justice Patricia Owen of the Texas Supreme Court, both \n     personally and professionally, for many years. I cannot \n     imagine a more qualified, ethical, and knowledgeable person \n     to sit on the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I accept the reality that politics is a part of our \n     culture, but I know that when it comes to appointing federal \n     judges, we must transcend politics and look to character and \n     ability. Patricia Owen has the character and ability to make \n     all of us, Democrat and Republican, proud.\n       I ask that your Committee act swiftly to confirm her \n     nomination to the United States Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     E. Thomas Bishop.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Hughes/Luce, LLP.,\n\n                                        Dallas, TX, July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As past presidents of the State Bar of \n     Texas, we join in this letter to strongly recommend an \n     affirmative vote by the Judiciary Committee and confirmation \n     by the full Senate for Justice Priscilla Owen, nominee to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Although we profess different party affiliations and span \n     the spectrum of views of legal and policy issues, we stand \n     united in affirming that Justice Owen is a truly unique and \n     outstanding candidate for appointment to the Fifth Circuit. \n     Based on her superb integrity, competence and judicial \n     temperament, Justice Owen earned her Well Qualified rating \n     unanimously from the American Bar Association Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary--the highest rating \n     possible. A fair and bipartisan review of Justice Owen's \n     qualifications by the Judiciary Committee certainly would \n     reach the same conclusion.\n       Justice Owen's stellar academic achievements include \n     graduating cum laude from both Baylor University and Baylor \n     Law School, thereafter earning the highest score in the Texas \n     Bar Exam in November 1977. Her career accomplishments are \n     also remarkable. Prior to her election to the Supreme Court \n     of Texas in 1994, for 17 years she practiced law specializing \n     in commercial litigation in both the federal and state \n     courts. Since January 1995, Justice Owen has delivered \n     exemplary service on the Texas Supreme Court, as reflected by \n     her receiving endorsements from every major newspaper in \n     Texas during her successful re-election bid in 2000.\n       The status of our profession in Texas has been \n     significantly enhanced by Justice Owen's advocacy of pro bono \n     service and leadership for the membership of the State Bar of \n     Texas. Justice Owen has served on committees regarding legal \n     services to the poor and diligently worked with others to \n     obtain legislation that provides substantial resources for \n     those delivering legal services to the poor.\n       Justice Owen also has been a long-time advocate for an \n     updated and reformed system of judicial selection in Texas. \n     Seeking to remove any perception of a threat to judicial \n     impartiality, Justice Owen has encouraged the reform debate \n     and suggested positive changes that would enhance and improve \n     our state judicial branch of government.\n       While the Fifth Circuit has one of the highest per judge \n     caseloads of any circuit in the country, there are presently \n     two vacancies on the Fifth Circuit bench. Both vacancies have \n     been declared ``judicial emergencies'' by the Administrative \n     Office of the U.S. Courts. Justice Owen's service on the \n     Fifth Circuit is critically important to the administration \n     of justice.\n       Given her extraordinary legal skills and record of service \n     in Texas, Justice Owen deserves prompt and favorable \n     consideration by the Judiciary Committee. We thank you and \n     look forward to Justice Owen's swift approval.\n                                                Darrell E.

The Texas Supreme Court justice, who \n     had a hearing yesterday before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, is part of the right flank of the conservative \n     court on which she serves. Her opinions have a certain \n     ideological consistency that might cause some senators to \n     vote against her on those grounds. But our own sense is that \n     the case against her is not strong enough to warrant her \n     rejection by the Senate. Justice Owen's nomination may be a \n     close call, but she should be confirmed.\n       Justice Owen is indisputably well qualified, having served \n     on a state supreme court for seven years and, prior to her \n     election, having had a well-regarded law practice. So rather \n     than attacking her qualifications, opponents have sought to \n     portray her as a conservative judicial activist--that is, to \n     accuse her of substituting her own views for those of \n     policymakers and legislators. In support of this charge, they \n     cite cases in which other Texas justices, including then-\n     Justice Alberto Gonzales--now President Bush's White House \n     Counsel--appear to suggest as much. But the cases they cite, \n     by and large, posed legitimately difficult questions. While \n     some of Justice Owen's opinions--particularly on matters \n     related to abortion--seem rather aggressive, none seems to us \n     beyond the range of reasonable judicial disagreement. And Mr. \n     Gonzales, whatever disagreements they might have had, \n     supports her nomination enthusiastically. Liberals will no \n     doubt disagree with some opinions she would write on the 5th \n     Circuit, but this is not the standard by which a president's \n     lower-court nominees should be judged.\n       Nor is it reasonable to reject her because of campaign \n     contributions she accepted, including those from people \n     associated with Enron Corp. Texas has a particularly ugly \n     system of judicial elections that taints all who participate \n     in it. State rules permit judges to sit on cases in which \n     parties or lawyers have also been donors--as Justice Owen did \n     with Enron. Judicial elections are a bad idea, and letting \n     judges hear cases from people who have given them money is \n     wrong. But Justice Owen didn't write the rules and has \n     supported a more reasonable system.\n       Justice Owen was one of President Bush's initial crop of 11 \n     appeals court nominees, sent to the Senate in May of last \n     year. Of these, only three have been confirmed so far, and \n     six have not even had the courtesy of a hearing. The fact \n     that President Clinton's nominees were subjected to similar \n     mistreatment does not excuse it. In Justice Owen's case, the \n     long wait has produced no great surprise. She is still a \n     conservative. And that is still not a good reason to vote her \n     down.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the New York Times, January 25, 2002]\n\n                              Corrections\n\n       An article in Business Day on Tuesday about criticism of \n     Justice Priscilla Owen of the Texas Supreme Court, a nominee \n     for a federal judgeship who accepted campaign donations from \n     Enron, misstated the amount of money saved by the company \n     because of a decision she wrote, dealing with taxes owed to a \n     local school district. It was $224,988.65, not $15 million. \n     The larger sum, cited in her opinion as the district's \n     revenue loss, was the amount by which the value of a piece of \n     the company's land was lowered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7396-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7396-S7397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER C. CONNER, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE UNITED \n                         STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 826.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Christopher C. Conner, \nof Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania be recognized for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nagreeing to recognize me.\n  Now that the nomination has been confirmed by the Senate, I \ncongratulate Kit Conner from outside of Harrisburg, PA, for filling the \nvacancy in the Middle District. Judge Conner is one of six members from \nPennsylvania who are on the Executive Calendar in the Senate. Including \nhim, there are five district judges and one Third Circuit nominee, and \nI am very gratified we have been able to unlock the logjam on judges \nand begin the process of moving forward.\n  Kit Conner is a very distinguished member of the bar in the Middle \nDistrict in Pennsylvania. He is a tremendous lawyer and advocate, \nsomeone who has made substantial contributions to his community and is \ngoing to be an excellent Middle District judge. I look forward to his \nswearing in ceremony very soon.\n  If we go down the listing of judges in the order in which they appear \non the calendar, the next judges to be confirmed are also Pennsylvania \njudges, at least nominees for judicial vacancies, and they would be Joy \nFlowers Conti from the Western District of Pennsylvania, John Jones \nfrom the Middle District, and then D. Brooks Smith, who is\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\na judge from the Western District who has been nominated for the Third \nCircuit. Hopefully next week, maybe as early as Monday or Tuesday, we \ncan get to these nominations in the order in which they appear on the \ncalendar. That seems to be the way the Senate is proceeding, and so we \ncan begin to fill some of these vacancies we have in Pennsylvania, and \nin particular the Judge Brooks Smith vacancy to the Third Circuit, so \nwe can begin to get the expeditious justice that people in Pennsylvania \nand the Third Circuit deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Christopher C. Conner, of Pennsylvania, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table, and the President will be notified \nof the Senate's action.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with today's confirmation of Mr. \nChristopher Conner to the District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania, the Democratic-led Senate will have confirmed a total of \n60 judicial nominees since the change in Senate majority a little over \none year ago and 49 district court nominees.\n  Today's nominee has not proven to be very controversial and the \nSenate has acted quickly on this nomination.\n  Mr. Conner was nominated in March of this year to a relatively recent \nvacancy and received a hearing in May, shortly after his paperwork was \ncompleted.\n  With today's confirmation, the Judiciary Committee will have held \nhearings for a total of 10 District Court nominees from Pennsylvania, \nincluding Judge Davis, Judge Baylson and Judge Rufe, who were confirmed \nin April. Those confirmations illustrate the progress being made under \nDemocratic leadership and the fair and expeditious way this President's \nnominees are being treated.\n  With today's confirmation, we will have confirmed four nominees to \nthe District Courts in Pennsylvania. I think that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate as a whole have done well by Pennsylvania, \ndespite some of the obstructionist practices during Republican control \nof the Senate, particularly regarding nominees in the Western half of \nthe State.\n  Nominees from Philadelphia were not immune from Republican \nobstructionist tactics, despite the best efforts and diligence of my \ngood friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure confirmation \nof all of the judicial nominees from all parts of his home State, \nwithout regard to which party controlled the White House.\n  For example, Judge Legrome Davis was first nominated to the position \nof U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \nby President Clinton on July 30, 1998. The Republican-controlled Senate \ntook no action on his nomination and it was returned to the President \nat the end of 1998. On January 26, 1999, President Clinton renominated \nJudge Davis for the same vacancy. The Senate again failed to hold a \nhearing for Judge Davis and his nomination was returned after two more \nyears.\n  Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis' nomination languished \nbefore the Committee for 868 days without a hearing.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Davis was subjected to the kind of inappropriate \npartisan rancor that befell so many other nominees to the district \ncourts in Pennsylvania and to the Third Circuit during the Republican \ncontrol of the Senate. I want to note emphatically, however, that I \nknow personally that the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, strongly \nsupported Judge Davis's nomination and worked hard to get him a hearing \nand a vote.\n  The lack of Senate action on Judge Davis's initial nominations are in \nno way attributable to a lack of support from the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania. Far from it.\n  In fact, I give Senator Specter full credit for getting President \nBush to renominate Judge Davis earlier this year and commended him \npublicly for all he has done to support this nomination from the \noutset.\n  This year we moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis, and he was \nconfirmed within a few months of his renomination by President Bush. \nThe saga of Judge Davis recalls for us so many nominees from the period \nof January 1995 through July 10, 2001, who never received a hearing or \na vote and who were the subject of secret anonymous holds by \nRepublicans for reasons that were never explained.\n  At Judge Davis' recent confirmation hearing Senator Santorum \ntestified that Judge Davis did not get a hearing because local \nDemocrats objected. I was the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee during those years and never heard that before. My \nunderstanding at the time, from July 1998 until the end of 2000, was \nthat Judge Legrome Davis would have had the support of Senator Specter \nas well as every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. \nDespite that bipartisan support, he was not included by the then-\nChairman of the Committee in the May 2000 hearing for a few other \nPennsylvania nominees.\n  In contrast, the hearing we had earlier this year for Ms. Conti was \nthe very first hearing on a nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania since 1994, in almost a decade, despite qualified nominees \nof President Clinton. No nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania received a hearing during the entire period that \nRepublicans controlled the Senate in the Clinton Administration. One of \nthe nominees to the Western District, Lynette Norton, waited for almost \n1,000 days, and she was never given the courtesy of a hearing or a \nvote. Unfortunately, Ms. Norton died earlier this year, having never \nfulfilled her dream of serving on the Federal bench.\n  Large numbers of vacancies continue to exist, in large measure \nbecause the recent Republican majority was not willing to hold hearings \nor vote on more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial nominees, many \nof whom waited for years and never received a vote on their nomination. \nIt is the Democrats, not the Republicans, who have broken with that \nhistory of inaction from the Republican era of control, delay and \nobstruction.\n  With today's confirmations of Mr. Conner to the Federal district \ncourts in Pennsylvania, the Senate will have confirmed 49 district \ncourt nominees, meaning that more than 8 percent of the district court \nnominees confirmed so far are from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nChristopher Conner to be U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.\n  I have enjoyed looking over the record of Mr. Conner's broad \nlitigation background, and I have concluded that he will bring to the \nbench the necessary legal experience and temperament for an effective \nFederal judge.\n  Christopher Conner is a native of Harrisburg, PA, and a highly \nrespected civil litigator. Upon graduation from Dickinson School of Law \nin 1982, Mr. Conner joined the Harrisburg firm today known as Mette, \nEvans and Woodside. He was named a shareholder in 1988.\n  He currently serves as chair of his firm's Corporate & Commercial \nLitigation Practice Group. His practice has focused on civil \nlitigation, primarily business litigation, employment law, mediation, \nand Federal civil rights litigation. He has handled contract disputes, \nemployment discrimination suits, Lanham Act claims, large-scale class-\naction cases, sexual harassment cases, and insurance coverage matters.\n  Mr. Conner is certified as a mediator in Federal and State courts, \nand he has experience in providing human resources training for \nbusinesses and associations, including diversity training.\n  The ABA has awarded him a unanimous Well Qualified rating, and I rate \nhim highly as well. I strongly believe Mr. Conner will make an \nexcellent Federal judge in Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senate last voted on the issue of medical \nmalpractice back in 1995. It was an amendment I offered at that \nparticular time. There were 53 votes in support of the amendment, \nincluding Senators Feinstein and Lieberman on the Democratic side who \nare still Members of the Senate. In addition, Senator Nunn, Senator \nExon, and Senator Jeffords also supported that medical malpractice \namendment back in 1995, which was, as I said, the last time we had a \nvote on this issue.\n  I will briefly describe what the amendment at the desk would do, and \nthen I want to talk for a few minutes about the growing crisis. I know \nSenator Hatch is anxious to speak on judges, but I do want to at least \ndescribe what the amendment does and make a few observations about the \ngrowing crisis in the country.\n  First, let me make it clear that the amendment at the desk is pro-\nvictim and pro-consumer. This amendment does not cap noneconomic--that \nis, pain and suffering--damages at all, not one penny. So compensatory \ndamages--economic as well as pain and suffering--those kinds of damages \nare not\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\nin any way adversely impacted by a cap under the McConnell amendment.\n  We do place reasonable caps on lawyers' fees. By doing so, it ensures \nthat the injured victim, not the victim's lawyer, gets the majority of \nthe award. After all, that is only fair. It is the victim who has \nsuffered the injury and not the lawyer.\n  This amendment also allows punitive damages, even though we know, all \nof us who understand punitive damages, that they are not designed to \nenrich the plaintiff but, rather, to punish the defendant. We allow \npunitive damages under a cap, a reasonable limit of twice compensatory \ndamages. So no limits on compensation for pain and suffering, but a \nlimit on punitive damages of twice compensatory damages, twice the \neconomic and noneconomic damages.\n  Essentially, what we are doing is guaranteeing the injured victim \nfull compensation. In addition to guaranteeing the injured victim full \ncompensation, we are also ensuring that they get more of the money to \nwhich they are entitled by providing a reasonable cap on the fee for \nthe lawyer. In order to bring some certainty to the system and drive \nthe costs of insurance down, the amendment caps punitive damages at \ntwice the sum of the compensatory damages awarded. It provides some \ncertainty. This is a very pro-victim, pro-consumer amendment.\n  When we voted on this back in 1995, one of the arguments made, I \nrecall, was that there was no crisis, what is the problem? Frankly, we \nthought it was a growing crisis at that point. Today, it is a perfectly \napparent crisis. The Nevada Governor has called a special session \nbeginning Monday on this very issue. This crisis is sweeping the \ncountry.\n  We have a map that I think is useful. The red States are States that \nare currently experiencing a medical liability crisis; States such as \nNevada that I mentioned, the State of Washington, the States of Oregon, \nTexas, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, and the cluster in the \nNortheast--New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. My own \nState of Kentucky is a State with problem signs.\n  To give an example, we have doctors moving to Indiana, across the \nOhio River, because Indiana has reasonable caps on recovery, and \ntherefore they do not have a medical malpractice crisis and the doctors \nare not bailing out. In States that have enacted a reasonable approach, \nthe crisis does not exist.\n  Another interesting chart gives a sense of what has happened since we \nlast voted on this issue in 1995. The median jury award then was around \n$500,000; today it has gone up to $1 million. I don't think anybody \nbelieves that doctors and nurses and health care professionals are any \nmore negligent today than they were then. I don't suppose anyone would \nsuggest there has been some kind of dramatic deterioration in their \nbehavior over the last 7 years, but in fact the awards have gone up \ndramatically, and of course, as we know, the insurance rates along with \nit, leading to an exodus from this field across America. The crisis has \narrived. It is here.\n  To give an example from my own State, a few weeks ago in Corbin, KY, \nthe Corbin Family Health Center was forced to shut the doors because \nthe doctors were unable to find an affordable insurance policy. Dr. \nRichard Carter and his four colleagues deliver about 250 babies a year \nand have never lost a malpractice claim. Yet when their insurance \ncompany, the St. Paul Companies, decided to leave the medical \nmalpractice business, the Corbin Family Health Doctors lost their \ncoverage--a group that had never lost a claim. The remaining few \ninsurance companies that were willing to provide coverage were only \nwilling to do so for $800,000 to $1 million, a whooping 465 percent \nincrease.\n  This is going on all across America. Tuesday we will have an \nopportunity to elaborate. There are a number of Senators on my side of \nthe aisle who want to speak to this national crisis.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment has nothing to do with the \nprice of prescription drugs, the cost of health care, or even the \ninsurance premiums of doctors. It has everything to do with the profits \nof the insurance industry. At a time when Americans want greater \ncorporate accountability, in this time of Enron, WorldCom, and other \ncorporate scandals, it is unbelievable that our Republican friends cozy \nup to big insurance corporations to give them a break.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the legislation before the Senate is \nabout the high price of prescription drugs and providing a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. Now the Republican side is trying to divert \nattention from this important debate by offering this amendment. It is \nan attack on the very people the underlying legislation was designed to \nhelp, those in need of quality medical care.\n  The McConnell amendment is designed to shield health care providers \nfrom the basic accountability for the care they provide. While those \nacross the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real beneficiaries \nwill be the insurance companies. This amendment enriches the insurance \nindustry at the expense of the most seriously injured patients--men and \nwomen and children whose entire lives have been devastated by medical \nnegligence and corporate abuse. This proposal also shields HMOs that \nfail to provide needed care, drug companies with medicine that has \ntoxic side effects, and manufacturers of defective medical equipment.\n  In recent months, the entire Nation has been focused on the need for \ngreater corporate accountability. The McConnell amendment does the \nreverse. It dramatically limits the financial responsibility of the \nentire health care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm \nthey have suffered. When will the Republican Party start worrying about \ninjured patients and stop trying to shield big business from the \nconsequences of its wrongdoing? Less accountability will never lead to \nbetter health care.\n  This amendment places major new restrictions on the right of \nseriously injured patients to recover fair compensation for their \ninjuries. These restrictions only serve to hurt those patients who have \nsuffered the most severe, life-altering injuries, and to have their \ncases proven in court. If we were to arbitrarily restrict the \ncompensation which seriously injured patients can receive, as the \nsponsor proposes, what benefits would result? Certainly, less \naccountability for health care providers will never improve the quality \nof health care. It will never even result in less costly care.\n  The cost of medical malpractice premiums constitutes less than two-\nthirds of 1 percent. Do we understand that? The cost of medical \nmalpractice premiums constitutes two-thirds of 1 percent of the \nNation's health care expenditures each year. Malpractice premiums are \nnot the cause of the high rate of medical inflation.\n  Over the decade from 1988 to 1998, the cost of medical care rose 13 \ntimes faster than the cost of malpractice insurance. This chart \nreflects that: The growth of health care costs plus 74 percent; and the \nmedical malpractice costs, 5.7 percent.\n  These restrictions are not only unfair to patients but an effective \nway to control medical malpractice claims. There is scant evidence to \nsupport the claim that enacting limits will lower insurance rates. \nThere is substantial evidence to the contrary. There are other much \nmore direct, effective ways to address the costs of medical malpractice \ninsurance that do not hurt patients.\n\n  The supporters of the McConnell amendment have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. They cite a report released just \nyesterday by the Department of Health and Human Services. However, that \ndata is neither comprehensive or persuasive. It looks at only 10 of the \n27 States that do not currently have a cap on malpractice damages, and \nit looks at the rate of increase in those States for only 1 year. In \nessence, that report cherry-picks the data to support a politically \npreordained conclusion.\n  Let's look at the facts: 23 States currently have a cap on medical \nmalpractice damages. Most have had those statutes for a substantial \nnumber of years. And 27 States do not have a cap on malpractice \ndamages. The best evidence of whether such caps affect the cost of \nmalpractice insurance is to compare the rates in those two groups of \nStates. Based on the data of medical\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nliability monitored on all 50 States, the average liability premium in \n2001 for doctors practicing internal medicine was slightly less, 2.2 \npercent for doctors in States without caps on malpractice, $7,715; and \nin States with caps on damages, $7,887. Internists actually pay more \nfor malpractice insurance in the States that have the caps.\n  The average liability premium in 2001 for general surgeons was also \nslightly less. For doctors in States without caps, $26,144; in States \nwith caps, it was $26,746. Surgeons are also paying more in States that \nhave caps.\n  The average liability premium on OB/GYN physicians in 2001 was only \n3.3 percent more for doctors in States without caps, $44,485; and \nStates with caps, $43,000--a very small difference.\n  This evidence clearly demonstrates that capping malpractice damages \ndoes not benefit the doctors it purports to help. Their rates remain \nvirtually the same. It only helps the insurance companies earn bigger \nprofits.\n  This chart over here indicates the States without the cap on damages, \nStates with a cap on damages. I think the proof is in the pudding.\n  Since malpractice premiums are not affected by the imposition of caps \non recovery, it stands to reason that the availability of physicians \ndoes not differ between States that have caps and the States that do \nnot. Do we understand that? We are talking about comparing the number \nof available physicians between the States that do have caps and the \nStates that do not. AMA data show that there are 233 physicians per \n100,000 residents in States that do not have medical malpractice caps \nand 223 physicians per 100,000 residents in States with caps.\n  Looking at the particularly high cost of obstetrics and gynecology, \nStates without caps have 29 OB/GYNs per 100,000 while States with caps \nhave 27.4 per 100,000. Clearly, there is no correlation.\n  California, the State that has the lowest caps the longest, set a \n$250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in the mid-1970s, which has not \nbeen adjusted for inflation since. If the tort reformers are correct, \nyou would expect California to have had a smaller percent of growth in \npremiums since those caps were enacted. Between 1991 and 2000, premiums \nin California actually grew more quickly, 3.5 percent, than did the \npremiums nationwide.\n  The State with the caps shows the malpractice insurance actually went \nup.\n  If this amendment were to pass, it would sacrifice fair compensation \nfor injured patients in a vain attempt to reduce medical malpractice \npremiums. Doctors would not get the relief they are seeking. Only the \ninsurance companies, which created recent market's instability, would \nbenefit.\n  Even supporters of the industry acknowledge that enacting tort reform \nwill not produce lower insurance premiums.\n  Sherman Joyce, the president of the American Tort Reform Association, \ntold the Liability Week publication:\n\n       We wouldn't tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort \n     reform would be to reduce insurance rates.\n\n  This is the president of the American Tort Reform Association, \ntelling Liability Week:\n\n       We wouldn't tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort \n     reform would be to reduce insurance rates.\n\n  Victor Schwartz, the association's general counsel, told Business \nInsurance:\n\n       . . . many tort reform advocates do not contend that \n     restricting litigation will lower insurance rates and ``I've \n     never said that in 30 years.''\n\n  The American Insurance Association even released a statement earlier \nthis year, March 13, 2002, acknowledging:\n\n       [T]he insurance industry never promised that tort reform \n     would achieve specific premium savings.\n\n  Listen to that. The American Insurance Association even released the \nstatement on March 13:\n\n       [T he insurance industry never promised that tort reform \n     would achieve specific premium savings.\n\n  A National Association of Insurance Commissioners study shows that in \n2000, the latest year for which data is available, total insurance \nindustry profits as a percentage of premiums for medical malpractice \ninsurance was nearly twice as high--13.6 percent--as overall casualty \nand property insurance profits--7.9 percent.\n  Do we understand that now? The insurance industry commissioners are \nnow saying that the insurance industry profits, as a percentage of \npremiums for medical malpractice, are twice as high as overall casualty \nand property insurance profits.\n\n  In fact, malpractice was a very lucrative line of insurance for the \nindustry throughout the 1990s. Recent premium increases have been an \nattempt to maintain high profit margins despite sharply declining \ninvestment earnings.\n  Insurance industry practices are responsible for the sudden, dramatic \npremium increases which have occurred in some States in recent months. \nThe explanation for these premium spikes can be found, not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves. There have been substantial increases \nin recent months in a number of insurance lines, not just medical \nmalpractice. In 2001, rates for small commercial accounts have gone up \n21 percent, rates for midsize commercial accounts have gone up 32 \npercent, and rates for large commercial accounts have gone up 36 \npercent. These increases were attributable to general economic factors \nand industry practices, not medical liability tort law.\n  Insurers make much of their money from investment income. During the \ntime when investments offer a high profit, companies compete fiercely \nwith one another for market share. They often do so by underpricing \ntheir plans and insuring poor risks. When investment income dries up \nbecause interest rates fall, the stock market declines, or cumulative \nprice cuts lower profit, the insurance industry then attempts to \nincrease its premiums and reduce its coverage. This is a familiar cycle \nwhich produces a manufactured crisis each time their investments turn \ndownward.\n  For example, St. Paul, one of the largest medical malpractice \ninsurers, which has been experiencing serious financial difficulties \nlately, actually released $1.1 billion in reserves between 1992 and \n1997 to enhance its bottom line and make those dollars available for \ninvestment. Some of the company's investments did not go well. It lost \n$108 million in the collapse of Enron alone. When claims became due, \nthose reserves were not available to pay them.\n  A recent study of the Consumer Federation of America, presented at a \nhearing of the Health Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and \nCommerce last week, documented this industry's trend:\n\n       It is the hard insurance market and the insurance \n     industry's own business practices that are largely to blame \n     for the rate shock that physicians have experienced in recent \n     months.\n\n  The Consumer Federation's findings are highly enlightening:\n\n       Medical malpractice rates are not rising in a vacuum. \n     Commercial insurance rates are rising overall. The rate \n     problem is caused by the classic turn in the economic cycle \n     of the industry, sped up--but not caused--by terrorist \n     attacks. Insurers have underpriced malpractice premiums over \n     the last decade. It would take a 50 percent hike to increase \n     inflation-adjusted rates to the same level as 10 years ago. \n     Further limiting patients' right to sue for medical injuries \n     would have virtually no impact on lowering overall health \n     care costs. Medical malpractice insurance costs as a \n     proportion of the national health spending are minuscule, \n     amounting to less than 60 cents per hundred dollars spent. \n     Insurer losses for medical malpractice have risen slowly in \n     the last decade by just over the rate of inflation. \n     Malpractice claims have not exploded in the last decade. \n     Closed claims, which include claims where no payout was \n     made, have remained constant, while paid claims have \n     averaged just over $110,000. Medical malpractice \n     profitability over the last decade has been excellent, at \n     just over 12 percent per year despite a decline in profits \n     in the last 2 years.\n\n  That is the profit they have been making over the last decade.\n  This analysis of why we are seeing a sudden spike in premiums was \nbasically confirmed by a June 24, 2002, Wall Street Journal article \ndescribing what happened to the malpractice insurance industry during \nthe 1990s:\n\n       Some of these carriers rushed into malpractice coverage \n     because an accounting practice widely used in the industry \n     made the area seem more profitable in the early 1990s than it \n     really was.\n\n  Does that have a ring to it, Mr. President? Carriers rushing in \nbecause an accounting practice widely used in\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\nthe industry made the area seem more profitable in the early 1990s than \nit really was? And now we are going to take it out on the individuals \nwho are most vulnerable and most severely hurt in our society?\n\n       A decade of shortsighted price slashing led to industry \n     losses of nearly $3 billion last year.\n\n  I continue the quote from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       I don't like to hear insurance company executives say it's \n     the tort system--it's self-inflicted--says Donald Zuk, chief \n     executive of SCPIE Holdings, Inc., a leading malpractice \n     insurer in California.\n\n  This is what he said:\n\n       I don't like to hear insurance companies say it's the tort \n     system--it's self-inflicted. . . .\n\n  Zuk then continues:\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       The losses were exacerbated by carriers' declining \n     investment returns. Some insurers had come to expect that big \n     gains in the 1990s from their bond and stock portfolios would \n     continue, industry officials say. When the bull market \n     stalled in 2000, investment gains that had patched over \n     inadequate premium rates disappeared.\n\n  Let's look back at the type of severely injured patients who would be \ndenied fair compensation under the McConnell amendment. These are the \npeople who are being asked by those across the aisle to pay for the \nmismanagement of the insurance industry and the wrongdoing of health \ncare providers:\n  Leyda Uuam--from Massachusetts--underwent surgery to correct a \nprotruding belly button when she was 5 weeks old. Leyda will never \nwalk, talk, move, or have any normal function after she suffered brain \ninjury due to a series of errors by anesthesiologists, nurses, and a \ntransport team.\n  When Mrs. Oliveira's unborn baby showed fetal distress her doctor \nfailed to perform a timely caesarean birth as common sense would \nindicate. Instead, he attempted a forceps delivery. When this didn't \nwork, he made three attempts at vacuum extraction, which were also \nunsuccessful. A different physician then attempted a second forceps \ndelivery, which also failed. Finally, Olivera underwent a caesarean \nsection, yet her son died within an hour of his birth. An autopsy \nreport identified the cause of death asphyxia. The hospital, in an \nattempt to cover its negligence, amended the report falsely, listing \nthe cause of death as probably fetal sepsis.\n  Twelve year-old Steven Olsen is blind and brain damaged today because \nof medical negligence. When he was hiking, he fell on a stick in the \nwoods. The hospital refused his parents' request for a CAT scan, and \ninstead pumped Steven full of steroids and sent him home with a growing \nbrain abscess. The next day, Steven Olson became comatose and wound up \nback in the hospital. Had he received the $800 CAT scan, which would \nhave detected the brain mass growing in his skull, Steven would be \nperfectly healthy today. The jury awarded Steven $7.1 million in non-\neconomic damages for his life-sentencing of serious illness and \ndisability.\n  Harry Jordan, as man from Long Beach, underwent surgery to remove a \ncancerous kidney. The surgeon took out his healthy kidney instead. \nJordan had been living for years on 10 percent kidney function, and he \nis now no longer able to work.\n  Elizabeth, a former fashion model, went to the emergency room \ncomplaining of nausea, vomiting, and ``the worse headache of her \nlife.'' The doctor misdiagnosed her as having an acute neck sprain and \nsent her home. Unfortunately, he failed to diagnose her symptoms as the \nwarning leak of a brain aneurysm even though he had written a textbook \nwhich included an entire chapter on warning leaks. Ten days after her \nhospital visit, Elizabeth's aneurysm ruptured and she had a stroke. The \nbleeding destroyed brain tissue, requiring the removal of \\1/3\\ of the \nfrontal lobe of her brain. Elizabeth was left paralyzed as a result of \nher misdagnosed aneurysm.\n  Philip Lucy's nasal cancer was misdiagnosed by doctors as high blood \npressure and nerve damage for 2 years, although he continued to \ncomplain of pain. It was finally discovered that his left sinus was \ncompletely filled with a cancerous mass. This necessitated the removal \nof his left palate, left cheek, left orbit and his left eye.\n  LeVern Dostal, a recent retiree, died a slow and painful death after \nher surgeon failed to give her antibiotics before her gallbladder \nsurgery. She developed sepsis and was hospitalized for a lengthy period \nof time, during which she underwent 3 more surgeries, as her condition \nslowly deteriorated.\n  Ms. Keck, 63, was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. She \nsustained brain injuries because a nurse failed to monitor her oxygen \nlevel as instructed, and failed to notify the doctors of her worsening \ncondition. She now suffers from paralysis and cannot speak. The \nhospital was purposefully understaffed to increase profits.\n  As we debate this amendment, let us all remember that we are dealing \nwith people's lives--many of them have suffered life-altering injuries \nas a result of substandard medical care. The law is there to protect \nthem, not to shield those who caused their injuries.\n  I hope the Senate will not accept the McConnell amendment for the \nreasons I have outlined. As we have seen on so many different \noccasions, the neediest, the youngest, and the most vulnerable \nindividuals in our society are often those who suffer the greatest \nkinds of neglect and negligence.\n  If we are going to have accountability in our society, we ought to \nhave accountability.\n  One of the extraordinary things I heard was yesterday during the \nPresident's statement in North Carolina when he talked about \naccountability by victims, but not accountability by the insurance \ncompanies and not accountability by the others--not accountability by \nothers even in the corporate world but accountability by \nschoolchildren. If they are not able to learn and be successful, then \nthey are not included in terms of the completion of their studies. And \nnow they are being held accountable. We are not getting the resources \nfor them in order to give them the fair chance.\n  It seems to me we are being asked to protect the strongest elements \nin terms of our society. We have seen that during the course of this \nwhole debate. Now we see it with regard to an amendment to protect the \ninsurance companies. When we look at any piece of legislation, we \nshould ask: Who is going to benefit, and who is going to lose? The \nanswer is very simple with this amendment. The people who are going to \nbenefit are going to be the insurance companies themselves, and the \npeople who are going to pay the price are going to be our most \nvulnerable in our society who need our protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the speech \nof my good friend from Massachusetts, although I must say that it must \nhave been drafted to address a different amendment other than the one \nthe Senator from Kentucky sent to the desk. None of the victims that \nSenator Kennedy recounted would have lost a penny of economic or \nnoneconomic damages under the amendment that is at the desk--not a \npenny. We don't cap either pain and suffering, or economic damages. \nThere is no cap at all.\n  I did not hear my friend from Massachusetts talk about the legal \nfees.\n  Let us go back and take a look at what this amendment does before \nyielding to my friend, the only doctor in the Senate, to address this \nissue.\n  This is a pro-victim amendment. There are no caps on economic and \nnoneconomic damages in this amendment. Two things are capped: Punitive \ndamages, which are designed to punish the defendant and not enrich the \nplaintiff, are capped at twice the rest of the damages. There is a very \nreasonable cap on attorney's fees. And the reason for that is the \nplaintiffs--the victims--the senior Senator from Massachusetts is \ntalking about are only getting about 52 percent of the money. Those \ngrievously injured parties are not getting enough of the awards.\n  Let us in this debate talk about the amendment that is before us--not \nthe amendment that might have been before us.\n  The AMA supports the amendment--frankly, somewhat tepidly. They would \nlike to go further. But the AMA does support my amendment. Obviously, \nthey think it would make a difference in being able to continue to \nprovide health care for our American citizens.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer would make needed reforms to \nmedical malpractice litigation.\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n  There are few challenges facing this body that are more complex than \nimproving the quality and affordability of health care in America. This \nweek, we will have debated competing proposals to expand Medicare and \ncreate a prescription drug benefit. Over the past year, the Senate has \npassed legislation to strengthen our Nation's defenses against the \nthreat of bioterrorism and provide new resources to the researchers at \nthe National Institutes of Health, NIH. While all of these proposals \nare worthy of this body's consideration, the Senate has not yet \naddressed one of the fundamental problems limiting the accessability \nand affordability of quality care: reforming our Nation's flawed \nmedical malpractice system.\n  These reforms are essential to ensuring that quality health care is \navailable and affordable to all Americans. After all, what good is a \nMedicare drug benefit if you can't find a doctor to write a \nprescription or a pharmacist to fill it? Our current medical \nmalpractice system encourages excessive litigation, drives up costs, \nand literally scares care-givers out of the medical profession. All too \noften, these lawsuits result in exorbitant judgements that benefit \npersonal injury lawyers more than they compensate injured patients.\n  Enacting reasonable medical malpractice reforms will reduce health \ncare costs and improve access to care, while allowing legitimate \nvictims full access to the courts. My amendment would take a modest, \nbut important, first step at reforming this flawed medical malpractice \nsystem in a manner which I believe will attract significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I have long championed strong, medical malpractice reform \nlegislation. I believe debate on the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act, provides us not only the opportunity, but the \nobligation, to enact meaningful malpractice reforms.\n  Much like the issue of a Medicare drug benefit, medical malpractice \nreform is not a new topic for the Senate. During debate on the Product \nLiability Fairness Act of 1995, I offered an amendment to enact \nreasonable reforms to our Nation's medical malpractice laws. After \ndebating the amendment for several days, I was proud to have the \nsupport of 53 Senators and my amendment was agreed to by the Senate. \nAmong those 53 supporters were some prominent Democrats and \nIndependents: Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, Jeffords, Nunn and Exon.\n  Today I offer the same amendment the Senate agreed to in 1995. For \nthe benefit of my colleagues who have joined the Senate since we last \ndebated this issue, my amendment would do the following: The McConnell \namendment would limit punitive damages to two times the sum of \ncompensatory damages, economic and non-economic. This provision would \nhelp end the litigation lottery, where punitive damages are awarded out \nof all proportion to the underlying conduct. The threat of being \nunreasonably held responsible for millions and millions of dollars in \ndamages hangs like the sword of Damocles over the heads of our medical \nprofessionals.\n  My amendment would eliminate joint liability for non-economic and \npunitive damages. As a result, defendants would only be liable for \ntheir own proportionate share for the harm that occurred. It is unfair \nfor an injured person to be found 99 percent liable for his injury, and \nhis doctor to responsible for only 1 percent, yet the doctor has to pay \nfor all of the damages.\n  The amendment places modest limits on attorneys' contingency fees in \nmedical malpractice cases. Specifically, the amendment would only allow \npersonal injury lawyers to collect 33 percent of the first $150,000 of \nan award and 25 percent of the award on all amounts above $150,000.\n  My amendment encourages States to develop alternative dispute \nresolutions mechanisms to help resolve disputes before they go to \ncourt.\n  As I noted earlier, the amendment I offer today is the same one that \nthe Senate agreed to in 1995. Unfortunately, as we all know, it is \nimpossible to pass contentious legislation in this body without the 60 \nvotes necessary to invoke cloture. Therefore, in the interests of \npreventing a filibuster against the larger product liability bill, I \nwithdrew my medical malpractice amendment, and it has never been signed \ninto law.\n  In 1995, the Senate considered our medical malpractice system to be \nso flawed that it required the Federal Government to enact these exact \nreforms. In the period since then, the system has gotten dramatically \nworse, not better.\n  I might not be so passionate about enacting medical malpractice \nreforms if these lawsuits were an accurate mechanism for compensating \npatients who had been truly harmed by negligent doctors. Unfortunately, \nthe data shows just the opposite. In 1996, researchers at the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health performed a study of 51 malpractice cases which \nwas published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In approximately \nhalf of those cases, the patient had not even been harmed, yet in many \ninstances the doctor settled the matter out of court, presumably just \nto rid themselves of the nuisance. In the report's conclusion, the \nresearchers found that, ``there was no association between the \noccurrence of an adverse event due to negligence or an adverse event of \nany type and payment.'' In everyday terms, this means that the \npatient's injury had no relation to whether or not they received \npayment in their malpractice case.\n  While the research showing that litigation's effectiveness at \ncompensating the injured hasn't stopped the personal injury lawyers \nfrom rushing to the courthouse to file more lawsuits, the jackpots in \nthe personal injury lawyers' litigation lottery have increased \ndramatically since we considered this issue in 1995. As my first chart \nshows, the Jury Verdict Research Service reports that the median award \nmade by a jury has more than doubled since 1996, from $474,000 to \n$1,000,000 in 2000. Not surprisingly, the increase in jury awards has \nled to a similar increase in the dollar value of settlements reached \nout of court. Since 1995, the median settlement has increased from \n$350,000 to $500,000 in 2000.\n  These escalating settlements might make one wonder, ``Are our \ndoctors, nurses and hospitals twice as negligent as they were just 6 \nyears ago?'' The answer is, of course, no: the doctors haven't gotten \nworse, but the system has. In fact, plaintiffs only won 38 percent of \nthe medical malpractice claims that went to trial, essentially the same \nas it was in 1995, 35 percent.\n  I think this bears repeating. In 1995, the Senate considered our \nmedical malpractice system to be so flawed that it required the federal \ngovernment to enact limits on the contingency fees charged by personal \ninjury lawyers and punitive damages. In the period since then, the \nsystem has gotten worse, not better.\n  This litigation explosion is manifested in the premiums which doctors \npay for their malpractice insurance. In the 7 years since we last \ndebated medical malpractice reform on the Senate floor, doctors on Main \nStreet USA have seen dramatic increases in their insurance premiums. \nSince 1995, obstetricans, OB-GYN's, have seen their premiums increase \nan average of almost 12 percent a year, each and every year. The same \nis true for the general surgeons who have seen their malpractice \npremiums increase 13 percent each year. Let me be perfectly clear, I am \nnot talking about a thirteen percent increase over seven years, these \npremiums are increasing 13 percent EVERY year.\n  This may make people wonder, ``Why should I care about how much \ndoctors pay for malpractice insurance premiums?'' The answer is access. \nDoctors are less likely to provide those services for which they are \nlikely to be sued.\n  This is particularly true in rural areas of this Nation. While many \ndoctors are willing to set up practices in rural areas, they cannot \nforgo malpractice insurance. Therefore, many doctors are forced to \nestablish practices in more urban and suburban areas where they can \nearn the fees necessary to cover their malpractice premiums.\n  This has certainly been the case in Kentucky this year. Just a few \nweeks ago, the Corbin Family Health Center in Corbin, KY was forced to \nshut its doors because its doctors were unable to find an affordable \ninsurance policy. Dr. Richard Carter and his four colleagues at Corbin \nFamily Health deliver about 250 babies a year and have never lost a \nmalpractice claim. Yet\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nwhen their insurance company, The St. Paul Cos., decided to leave the \nmedical malpractice business, Corbin Family Health's doctors lost their \ncoverage. The remaining few insurance companies that were willing to \nprovide coverage will only do so for $800,000 to $1 million a whopping \n465 percent increase.\n  This is a tragedy. Fifty of the clinic's patients are due to give \nbirth in the next 2 months, and 130 more are due by the end of this \nyear.\n  Fortunately for the families of Corbin, KY, the clinic's doctors were \nable to secure coverage last week, and the clinic reopened. However, \ntheir premium is twice what they paid previously. In addressing his \nclinic's predicament, the clinic's director, Steven Sartori, noted, \n``Even though you're relieved, it's not over because this malpractice \nproblem is not going to go away . . . There's more doctors who are \ngoing to be in the same predicament I was in.''\n  This problem is not limited to Kentucky. On July 1 of this year, \nAtmore Community Hospital in Atmore, AL, was forced to close its \nobstetrics program because it could not afford the 282 percent increase \nin malpractice insurance from $23,000 to $88,000. Now, expecting \nmothers must travel either to the hospital in Brewton, AL, 30 miles \naway, or to the big city hospitals in Mobile or Pensacola. That's more \nthan an hour and a half drive.\n  Nor is the problem limited to the South. The administrators at Copper \nQueen Community Hospital in Brisbee, AZ were recently forced to close \ntheir maternity ward because their family practitioners were looking at \na 500 percent premium increase. Expectant mothers must now travel more \nthan 60 miles to the closest hospital in Sierra Vista or Tucson. \nAccording to a recent article in Forbes magazine, four women have since \ndelivered babies en route.\n  In New Jersey, the director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Holy Name \nHospital was forced to lay off six employees from his practice when his \nmalpractice premiums doubled. He told the New York Times ``The issue \nis, we can't stay open. It's going to restrict access to care. It's \ngoing to change the way OB is delivered to the population, and they're \nnot going to like it.''\n  While our flawed medical malpractice system may be hitting \nobstetricians particularly hard, it is negatively impacting nearly \nevery aspect of the medical profession. Many radiologists in Georgia \nare no longer reading mammograms, Atlanta Business Chronicle, 6/21/\n2002, because of the liability associated with the service. These \nlifesaving mammograms may only make up 5 percent of a radiologist's \npractice, but are responsible for a whopping 75 percent of their \ninsurance liability. Officials at Memorial Hospital and Manor in \nBainbridge, GA faced a staggering 600 percent increase in premiums \ndespite a ``nearly spotless claims history,'' Modern Healthcare, 4/1/\n2002.\n  However, no one should be fooled into thinking that this medical \nmalpractice crisis is limited to the small hospitals of rural America. \nPerhaps the most publicized case involves the closure of the trauma \nunit at the University of Nevada Medical Center, UMC. Trauma centers \nare frequently referred to as ``super emergency rooms'' because they \nare staffed with highly trained surgeons and specialists who are \nqualified to treat the highest risk cases. Nearly all of the highly \nskilled surgeons and orthopedists who worked in the UMC unit decided \nthey could no longer risk the liability exposure and resigned. UMC's \ndirector Dr. John Fildes explained that, ``We want to be here, that's \nthe sad thing. These physicians want to take care of patients, but they \nare withdrawing from high-risk activities to protect their families and \nlivelihoods'', Washington Post 7/4/2002.\n  What does the closing of UMC's Trauma Center mean to the people of \nsouthern Nevada? It means that those patients who are most seriously \ninjured in car accidents must either be treated at less prepared \nemergency rooms or transferred out of state to the nearest trauma \ncenter. Fortunately, UMC has reached a temporary arrangement that will \nallow the unit to re-open by classifying its physicians as State \nemployees for the next 45 days.\n  Pennsylvania has faced a similar crisis. I would like to read from a \nrecent article that appeared in the Allentown Morning Call:\n  Thomas DiBenedetto is a marked man.\n  He feels the bull's-eye on his back every time someone is wheeled \ninto Lehigh Valley Hospital's emergency room with broken, mangled \nbones.\n  It's his job to put people back together. DiBenedetto is an \northopedic surgeon in the Level One trauma center, and he loves what he \ndoes. Or, at least, he did.\n  Large medical malpractice awards and increasingly litigious patients \nhave made it difficult for him to enjoy the job he's been doing for 13 \nyears. He has been sued four times.\n  He won all four cases. Yet, his malpractice insurance costs this year \nwent up nearly a third, to $44,000. Even though his record is clean, he \nexpects the bill to continue to climb.\n  Now, I am tempted to take issue with the AMA's finding in that I \nthink some of these States have crossed the line from having serious \nproblems to being in a crisis. I know how bad the situation is in \nKentucky, and I think Kentucky ought to be listed as a crisis State. I \nnoted the closure of the Corbin Family Health Center earlier, and we \nsee daily reports of how Kentucky physicians are packing their medical \nbags and heading to Indiana, which has more reasonable tort laws.\n  For those doctors who choose to stick with the profession they love, \nthey will inevitably be forced to pass these higher malpractice costs \nalong to consumers in the form of higher fees. Several years ago the \nHudson Institute conducted a study in which it estimated that liability \ncosts added $450 to the cost of each patient admission to a hospital \nand accounted for 5.3 percent of their medical expenditures. In 1994, \nthe Towers-Perrin Research firm estimated that malpractice expenses \nadded $12.7 billion to the cost of health care in America. To put that \ninto terms many Senators can understand, that is more money that \nMedicare spent on nursing home care in 1994 and almost as much as was \nspent on the Medicare Home Health benefit. I don't think anyone would \nargue that these dollars would be better spent improving patient care \nrather than lining the pockets of the personal injury lawyers.\n  I will be the first person to admit that the reforms I propose today \nare modest. As many of my colleagues know, I have authored even \nstronger reforms contained in free-standing legislation, the Common \nSense Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 2001. Our Nation's health care \nis staring down the barrel of a medical malpractice crisis, and it must \nbe addressed soon. Therefore, I have chosen to offer this amendment \nwhich the Senate already agreed to in 1995. At its heart, this \namendment merely assures that patients, not personal injury lawyers, \nreceive the vast majority of any jury award or settlement. By \nestablishing proportional liability, the amendment ensures that damages \nare paid by those parties who actually inflict the harm. I believe \nthese are common sense steps the Senate can take to address, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the \nonly physician in the Senate who is well versed on this issue. I yield \n20 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: As I understand it, \nwe have a time agreement in terms of the allocation of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under a time agreement. The time is \nlimited and under the control of the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we were trying to go back and \nforth. I know the Senator has to leave. I don't know what the Senator's \ntime limitation is. Could he take 7 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a time constraint. I have been on \nthe floor since last night waiting to make my opening statement.\n  I would be happy to yield 3 minutes, if the Senator has to make an \nairplane or something.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want the record very clear--then we are \nnot going from side to side? I thought we were going from side to side. \nI withdraw that.\n  (Laughter)\n  Senator McConnell had two speeches.\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n  We have followed the side-to-side rule. Now we are making it clear \nthat on this legislation we no longer have to follow it. If that is the \nway it is going to be--we have respected that since the start of this \ndebate. This is the first time I have been on the floor for 7 days that \nwe have not done that.\n\n  I am prepared to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time has been used by each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has used 23 \nminutes. The Senator from Kentucky has used 11 minutes.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to change the topic and focus where \nI believe the impact is most being felt today. It really has not been \ndiscussed on the floor thus far; and that is, at the level of the \ndoctor-patient relationship, at the level where care is actually \ndelivered. We heard a lot about the budget numbers and the insurance \ncompanies and the like, but what I would like to do is focus on where \nthe impact actually is.\n  Yesterday, I was at a hospital, not as a physician, but I was there \nwith someone in my family. I was in an emergency room 2 nights ago and \nthen yesterday. Again, I was not there as a doctor or as a U.S. \nSenator. It was a local hospital, George Washington University \nHospital.\n  On a side table, I picked up a newsletter. Again, it was not intended \nfor me. The newsletter is called the ``GW Medicine Notes.'' I have it \nin my hand. It is written by their medical staff for their medical \nstaff and, I guess, for people in the hospital. The letter is from the \nchairman, Dr. Alan G. Wasserman. The whole front page really tells the \nstory that much of the debate will be about today and on Tuesday.\n  I will open with just one sentence or two sentences from this letter, \nagain not intended for me, but to really express the sentiment, the \nimpact of what is happening all across America because what we are \nseeing today is, indeed, a crisis.\n  The words, again, from Dr. Wasserman, in what is called the ``GW \nMedicine Notes,'' a monthly publication of GW, the George Washington \nDepartment of Medicine:\n  What we have is a runaway train that isn't stopping. The malpractice \nproblem is not just a physician problem. It is beginning to affect the \nability of patients to get proper care in a timely manner.\n  I may refer back to this letter because I found it fascinating, \nsitting there yesterday waiting for an MRI scan, just to see the \nsentiment that patients are actually being hurt. When I saw the words: \n``What we have is a runaway train that isn't stopping,'' the imagery, I \nthink, is very appropriate.\n  We cannot do little things. This train is barreling through, and \npatients are being hurt. Forget all the rhetoric, the dollars and \ncents, the bad insurance companies and the profits. Patients are being \nhurt by the current tort system that we have in effect today. The good \nnews is, there is something we can do about it, and it starts right \nhere with the McConnell amendment that is on the floor today.\n  I want my colleagues to listen very carefully. I hope, in the \nexpanded reach, people are listening, because we have an opportunity, \nin this amendment, to improve patient care, and to reverse this runaway \ntrain, which is hurting patients today.\n  How can I say so definitively that patients are being hurt? You can \nlook in the media. You can go into hospitals. I encourage everybody to \nask their doctor. The next time you see your doctor or see a nurse or \ngo into a hospital or interact with your health care system, just ask: \nWhat are these malpractice premiums doing?\n  We will talk a little bit about why premiums are going up.\n  What is being said around the country? Pick up the newspaper any day \nall across the country. Allentown, PA; Beckley, WV; New York, NY; \nKansas City, KS; Jackson, MS.\n  Jackson, MS, November 23, 2001:\n\n       Costs Lead Rural Doctors to Drop Obstetrics.\n\n  That is because of the cost of the malpractice insurance. OB/GYNs are \nrefusing to deliver babies and are dropping obstetrics.\n  Allentown, PA:\n\n       CARE CRISIS: Malpractice premiums crippling doctors. The \n     emergency has stricken physicians in southeastern \n     Pennsylvania, forcing some to leave their practices and \n     patients behind.\n\n  Beckley, WV:\n\n       The situation may be more acute in West Virginia than \n     anyplace else, but doctors across the board and around the \n     country are facing double-digit hikes in malpractice \n     premiums, something many hadn't seen since the 1980s.\n\n  Kansas City, KA:\n\n       Insurance rates reach crisis level for doctors. Some \n     physicians have been forced to leave practices.\n\n  Again, we are talking about access to health care and costs of health \ncare.\n  Dayton, OH:\n\n       WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE CRISIS LOOMS. . . . Rising malpractice \n     premiums may force some doctors to stop delivering babies.\n\n  Buffalo, NY:\n\n       Soaring costs of medical malpractice insurance have caused \n     fears among doctors that they will be forced to either quit \n     their profession or practice in another state.\n\n  We all recognize this problem. I think both sides are going to state, \nagain and again, that medical liability insurance premiums are \nskyrocketing. Why? The facts are there. We know it. We see it. Our \nphysicians tell us why. We can look at what our insurance companies are \nhaving to charge today. The question is, why?\n  Medical liability claims and damage awards are exploding, and when \nthey explode, that ends up being translated into increased premiums. \nPeople think those increased premiums are paid for by the doctor. When \nthe doctor pays $50,000 or $100,000 in malpractice insurance, it is not \nreally paid by the doctor, because the doctor is going to pass that \nstraight back to the patients.\n  When you go to a doctor for a particular procedure part of that \nprocedure is going just to buy the insurance. These costs ultimately \nincrease premiums. First of all, increased jury awards increase \npremiums. They are eventually passed back to the patient.\n  We saw a chart earlier today. Let me just show it again. It is not \njust in George Washington Hospital, where I happened to find this \nnewsletter and talked to the doctors and nurses there, and not just at \nVanderbilt but all throughout the local and national medical community. \nThe problem is all over the United States of America.\n  This is from the AMA. Basically, it outlines, in red, those States \nthat are in crisis. You can see, it is not just on the east coast, and \nit is not just in the South, and it is not just in the Northwest. Shown \nin red are States in crisis: New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Nevada, and \nWashington. Shown in yellow, including my home State, are States with \nproblem signs. As these rates increase 15, 16, 17 percent, sometimes 20 \npercent, sometimes 30 percent, they will force more states into the \nred, unless we act.\n  The end product of all this, all those articles, the end product of \nthe newsletter--this is what is circulating in hospitals and clinics \nall over the United States of America--is that patients are suffering.\n  Why do I say that? No. 1, access to care. It is not just a matter of \nthe costs, but it is access to care. If you are in a motor vehicle \naccident and you need a trauma center, we have seen trauma centers \nclose because of these escalating, out-of-sight, skyrocketing premiums, \nwhich no longer can be tolerated. If you are one of those individuals \nwho needs that care, the access is not there, and you are going to be \nhurt.\n  If you need an obstetrician--in many ways, it is a woman's issue--and \nyour former gynecologist-obstetrician is one who gave up that interest \nin delivering babies because the malpractice insurance was so high, \nyour access to obstetrics care, the delivery of babies, and the \nprenatal and perinatal care all of a sudden disappears.\n  Why? Ask your obstetrician. It is because the malpractice insurance \nhas gone sky-high, from $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 up \nto $150,000, and it can no longer be sustained over time.\n  So physicians are dropping services. They have no choice. They are \nmoving away from procedures that have a higher challenge rate because \nof the risk of the procedures. But if you are one who needs that \nprocedure, you suffer from a lack of access to care. Those procedures \nthat are a little bit higher\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\nrisk, physicians are beginning to leave and not do them.\n\n  We have had letters read about malpractice insurance. All of us \nunderstand that malpractice insurance needs to be addressed. It is the \nonly way to improve the system itself. Malpractice does occur. There is \nnothing in the McConnell amendment that in any way lowers the standards \non malpractice. You will have the other side reading a whole series of \nletters from people who have been injured. And as the Senator from \nKentucky pointed out, there is nothing in his amendment that lowers the \nstandards in any way in addressing true malpractice.\n  My colleagues who are physicians are now demanding action by \nCongress. Why? Because they took that Hippocratic oath to take care of \npatients, to do no harm. To illustrate this runaway train concept that \nDr. Wasserman mentioned in his newsletter, things are at a crisis, we \nhave level 1 trauma centers closing. Thank goodness they are not \nclosing permanently but closing for this very reason--not for a whole \nbroad range of reasons of cost increases but for this very reason--the \nhigh costs of liability insurance.\n  A level 1 trauma center is a big deal. It is not just an emergency \nroom, and emergency rooms are terribly important, but it is not just an \nemergency room that sutures cuts or takes care of serious headaches. \nThis is where you go if you are in a severe motor vehicle accident, \nhave severe head trauma, multiple injuries, bleeding in the abdomen. \nThis is where you go where you have trained specialists 24 hours a day \nto save your life. That is what a level 1 trauma center is.\n  The only level 1 trauma center facility at the University of Nevada \nMedical Center closed on July 3 after 57 orthopedic surgeons basically \nresigned because medical malpractice insurance rates made it too costly \nfor them to treat high-risk patients.\n  Luckily, fortunately, the trauma center reopened when the surgeons \nagreed to return for at least 45 days. People can look at that case and \nsay it was for this reason or that. The bottom line is, we have a group \nof people in a community who took an oath to take care of patients, but \nbasically said this is such a severe, fast-moving, heavy, runaway train \nthat we can't sustain what we do professionally because of this crisis.\n  This particular trauma center is one of the 10 busiest in the country \nand is the only one in Las Vegas. When it closed, the nearest trauma \ncenter was roughly an hour and 20 minutes away.\n  Therefore, when we talk dollars and cents and insurance companies \nmaking money, we need to address all of that. But let's recognize that \nwe have to fix the system which has now gotten so bad, so severe that \npremiums are skyrocketing. That increase is passed on to patients. \nPatients cannot afford increases in health care costs. We have known \nthat for a long time.\n  Now what is happening, the actual care expected by the American \npeople and that the American people deserve is less available. We call \nit less access. But whether it is a trauma center closing, whether it \nis a woman who wants to keep her obstetrician, but the obstetrician \nsays he can't afford to keep delivering babies because of these \npremiums, because of these excessive lawsuits, these frivolous lawsuits \ntoday, he can't afford his old specialty that he was trained to do. \nThen there is the third component of access. You have physicians \nleaving parts of the country. Basically, some parts of the country, \nthese red areas where you have this crisis level, malpractice insurance \nhas gotten so high that a physician can either quit--and they are doing \nthat; they have no choice. Ask your physicians.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In response to his observation, what is happening in \nmy State is they are going across the river to Indiana which, as you \nwill note, is a State which has modest caps on recovery; therefore, \naffordable rates.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. He is exactly right. We \nhave people moving from a yellow State, such as Kentucky, to a white \nState. The white means States that are currently OK. You see \nCalifornia. I will come back to California and comment on that. We have \npeople from Mississippi, that already has fewer physicians, moving up \nto Tennessee. And who knows, they may end up moving to Wisconsin or \nIndiana or out to California for the same reason.\n  What is important, in response to the Senator from Kentucky's \nquestion, is that physicians are making decisions not on places they \neither like to practice to deliver the care they are trained to do, but \nnow they are making decisions because of this exorbitant, runaway \ntrain. It is almost like a litigation lottery, malpractice lawsuit \npremiums that they are having to pay. They tell you that. That is the \nreason they are moving.\n  So we have the cost issue. We have the specialty issue. We have \nphysicians changing specialties, not because of their individual \npractice, what kind of care they are giving, but because the premiums \nare that higher for obstetricians versus gynecologists. Obstetricians \ndeliver the baby; the gynecologists takes care of many other women's \nissues. Then you have the geographic movement to other States.\n  There is a reason for all of this. It is a litigation problem. We \nneed to fix the problem, and it can be fixed. The numbers are \nstaggering. Between 1995 and the year 2000, the average injury award \njumped over a 5-year period more than 70 percent to $3.5 million. That \nis the average. More than half of all injury awards today top $1 \nmillion of all the awards. The payouts aren't the only problem.\n  Simply defending a malpractice claim, whatever the claim is, is more \nthan $20,000, whether or not the doctor is at fault or the hospital is \nat fault. So there is an incentive through these exorbitant contingency \nfees where the trial lawyers, the personal injury lawyers, may make 40 \npercent. If there is a jury award, the trial lawyer, the personal \ninjury lawyer gets 40 percent of the cut. Thus the personal injury \nlawyer has the incentive, the economic incentive to go out and engage \nin lawsuits, in frivolous lawsuits.\n  Each one of those which comes forward, no matter what, just to defend \ncosts at least $20,000. In 2001, physicians in many States saw their \nliability premiums for these frivolous lawsuits, excessive lawsuits \nthat go to the millions and millions of dollars, with the trial lawyers \ntaking off 40 percent--and Senator McConnell's amendment addresses this \ncontingency fee very directly to put some sort of control on the \nincentive that trial lawyers have to dig up these cases, then the \nphysicians, because of the tremendous cost, whether the case is \nfrivolous or not, they tell their insurance company to settle the case. \nThey don't want to be tied up in a court. They want to deliver care. \nThat is what physicians are trained to do. That is what they are \nobligated to do.\n  The solution: Intelligent, reasonable tort reform, sensible reform \nwith fair and equitable compensation for those negligently injured. \nCalifornia has addressed this. Hopefully, over the next several days or \nhours we will address their experience. We have seen California put \nvery reasonable controls and caps and incentives addressing things \nbroadly, and they have been able to control their costs. So we know it \ncan be done.\n  I see my time is about over. I look forward to coming back Monday to \ntalk a little bit more about this issue. The bottom line is, the \nMcConnell amendment will help patients. That is what it is about. \nPatients are suffering today. We know sensible tort reform works. We \nhave seen it in California, in those States that have been progressive \nenough to do that. Now we have a duty to make sure these red States \nbecome yellow States and eventually become white States where we don't \nhave this crisis today.\n  Sensible tort reform works. Let's act now to protect patients, their \naccessibility to quality care, the premiums that physicians have to pay \nwhich are ultimately translated down to cost to that individual \npatient.\n  I urge support of the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. He has a unique \nperspective as the only physician in the Senate for lending his voice \nto this most important cause. I might say to my friend, to those on the \nother side of the aisle, we may or may not win Tuesday morning, but \nthis is not going\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\naway. We will be back, and we will some day address this problem \nbecause it is a national problem. Some on the other side will argue for \nStates rights, which I always find interesting coming from very liberal \nMembers of the Senate, that somehow this is not a Federal problem. I \nintend to outline in my full remarks exactly why it is a national \nproblem and can only be corrected at the national level. I thank my \nfriend for his outstanding comments this morning and look forward to \ncontinued discussion next week.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Kentucky to allow me \nto enter three sentences in the Record, and then I will close.\n  First, I thank the Senator for his comments. This does give us an \nopportunity to point to the fact that this is a national crisis that \nhas to be addressed. We have an obligation to address this crisis.\n  Dr. Frank Boehm, who is a good friend of mine, writes a newspaper \narticle in the Nashville Tennessean. Though I do not have one of his \narticles, he keeps a really good feel of what is going on around the \nState of Tennessee and around the country and is also one of the \npreeminent high-risk obstetrical doctors in the United States of \nAmerica. I communicated with him the other day.\n  I close with two or three sentences of what he said. He sees a lot of \nthese high-risk cases coming through and reviews a lot of cases. He \nsays:\n\n       What this has taught me is that doctors, hospitals and \n     nurses are being sued in large numbers, in large part because \n     of the possibility of a settlement or trial judgment of a \n     large amount of money.\n\n  Then he talks about some of the things we can do, many of which are \nin the underlying McConnell amendment.\n  He closes with this:\n       Doctors need tort reform and so do our patients. With many \n     physicians leaving States to practice elsewhere, or just \n     closing up shop, patients are suffering from a lack of access \n     to medical care in many parts of our country.\n\n  That was in an e-mail in response to my question of what is the lay \nof the land.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee \nparticularly for his fine observation. There has been an effort on the \npart of some--and I am sure we will hear it again Tuesday--to say this \nis about insurance companies. This is not about insurance companies. It \nis about doctors, and it is about patients.\n  The AMA does support the McConnell amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter indicating their support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                 Chicago, Illinois, July 25, 2002.\n     Re Medical Liability Reform Amendment\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) commends you for your leadership and initiative in \n     offering an amendment to S. 812 (``Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001'') that would bring \n     several common-sense reforms to our nation's broken medical \n     liability litigation system.\n       Many states in our nation are experiencing an emerging \n     medical liability insurance crisis. Due to large jury awards \n     and the burgeoning costs of defending against lawsuits \n     (including frivolous claims), medical liability insurance \n     premiums are skyrocketing. In many cases, physicians are \n     finding that liability insurance is no longer available or \n     affordable. The media now reports on almost a daily basis \n     that the situation has become so critical in some states that \n     physicians are forced to limit services, retire early, or \n     move to another state where the medical liability system is \n     more stable.\n       The most troubling aspect of our unrestrained medical \n     liability system is the effect on patients. Access to care is \n     seriously threatened in states such as Florida, Mississippi, \n     Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \n     Texas, Washington, and West Virginia. In other states, \n     including Kentucky, a crisis is looming. Emergency \n     departments are losing staff and scaling back certain \n     services such as trauma care. Many OB/GYN's have stopped \n     delivering babies, and some advanced and high-risk procedures \n     are being postponed because surgeons cannot find or afford \n     insurance.\n       Your amendment includes key building blocks to effective \n     reforms, such as allowing injured patients unlimited economic \n     damages (e.g., past and future medical expenses, loss of past \n     and future earnings, cost of domestic services, etc.), \n     establishing a ``fair share'' rule that allocates damage \n     awards fairly and in proportion to a party's degree of fault, \n     preventing double recovery of damages, allowing periodic \n     payment of future damages, and preventing excessive attorney \n     contingent fees (thereby maximizing the recovery of \n     patients).\n       In addition to these necessary reforms, we urge you to \n     include a reasonable limit of $250,000 for non-economic \n     (e.g., pain and suffering) damage awards, while allowing \n     states the flexibility to establish or maintain their own \n     laws limiting damage awards that have proven effective as \n     stabilizing the medical liability insurance market. Multiple \n     studies have shown that a limit on non-economic damages is \n     the most effective reform to contain run-away medical \n     liability costs. Such reform has also been proven effective \n     at the state level. We also urge you to include a reasonable \n     cap on punitive damages, such as the greater of 2 times \n     economic damages or $250,000.\n       By enacting meaningful medical liability reforms, Congress \n     has the opportunity to increase access to medical services, \n     eliminate much of the need for medical treatment motivated \n     primarily as a precaution against lawsuits, improve the \n     patient-physician relationship, help prevent avoidable \n     patient injury, improve patient safety, and curb the single \n     most wasteful use of precious health care dollars--the costs, \n     both financial and emotional, of health care liability \n     litigation.\n       The proposals in your amendment are an important step in \n     the right direction to strengthen our health care system. The \n     AMA looks forward to working with you regarding a reasonable \n     reform on non-economic damages.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Michael D. Maves, MD, MBA.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio in the \nChamber. I will be happy to yield him such time as he may need.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, about 10 minutes will do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today as a Senator from a State \nthat is on the edge of becoming one of those red areas on that national \nmap. This Senator does not want his State to become one of those red \nStates. I rise in strong support of Senator McConnell's medical \nliability amendment.\n  The litigation tornado that continues to sweep the Nation does not \nseem to be losing strength. In fact, at the rate lawsuits continue to \nbe filed, the only entity that stands to lose strength is our economy.\n  The cost of malpractice insurance has had an enormous impact on the \nrising costs of health care and the cost of health care insurance to \nthe extent that more and more of my constituents are complaining that \nthe cost of insurance is so high that they can no longer afford to buy \nit.\n  In particular, the effect of rampant litigation has really had a \ndisastrous impact on the health care industry. When a pharmaceutical \ncompany decides not to develop and produce a new drug because the cost \nof possible litigation could erase any profit, who really loses?\n  When physicians choose not to perform certain procedures, such as \ndelivering babies, because malpractice insurance rates are too high, \nwho loses?\n  Even worse, when a physician stops practicing medicine because he or \nshe no longer can afford the insurance premiums or is so fearful of \nmalpractice being filed against them, who loses?\n  Recently, the American Medical Association released an analysis which \nfound that medical liability has reached crisis proportion--I \nunderscore ``crisis proportion''--in 12 States. One of those 12 States \nis Ohio.\n  In addition, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the \nACOG, issued a red alert and warned that without State and Federal \nreforms, chronic problems in the Nation's medical liability system \ncould severely jeopardize the availability of physicians to deliver \nbabies in the United States of America.\n  The good news for Ohioans is that Ohio did not make the ACOG's list \nof nine hot States, those in which a liability insurance crisis \ncurrently threatens the number of physicians available to deliver \nbabies.\n  The bad news is that Ohio is only one step short of that mark. It is \none of three States where a crisis is brewing. In fact, signs of the \ncrisis are already beginning to show.\n  Currently, in Hancock County in northwest Ohio, they have only one \nphysician to deliver babies. Think about it, a county with a population \nof\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\nover 70,000 people has 1 physician to deliver babies. He has indicated \nthat if his insurance premiums continue to climb at the current rate, \nhe will have to close up shop.\n  That sounds like a crisis to me, and I am sure it sounds like a \ncrisis to the women in Hancock County who need someone there to deliver \ntheir babies.\n  I believe this amendment that Senator McConnell has before us gets us \non our way to enacting meaningful medical liability reform. It limits \nattorney's fees so that the money awarded in court goes to the injured \nparties, who are the people who really need the money. It also allows \nphysicians to pay any large judgments against them over a period of \ntime to avoid bankruptcy and requires all parties to participate in \nalternative dispute resolution proceedings, such as mediation or \narbitration, before going to court. It limits punitive damages to twice \nthe sum of compensatory damages. These are all reasonable limitations.\n\n  One of the growing areas in the legal profession is mediation and \narbitration. In fact, the Michael Moritz School of Law at Ohio State \nUniversity, of which I am a graduate, is one of the leaders of that \ninitiative in the legal profession.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, I joined the chief justice of the \nsupreme court and wrote to all the businesses in our State encouraging \nthem to agree to a mediation and arbitration in order to reduce \nlitigation costs and, frankly, improve the economic environment in our \nState.\n  Why shouldn't we do this in medical malpractice cases? Doesn't it \nmake sense? Providing a commonsense approach to our medical liability \nproblems is certainly a win-win situation. Patients would not have to \ngive away large portions of their judgments to their attorneys and \nphysicians could focus on doing what they do best: practicing medicine \nand providing health care.\n  I know there are differences of opinion about how to approach this, \nbut we do have a crisis in this country. If those who are opposed to \nSenator McConnell's amendment are concerned about this problem, then it \nwould serve us well to sit down and figure out some way we can address \nthis problem. We need to do it now, not tomorrow, not next month. I can \ntell you, if we do not do something about this problem, we are going to \nsee more and more people in this country do without medical care. We \nare going to see a lot more of our physicians dropping out of the \npractice of medicine. And we truly will have something we never \nexperienced in this great country, and that is a health care crisis.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back any time to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio, who \nrepresents one of those red States in crisis, for his important \ncontribution to this debate. I thank him so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Frist be allowed \nto control the remainder of the time we have for the morning on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 50 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. FRIST. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I mentioned in comments a few minutes ago \nthe fact that I was in the hospital yesterday and two nights ago with a \nfamily member and I will go there in a few minutes. Being there as a \npatient's family is a different perspective than being there as a \nphysician or Senator.\n  As one walks those halls and sees people working hard, day in and day \nout, 24 hours a day, as one watches the shift change at 7 or 8 at \nnight, fresh people coming in and starting, and see physicians coming \nin at 9, 10 at night, starting early in the morning, seeing the \nemergency room and trauma centers going on around-the-clock, when one \nsees that and recognizes that we can do something that will make that \nbetter when the trends, especially in the last 3 to 4 years, are \ngetting worse, it makes one feel very passionately about that.\n  When I see doctors leaving the practice of medicine for this reason, \nthese exorbitant, skyrocketing, out of control--this runaway train \nwhich I mentioned earlier, such good imagery--it makes me want to \npassionately come to this body and make sure that people understand, \nmake sure that my colleagues understand, that physicians are leaving \nthe practice of medicine because of these exorbitant malpractice suits.\n  A physician who gets up every morning to take care of patients who \ncome through that door is being charged $100,000 not for what they do \nbut to cover the legal system and these out-of-control malpractice \nsuits, which I will say are in many cases driven by the trial lawyers, \nthere is no question in my mind, and if you talk to people broadly they \nwill say lawyers have the incentive.\n  When one sees that happening and sees that patients are going to \nsuffer, they want to act. That is what this McConnell amendment allows \nus to do, to do something that does not solve the problem; it does not \ngo as far as I want to go. As the Senator from Kentucky said, does not \ngo so far as the American Medical Association, which represents so many \ntens of thousands of doctors, would go, but it is a first step. It puts \nthe issue back on the table, and we ought to talk about this issue in \nthis body.\n  It has been 7 years since we have actually addressed this issue, an \nissue that patients are being hurt by, that is driving physicians out \nof the practice of medicine, that is driving physicians from Kentucky \nto Indiana, from Mississippi to Tennessee, out of New York City, out of \nNew York, out of Texas, out of Florida, that is driving the price of \nhealth care up unnecessarily. It is unnecessary. In fact, it is hurting \npatients unnecessarily; it is not helping patients.\n  If there is malpractice, there needs to be appropriate punishment. \nThere needs to be appropriate economic compensation. It needs to be \nfair. It needs to be equitable. But these skyrocketing lawsuits, many \nof them frivolous, need to be brought under some sort of moderation and \nsome sort of control.\n  I mentioned that Dr. Wasserman, who is chairman of the Department of \nMedicine at George Washington University, who is in the hospital \nworking right now--we did not even really talk about this specifically \nin any detail, but in the newsletter that I quoted earlier, which is \npretty good reflection of what is going on in every hospital around the \ncountry, it is important for my colleagues to know that sentiment.\n  In that same newsletter, I read one sentence earlier saying that what \nwe are facing, in terms of this lack of tort reform, a medical \nliability crisis being a runaway train, a beautiful analogy. He said, \nand I quote from the second paragraph of the letter:\n\n       Malpractice rates are increasing at a rapid rate across \n     this nation. Insurance companies are going out of business, \n     refusing to write new policies, or raising rates 50 to 200 \n     percent.\n  People say, why? Some say it is the bad insurance companies that are \nmaking profits and taking advantage of people broadly, and that is \nwhere the problem is. Well, I disagree. It may be part of the problem \nthat may need to be addressed, but the fundamental problem is the \nfrivolous lawsuits, with no sort of restraint, with out-of-control \nincentives for the personal injury lawyers to take a 40 percent cut, to \nincrease the number of cases, to bring these suits, again with no \nlimits, no caps, not a $100,000 cap, a $500,000 cap, a $1 million cap, \n$5 million cap or $10 million--it does not matter what it is, they take \naway 40 percent of whatever it is so they are going to drive it high.\n  The McConnell amendment stops short of what I would really like to \ndo, and it does not have any sort of limitation of payments. It looks \nat limits on attorney's fees, establishes proportional liability, looks \nat both scopes, such as collateral service reform, which we will be \nable to talk about, but it is a good first step.\n  Dr. Wasserman, in his newsletter--and this will be the last time I \nwill quote from it, but it captures it--says: Be patient. There is a \ncoming crisis. Already, there is a shortage of physicians in certain \nmedical specialties in certain areas. Do not try to have a baby in Las \nVegas. There are no obstetricians. Try to find a rheumatologist\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nin Florida in the winter with less than a 3-month wait.\n  At some point, this will be politically important when more people \nare denied immediate access to health care, and then maybe change will \ncome.\n  That hurts me in many ways, because it basically says we do not have \nthe guts to face an issue that is not just dollars and cents and \nprofits and all of this class warfare that we hear about, but an issue \nthat is hurting patients, where the patients suffer.\n  The example is right before our eyes, and I do not see how we cannot \naddress it. The example I mentioned earlier in the great State of \nNevada, where physicians actually had to close down a trauma center, a \nlevel-1 trauma center, which is sophisticated care that can be \ndelivered adequately in no other way, and if you are in that automobile \naccident, your care is in jeopardy. It does not have to be this way if \nwe can pass this amendment, continue the discussion, again, hopefully \nimprove and strengthen this amendment in the future.\n  This is not going to go away. It is getting worse. It is getting \nworse before our eyes. We last talked about it on this floor 7 years \nago. This is the first time since then. That is inexcusable. I \nmentioned the level 1 trauma center having to close, leaving patients \nfor that period of time if they were in an accident having to go an \nadditional hour and a half for proper care.\n  Let's look at the obstetricians and gynecologists. Again, as I \nmentioned earlier, an obstetrician/gynecologist is trained to do \ngynecology, women's health issues. An obstetrician's practice is to \ndeliver babies. It is a good example because as these doctors' \ninsurance premiums go sky high, and when they go sky high, the \nobstetricians are saying: I cannot deliver babies anymore. I am going \nto change to the field of gynecology.\n  Then the mom, who has been going to that obstetrician for 5 years, 10 \nyears or 15 years, goes to see their physician who says: I am not \ndelivering babies anymore, and the reason I am not is because I cannot \nafford that malpractice insurance. So then all of a sudden there is \nthis problem with access to care affecting the individual. We talked a \nlittle bit about costs; we talked about physicians moving.\n  I again ask women all over this country to ask their obstetrician \nwhat is happening to obstetrics care today because of malpractice \ninsurance.\n  Nationwide, 1 out of 10 OB/GYNs no longer deliver babies because of \nthis high cost of liability insurance. Obstetricians are not just \ngeographically moving but are leaving the practice altogether. Again, I \ncan say that. I can go to a hospital and say that. I can say that as a \nSenator and as a physician. The best thing is for people to talk to \ntheir obstetricians and ask how this malpractice insurance impacts on \nthem.\n  Earlier today we heard some comments about insurance companies, and I \nthink on Tuesday we will have the opportunity to come back to that as \nwell. Much of my focus is on the individual patient and on the impact \non the practice of medicine, which is very real. I do want to at least \nintroduce the fact that these insurance companies, many of which are \nnot-for-profit in the sense that they are mutual funds--and I will use \nthe example of the State Volunteer Mutual Insurance Company in \nTennessee. It is owned by the physicians in Tennessee.\n  Again, it is not a red State yet. It is on the verge of being a \ncrisis State. Eighty percent of the physicians in Tennessee come \ntogether and have a mutual insurance company because they can have the \ninput and they can try to keep the rates down in the very best way \npossible.\n  I will read from a letter, and I ask unanimous consent to have this \nprinted in the Record, dated July 25, from the State Volunteer Mutual \nInsurance Company.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                     State Volunteer Mutual Insurance Company,\n\n                              Brentwood, Tennessee, July 25, 2002.\n     Hon. William H. Frist, MD,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing to urge you to support \n     tort reform legislation currently being considered by the \n     Congress.\n       According to recent news reports, doctors and hospitals in \n     a number of states are currently facing a true crisis in the \n     cost and availability of professional liability insurance. \n     These states include West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, \n     Florida, Nevada and Mississippi and several other states. \n     Access to patient care in those states is being adversely \n     impacted, especially in the area of pre-natal and obstetrical \n     care.\n       While our situation in Tennessee has not yet reached the \n     crisis experienced in those states, there are many \n     indications that our state could well face the same sort of \n     problems in coming years if we do not act now to make some \n     changes in our civil justice system.\n       St. Paul Insurance Company, the nation's largest writer of \n     health care professional liability insurance, experienced \n     such losses that it announced last December that it was \n     completely withdrawing from the market, adversely affecting \n     tens of thousands of physicians who carried coverage with \n     that company, some of whom were in Tennessee.\n       Professional liability premiums for doctors in Tennessee \n     have been steadily rising in recent years. According to State \n     Volunteer Mutual Insurance Company, which covers most \n     practitioners in Tennessee, premiums have increased by 45 \n     percent over the past three years, in order to keep up with \n     rapidly escalating losses in medical malpractice lawsuits. \n     Only approximately 4 percent of this 45 percent increase was \n     related to lower investment yield, with the remainder being \n     due to increasing medical malpractice losses. State Volunteer \n     Mutual Insurance Company is a policyholder owned mutual \n     company with no outside investors.\n       In recent years both juries and judges in Tennessee have \n     made multi-million dollar awards for non-economic type \n     damages, over and above a plaintiff's actual economic \n     losses. (According to State Volunteer, in one recent case \n     a jury awarded only $25,000 in economic damages but \n     awarded non-economic damages of $1,600,000. Another case \n     resulted in a jury award of $100,000 economic loss and \n     $1,900,000 non-economic damages. A judge in another case \n     awarded $1,062,080 in economic loss and gave $4,500,000 \n     non-economic damages. Another judge awarded $687,691 \n     economic loss and gave $3,000,000 in non-economic damages. \n     One jury awarded $7,811 in economic loss but gave \n     $2,650,000 non-economic damages.)\n       Awards in personal injury and wrongful death cases in \n     Tennessee are dramatically increasing, according to the \n     latest statistical report of the state's Administrative \n     Office of the Courts. In fiscal year 2001, even though fewer \n     cases were disposed of in our courts than in the previous \n     year, damages awarded statewide were more than $94 million. \n     This represented an increase of more than $51 million over \n     the previous year. The total was the largest since the courts \n     began reporting these statistics. According to the same \n     report, the average award for fiscal year 2001 was $209,284, \n     up $95,064 from the previous year, the largest average since \n     awards have been reported.\n       Senator Frist, doctors and hospitals in Tennessee are \n     dedicated to providing excellent care to our state's \n     population but at a time when health care reimbursements are \n     shrinking, and professional inability costs are dramatically \n     increasing, doctors in Tennessee believe that the Congress \n     should enact some common sense tort reform that will preserve \n     citizens' access to health care and compensate them for their \n     actural economic damages caused by negligence, while \n     modifying the current system of unlimited liability that \n     doctors and other health care professionals and institutions \n     currently face. Reforms modeled after California's ``MICRA'' \n     law make sense to me. California passed legislation in 1975 \n     that helped solve a crisis in that state. It is my \n     understanding that key provisions in California's civil \n     justice reform included the following:\n       $250,000 cap on non-economic damages;\n       reasonable sliding scale for lawyers' contingency fees;\n       collateral source payment offsets;\n       periodic payment of future damages.\n       I believe similar reforms on a national basis will go far \n     toward alleviating the health care crisis now facing much of \n     the country and will help avoid such a crisis from coming to \n     pass in Tennessee.\n       Thank you for your attention and concern regarding this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steven C. Williams,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The State Volunteer Mutual Insurance Company is a \npolicyholder owned mutual company with no outside investors.\n  So I think they don't have a huge incentive to go out and gouge the \ncommunities or patients. It is mutually owned by physicians throughout \nthe State.\n  In the letter to me, I read further:\n\n       Senator Frist, doctors and hospitals in Tennessee are \n     dedicated to providing excellent care to our state's \n     population. But at a time when health care reimbursements are \n     shrinking, and professional liability costs are dramatically \n     increasing, doctors in Tennessee believe that Congress should \n     enact some common sense tort reform that will preserve \n     citizens' access to health care and compensate them for their \n     actual economic damages caused by negligence, while modifying \n     the current system of unlimited liability that doctors and \n     other health care professionals and institutions currently \n     face.\n\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\n\n  This letter was written by Steven C. Williams, president and CEO of \nthe insurance company, but also representing 80 percent of the \nphysicians in Tennessee, calling for sensible reform, for moderate \nreform, reform that does not go overboard. That is what the McConnell \nmedical malpractice amendment indeed does.\n  What is most important is what is happening to patients. Patients are \nsuffering under the current system. It is a runaway train. We all know \nit is a problem. We have seen it in Las Vegas at the trauma center. We \nsee it in various States. We go in our physician's offices and hear it. \nThe problem is getting worse. It is increasing in its impact and not \ngetting better. That is why we call for action now.\n  The Tennessee Medical Association, in a letter dated July 24, 2002, \nto me:\n\n       We have a storm brewing here in Tennessee. While the waves \n     are not yet crashing in on us, as in many states, including \n     our next-door-neighbor, Mississippi, it most certainly is \n     coming. Over the last two years, medical malpractice \n     insurance rates have gone up 32 percent.\n  Of additional concern is that in Tennessee there is a very clear \ntrend of increasing awards in medical malpractice cases. This, we \nbelieve, is fueled in large part by a growing public perception and \nenvironment that likens the courtroom to a casino where there appears \nto be no limit.\n\n  That was Michael A. McAdoo, president, Tennessee Medical Association.\n  The medical liability premiums are skyrocketing. It is because the \nmedical liability claims are exploding. It is because the awards are \nexploding. The problem is not limited to just the Northeast or the \nSoutheast. But as you can see from this map, the medical liability \ncrisis is all over the United States of America. It has to do with cost \nand access to care and physicians leaving their profession.\n  The response to what we do means we have to identify the underlying \nproblem and not just worry around the edges or tinker around the edges. \nI mentioned earlier, an average jury award over a 5-year period jumped \nmore than 70 percent on average. When more than half of all jury awards \ntop $1 million, we have this field of defensive medicine. That means \nphysicians in the emergency room that I was in two nights ago, \nattending to a patient, are going to err in going a little bit too far \nin terms of tests. Why? Because if that headache, which to your exam is \njust a routine frontal headache treatable by a doctor, if you do not \nget the CAT scan or MRI scan, the risk, although it is beyond the \nnormal bounds of routine accepted medical practice, a physician, a \nnurse, or a hospital is going to err on getting the expensive tests, \nalthough in your clinical judgment and using the practiced guidelines \nout there today, you do not need the tests. But you will get that \nseries of more expensive tests that unnecessary testing.\n\n  Again, the American people pay for it. Those costs are unnecessary. \nThey are there because of the fear of skyrocketing lawsuits, numbers of \nlawsuits, awards themselves. No one wants to be in that category. The \nbest protection is to get the range of tests, although you may think \nthey are unnecessary.\n  What is the effect on the doctor? In 2001, physicians in many States \nsaw their rates rise by 30 percent, and even more. That is just \nphysicians, generally. If you look at the specialists, such as \nobstetricians or possibly neurosurgeons or neonatal specialists, \nmalpractice insurance is rising by as much as 200 percent, and in some \ncases 300 percent.\n  In New York and in Florida, obstetricians--the ones who deliver \nbabies--gynecologists, and surgeons pay more than $100,000 for $1 \nmillion in coverage. That $100,000 they pay comes out of their pocket \ninitially, but for them to stay in business and continue what they do, \nthey take that $100,000 and pass it on to the people who are listening \nto me, the people all across America. That is why this issue is so \npowerful today.\n  People for the first time realize one doctor out there, who took an \noath to do no harm, to help patients, who trained 4 years in medical \nschool, a year in internship, 5 years in surgical residency, 2 years in \nspecialty training, and a year of fellowship, just to be able to help \npeople, are having to pay $100,000, not to help people, but to protect \nthemselves. That is absurd.\n  Ultimately, for them to stay in business it gets passed all the way \nback through the system to that individual patient. It may come in \ntaxes. It may come for those who do not have insurance, and pay retail, \nwho do not have any insurance when the overall prices in health care go \nup. If you do not have insurance, you are in trouble today because the \noverall price of health care has skyrocketed. This is an area where \nthrough commonsense tort reform we can lower this escalating cost of \nhealth care across the board.\n  For annual premiums, some doctors in Florida and New York pay, again, \nabove $100,000. That is one individual doctor. This is not a big \ncorporation that pays this. It is not a big hospital paying it. These \nare individual doctors paying this money so they can fulfill that \nHippocratic oath of doing no harm.\n  In Tennessee, which is not yet in the crisis mode, and is not \nconsidered to be in crisis, but it has problem signs today, the \npremiums rose 17.3 percent last year in 1 year. They will rise anywhere \nfrom 15 percent to 17 percent this year. What we need to do is ask why. \nIs there more malpractice today? Are physicians not as well trained \ntoday as they were a year ago, or 5 years ago, or 10 years ago? Are \nthey not using the tests appropriately today in order to take care of \npatients?\n\n  If so, we need to debate that issue and look at it and look at the \ndata that is out there.\n  No, I think the dynamics are because of frivolous lawsuits, because \nthe personal injury trial lawyers have a huge incentive, a huge \nfinancial incentive for themselves in order to bring cases forward, \nwhich puts physicians in a position where it is easier to settle these \ncases rather than to spend a year or 2 years, if you have the \ninsurance. So there is this huge settlement, even if you don't have \nmalpractice, even if you know that you are absolutely innocent. It is \neasier to settle for $1 million or $2 million so you can go back to the \npractice of medicine.\n  The system is broken, and it is getting worse.\n  Can it be fixed? Yes. The McConnell amendment makes a first step \nthere--intelligent, reasonable, balanced tort reform. It will help \naddress it, but it will not solve the entire problem. It is not going \nto make it go away, but I can tell you, it will help patients because \nthey will not have to be driven to the ranks of the uninsured; because \nthat obstetrician, with whom they have the first baby and second baby, \nwill not have left practice because of that malpractice insurance; \nbecause they will be able to see the neurosurgeon for their brain tumor \nin their region because he or she did not move from Texas to Wisconsin \nbecause of these exorbitant malpractice rates.\n  I mentioned earlier that today is different than 6 years ago when we \nlast addressed it. It is in a lot of different ways because the problem \nis getting worse. Ask the physicians, ask the people in the hospitals \nwho are working there every day. Read the newspaper, and you will see \nthat every newspaper is going to address this in a direct way. I think \nwe need to go back and look at hard data that is out there today, in \nterms of what certain States have done and been able to accomplish and \nwhat other States have tried, and learn from that.\n  In California there is what is called MICRA, which is the Medical \nInjury and Compensation Reform Act. It became law in the mid-1970s. It \nis a good example of what works. When you look at States, other big \nStates, you see a lot of them are in trouble. You see New York City is \nin trouble. If you are in New York City, talk to the physicians, talk \nto the medical community, ask them what has happened in terms of these \ntort issues recently.\n  Look at Pennsylvania; it is in trouble. Look at Florida, look at \nTexas, where there is trouble. This is California in white, meaning \nthey do not have a huge problem there. You do not hear it. I was in \nCalifornia this past weekend and probably talked to six or seven people \nin the medical profession at academic health care centers, and it is \nnot No. 1 on their list for reform because they say it is not a big \nissue there.\n  Why? In the 1970s, California passed MICRA--Medical Injury and \nCompensation Reform Act. California doctors and patients have been \nspared much of\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nthe medical liability crisis that we see across the country today. I \nthink it is a good surrogate measure, that California's premium, the \npremiums they are paying today, are among the lowest medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums in the country. MICRA is the reason.\n  I have used this example of obstetricians and gynecologists, so I \nwill keep going back to that. It is the reason that the obstetrician, \nthe one who delivers babies in California, may pay about $40,000 for \nmedical liability insurance where, if you took that same obstetrician--\nsame training, same medical school, had done the same number of \nprocedures, delivered the same number of babies--and you put them in, \nlet's say Florida or let's say New Jersey, or you put them in New York, \nthe premiums--here, say, $40,000 for that insurance--it will be above \n$100,000, maybe up as high as $150,000. The same person, same training, \nsame number of babies, same Hippocratic Oath--\"Do no harm''--here \npaying around $40,000; in these red States, paying upwards to $150,000.\n\n  My colleagues have to ask why, but more important, the American \npeople have to ask why. Is there less malpractice in California? I \ndon't think so. Better trained doctors in California? I don't think so. \nThe reason goes back to the tort system, the liability system.\n  In other States it has been allowed to run out of control, and that \nis why this McConnell amendment comes in. Again, we have not really \ntalked about all the things that are in the amendment. We will have the \nopportunity to do that. But that is why it is important to go back and \nlook at what is in the amendment. It doesn't go very far. It doesn't go \nfar enough for me or, I think, for most of my colleagues in the medical \nprofession.\n  But why does MICRA work? Why does this doctor with the same training \npay so much less than these other States?\n  Let's look at MICRA. What does MICRA do? This is not the McConnell \namendment. I don't want to confuse the two, but it shows what \ncommonsense reform in a State that was way ahead of the curve can \naccomplish. MICRA does limit attorney's contingency fees to a sliding \nfee scale. This allows the patient, when there is an award, to keep the \nmoney.\n  If it is malpractice and you are trying to compensate the patient, to \nhave the lawyer walk away with 40 percent of the money doesn't make \nsense to me. I don't think it makes sense to the American people once \nthey really understand that. With this limiting of how much the \nattorney can take out of what is sent home by the jury to the patient, \nby limiting that in some way, you have some element of control of this \nrunaway train which is hurting patients.\n  It is pretty simple. In my mind it is simple. If you look at how much \na lot of these personal injury trial lawyers make today, especially in \nthe environment where we are looking a lot more at the corporate world, \nthe numbers are incredible. Ask, if you take the top 50 personal injury \ntrial lawyers in America, what is their take? What do they make? The \nincentive is there.\n  If you are in the field of law, you would like to say, I am out just \nto save the world and do good. But when you take 40 percent of the take \nafter a multimillion malpractice injury--first of all, the patient \ndoesn't get it. That is who it is really about--or that is who it is \nabout in the medical profession. It needs to be about the patient. That \nis whom you take the oath to serve.\n  It is hard for me to understand how you could have the huge \ncontingency fees today when you hear physicians are leaving, they are \nnot taking care of patients, they are being forced to close down trauma \ncenters.\n  MICRA places a statute of limitations on bringing a suit 1 year from \ndiscovery or 3 years. This is the California law. This ensures that a \nsuit would be brought in a reasonable amount of time. It protects \nevidence, and it also keeps people from sort of searching in the bowels \nof a hospital or advertising for cases 5 years ago, or 20 years ago, or \n30 years ago. Again, malpractice occurs at a certain point in time, and \nwe need to punish it, and punish it hard. But to go out and stir up \nthese cases so you can be paid for it, I think is inappropriate.\n  What MICRA does--and again this is not in the McConnell legislation, \nand this I hope will come back to the floor again and again and again \nuntil we fix it--MICRA, California law, caps future noneconomic damages \nat $250,000. These are not the economic damages. There is full \ncompensation there. So, under MICRA, patients are fully compensated for \ntheir economic loss due to medical malpractice, and they are \ncompensated for lost wages, and they are compensated for the medical \ncare and the future costs of medical care.\n  I use California as an example because we have not talked about it on \nthe floor of the Senate. We haven't talked about it in committee, \nbecause this whole issue has not been addressed. The bottom line is you \ncan have reforms--which the majority of States do not have today, and \nthat is the reason there is a role for this body to act--because the \nproblem is well identified, and the problem is getting worse. The \nproblem has not been adequately addressed by States--California and a \nhandful of others have addressed it--so that we have an obligation to \nthe patients.\n  The reforms in California have helped the patients. Injured patients \nreceive a larger share of whatever award. If there is malpractice and \nthere is an award, the patient can walk--hopefully, can walk--home with \nmore of that award. In addition, these reforms have helped slow down \nthe overall rising cost of medicine.\n  There is no question in my mind that physicians are practicing \ndefensive medicine, which the physicians have to practice, and this \ndrives up the overall cost of health care today.\n  We talk a lot about prescription drugs, about the importance of \ngenerics, about the importance of coverage within Medicare, and about \nhaving a competitive system--all of which we hope will actually slow \ndown the skyrocketing costs of medical care today. Indeed, the cost of \nhealth care in California has been slowed by the slowing and the \nrestraining of these out-of-control, skyrocketing, runaway train costs \nin liability that other States have.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a time \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Does the Senator have an idea how much more time he will \ntake?\n  Mr. FRIST. Probably 5 minutes, and then I would be happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. STABENOW). Eighteen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, let me take a couple of minutes, and then \nI would be happy to sit down and look forward to the opportunity to \ntalk about all of this on Tuesday, which I believe is when we will come \nback to this.\n  The McConnell medical malpractice amendment does the following:\n  It limits punitive damages. It limits punitive damages to two times \nthe sum of what are called compensatory damages. Again, this gets sort \nof technical. We talk about economic damages and noneconomic damages. \nIt allows punitive damages in those cases where the award has been \nproven by clear evidence and by convincing evidence.\n  I mentioned attorney fees. I am critical of that because I don't \nunderstand in this day and time why personal injury trial lawyers walk \naway with so much money that has been awarded to the person who has \nbeen injured. But it does limit attorney fees.\n  The McConnell amendment places very modest limits on attorney's \ncontingency fees and medical malpractice cases. Specifically, the \namendment allows personal injury lawyers to collect 33 percent, or a \nthird, of a $150,000 award, and about $25 percent of the award on all \namounts above $150,000.\n  Again, that is pretty modest from my standpoint. The fact that an \naward to somebody who has been injured is $150,000, it was malpractice, \nand the fact that a trial lawyer will take away a third of that for \ntheir pocket, again, to me--that is what is in the amendment--that is \nan improvement over today. But, again, in the future I hope we come \nback and address that.\n  The statute of limitations--I mentioned California's law--the \namendment requires that a medical malpractice complaint must be filed \nwithin 2 years of discovering the injury and\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nthe cause. Again, that is when it should be filed.\n  The McConnell amendment is modest. It identifies the problem. It \ngives us the opportunity to talk about the problem on both sides of the \naisle. It does not include all of the measures I think are necessary to \naddress this problem eventually. But it is a good first step in the \nright direction.\n  We have evidence that reasonable tort reform--and we can debate what \nreasonable tort reform is. I think, again, the McConnell amendment is \nthe first step. It doesn't go quite far enough, but it is a good first \nstep.\n\n  We know that by addressing this we are going to hold down health care \ncosts which are skyrocketing. The premiums are going up 15 percent, 17 \npercent, and 20 percent--last year, this year and next year. That \ntranslates down to the patient. Those premiums are eventually going to \nbe passed down to the patient. To my mind, there is no question but \nthat we will put them in the ranks of the uninsured.\n  On the access issue, the McConnell amendment is a simple amendment. I \nam convinced. Ask your physician, if you have the opportunity over the \nweekend. I am absolutely convinced it will improve access when we know \nthat access overall is deteriorating.\n  We need to look at Las Vegas, and we need to look at the many \nexamples which are in newspapers all across the country of physicians \nleaving a specialty practice because of malpractice insurance, or \nleaving a State.\n  We have an opportunity to do something which protects patients and \nwhich improves their access and clearly stops the deteriorating access \nto quality care before this problem gets worse.\n  I urge support of this amendment and look forward to coming back to \nit over the next several days.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Let me say, first, from the discussion that we have been having all \nover America, and on the floor of the Senate for the last few weeks \nabout trying to reinsert some responsibility and accountability because \nof the fundamental notion we believe in this country that everybody--\nevery person, every company, big business, small business, and \neverybody in America--should be responsible and accountable for what \nthey do, one of the reasons we have had such a downslide in Wall Street \nlately is people have lost confidence in the responsibility of people \nwho run some--I emphasize ``some''--of the companies that have been on \nthe front pages of the newspapers for the last several months. What \nthey want us to do is reimpose some of that corporate responsibility. \nSo we work very hard on that.\n  At a time when the focus is on trying to make sure we have real \nresponsibility and real accountability in this country, the President \nyesterday went to my home State to do exactly the opposite. The \nPresident went to North Carolina to say: I am going to side with big \ninsurance companies and against victims. I am going to say if a child \nwho has been severely hurt as a result of bad care is trying to get \nsome help for him and his family over a long period of time, I am going \nto put a limit on that. I am going to put a limit for a very simple \nreason: The big insurance companies of America will have to pay.\n  Unfortunately, there is a pattern with this administration. Every \ntime they have a choice between the interests of average Americans, \nkids, families, and people who do not have lobbyists in Washington, DC, \nrepresenting them, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the \ninterests of big HMOs, big oil companies, big energy companies, the \ndrug industry, the pharmaceutical drug industry, and big insurance \nindustry in this case--whenever those interests come into conflict with \nthe interests of ordinary Americans, this administration consistently \nsides with the big interests. They have done it on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  They have prevented us from having a real and meaningful Patients' \nBill of Rights. While we try to protect families and patients, they \nside with the big HMOs. I think we are going to overcome it.\n  On preventing us from having a meaningful prescription drug benefit \nfor senior citizens and doing something about the costs of prescription \ndrugs in this country, on which the Presiding Officer has worked so \nhard, we know that is a fight between ordinary Americans and ordinary \nfamilies who need these prescription drugs and the pharmaceutical \nindustry. The President has stood with the big pharmaceutical industry.\n  On trying to do something about clean air in this country, the \nPresident and his administration have proposed weakening our clean air \nlaw--all in the interest of protecting his friends in the oil industry, \nin the energy industry, and against the interests of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  So now he adds to that list, going to my home State of North \nCarolina, to say to the victims: I am going to make sure the big \ninsurance companies of America are protected. At the end of the day, \nthat is all this is about.\n  The proposal the President made is different from this amendment--\nwhich I will talk about in a minute--which is to impose a limit of \n$250,000 on some of the damages for children can be recovered against \nthese big insurance companies.\n  For example, in the case of a child who may be born blind or crippled \nfor life or a child who has to be taken care of by his or her parents \nevery single day, 7 days a week, every day of the year for the rest of \ntheir lives, the President says: I am going to make sure the insurance \ncompanies don't have to pay what they are obligated to pay to that \nfamily, to that child.\n\n  It is wrong. It is no more complicated than that. And the children \nand the families, who have been the victims, know it is wrong.\n  The President held a roundtable yesterday in North Carolina on this \nsubject. How many victims participated in that roundtable? How many \npeople whose lives have been destroyed and who need the help that the \ninsurance company is obligated to provide for them participated? \nEverybody else was well represented. What about the people who don't \nhave lobbyists? What about the people who aren't represented here in \nWashington by lobbyists? The families, the kids who are hurt by all \nthis, were they at the roundtable? Were their voices heard?\n  I invite the President to come back to North Carolina, and this time, \ninstead of talking to these powerful interests, I hope he will sit down \nwith regular folks who have been the victims and listen to what they \nhave to say, listen to what their lives are like.\n  One of the phrases that was used in the administration proposal was: \nYou have these families who have won the lottery.\n  Well, I can tell you what the parents of a child who was a victim \nsaid yesterday from North Carolina. I know these people because I \nrepresent them. The parents said: Our little girl was born, and because \nof the type of care she got, she couldn't see, she couldn't hear, she \ncouldn't walk. Every day of her life--7 days a week, 24 hours a day--we \ntook care of her. And we loved her so much. There is nothing we \nwouldn't have done for her. And then she died. And when we go to visit \nher at her grave, we don't feel much like we won the lottery.\n  These are the people whom these kinds of proposals affect. These are \nreal people with real lives. We have to look at the consequences, even \nthough they are not up here with powerful, fancy lobbyists representing \nthem. They are the people we have to look out for. And they are the \npeople who expect their President to look out for them. Unfortunately, \nhe continues to stand with big insurance companies, with big \npharmaceutical companies, with big HMOs. These people need his help. It \nis no more complicated than that.\n  Now, as to this amendment and the purpose of it, first, medical \nmalpractice premiums constitute less than 1 percent of health care \ncosts in this country. So think about the logic. The argument is, we \nare going to do something about health care costs in this country, and \nthe way we are going to do it is to try to do something misguided--we \nare going to try to do something about medical malpractice premiums, \nwhich constitute about two-thirds of 1 percent of health care costs in \nthis country.\n  First of all, it is the wrong place to start if you are going to do \nsomething\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nabout health care costs in this country. If you want to do something \nabout health care costs, you ought to do what the Presiding Officer and \nI and so many of us have tried to do--bring the cost of prescription \ndrugs under control in this country, because that will have a real \neffect on health care costs. They are a driving force in rising health \ncare costs in this country.\n  This is minuscule by comparison. So, No. 1, it is a misguided effort \nin terms of what it is focused on. No. 2, it will not work because \nthese kinds of proposals--the President's proposal yesterday in North \nCarolina, and this amendment, which is different--are proposals that \nimpose limitations on recoveries for victims, for families, to try to \nget rid of some concepts in the law. They have been used in many places \naround the country. They do not work. They do not, in fact, have the \nkind of impact on insurance premiums that these people who are \nproposing them say they have.\n  If you look at medical malpractice premiums in this country, and you \nlook at the States that have these provisions that impose limits on the \nfamilies, and then you look at the States that do not have them, the \ncosts of medical malpractice insurance--I am looking for the year 2001 \nfor internal medicine, for general surgery, for obstetrics and \ngynecology--are virtually identical.\n  This all sounds logical. If you impose limits on what the victims and \nthe families can recover, why does that not help bring the cost of the \ninsurance down? Why does it not have an effect on premiums? Because \nlogic would tell you it would because insurance companies have to pay \nless, theoretically. So as a result, why don't they lower the premiums? \nBecause the insurance company premiums have nothing to do with this. \nThat is the reason.\n  The insurance company takes the money that they receive in premiums, \nand they invest it. Where do they invest it? They invest it in that \nsame stock market in which most of the people in America are invested.\n  You can look at every time they start raising premiums. They come to \nWashington and say: There is a crisis; we have to do something about \nthis; this is a serious problem; we have these outrageous awards for \nchildren and families; we have to stop it. And the way to stop it is to \ncut off the rights of the victims. That is the way to stop it.\n  So why? Because they are not doing well in their investments. Every \nsingle time, when the stock market falls, and the insurance companies' \nmoney that is invested is not bringing back a good return--in fact, \nthey are losing money--they raise premiums.\n  Who has to pay those higher premiums? The health care providers. They \nare just as much a victim of this as the kids and the families who are \nvictims of the bad medical care. The insurance companies are the ones \nthat are responsible. You can look at it. It is as sure as the Sun is \ngoing to come up tomorrow, if they are doing well on their investments, \nthe premiums stay relatively stable. When they are not doing well on \ntheir investments, the premiums go up. That is what this is all about.\n  While these kinds of proposals are aimed at reducing the rights of \nvictims--which is what they are--instead, what we ought to be doing is \nlooking at what the big insurance companies are doing when they get \nunhappy with the results of their own investments. That is what drives \nthis.\n  If you look at what has happened in these States--the Senator from \nTennessee talked about California at great length. California has some \nof the most severe limitations in the country on what victims can \nrecover--severe limitations. They have been in place a long time.\n  So let's look at what has happened in California.\n  Between 1991 and 2000, over that about 10 years--a little less than \n10 years--the premiums in California went up more than the national \npremiums. Why? Why in the world, if they have got these serious \nlimitations on recoveries--and they have been in place for years in \nCalifornia--why would their premiums go up? And why would they go up \nfaster than in the rest of the country, many places which do not have \nthese kinds of limitations? Because the rise in premiums, and what is \nhappening in what insurance companies charge people around the country, \nis in direct relation to how they are doing in their own investments.\n  In some cases, it is an insurance company or the insurance industry \nthat exists in a region, in some cases it is national, and in many \ncases, of course, it is connected to the international and the \nreinsurance markets, but it is clear as day that it is directly related \nto how they are doing in their investments in the stock market.\n  So this effort is misguided. Besides that, I do want to point out, \nthough, that the Senators who are proposing this amendment to put \nlimits on what victims can receive, even they are not willing to go as \nfar as the administration is. The administration proposes a $250,000 \nlimit on some damages for children, among others, who have a lifelong \ndisability as a result of bad medical care.\n  This amendment does not make that proposal. They are not willing to \ngo that far. They know that when you put a limit on those kinds of \nrecoveries, on those kinds of damages, it is like a laser directed at \nthe most severely injured, and usually the youngest, because young \nchildren who have severe injuries for life, which they and their \nparents are going to have to carry for the rest of their lives--and you \nare limiting them to $250,000 in those kinds of damages--$250,000--\nnobody in America thinks that makes sense. That is why that is not \npart, I suspect, of this proposal.\n  Instead, this proposal goes about it in a different kind of way. What \nthis proposal suggests is a couple things: One, that we get rid of \nsomething called joint and several liability. Without going into too \nmuch detail about this, we believe in this country--and it has been the \nlaw of the land for many years--that if you have a victim, whether it \nis a victim of criminal conduct or bad medical care, or somebody who \nhas behaved wrongly, and you have a victim, the victim should not be \nthe one held responsible. If you have several people who caused it, \nthey share the responsibility.\n\n  What this proposal says is, all right, somebody got hurt as a result \nof the bad behavior of a group of people. Always remember, you have an \namount that has been lost by the victim. Let's say it is $100,000 that \nhas been lost by the victim. If that money has been lost, it is shared \namong the defendants. What we have always said in America is, as part \nof our law, the victim should never be the one held responsible for \nthat loss. The loss doesn't go away. The loss is always there; the \ndamages are always there.\n  This proposal says, if you have five people who are responsible, then \namong those five people, none of them can be required to pay more than \nwhatever a jury determines is their percentage responsibility. But \nremember, these are all wrongdoers. So on one side of the equation you \nhave a child who is innocent. On the other side of the equation you \nhave the group of wrongdoers. The amount that has been lost does not \nchange. Somebody has to be responsible for that. So are we going to say \nthat the wrongdoers are responsible or are we going to shift some of \nthat responsibility to the innocent victim?\n  That is what this proposal does. It says we are going to get rid of \nwhat is called joint and several liability, which means you can collect \nagainst any one or all of the wrongdoers, and says instead, if there is \na wrongdoer you can't get to, for whatever reason, that part of the \nresponsibility goes back to the victim. It violates what we believe in \nthis country. It violates our fundamental notion of responsibility and \naccountability that the people who ought to be held accountable for \nthey are the people who did wrong, not the innocent victim. That is \nwhat is wrong with this specific proposal.\n  There are other proposals. The next proposal says if there is an \naward of something called punitive damages, then half of that money \nwill go to the Government. Now, let's talk about that in a real case. \nLet's explain what the effect of that is.\n  To get punitive damages, the conduct has to be either criminal or \nvery close to criminal. That is what is required in order for punitive \ndamages to be awarded. So let's say you have a teenage girl who is the \nvictim of this kind of criminal conduct. The jury awards these damages \nto that young girl. This is what this amendment says to that\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\nvictim of essentially criminal conduct: We are going to impose a 50 \npercent tax on you. That is what we are going to do. We are going to \nsay to the victim of this conduct: There is a 50 percent tax on the \ndamages that a jury, after hearing the whole case, has decided you are \nentitled to, 50 percent. That is going to go to the Government.\n  Is that the signal we want to send as a Congress, as the U.S. Senate? \nDo we want to say to the American people that we as a body want to \nimpose a 50 percent tax on a child who has been the victim of what is \nessentially criminal conduct? This is crazy. It doesn't make any sense. \nIt also violates our basic notions of fairness and responsibility and \naccountability.\n  We have talked a great deal on the floor about doing things about the \nvictims of criminal conduct. This essentially falls in the same \ncategory. It makes no sense for the government to impose a 50 percent \ntax on a child who has been the victim of what amounts to criminal \nconduct.\n  These provisions--and there are others--are wrong: getting rid of \nwhat is called joint and several liability, which means the wrongdoers \ndon't necessarily have to pay for all of what has happened, while some \nof it gets shifted to the victim. That is wrong.\n\n  Second, to say we are going to impose a 50 percent tax on a victim, a \nchild who has been essentially the victim of criminal conduct, that is \nwrong.\n  More important than all of that, this whole effort is misguided. If \nwhat we want to do is do something about health care costs, we should \nnot focus on what is well less than 1 percent of health care costs. We \nought to focus on the things that really make a difference, such as the \nrising cost of prescription drugs.\n  More importantly, the people who need us to look out for them are the \nvery people that this amendment is aimed at--the kids, the families, \nthe victims. We need to stand up for them. They need us to be willing \nto stand up for them no matter who is outside the floor of the Senate \nrepresenting the most powerful interests in America.\n  No matter how many lobbyists the insurance industry has, no matter \nhow many lobbyists the HMOs have, the big energy companies, the big oil \ncompanies, who is going to stand up for these kids and these families? \nIf they don't have us to stand up for them, they have nobody.\n  On all of these fronts, whether we are talking about doing something \nabout the high cost of prescription drugs for people, whether we are \ntalking about kids and families who are the victims of bad medical \ncare, whether we are talking about trying to protect our air for our \nchildren and for our families, on all these fronts, we have to stand up \nfor them. The people who voted for us and sent us to the Congress are \ncounting on us because they don't have lobbyists up there. They have \nnobody here outside the halls of Congress representing them. They count \non us to stand up for them.\n  As we go through these fights, we will stand up for them. This is one \nof them.\n  How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from North Carolina leaves, I would like \nto ask him a question or two. I am sorry I was not able to hear all of \nhis remarks. Having tried a few cases in my day, one of the concerns I \nhave about this tort debate is the fact that the insurance industry is \nthe only one that I know of, other than baseball, that can sit down in \na restaurant in sight of everybody or in some dark room, wherever they \nwant, and knowingly and openly conspire to set prices. There is nothing \nwrong with that. That is because of the McCarran-Ferguson law passed \nduring the depths of the Depression. They can do this.\n  Let me say to my friend, to show how unnecessary the debate is here \nin the Senate, first of all, this is something the States should be \ndoing, as is happening in Nevada.\n  This coming Monday, the Nevada State legislature is convening in a \nspecial session to deal with medical malpractice. I may not agree with \nwhat the State legislature does or doesn't do, but that is where this \nshould be settled.\n  The State of Nevada is different than the State of North Carolina. We \nhave all kinds of different problems with our torts than the Senator \ndoes.\n  I have two questions for my friend. First of all, do you think it \nwould be a good idea for the Congress, after some 70 years, to take a \nlook at McCarran-Ferguson to find out if insurance companies should be \nexempt from fixing prices, be exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act? \nThat is my first question.\n  The second question is, don't you think that tort liability, whether \nit is medical devices, medical malpractice, or products liability, \nshould be settled by State legislatures?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator asked two very good questions. First, I \nthink it is a terrific idea for us to look at the insurance industry, \nits practices in general, and what effect McCarran-Ferguson has on \nthose practices. The Senator describes a large part of the problem.\n  The Senator knows as well as I do, you can't move in Washington \nwithout bumping into some lobbyist representing the insurance industry. \nThey are so well heard and so well represented. I think it is a very \ngood idea.\n\n  As to the second question, we have differences between North \nCarolina, my State, and the State of Nevada, and differences between us \nand California. These are the kinds of issues that ought to be resolved \nat the State level. We have always believed that. There is a little bit \nof an inconsistency for the administration that normally says these are \nmatters that ought to be left to the States, we trust the States to \nmake these decisions; but in the case where they want to do something \non behalf of the insurance industry, which is what this is, they want \nto take it away from the States; they want to do it at the national \nlevel.\n  What has historically been done in this area is the way it should be \ndone, which is these are matters about State courts, how State courts \nhandle these kinds of cases. They are in touch with it. They know what \nis happening in their individual States, what the problems are, and \nthey can address them in a responsible and equitable way.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions.\n  We reserve the remainder of our time, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). In my capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Nevada, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  In my capacity as a Senator from the State of Nevada, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the quorum call that will shortly be called for be charged \nequally against both sides for the time remaining.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SARBANES). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7413-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7413-S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I have been reading the popular press, as \nhave most of us. As we watched the gyrations that occur in the stock \nmarket at the moment, I have been interested at the way people in the \npress have been portraying what has been happening.\n  We have been told in the last few weeks that the market went down \nbecause President Bush's speech was not tough enough when he spoke to \nWall Street. We have been told that the market went up because Chairman \nGreenspan's presentation to the Banking Committee was encouraging. We \nhave been told that the market went down because the Banking \nCommittee's bill on corporate governance was too tough and was \nfrightening people. Then we were told that the market went up \ndramatically because the same bill was passed and people were \nreassured.\n\n  The consequence of all of this is to demonstrate to me that the \npopular press does not have a clue as to why the market does what it \ndoes. They do not understand market forces, and they are looking for \nreasons with little or nothing to do with what happens in the market.\n  I will make a few comments about the market and what it is we might \nreally do in Congress if we want to have an impact on the market and \nthe economy.\n  In the short-term, there are two factors that we know about investors \nin the stock market. No. 1, they hate uncertainty. They hate a \nsituation where they do not know what is going on. This is one of the \nreasons why they reacted to the recent scandals with respect to \naccounting: They did not have the certainty that they could depend on \nthe numbers.\n  Now, as they are beginning to sort through some of the information we \nhave, they are beginning to feel a slight increase in certainty in \ntheir reaction to the numbers. That is showing up in some of the \nstabilization in the market. It has nothing to do with what kind of a \nspeech the President gives or how eloquent we are in the Senate.\n  No. 2, the market has a herd mentality in the short-term. If everyone \nis selling, we ought to sell. That is the reaction in many brokerage \nhouses. There are those who say: We are contrarians; if everyone is \nselling, we are going to buy; we are out of the herd mentality. But \nthey are in a herd mentality among the contrarians.\n  So there is no careful analysis of what is going on but a flight from \nuncertainty and a herd mentality, both of which rule the market in the \nshort-term.\n  In the long term, however, which is what really matters, there are \nalso two factors in the market we must pay attention to. No. 1, in the \nlong term, the market is self-correcting. Errors of judgment that are \nmade on one side of a trade are compensated for by intelligent \ndecisions on the other side of the trade. One brokerage house or one \nfund manager who overreacts and makes a serious mistake is offset by \nanother fund manager who serendipitously makes the right decision. Over \ntime, the markets are self-corrected so that the frantic headlines we \nsee in Time Magazine or on the front pages of the New York Times, the \nmarket this or the market that, on the basis of the President's speech \nor the Congress's actions, over time they have no relevance to reality \nwhatever. The market over time is self-correcting, goes in the right \ndirection, and rewards people who do the right thing and punishes \npeople who do the wrong thing.\n  Second, over time, the market depends on fundamentals. There are \nperiods of time when we have froth. There are periods that I call \n``tulip time''--remembering the tulip mania of the Netherlands. Over \ntime, these periods of froth are squeezed out, and the market makes its \ndecision on fundamentals.\n  I say to my friends in the popular press who are trying to sell air \ntime or newspapers: Stop trying to frighten the American people one way \nor the other. Come back to an understanding that fundamentals in the \neconomy are the things that really matter--not speeches by the \nPresident, not actions necessarily by the Congress.\n  I think we had to act on the corporate governance area, but we didn't \ndrive the market up or down by the action that we took. We added to the \nquestion of fundamentals.\n  How well the Sarbanes-Oxley bill works will play itself out in the \nfundamentals. If it works in a solidly fundamental way, it will benefit \nthe markets. If it turns out it has flaws, it will hurt the market. But \nthe speeches we imagine as we pass the bill have little or no impact.\n  One final comment. If we were serious about doing something to change \nthe culture in corporate America, we ought to consider removing \ntaxation on dividends. We have had a lot of conversation about options \nand managing earnings. If dividends become a reason why people buy \nstocks, as they once were, that would change the nature of corporate \ngovernance fairly fundamentally.\n  If a CEO knew his stock price would go up if his dividend were \nincreased and if his investors knew if they get an increase in \ndividends it would not be eaten up in taxes, there would be a change in \nthe corporate boardrooms of this country that would be salutary.\n  I don't have the time to go into this, but at some future time I will \nexplore it. I raised this with Chairman Greenspan when he testified \nbefore the Banking Committee and asked him about the propriety of \nremoving taxation from dividends. That was the beginning of a \nconversation that I want to have over time.\n  As we go through the experience of the present economic difficulties \nand the gyrations of the market, it is time to reflect on fundamental \nthings we can do that will change the nature of the corporate culture. \nAddressing stock options and expensing stock options is something we \ncan talk about. Dealing with corporate compensation is something we can \ntalk about.\n  Back to my earlier point. Over time, the market responds to \nfundamentals, and, over time, we ought to look at some fundamental \nchanges. That means we have to look at the tax laws. There is nothing \nthat government does that affects corporate activity more than the Tax \nCode. That is where we ought to look for serious cultural changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7414-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I bring up a subject that I have been \nspeaking about frequently. That is our Social Security system, one that \nI believe the American people deserve to have a debate about before the \nelection in November.\n  There have been many attempts to put off this debate until after the \nelection so we can decide policy that will truly impact the American \npeople for many, many years and decades to come. It is extremely \ndisappointing we have had a hard time engaging in that debate. This \nweek we actually made some progress, at least with regard to debate, \nnot necessarily with regard to the content of the debate.\n  I express my great disappointment and, frankly, my utter amazement\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nabout comments made this past week by the President's press secretary, \nMr. Ari Fleischer, with respect to the privatization of Social \nSecurity. I will read the beginning of an article from the Washington \nPost on Thursday on the press secretary's remarks, and I will ask \nunanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  The article is titled: ``Bush Continues to Back Privatized Social \nSecurity.''\n  It reads:\n\n       The White House yesterday stood firmly behind President \n     Bush's plan for workers to divert some of their social \n     security payroll taxes into the stock market, despite the \n     dramatic drops suffered in recent months.\n\n  Basically, for the past 2\\1/2\\ years.\n\n       White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer took a swing at \n     the existing Social Security Program, calling it \n     ``dangerous'' to let the people pay a lifetime of high taxes \n     for a Social Security benefit that under current projections \n     they'll never receive.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       . . . calling it ``dangerous`` to let people pay a lifetime \n     of high taxes for a Social Security benefit that under \n     current projections they'll never receive.\n\n  Often we hear people talking about trying to scare seniors and all \nkinds of hyperbolic commentary about Social Security, but this tops it.\n  Yesterday, the Congress, under your leadership, took the leadership \nwith regard to corporate reform to help make sure corporate America, \nthe Nation's accounting profession, those who are responsible for \nmanaging corporate America, are more responsible. But after reading Mr. \nFleischer's remarks, I think we should consider a similar initiative to \nmake the administration's statements on Social Security equally \nresponsible.\n  It is inconceivable that we would be talking to the American people \nin terms that, under current projections, they will never receive their \nbenefits.\n  Let me take a moment to review where things stand on this issue of \nSocial Security, which I do believe truly needs a full debate--maybe \nnot in context that Mr. Fleischer is talking about, but we do need a \ndebate in front of the election.\n  Last December, President Bush's Social Security Commission proposed \nplans to privatize Social Security that would require deep cuts in \nguaranteed benefits--not eliminate, deep cuts. For workers now in their \ntwenties, those cuts would exceed 25 percent. From younger workers and \nfuture generations, those cuts could be much deeper, up to and beyond \n45 percent.\n  Unfairly, and in my view inappropriately, these cuts would apply to \neveryone, even those who choose not to risk their Social Security \nbenefits in privatized accounts. For those who do participate in \nprivatized accounts, the cuts in their guaranteed benefits would even \nbe larger than those I just mentioned.\n  Incredibly, for the disabled and for surviving children and family \nmembers, the cuts in their benefits would be especially disastrous, \nmore extreme than the numbers that are cited for retirees.\n  These deep cuts would undermine the fundamental purpose of Social \nSecurity, which is about providing a basic level of security to those \nwho have worked hard, contributed to our Nation, paid into the Social \nSecurity system, and they did it in good faith that the system would be \navailable, and those resources would be available for their retirement. \nSocial Security promises Americans a basic level of security on which \nthey can count. It is the bedrock of a social insurance program that \nour Nation overwhelmingly supports, has for generations--70 years--and \nthat retirees can depend on for a rock solid guarantee regardless of \nwhat the stock market does or what asset markets of all kinds do, \nregardless of inflation and regardless of one's lifespan. Social \nSecurity will be there and that fundamental guarantee is what the \nprogram is all about.\n  By contrast, privatizing Social Security would shred, would break \nthat guarantee, and in my view we must not let that happen. It is one \nof the most important issues our Nation should be debating as we face \nthis election this fall. The lines are very clearly drawn. Mr. \nFleischer suggested they stand firm in their belief that the \nprivatization of Social Security is the direction we should take.\n\n  The huge volatility in the stock market over the past several months \nshould make clear to all Americans that equity investments by their \nnature cannot offer the same security that Social Security provides. \nBeing an old market hand, markets go up, they go down, they go \nsideways. They are volatile through time. Sometimes they have serious \nerosions in value.\n  In the past 2\\1/2\\ years, stocks have lost nearly $8 trillion in \nvalue. The S index has declined by about 45 percent. This year alone, \nstocks have lost close to $3 trillion. That translates to real \nundermining of retirement security for those who were dependent on it, \nprimarily focused on a 401(k) in the stock market. Many of those losses \nhave been suffered in our pension systems. They have been suffered in \nIRAs, 401(k)s, personal savings accounts. Those have truly undermined \nthe security that one might draw from them.\n  But through all of that, Social Security stands firm. The guaranteed \nbenefits are in place. One doesn't have to wonder whether those \nresources for one's retirement security are going to be available. \nBasic, critical benefits will be there for the beneficiaries, \nregardless of the state of the stock market.\n  In light of that dramatic volatility, I had hoped that President Bush \nwould reconsider his support for privatizing Social Security. As I \nsaid, Mr. Fleischer was crystal clear. The President's position had not \nchanged.\n  For me, this is extremely disappointing, and I certainly call on the \nPresident to rethink his position. On these matters of great national \nimport--whether it was the corporate reform activity that we had a \ndebate about for 3 or 4 months, leading up to yesterday's successful \npassage of corporate reform; whether it is with regard to the fiscal \npolicy that has seen us move from substantial surpluses, 3 years of \nsurpluses into substantial deficit; and now, on Social Security--we see \nthis continual sense of inflexibility.\n  Leadership is about thoughtful respect for the facts, changing \nrealities that might require a change in one's position. I hope the \nPresident will consider that in the context of Social Security, taking \ninto account the kind of market volatility we have seen, taking into \nconsideration the kind of risk that might be brought to bear on those \nwho have had their investments in the stock market over long periods of \ntime.\n  Having said that, my concern about Mr. Fleischer's statement \nWednesday goes beyond his reaffirmation of this administration's \ncontinuing support for privatizing Social Security. He went much \nfurther. Let me just read again from the story I cited from the \nWashington Post. Mr. Fleischer claimed that Social Security was ``going \nbankrupt,'' and that it was dangerous to:\n\n       . . . let people pay a lifetime of high taxes for a Social \n     Security benefit that under current projections they'll never \n     receive.\n\n  ``Going bankrupt,'' if that is not scare language, I can't imagine \nhow one could otherwise categorize it.\n  This statement is simply outrageous. It is simply outrageous to \nsuggest that people now paying into the system will never receive a \nSocial Security benefit. It is not just misleading, it is absolutely \nfactually wrong. I am afraid it is part of a concerted effort by those \nadvocates of privatization to scare Americans, especially younger \nAmericans, into believing that the only way they are ever going to get \na retirement benefit out of Social Security is to invest it in personal \naccounts, to invest it in privatized accounts, to invest it in the \nstock market.\n  I am not against investing private funds beyond Social Security in \nall kinds of assets. But we are talking about a guaranteed benefit for \nall of Americans. In the 1930s, before we had Social Security, or \nbefore 1930, almost 50 percent of senior Americans lived in poverty. \nBecause of the benefit of Social Security, now we are down to about 10 \npercent. It is a fundamental, solid program. People know that our \nGovernment has created a situation where they can have security in \ntheir retirement. It is a sacred trust with the American people. It is \nbased on a promise that if you work hard and contribute to your \ncountry, you will enjoy a very basic level of security in retirement.\n  By the way, this is not exactly a princely sum that people get out of \nSocial Security. I wish we could make it better.\n  Last year, the average retiree benefit was about $10,000--not exactly \nwhat\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nsome of the salaries of big corporate executives are about--and about \n$9,000 for women. That is not exactly a princely sum, as I suggested, \nin my part of the country. In New Jersey, the average rental payment \nfor an individual is about $1,200 a month. I don't think $10,000 \nmatches up with what you even have to pay for rent in many parts of the \ncountry. It is not exactly as if our Social Security system is \nproviding excessive amounts of resources for individuals in their \nretirement. But it does provide that bedrock safety.\n  Unfortunately, I guess there are those who seem to think $10,000 is \ntoo much. They want to break Social Security's promise to seniors in \nthe future by cutting those benefits by 25 percent, or 45 percent. \nThose are big numbers. That is hard to put together against the cost of \nretirement for most Americans.\n  One way they justify such claims is by arguing that the current \nsystem will leave today's workers high and dry. We heard Mr. \nFleischer's remarks. They seem to be hoping that will be a self-\nfulfilling prophecy, that somehow or another they can scare people into \nbelieving we ought to undermine Social Security. I stand here today \nquite confident that folks on this side of the aisle, if we have \nanything to say on the matter, are not going to let that happen.\n  That is why we need to have this debate about Social Security \nprivatization before people go to the polls this November. It is one of \nthose defining issues for the American people to express themselves \nabout. It is very clear: Do you want privatization of Social Security \nthat puts the responsibility and the risk on the shoulders of Americans \nor do you want a guaranteed system that provides benefits if you have \npaid into that system when you retire? It is very clear, it is not a \ncomplicated concept--guaranteed benefits versus risk.\n  For those concerned about the future of Social Security, let me \nremind my colleagues that Social Security benefits are established in \nthe United States Code and represent a legal commitment--I think we \ncall it an entitlement--by the Federal Government and with the full \nfaith and credit of the United States.\n  Unlike many other programs, Social Security is not subject to a \nyearly appropriations process. The entitlement and benefit is not \ndependent on future congressional action. Mr. Fleischer is just flat \nout wrong.\n  As a purely legal matter, this entitlement would remain a binding \nobligation of the Government even if Congress were to allow the Social \nSecurity trust fund to become insolvent. However, as a practical \nmatter, the point is moot. First, the nonpartisan actuaries at the \nSocial Security Administration project that the trust fund will be \nfully solvent for 40 years; that is, 2041. After that, there still \nwould be enough funding for three-quarters of the benefits to the \nactuarial life on which they are making the calculations.\n  But there is nothing in the law to prohibit Congress from \nreplenishing the funds or changing some of the terms and conditions. We \ncan do a number of things to establish the security of that trust fund.\n  We ought to start by balancing our budget so we are not spending the \nSocial Security trust fund on everything under the Sun other than for \nwhat it is intended. But we could take actions here on the floor of the \nSenate with the Congress and the President working together to flush \nthat up. As a matter of fact, we have a legal obligation to do that.\n\n  I think it is absolutely essential that Mr. Fleischer review the \ncontext in which he says we are going to have a bankruptcy because we \nhave written into law that that is not going to happen. I am confident \nthat long before 2041, the Congress and the White House will come \ntogether in a bipartisan way, as they have in history in different \nperiods of time, move beyond privatization proposals which would \nactually worsen the Social Security financial system, and work together \nto solve the program's long-term funding needs. It can be done. It is \nnot beyond the realm of a lot of reasonable people. We ought to talk to \nthe American public about that.\n  But the reality is that privatization is not the direction that is \ngoing to provide the kind of security that I think most Americans are \nlooking for in their retirement.\n  I think we ought to get away from giving blatantly false and \nmisleading arguments and scaring people about the solvency of Social \nSecurity, as Mr. Fleischer did on Wednesday. I think we need to stop \nthe scare tactics for young people and talk about real solutions for a \nreal problem, that I think can be addressed if we are thoughtful, in \nthe way we have addressed a number of issues in the Senate.\n  I conclude by again urging the Bush administration to reconsider \ntheir position on privatization, particularly in light of the dramatic \nevents of recent weeks. Just as September 11 led to fundamental changes \nin Americans' perceptions about the risks of terrorism, I think the \nrecent volatility of this market has captured the reality of what \nmarkets can provide as far as undermining security is concerned, and we \nhave developed a much greater appreciation as a nation about the \nuncertainties of the market. I hope the Bush administration will face \nup to that reality and readjust its attitude and its views on its \npolicies accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 25, 2002]\n\n           Bush Continues to Back Privatized Social Security\n\n                           (By Amy Goldstein)\n\n       The White House yesterday stood firmly behind President \n     Bush's plan for workers to divert some of their Social \n     Security payroll taxes into the stock market, despite the \n     dramatic drops Wall Street has suffered in recent months.\n       White House press secretary Ari Fleischer took a swing at \n     the existing Social Security program, calling it \n     ``dangerous'' to ``let people pay a lifetime of high taxes \n     for a Social Security benefit that under current projections \n     they'll never receive.''\n       Fleischer made clear that Bush continues to favor \n     permitting Americans to take a portion of the taxes they \n     ordinarily contribute to Social Security trust fund and \n     invest it on their own. ``That would include markets,'' \n     Fleischer said. ``Nothing has changed his views about \n     allowing younger workers to have those options.''\n       However, Fleischer recalibrated his sale pitch for private \n     retirement accounts, deemphasizing earlier arguments that \n     such investments would generate more retirement savings \n     through higher rates of return. Instead, he said that the \n     current system is ``going bankrupt'' and that the government \n     should grant people more control over their money. He used \n     the word ``options'' a dozen times.\n       The White House's reminder that Bush wants to overhaul \n     Social Security comes as the administration is redoubling its \n     efforts to draw attention to strong points in the economy. \n     The remarks about the retirement system, on a day when the \n     stock market rose after nine weeks of historic declines, \n     typify an administration that has prized consistency in its \n     policy positions, rather than shifting with changed \n     circumstances.\n       Bush's position on Social Security was a major tenet of his \n     2000 campaign. Last year, he assigned a commission to \n     recommend such a system, and the panel responded in December \n     with three proposals. Each would require at least $2 trillion \n     to convert to the new approach, the commission found. It also \n     concluded that the program, destined to face enormous \n     economic strains by the middle of the next decade as the baby \n     boom generation retires, will require reductions in benefits, \n     money from elsewhere in the federal budget--or both.\n       For now, the White House essentially is speaking into a \n     legislative vacuum. Republicans, fearing that the volatile \n     issue could prove damaging in the elections this fall, \n     persuaded Bush last winter that Congress should not consider \n     any Social Security reforms until 2003. Now some in the party \n     are suggesting that debate should be deferred until after the \n     2004 presidential election.\n       House Republicans have distanced themselves from Bush's \n     ideas--at least rhetorically--by passing a bill that promised \n     not to ``privatize'' the retirement system, although many in \n     the party still favor what they now call ``individual \n     investments.'' House Democrats are trying to force a vote on \n     the president's proposal, believing that a debate may prove \n     politically advantageous during a season of investment losses \n     and corporate scandals.\n       In the absence of legislation, the most ardent proponents \n     of individual accounts continue to press their cause. This \n     week, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, issued a \n     poll it sponsored suggesting that two-thirds of voters \n     support that arrangement. Andrew Biggs, who works on Social \n     Security at Cato and was a staff member of the White House \n     commission, said the findings are striking because the survey \n     was conducted during an interval earlier this month\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\n     when the stock market fell 700 points. ``Nobody can claim we \n     had the environment stacked in our favor,' he said.\n       A Washington Post-ABC News poll this month found that about \n     half the public supports investing some of their Social \n     Security contributions in the stock market, significantly \n     less than two years ago, but about the same proportion as \n     last year.\n       Democrats and other opponents of the change have been \n     raising the issue particularly in congressional campaigns. \n     ``There is a link between the rising crisis of confidence in \n     corporate America and the scheme to privatize Social Security \n     and cut Social Security benefits as Republicans are still \n     seeking to do,'' House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt \n     (D-Mo.) said this month.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take the floor for a moment or \ntwo to commend the able Senator from New Jersey for the statement that \nwas just made about Social Security privatization, and for focusing on \nthis absolutely outrageous statement made by the White House Press \nSecretary earlier this week. To terrify people with that kind of \nstatement is absolutely irresponsible. I think it is very important \nthat be put on the Record.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the analysis and focus he is \nbringing to this issue of privatizing Social Security. It is an \nextraordinarily important issue. I agree with the Senator that it ought \nto be fully debated.\n  The President and his advisers apparently have not abandoned their \nbad idea of privatizing Social Security. If that is the case, then we \nneed to lay out in front of the country exactly what is involved. The \nbiggest thing involved, in my judgment, is the very point which the \nable Senator from New Jersey was making just a few moments ago; that \nis, the question of the guaranteed benefit.\n  Under the existing Social Security system, we seek to provide an \nassured benefit level in Social Security. So when someone stops \nworking, and they start drawing their Social Security, they are told, \nyou will get X amount of dollars per month in your Social Security \ncheck. In addition, of course, we also provide for a cost-of-living \nadjustment in that check.\n\n  So the beneficiary, in planning their retirement, and their standard \nof living under retirement, knows that each month the Social Security \ncheck will come, and it will be in this amount--a guaranteed benefit--\nand that they can count on that.\n  The privatization, first of all, undercuts the guaranteed benefit \nconcept, and carries with it the risk that your monthly benefit check \nmay be far less. It also carries the risk it may be far more. But who \nknows? Who knows?\n  Can you imagine the trauma of senior citizens all across the country \nif the amount of their Social Security check had been linked to the \nmovement of the stock market in recent months? You would have some \nelderly person, for whom Social Security is their only source of \nincome, reading stories about the drop in the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq \nand all the rest of it, thinking to themselves: How much is going to be \nin my next monthly check? How am I just going to get through the \nnecessities of life if the amount of my Social Security check is going \nto drop, because of it now being tied to the movements in the market?\n  Any responsible discussion about this has been that you would have an \nadd-on over and above Social Security that might then be placed in the \nmarket, so at least you would guarantee to the person sort of the \nminimum retirement upon which they could absolutely plan and absolutely \ncount. And that is what needs to be laid out and debated.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has pinpointed that concern. I commend \nhim for doing it. It is very important. People need to focus on this \nissue. We need to have this debate. We ought not to be in a situation \nwhere the White House Press Secretary can make the kind of statements \nhe is making, seek to undercut confidence in the system, and then use \nthat as an argument for some fundamental change which would jeopardize \nthe guaranteed benefit aspect of the Social Security system which is an \nextremely important part of it.\n  I thank the Senator for the excellent job he is doing in bringing \nthis issue to the attention of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sarbanes).

Mr. President, yesterday during my floor remarks on the \nfinal passage of H.R. 2673, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, I requested \nunanimous consent that a section by section analysis and discussion of \nTitle VIII, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, which \nI authored, be included in the Congressional Record as part of the \nofficial legislative history of those provisions of H.R. 2673. That \nunanimous consent request was granted, but due to a clerical error, \nthis essential legislative history was not printed in yesterday's \nCongressional Record.\n  It is my understanding that this document will appear in yesterday's \nCongressional Record when the historical volume is compiled. However, \nin order to provide guidance in the legal interpretation of these \nprovisions of Title VIII of H.R. 2673 before that volume is issued, I \nask unanimous consent that the same document be printed in today's \nCongressional Record and be treated as legislative history for Title \nVIII, offered by the sponsor of these provisions, as if it had been \nprinted yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Section-by-Section Analysis and Discussion of the Corporate and \n      Criminal Fraud Accountability Act (Title VIII of H.R. 2673)\n\n       Title VIII has three major components that will enhance \n     corporate accountability. Its terms track almost exactly the \n     provisions of S. 2010, introduced by Senator Leahy and \n     reported unanimously from the Committee on the Judiciary. \n     Following is a brief section by section and a legal analysis \n     regarding its provisions.\n\n\n                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\n\n     Section 801.--Title. ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud \n         Accountability Act.''\n     Section 802. Criminal penalties for altering documents\n       This section provides two new criminal statutes which would \n     clarify and plug holes in the current criminal laws relating \n     to the destruction or fabrication of evidence and the \n     preservation of financial and audit records.\n       First, this section would create a new 20-year felony which \n     could be effectively used in a wide array of cases where a \n     person destroys or creates evidence with the intent to \n     obstruct an investigation or matter that is, as a factual \n     matter, within the jurisdiction of any federal agency or any \n     bankruptcy. It also covers acts either in contemplation of or \n     in relation to such matters.\n       Second, the section creates a new 10-year felony which \n     applies specifically to the willful failure to preserve audit \n     papers of companies that issue securities. Section (a) of the \n     statute has two sections which apply to accountants who \n     conduct audits under the provisions of the Securities and \n     Exchange Act of 1934. Subsection (a)(1) is an independent \n     criminal prohibition on the destruction of audit or review \n     work papers for five years, as that term is widely understood \n     by regulators and in the accounting industry. Subsection \n     (a)(2) requires the SEC to promulgate reasonable and \n     necessary regulations within 180 days, after the opportunity \n     for public comment, regarding the retention of categories of \n     electronic and non-electronic audit records which contain \n     opinions, conclusions, analysis or financial data, in \n     addition to the actual work papers. Willful violation of such \n     regulations would be a crime. Neither the statute nor any \n     regulations promulgated under it would relieve any person of \n     any independent legal obligation under state or federal law \n     to maintain or refrain from destroying such records. In \n     Conference language was added that further clarified that the \n     rulemaking called for under the (b) provision was mandatory, \n     and gave the SEC authority to amend and supplement such rules \n     in the future, after proper notice and comment.\n     Section 803.--Debts nondischargeable if incurred in violation \n         of securities fraud laws\n       This provision would amend the federal bankruptcy code to \n     make judgments and settlements arising from state and federal \n     securities law violations brought by state or federal \n     regulators and private individuals non-dischargeable. Current \n     bankruptcy law may permit wrongdoers to discharge their \n     obligations under court judgments or settlements based on \n     securities fraud and securities law violations. The \n     section, by its terms, applies to both regulatory and more \n     traditional fraud matters, so long as they arise under the \n     securities laws, whether federal, state, or local.\n       This provision is meant to prevent wrongdoers from using \n     the bankruptcy laws as a shield and to allow defrauded \n     investors to recover as much as possible. To the maximum \n     extent possible, this provision should be applied to existing \n     bankruptcies. The provision applies to all judgments and \n     settlements arising from state and federal securities laws \n     violations entered in the future regardless of when the case \n     was filed.\n     Section 804.--Statute of limitations\n       This section would set the statute of limitations in \n     private securities fraud cases to the earlier of two years \n     after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation \n     or five years after such violation. The current statute of \n     limitations for most private securities fraud cases is the \n     earlier of three years from the date of the fraud or one year \n     from the date of discovery. This provision states that it is \n     not meant to create any new private cause of action, but only \n     to govern all the already existing private causes of action \n     under the various federal securities laws that have been held \n     to support private causes of action. This provision is \n     intended to lengthen any statute of limitations under federal \n     securities law, and to shorten none. The section, by its \n     plain terms, applies to any and all cases filed after the \n     effective date of the Act, regardless of when the underlying \n     conduct occurred.\n     Section 805.--Review and enhancement of criminal sentences in \n         cases of fraud and evidence destruction\n       This section would require the United States Sentencing \n     Commission (``Commission'') to review and consider enhancing, \n     as appropriate, criminal penalties in cases involving \n     obstruction of justice and in serious fraud cases. The \n     Commission is also directed to generally review the U.S.S.G. \n     Chapter 8 guidelines relating to sentencing organizations for \n     criminal misconduct, to ensure that such guidelines are \n     sufficient to punish and deter criminal misconduct by \n     corporations. The Commission is asked to perform such reviews \n     and make such enhancements as soon as practicable, but within \n     180 days at the most.\n       Subsection 1 requires that the Commission generally review \n     all the base offense level and sentencing enhancements under \n     U.S.S.G. Sec. 2J1.2. Subsection 2 specifically directs the \n     Commission to consider including enhancements or specific \n     offense characteristics for cases based on various factors \n     including the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of \n     physical evidence, the amount of evidence destroyed, the \n     number of participants, or otherwise extensive nature of the \n     destruction, the selection of evidence that is particularly \n     probative or essential to the investigation, and whether the \n     offense involved more than minimal planning or the abuse of a \n     special skill or position of trust. Subsection 3 requires the \n     Commission to establish appropriate punishments for the new \n     obstruction of justice offenses created in this Act.\n       Subsections 4 and former subsection 5 of the Senate passed \n     bill, which was moved to Title 11 in Conference, require the \n     Commission to review guideline offense levels and \n     enhancements under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, relating to fraud. \n     Specifically, the Commission is requested to review the fraud \n     guidelines and consider enhancements for cases involving \n     significantly greater than 50 victims and cases in which the \n     solvency or financial security of a substantial number of \n     victims is endangered. New Subsection 5 requires a \n     comprehensive review of Chapter 8 guidelines relating to \n     sentencing organizations. It is specifically intended that \n     the Commission's review of Section 8 be comprehensive, and \n     cover areas in addition to monetary penalties, additional \n     punishments such as supervision, compliance programs, \n     probation and administrative action, which are often \n     extremely important in deterring corporate misconduct.\n     Section 806.--Whistleblower protection for employees of \n         publicly traded companies\n       This section would provide whistleblower protection to \n     employees of publicly traded companies. It specifically \n     protects them when they take lawful acts to disclose \n     information or otherwise assist criminal investigators, \n     federal regulators, Congress, supervisors (or other proper \n     people within a corporation), or parties in a judicial \n     proceeding in detecting and stopping fraud. If the employer \n     does take illegal action in retaliation for lawful and \n     protected conduct, subsection (b) allows the employee to file \n     a complaint with the Department of Labor, to be governed by \n     the same procedures and burdens of proof now applicable in \n     the whistleblower law in the aviation industry. The employee \n     can bring the matter to federal court only if the Department \n     of Labor does not resolve the matter in 180 days (and there \n     is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the \n     claimant) as a normal case in law or equity, with no amount \n     in controversy requirement. Subsection (c) governs remedies \n     and provides for the reinstatement of the whistleblower, \n     backpay, and compensatory damages to make a victim whole, \n     including reasonable attorney fees and costs, as remedies if \n     the claimant prevails. A 90 day statute of limitations for \n     the bringing of the initial administrative action before the \n     Department of Labor is also included.\n     Section 807.--Criminal penalties for securities fraud\n       This provision would create a new 10-year felony for \n     defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. The \n     provision would supplement the patchwork of existing \n     technical securities law violations with a more general and \n     less technical provision, with elements and intent \n     requirements comparable to current bank fraud and health care \n     fraud statutes. It is meant to cover any scheme or artifice \n     to defraud any person in connection with a publicly traded \n     company. The acts terms are not intended to encompass \n     technical definition in the securities\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n     laws, but rather are intended to provide a flexible tool to \n     allow prosecutors to address the wide array of potential \n     fraud and misconduct which can occur in companies that are \n     publicly traded. Attempted frauds are also specifically \n     included.\n\n\n                               discussion\n\n       Following is a discussion and analysis of the Act's Title 8 \n     provisions.\n       Section 802 creates two new felonies to clarify and close \n     loopholes in the existing criminal laws relating to the \n     destruction or fabrication of evidence and the preservation \n     of financial and audit records. First, it creates a new \n     general anti shredding provision, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1519, with a \n     10-year maximum prison sentence. Currently, provisions \n     governing the destruction or fabrication of evidence are a \n     patchwork that have been interpreted, often very narrowly, by \n     federal courts. For instance, certain current provisions make \n     it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, \n     but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents \n     yourself. Other provisions, such as 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, have \n     been narrowly interpreted by courts, including the Supreme \n     Court in United States v. Aguillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), to \n     apply only to situations where the obstruction of justice can \n     be closely tied to a pending judicial proceeding. Still other \n     statutes have been interpreted to draw distinctions between \n     what type of government function is obstructed. Still other \n     provisions, such as sections 152(8), 1517 and 1518 apply to \n     obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as \n     bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and \n     healthcare fraud. In short, the current laws regarding \n     destruction of evidence are full of ambiguities and technical \n     limitations that should be corrected. This provision is meant \n     to accomplish those ends.\n       Section 1519 is meant to apply broadly to any acts to \n     destroy or fabricate physical evidence so long as they are \n     done with the intent to obstruct, impede or influence the \n     investigation or proper administration of any matter, and \n     such matter is within the jurisdiction of an agency of the \n     United States, or such acts done either in relation to or in \n     contemplation of such a matter or investigation. The fact \n     that a matter is within the jurisdiction of a federal agency \n     is intended to be a jurisdictional matter, and not in any way \n     linked to the intent of the defendant. Rather, the intent \n     required is the intent to obstruct, not some level of \n     knowledge about the agency processes of the precise nature of \n     the agency of court's jurisdiction. This statute is \n     specifically meant not to include any technical requirement, \n     which some courts have read into other obstruction of justice \n     statutes, to tie the obstructive conduct to a pending or \n     imminent proceeding or matter by intent or otherwise. It is \n     also sufficient that the act is done ``in contemplation'' of \n     or in relation to a matter or investigation. It is also meant \n     to do away with the distinctions, which some courts have read \n     into obstruction statutes, between court proceedings, \n     investigations, regulatory or administrative proceedings \n     (whether formal or not), and less formal government \n     inquiries, regardless of their title. Destroying or \n     falsifying documents to obstruct any of these types of \n     matters or investigations, which in fact are proved to be \n     within the jurisdiction of any federal agency are covered by \n     this statute. Questions of criminal intent are, as in all \n     cases, appropriately decided by a jury on a case-by-cases \n     basis. It also extends to acts done in contemplation of such \n     federal matters, so that the timing of the act in relation to \n     the beginning of the matter or investigation is also not a \n     bar to prosecution. The intent of the provision is \n     simple; people should not be destroying, altering, or \n     falsifying documents to obstruct any government function. \n     Finally, this section could also be used to prosecute a \n     person who actually destroys the records himself in \n     addition to one who persuades another to do so, ending yet \n     another technical distinction which burdens successful \n     prosecution of wrongdoers.1 6\n       Second, Section 802 also creates a 10 year felony, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1520, to punish the willful failure to preserve \n     financial audit papers of companies that issue securities as \n     defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The new \n     statute, in subsection (a)(1), would independently require \n     that accountants preserve audit work papers for five years \n     from the conclusion of the audit. Subsection (b) would make \n     it a felony to knowingly and willfully violate the five-year \n     audit retention period in (1)(a) or any of the rules that the \n     SEC must issue under (1)(b). The materials covered in \n     subsection (1)(b), which contains a mandatory requirement for \n     the SEC to issues reasonable rules and regulations, are \n     intended to include additional records which contain \n     conclusions, opinions, analysis, and financial data relevant \n     to an audit or review. Specifically included in such \n     materials are electronic communications such as emails and \n     other electronic records. The Conference added the ability of \n     the SEC to update its rules to specifically allow it to \n     capture additional types of records that could become \n     important in the future as technologies and practices of the \n     accounting industry change. The regulations are intended to \n     cover the retention of all such substantive material, whether \n     or not the conclusions, opinions, analyses or data in such \n     records support the final conclusions reached by the auditor \n     or expressed in the final audit or review so that state and \n     federal law enforcement officials and regulators and victims \n     can conduct more effective inquiries into the decisions and \n     determinations made by accountants in auditing public \n     corporations. Non-substantive materials, however, such as \n     administrative records, which are not relevant to the \n     conclusions or opinions expressed (or not expressed), need \n     not be included in such retention regulations. The language \n     of the provision is clear. The SEC ``shall'' and ``is \n     required'' to promulgate regulations relating to the \n     retention of the categories of items which are specifically \n     enumerated in the statutory provision. ``Reviews,'' as well \n     as audits are also recovered by both (a) and (b). When a \n     publicly traded company is involved, the precise name which \n     the auditor chooses to give to an engagement is not \n     important. Documents pertinent to the substance of such \n     financial audits or review should be preserved. Willful \n     violation of these regulations will also be a crime under \n     this section.\n       In light of the apparent massive document destruction by \n     Andersen, and the company's apparently misleading document \n     retention policy, even in light of its prior SEC violations, \n     it is intended that the SEC promulgate rules and regulations \n     that require the retention of such substantive material, \n     including material which casts doubt on the views expressed \n     in the audit of review, for such a period as is reasonable \n     and necessary for effective enforcement of the securities \n     laws and the criminal laws, most of which have a five-year \n     statute of limitations. It should also be noted that criminal \n     tax violations, which many of these documents relate to, have \n     a six-year statute of limitations and the regulatory portion \n     of the Act requires a 7 year retention period. By granting \n     the SEC the power to issue such regulations, it is not \n     intended that the SEC be prohibited from consulting with \n     other government agencies, such as the Department of Justice, \n     which has primary authority regarding enforcement of federal \n     criminal law or pertinent state regulatory agencies. Nor is \n     it the intention of this provision that the general public, \n     private or institutional investors, or other investor or \n     consumer protection groups be excluded from the SEC \n     rulemaking process. These views of these groups, who often \n     represent the victims of fraud, should be considered at \n     least on an equal footing with ``industry experts'' and \n     others who participate in the rulemaking process at the \n     SEC.\n       This section not only penalizes the willful failure to \n     maintain specified audit records, but also will result in \n     clear and reasonable rules that will require accountants to \n     put strong safeguards in place to ensure that such corporate \n     audit records are retained. Had such clear requirements and \n     policies been established at the time Andersen was \n     considering what to do with its audit documents, countless \n     documents might have been saved from the shredder. The idea \n     behind the statute is not only to provide for prosecution of \n     those who obstruct justice, but to ensure that important \n     financial evidence is retained so that law enforcement \n     officials, regulators, and victims can assess whether the law \n     was broken to begin with and, if so, whether or not such was \n     done intentionally, or with or without the knowledge or \n     assistance of an auditor.\n       Section 803 amends the Bankruptcy Code to make judgments \n     and settlements based upon securities law violations non-\n     dischargeable, protecting victims' ability to recover their \n     losses. Current bankruptcy law may permit such wrongdoers to \n     discharge their obligations under court judgments or \n     settlements based on securities fraud and other securities \n     violations. This loophole in the law should be closed to help \n     defrauded investors recoup their losses and to hold \n     accountable those who violate securities laws after a \n     government unit or private suit results in a judgment or \n     settlement against the wrongdoer. This provision is meant to \n     prevent wrongdoers from using the bankruptcy laws as a shield \n     and to allow defrauded investors to recover as much as \n     possible. To the maximum extent possible, this provision \n     should be applied to existing bankruptcies. The provision \n     applies to all judgments and settlements arising from state \n     and federal securities laws violations entered in the future \n     regardless of when the case was filed.\n       State securities regulators have indicated their strong \n     support for this change in the bankruptcy law. Under current \n     laws, state regulators are often forced to ``reprove'' their \n     fraud cases in bankruptcy court to prevent discharge because \n     remedial statutes often have different technical elements \n     than the analogous common law causes of action. Moreover, \n     settlements may not have the same collateral estoppel effect \n     as judgments obtained through fully litigated legal \n     proceedings. In short, with their resources already stretched \n     to the breaking point, state regulators must plow the same \n     ground twice in securities fraud cases. By ensuring \n     securities law judgments and settlements in state cases are \n     non-dischargeable, precious state enforcement resources will \n     be preserved and directed at preventing fraud in the first \n     place.\n       Section 804 protects victims by extending the statute of \n     limitations in private securities fraud cases. It would set \n     the statute of limitations in private securities fraud cases \n     to the earlier of five years after the date of the fraud or \n     two years after the fraud was discovered. The current statute \n     of limitations for most such fraud cases is three years from \n     the date of the fraud or one year after discovery, which can \n     unfairly limit recovery for defrauded investors in some \n     cases. It applies to all private securities fraud actions for \n     which private causes of actions are permitted and applies to \n     any case filed after the\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n     date of enactment, no matter when the conduct occurred. As \n     Attorney General Gregoire testified at the Committee hearing, \n     in the Enron state pension fund litigation the current short \n     statute of limitations has forced some states to forgo claims \n     against Enron based on alleged securities fraud in 1997 and \n     1998. In Washington state alone, the short statute of \n     limitations may cost hard-working state employees, \n     firefighters and police officers nearly $50 million in \n     lost Enron investments which they can never recover.\n       Especially in complex securities fraud cases, the current \n     short statute of limitations may insulate the worst offenders \n     from accountability. As Justices O'Connor and Kennedy said in \n     their dissent in Lampf, Pleva. Lipkind, Prupis, & Petigrow v. \n     Gilbertson, 111 S. Ct. 2773 (1991), the 5-4 decision \n     upholding this short statute of limitations in most \n     securities fraud cases, the current ``one and three'' \n     limitations period makes securities fraud actions ``all but a \n     dead letter for injured investors who by no conceivable \n     standard of fairness or practicality can be expected to file \n     suit within three years after the violation occurred.'' The \n     Consumers Union and Consumer Federation of America, along \n     with the AFL-CIO and other institutional investors, strongly \n     support the bill, and views this section in particular as a \n     needed measure to protect investors.\n       The experts agree with that view. In fact, the last two SEC \n     Chairmen supported extending the statute of limitations in \n     securities fraud cases. Former Chairman Arthur Levitt \n     testified before a Senate Subcommittee in 1995 that \n     ``extending the statute of limitations is warranted because \n     many securities frauds are inherently complex, and the law \n     should not reward the perpetrator of a fraud, who \n     successfully conceals its existence for more than three \n     years.'' Before Chairman Levitt, in the last Bush \n     administration, then SEC Chairman Richard Breeden also \n     testified before Congress in favor of extending the statute \n     of limitations in securities fraud cases. Reacting to the \n     Lampf opinion, Breeden stated in 1991 that ``[e]vents only \n     come to light years after the original distribution of \n     securities, and the Lampf cases could well mean that by the \n     time investors discover they have a case, they are already \n     barred from the courthouse.'' Both the FDIC and the State \n     securities regulators joined the SEC in calling for a \n     legislative reversal of the Lampf decisions at that time.\n       In fraud cases the short limitations period under current \n     law is an invitation to take sophisticated steps to conceal \n     the deceit. The experts have long agreed on that point, but \n     unfortunately they have been proven right again. As recent \n     experience shows, it only takes a few seconds to warm up the \n     shredder, but unfortunately it will take years for victims to \n     put this complex case back together again. It is time that \n     the law is changed to give victims the time they need to \n     prove their fraud cases.\n       Section 805 of the Act ensures that those who destroy \n     evidence or perpetrate fraud are appropriately punished. It \n     would require the Commission to consider enhancing criminal \n     penalties in cases involving obstruction of justice and \n     serious fraud cases where a large number of victims are \n     injured or when the victims face financial ruin.\n       The Act is not intended as criticism of the current \n     guidelines, which were based on the hard work of the \n     Commission to conform with the goals of prior existing law. \n     Rather, it is intended to join the provisions of the Act \n     which substantially raise current statutory maximums in the \n     law as a policy expression that the former penalties were \n     insufficient to deter financial misconduct and to request the \n     Commission to review and enhance its penalties as appropriate \n     in that light.\n       Currently, the U.S.S.G. recognize that a wide variety of \n     conduct falls under the offense of ``obstruction of \n     justice.'' For obstruction cases involving the murder of a \n     witness or another crime, the U.S.S.G. allow, by cross \n     reference, significant enhancements based on the underlying \n     crimes, such as murder or attempted murder. For cases when \n     obstruction is the only offense, however, they provide little \n     guidance on differentiating between different types of \n     obstruction. This provision requests that the Commission \n     consider raising the penalties for obstruction where no cross \n     reference is available and defining meaningful specific \n     enhancements and adjustments for cases where evidence and \n     records are actually destroyed or fabricated (and for more \n     serious cases even within that category of case) so as to \n     thwart investigators, a serious form of obstruction.\n       This provision and Title 11, also require that the \n     Commission consider enhancing the penalties in fraud cases \n     which are particularly extensive or serious, even in addition \n     to the recent amendments to the Chapter 2 guidelines for \n     fraud cases. The current fraud guidelines require that the \n     sentencing judge take the number of victims into account, but \n     only to a very limited degree in small and medium-sized \n     cases. Specifically, once there are more than 50 victims, the \n     guidelines do not require any further enhancement of the \n     sentence. A case with 51 victims, therefore, may be treated \n     the same as a case with 5,000 victims. As the Enron matter \n     demonstrates, serious frauds, especially in cases where \n     publicly traded securities are involved, can affect thousands \n     of victims.\n       In addition, current guidelines allow only very limited \n     consideration of the extent of devastation that a fraud \n     offense causes its victims. Judges may only consider whether \n     a fraud endangers the ``solvency or financial security'' of a \n     victim to impose an upward departure from the recommended \n     sentencing range. This is not a factor in establishing the \n     range itself unless the victim is a financial institution. \n     Subsection (5) requires the Commission to consider requiring \n     judges to consider the extent of such devastation in setting \n     the actual recommended sentencing range in cases such as the \n     Enron matter, when many private victims, including individual \n     investors, have lost their life savings. Finally this \n     provision requires a complete review of the Chapter 8 \n     corporate misconduct guidelines, which should include not \n     only monetary penalties but other actions designed to deter \n     organizational crime, such as probation and compliance \n     enforcement schemes.\n       Section 806 of the Act would provide whistleblower \n     protection to employees of publicly traded companies who \n     report acts of fraud to federal officials with the authority \n     to remedy the wrongdoing or to supervisors or appropriate \n     individuals within their company. Although current law \n     protects many government employees who act in the public \n     interest by reporting wrongdoing, there is no similar \n     protection for employees of publicly traded companies who \n     blow the whistle on fraud and protect investors. With an \n     unprecedented portion of the American public investing in \n     these companies and depending upon their honesty, this \n     distinction does not serve the public good.\n       In addition, corporate employees who report fraud are \n     subject to the patchwork and vagaries of current state laws, \n     even though most publicly traded companies do business \n     nationwide. Thus, a whistleblowing employee in one state \n     (e.g., Texas, see supra) may be far more vulnerable to \n     retaliation than a fellow employee in another state who takes \n     the same actions. Unfortunately, companies with a corporate \n     culture that punishes whistleblowers for being ``disloyal'' \n     and ``litigation risks'' often transcend state lines, and \n     most corporate employers, with help from their lawyers, know \n     exactly what they can do to a whistleblowing employee under \n     the law. U.S. laws need to encourage and protect those who \n     report fraudulent activity that can damage innocent investors \n     in publicly traded companies. The Act is supported by groups \n     such as the National Whistleblower Center, the Government \n     Accountability Project, and Taxpayers Against Fraud, all of \n     whom have written a letter placed in the Committee record \n     calling this bill ``the single most effective measure \n     possible to prevent recurrences of the Enron debacle and \n     similar threats to the nation's financial markets.''\n       This provision would create a new provision protecting \n     employees when they take lawful acts to disclose information \n     or otherwise assist criminal investigators, federal \n     regulators, Congress, their supervisors (or other proper \n     people within a corporation), or parties in a judicial \n     proceeding in detecting and stopping actions which they \n     reasonably believe to be fraudulent. Since the only acts \n     protected are ``lawful'' ones, the provision would not \n     protect illegal actions, such as the improper public \n     disclosure of trade secret information. In addition, a \n     reasonableness test is also provided under the subsection \n     (a)(1), which is intended to impose the normal reasonable \n     person standard used and interpreted in a wide variety of \n     legal contexts (See generally Passaic Valley Sewerage \n     Commissioners v. Department of Labor, 992 F. 2d 474, 478). \n     Certainly, although not exclusively, any type of corporate or \n     agency action taken based on the information, or the \n     information constituting admissible evidence at any later \n     proceeding would be strong indicia that it could support such \n     a reasonable belief. The threshold is intended to include all \n     good faith and reasonable reporting of fraud, and there \n     should be no presumption that reporting is otherwise, absent \n     specific evidence.\n       Under new protections provided by the Act, if the employer \n     does take illegal action in retaliation for such lawful and \n     protected conduct, subsection (b) allows the employee to \n     elect to file an administrative complaint at the Department \n     of Labor, as is the case for employees who provide assistance \n     in aviation safety. Only if there is not final agency \n     decision within 180 days of the complaint (and such delay is \n     not shown to be due to the bad faith of the claimant) may he \n     or she may bring a de novo case in federal court with a jury \n     trial available (See United States Constitution, Amendment \n     VII; Title 42 United States Code, Section 1983). Should such \n     a case be brought in federal court, it is intended that the \n     same burdens of proof which would have governed in the \n     Department of Labor will continue to govern the action. \n     Subsection (c) of this section requires both reinstatement of \n     the whistleblower, backpay, and all compensatory damages \n     needed to make a victim whole should the claimant prevail. \n     The Act does not supplant or replace state law, but sets a \n     national floor for employee protections in the context of \n     publicly traded companies.\n       Section 807 creates a new 25 year felony under Title 18 for \n     defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. \n     Currently, unlike bank fraud or health care fraud, there is \n     no generally accessible statute that deals with the specific \n     problem of securities fraud. In these cases, federal \n     investigators and prosecutors are forced either to resort to \n     a patchwork of technical Title 15 offenses and regulations, \n     which may criminalize particular violations of securities \n     law, or to treat the cases as generic mail or wire fraud \n     cases and to meet the technical elements of\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\n     those statutes, with their five year maximum penalties.\n       This bill, then, would create a new 25 year felony for \n     securities fraud--a more general and less technical provision \n     comparable to the bank fraud and health care fraud statutes \n     in Title 18. It adds a provision to Chapter 63 of Title 18 at \n     section 1348 which would criminalize the execution or \n     attempted execution of any scheme or artifice to defraud \n     persons in connection with securities of publicly traded \n     companies or obtain their money or property. The provision \n     should not be read to require proof of technical elements \n     from the securities laws, and is intended to provide needed \n     enforcement flexibility in the context of publicly traded \n     companies to protect shareholders and prospective \n     shareholders against all the types schemes and frauds which \n     inventive criminals may devise in the future. The intent \n     requirements are to be applied consistently with those found \n     in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1341, 1343, 1344, 1347.\n       By covering all ``schemes and artifices to defraud'' (see \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1344, 1341, 1343, 1347), new Sec. 1348 \n     will be more accessible to investigators and prosecutors and \n     will provide needed enforcement flexibility and, in the \n     context of publicly traded companies, protection against all \n     the types schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may \n     devise in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7421-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN: Mr. President, I arrived in Washington this morning after \nthe vote to invoke cloture on the nomination of Julia Smith Gibbons, to \nbe United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  It was my intention to be here in time to vote in favor of this \ncloture motion.\n  Unfortunately, the catenary wire providing power for Amtrak was \nknocked down in Elkton, MD.

Mr. President, I also take this opportunity today to right \na wrong. Over the past 2 years, members of The Federalist Society have \nbeen much maligned by some of my Democrat colleagues, no doubt because \nthey see political advantage in doing so. The Federalist Society has \neven been presented as an 'evil cabal' of conservative lawyers. Its \nmembers have been subjected to questions which remind one of the \nMcCarthy hearings of the early 1950's. Detractors have painted a \npicture which is surreal, twisted and untrue.\n  The truth is that liberal orthodoxies reign rampant and often \nunchecked in a majority of this countries law schools and in the legal \nprofession, and that the left is shocked that an association of \nconstitutionalist lawyers would exist, much less include the notable \nlegal minds it does.\n  During the mid-1990's, Professor James Lindgren of Northwestern \nUniversity Law School conducted a survey of law school professors and \ncame to the fallowing conclusion. At the faculties of the top 100 law \nschools 80 percent of law professors were Democrats, or leaned left, \nand only 13 percent were Republicans, or leaned right. These liberal \nprofessors promulgate their ideology in and outside the classroom.\n  Anyone associated with America's campuses or law schools knows that \nnonliberal views are regularly stifled and those espousing those views \nare often publicly shunned and ridiculed. It was this environment of \nhostility to freedom of expression and the exchange of ideas in \nuniversities that set the stage for the formation of the Federalist \nSociety. And given my Democrat colleagues' reaction to the Society, it \nappears to be fighting against liberal narrow-mindedness still.\n  In 1982, the Federalist Society was organized, not to foster any \npolitical agenda, but to encourage debate and public discourse on \nsocial and legal issues. Over the past 20 years the Federalist Society \nhas accomplished just that. It has served to open the channels of \ndiscourse and debate in many of America's law schools.\n  The Federalist Society espouses no official dogma. Its members share \nacceptance of three universal ideas: 1. that government's essential \npurpose is the preservation of freedom; 2. that our Constitution \nembraces and requires separation of governmental powers; and 3. that \njudges should interpret the law, not write it.\n  For the vast majority of Americans, these are not controversial \nissues. Rather, they are basic Constitutional assertions that are \nessential to the survival of our republic. They are truths that have \nunited Americans for more than two centuries. Recently we have seen the \nemergence of some groups that seek to undermine the third of these \nideas--that judges should not write laws. These groups have attempted \nto use the judiciary to circumvent the democratic process and impose \ntheir minority views on the American people.\n  This judicial activism is a nefarious practice that seeks to \nundermine the principle of democratic rule. It results in an unelected \noligarchy, government by a small elite. Judicial activism imposes the \nwill of a small group of politicized lawyers upon the American people \nand undermines the work of the people's representatives.\n  Indeed, if the radical left is successful, if we continue to appoint \njudges that are committed to writing law and not interpreting it, than \nall of us can just go home. We can resign ourselves to live under the \noligarchical rule of lawyers. I happen to know a few lawyers, and \nplease trust me when I say, this is not a good idea.\n  Beyond acceptance to its three key ideas, freedom, separation of \npowers, and that judges should not write laws, it is challenging, if \nnot impossible, to find consensus among Federalist Society members. Its \nmembers hold a wide array of differing views. They are so diverse that \nit is impossible to describe a Federalist Society philosophy.\n  The assertion that members are ideological carbon copies of each \nother is ludicrous. The Society revels in open, thoughtful, and \nrigorous debate on all issues. It rests on the premise that public \npolicy and social issues should not be accepted as part of a party-line \nbut rather warrant much thought and dialogue. Any organization that \nsponsors debate on issues of public importance, as opposed to self-\nserving indoctrination, is healthy for us all.\n  Now, how does the Federalist Society accomplish its goal? Not by \nlobbying Congress, writing amicus briefs, or issuing press releases. \nThe Federalist Society seeks only to sponsor fair, serious, and open \ndebate about the need to enhance individual freedom and the role of the \ncourts in saying what the law is rather than what it should be. The \nSociety believes that debate is the best way to ensure that legal \nprinciples that have not been the subject of sufficient attention for \nthe past several decades receive a fair hearing.\n  The Federalist Society's commitment to fair and open debate can be \nseen by a small sampling of some participants in its meetings and \nsymposiums. They have included scores of liberals like Justices Ruth \nBader Ginsburg and Stephen Bryer, Michael Dukakis, Barney Frank, Abner \nMikva, Alan Dershowitz, Laurence Tribe, Steve Shapiro, Christopher \nHitchins and Ralph Nader, just to name a few.\n  I would like to include for the Record a list of 60 participants in \nFederalist Society events that demonstrates the remarkable diversity of \nthought of Federalist Society events. One of them is Nadine Strossen, \nPresident of the ACLU, who has participated in Federalist Society \nfunctions regularly and constantly since its founding. She has praised \nits fundamental principle of individual liberty, its high-profile on \nlaw school campuses, and its intellectual diversity, noting that there \nis frequently strenuous disagreement among members about the role of \nthe courts. Strossen has even said that she cannot draw any firm \nconclusion about a potential judicial nominee's views based on the fact \nthat he is a Federalist Society member.\n  It seems to me that an organization that includes such a wide array \nof opinion serves this nation well and does not deserve the \nvilification it gets from the usual suspects.\n  There are many notable conservatives that also affiliate with the \nFederalist Society. But as the members of the Senate demonstrate, even \namongst those that are often labeled ``conservatives'' there is a much \ndisagreement on most social and political issues. Some often portray \nthe Federalist Society as a tightly-knit, well-organized coalition of \nconservative lawyers who are united by their right-wing ideology. This \nis far from true. Allow me to illustrate further.\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n  Two years ago the Washington Monthly published an article entitled \n``The Conservative Cabal That's Transforming American Law,'' which \ncited a 1999 decision by a panel of the D.C. Circuit's Court of Appeals \nas the ``network's most far-reaching victory in recent years''. The \ndecision overturned some of the EPA's clean-air standards on the \ngrounds that it was unconstitutional for Congress to delegate \nlegislative authority to the executive branch. C. Boyden Gray, a former \nWhite House Counsel for the first President Bush and a member of the \nFederalist Society's Board of Visitors, filed an amicus brief making \nthe winning argument.\n  However, this is not the smoking gun case that opponents of the \nFederalist Society would have us believe it to be to prove that it is \npart of the vast right wing conservative conspiracy. First, the case \nwas overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court, in a decision written by \nJustice Antonin Scalia, a frequent participant in Federalist Society \nactivities who was the faculty advisor to the organization when he \ntaught at the University of Chicago.\n  Second, the Washington Monthly piece also attacked Boyden Gray as a \nwater carrier for the Federalist Society for advancing Microsoft's \neffort against antitrust enforcement. Of course, Mr. Gray serves on the \nSociety's Board of Visitors with Robert Bork, who has been Microsoft's \nchief intellectual adversary.\n  Not quite the vast right wing conspiracy hobgoblin some of my \ncolleagues would have the American people believe in.\n  A close examination of the Federalist Society reveals not a tight-\nknit organization that demands ideological unity, but an association of \nlawyers, much like the early bar associations that first appeared in \nthis country in the late 19th century, made up of individuals from \nacross the political spectrum who are committed to the principles of \nfreedom and the rule of law according to the Constitution. As a former \nco-chairman myself, I applaud that the President has sought out its \nmembers to fill the federal bench.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          60 Diverse Participants in Federalist Society Events\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Justices\n\n  1.

Mr. President, yesterday a report was released by the \nGeneral Accounting Office, Gun Control: Potential Effects of Next-Day \nDestruction of NICS Background Check Records. The report provides \nevidence that one day is simply not enough time for law enforcement \nagencies to complete thorough and accurate analysis of purchase \nrecords. Under current National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem regulations, records of allowed firearms sales can be retained \nfor up to 90 days, after which the records must be destroyed. On July \n6, 2001, the Department of Justice published proposed changes to the \nNICS regulations that would reduce the maximum retention period from 90 \ndays to only one day.\n  Yesterday's GAO report found that during the first 6 months in which \nthe 90-day retention policy was in effect, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation used the records to launch 235 firearm-retrieval actions, \nan investigation and coordinated attempt to retrieve a firearm with \nstate or local law enforcement assistance. Of the 235 firearm-retrieval \nactions, 228 or 97 percent could have not been initiated under the one-\nday record destruction policy. An additional 179 firearm-retrieval \nactions could have been initiated under the 90-day record retention \npolicy, according to records, but the firearm had not yet been \ntransferred to the buyer. The one-day destruction policy, according to \nthe report, would make it difficult for the FBI to assist law \nenforcement agencies in gun-related investigations, and ultimately, \ncompromise public safety. Internal Department of Justice memos further \nindicate that the FBI's 90-day retention policy is within the scope of \nthe Brady Law.\n  The retention of NICS Background Check Records for a 90-day period of \ntime is critical, and I am greatly concerned by the Attorney General's \naction. I support the ``Use NICS in Terrorist Investigations Act'' \nintroduced by Senators Kennedy and Schumer. This legislation would \nsimply codify the 90-day period for law enforcement to retain and \nreview NICS data. The GAO report provides further evidence that the \nSchumer-Kennedy bill is good policy. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis common sense piece of gun-safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7422-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7422-S7423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

A gay man was beaten\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nby four men who yelled anti-gay slurs.

I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7423-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7423-S7424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCORRECTION OF THE RECORD REGARDING RESOURCES FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION \n                          DRUGS AND TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday some on the other side \nattacked last year's bipartisan tax relief legislation. They were led \nby the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Tom Daschle. As an \nexample of these claims, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record \nan article from yesterday's edition of Roll Call Daily.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Roll Call Daily, July 25, 2002]\n\n  Daschle Blames Bush Tax Cut for Failure on Prescription Drug Reform\n\n                           (By Polly Forster)\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) expressed \n     frustration with the chamber's failure to enact a sweeping \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit and blamed President' \n     Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut for ``starving'' the \n     opportunity to pass substantial reform.\n       Daschle also expressed doubt that a conference committee \n     will be able to work out the differences in the House and \n     Senate versions of trade legislation before the Houses \n     recesses this week.\n       Daschle charged that House Ways and Means Chairman Bill \n     Thomas (R-Calif.) was possibly undermining a key component of \n     the Senate trade bill by revisiting the details of the Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance bill and thereby delaying a final \n     result.\n       ``It sounds like he's trying to undermine the TAA \n     package,'' Daschle said. ``If that's the case, we'll wait \n     until September.''\n       Legislation on prescription drug benefits appeared \n     similarly in flux. Daschle said Democrats were forced to \n     revise their priorities because last year's tax cut shrunk \n     the possibilities available to them.\n       ``We don't have the resources because, in large measure, \n     the tax cut precludes it,'' Daschle said.'' Because of the \n     tax cut and the deficits we are now facing, we've got to be \n     concerned about the overall cost.''\n       But a Senate GOP leadership aide dismissed the validity of \n     that argument, saying that Democrats now find themselves in a \n     corner and are ``grasping at straws'' to avoid the blame.\n       ``Because Democrats stopped the bipartisan Finance \n     Committee from doing its work, they've caused every possible \n     drug proposal to fail in the Senate,'' said the GOP aid.\n       Since none of the proposals for drug benefit reform passed \n     through the Finance Committee, all measures are subject to a \n     60-vote threshold.\n       Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) has spent the \n     last several days in meetings with key lawmakers from both \n     sides in an effort to craft something most Senators could \n     agree to.\n       Daschle said the goal of the talks is to find a proposal \n     broad enough to win over at least 10 Republicans. ``We only \n     got 52'' for a Democratic bill, he said, ``and we need the \n     other eight. That means we've got to scale back and to \n     broaden our level of support.''\n       Daschle said Democrats will not be offering any more \n     proposals but instead will be looking to craft a bipartisan \n     measure.\n       Baucus spokesman Michael Siegel said the Senator was \n     looking at two approaches to the issue: using Medicare as the \n     channel to deliver drug benefits and where unavailable using \n     private companies, and also to extending a ``catastrophic'' \n     coverage bill that was short of nine votes Wednesday.\n       Daschle said the Senate will stay on the issue as long as \n     it takes,including the early part of September after the \n     recess, until there is a result--possibly forestalling \n     consideration of a bill to create the federal department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       ``It means our highest priority is to get the bill done and \n     we don't do other things until we get it done,'' he said.\n       Daschle vowed an equal commitment to retaining the worker \n     protection element in the trade package now in conference.\n       ``We're in no hurry,'' he said. ``It's more important to me \n     to have a good package even if that means we have to wait \n     until October.''\n       A top Senate Democratic aide said negotiations broke down \n     Thursday morning over the TAA element, which would provide \n     health coverage for workers displaced by international trade.\n       Senate Democrats expected Thomas to concede ground on that \n     part as the House was only just able to pass their bill on \n     the floor.\n       The breakdown left at least one Senate Democratic \n     leadership aid frustrated. ``It's ridiculous for Thomas to be \n     stuck on this because it's his chamber that needs to attract \n     the votes to pass the bill, not the Senate,'' said the aide.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is a very sophisticated, well-coordinated \ncampaign on the part of the Democratic Leadership to derail last year's \nbipartisan tax relief. It seems that everything that ails us as a \nnation is laid at the feet of the tax cut. I'm sure that the next \nattack will be that tax relief causes the Decline of Western \nCivilization. Or, perhaps, the Democratic Leadership would twist a \nphrase from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and claim that ``record high \ntaxes are the price we must pay for a civilized society.''\n  Many in the media agree with this concept and rarely, if ever, \nchallenge the factual basis for these attacks on last year's tax cut \nbill. Well, let me tell my friends in the Democratic Leadership, I'm \ngoing to correct the record every time. It's fine to attack tax relief, \nif you must, on ideological grounds. If the Democratic Leadership \nthinks we need to maintain record levels of taxation and keep growing \ngovernment. That's something on which we can disagree.\n  On facts, however. I'm going to correct the use of incorrect data. \nI'm also going to compare the record of the Democratic Leadership \nagainst the specific attack on the tax cut.\n  A couple days ago, I corrected the record on incorrect data used with \nrespect to the scoring of permanent death tax relief. Today, I'm going \nto take the latest attack and compare it with the record of the \nDemocratic Leadership.\n  The Roll Call Daily article is entitled ``Daschle blames Bush Tax Cut \nfor Failure on Prescription Drug Reform.'' According to the article, \nthe Distinguished Majority Leader said and I quote:\n\n       We don't have the resources, because, in large measure, the \n     tax cut precludes it. Because of the tax cut and the deficits \n     we are now facing, we've got to be concerned about the \n     overall cost.\n\n  Now, I noticed this same point being made by others in the Democratic \nLeadership. I must say the Democratic Leadership spends a lot of time \ncoordinating messages. They are very good at it. Perhaps, though, if \nless time were spent on perfecting partisan attacks on the President \nand Congressional Republicans, we might resolve more problems. After \nall, isn't that what we're paid to do? That is, do the People's \nbusiness.\n  So, the charge is the tax cut ate the surplus and there's not enough \nmoney left for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It's all the \nPresident's fault. It's the fault of the bipartisan budget resolution, \nBoy, do I get tired of hearing this stuff. It gets very old.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        COMPARISON OF BUSH, DEMOCRATIC, AND SENATE PASSED BUDGETS\n                     (Fiscal year 2002 through 2011)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Democratic     Senate\n                                   Bush budget  alternative     passed\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProject Surplus..................        5.6 T        5.6 T        5.6 T\n   Social Security Trust         2.0 T        2.5 T        2.5 T\n   Fund (for debt paydown)*......\n   Medicare Trust Fund     ...........        0.4 T      **0.4 T\n   (for debt paydown)*...........\nProjected Available Surplus......        3.6 T        2.7 T        2.7 T\nTax Cuts.........................        1.6 T        745 B        1.2 T\nHigh Priority Needs..............        212 B        744 B        849 B\n   Education.............         13 B        139 B        308 B\n   Prescription Drugs....        153 B        311 B        300 B\n   Defense...............         62 B        100 B         69 B\n   Agriculture...........         -1 B         88 B         58 B\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n \n   Health Coverage.......  ...........         80 B         36 B\n   Enforcement...........        -48 B         18 B        -41 B\n   Other.................         33 B          8 B        119 B\nStrengthen Social Security:\n   Using Social Security         600 B  ...........  ...........\n   Trust Fund Surplus............\n   Using non-Social        ...........        750 B  ...........\n   Security, Non-Medicare Surplus\nInterest.........................        461 B        490 B        572 B\nUnallocated......................      ***845B  ...........        129 B\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Because these trust funds are not needed in short term to pay benefits,\n  these amounts are used to pay down publicly-held debt.\n**Senate passed GOP resolution raids Medicare Trust Fund in 2002, 2005,\n  2006, 2007.\n***Includes $526 B from Medicare Trust Fund (OMB scoring).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Under that Democratic Alternative, ``resources,'' \nthat's the term Senator Daschle used, set aside for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit were $311 billion. Under the bipartisan \nbudget resolution, guess what, it's about the same number, $300 \nbillion. That's right, both sides allocated basically the same \nresources, $311 billion versus $300 billion for Medicare improvements \nand a prescription drug benefit. So, the Democratic budget had \nprevailed, we'd basically be where we are today.\n  There's another part of the record we have to examine. It's last \nyear's Democratic Alternative tax relief package. The Democratic \nalternative was supported by all members of the Democratic Leadership \nand all but three members of the Democratic Caucus. Well, guess what. \nAll of those Senators voted for a $1.260 trillion tax cut. That's 93 \npercent of the cost of the bipartisan tax relief. So, apparently 7 \npercent is a big difference. It's a big enough difference for the \nDemocratic Leadership to blame President Bush and the bipartisan group \nof Senators that supported the tax relief package.\n  I make this statement for one basic reason. The issues of budgeting, \nprescription drugs, and tax relief are important matters. Certainly \neveryone of us hears about these issues when we are back home. They are \nissues that our constituents expect us to resolve. Folks back home \nexpect us to be intellectually honest in debating these important \nmatters. When we debate these issues, we ought to be consistent in what \nwe're saying.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7424-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7424-S7425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAKING OUR STAND AGAINST HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I spent the first 20 years of my career \nstudying and working in medicine. I graduated from medical school in \n1978. After that, I trained as a surgical resident for eight years. I \nthen worked as a heart and lung transplant surgeon until I was elected \nto the United States Senate in 1994. During that time, HIV/AIDS went \nfrom a disease without a name to a global pandemic claiming nearly 20 \nmillion people infected.\n  It's hard to imagine an organism that cannot survive outside the \nhuman body can take such an immense toll on human life. But HIV/AIDS \nhas done just that--already killing thirteen million people. Today more \nthan 40 million people--including three million children--are infected \nwith HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is a plague of biblical proportions.\n  And it has only begun to wreak its destruction upon humanity. Though \none person dies from AIDS every ten seconds, two people are infected \nwith HIV in that same period of time. If we continue to fight HIV/AIDS \nin the future as we have in the past, it will kill 68 million people in \nthe 45 most affected countries between 2000 and 2020. We are losing the \nbattle against this disease\n  There is neither a cure nor a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. But we do have \nreliable and inexpensive means to test for it. Also, because we know \nhow the disease is spread, we know how to prevent it from being spread. \nWe even have treatments that can suppress the virus to almost \nundetectable levels and significantly reduce the risk of mothers \ninfected with HIV/AIDS from passing the disease to their children.\n  We have many tools at our disposal to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. \nBut are we using those tools as effectively as possible? The gloomy \nstatistics prove overwhelming that we are not. What we must do is focus \non what is truly needed and what is proven to work and marshal \nresources towards those solutions. We have beaten deadly diseases on a \nglobal scale before; we can win the battle against HIV/AIDS too.\n  More than 70 percent of people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide live \nin Sub-Saharan Africa. But the devastation of the disease--and its \npotential to devastate in the future--is by no means limited to Africa. \nHIV/AIDS is global and lapping against the shores of even the most \nadvanced and developed nations in the world.\n  Asia and the Pacific are home to 6.6 million people infected with \nHIV/AIDS--including 1 million of the five million people infected last \nyear. Infections are rising sharply--especially among the young and \ninjecting drug users--in Russia and other Eastern European countries. \nAnd the Americas are not immune. Six percent of adults in Haiti and \nfour percent of adults in the Bahamas are infected with HIV/AIDS.\n  I believe the United States must lead the global community in the \nbattle against HIV/AIDS. As Sir Elton John said in testimony before a \ncommittee on which I serve in the United States Senate, ``What America \nhas done for its people has made America strong. What America has done \nfor others has made America great.'' Perhaps in no better way can the \nUnited States show its greatness in the 21st century--and show its true \nselflessness to other nations--than leading a victorious effort to halt \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  But solving a global problem requires global leadership. \nInternational organizations, national governments, faith-based \norganizations and the private sector must coordinate with each other \nand work together toward common goals. And, most importantly, we must \nmake communities the focus of our efforts. Though global leadership \nmust come from places like Washington, New York and Brussels, resources \nmust be directed to where they are needed the most--to the men and \nwomen in the villages and clinics and schools fighting HIV/AIDS on the \nfront lines.\n  Adequate funding is and will remain crucial to winning the battle \nagainst HIV/AIDS. But just as crucial as the amount of funding is how \nit is spent. Should we spend on programs that prevent or lower the rate \nof infection? Should we spend on treatments that may prolong the life \nof those who are already infected? Should we spend on the research and \ndevelopment of a vaccine? The answer is yes . . . to all three \nquestions.\n  We can only win the battle against HIV/AIDS with a balanced approach \nof prevention, care and treatment, and the research and development of \nan effective vaccine. HIV/AIDS has already infected tens of millions of \npeople and will infect tens of millions more. We need to support proven \nstrategies that will slow the spread of the virus and offer those \nalready infected with the opportunity to live as normal lives as \npossible. And if our goal is to eradicate HIV/AIDS--and I believe that \nis an eminently achievable goal--then we must develop a highly \neffective vaccine.\n  But even with proven education programs or free access to anti-\nretroviral drugs or a vaccine that is 80 to 90 percent effective, our \nability to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS and treat those already infected \nwould be hampered. The infrastructure to battle HIV/AIDS in the most \naffected areas is limited at best. We need to train healthcare workers, \nhelp build adequate health facilities, and distribute basic lab and \ncomputer equipment to make significant\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nand sustainable progress over the long-term.\n  To win the battle against HIV/AIDS, we must not only fight the \ndisease itself, but also underlying conditions that contribute to its \nspread--poverty, starvation, civil unrest, limited access to \nhealthcare, meager education systems and reemerging infectious \ndiseases. Stronger societies, stronger economies and stronger \ndemocracies will facilitate a stronger response to HIV/AIDS and ensure \na higher quality of life in the nations most affected by and most \nvulnerable to the disease and its continued spread.\n  And we can make significant progress without vast sums of money and \nburgeoning new programs. Take, for example, providing something as \nbasic and essential as access to clean water. 300 million or 45 percent \nof people in Sub-Saharan Africa don't have access to clean water. And \nthose who are fortunate enough to have access sometimes spend hours \nwalking to and from a well or spring.\n  It costs only $1,000 to build a ``spring box'' that provides access \nto natural springs and protects against animal waste run-off and other \nelements that may cause or spread disease. 85 percent of the 10 million \npeople who live in Uganda don't have access to a nearby supply of clean \nwater. It would cost only $25 million to build enough ``spring boxes'' \nto provide most of the people living in rural Uganda with nearby access \nto clean water.\n  Providing access to clean water is just one of the many ways in which \nthe global community can empower the people most affected by and most \nvulnerable to HIV/AIDS. In some cases, such efforts--like supporting \ndemocracy and encouraging free markets--may cost little or take a long \ntime, but they will make a significant difference in the battle against \nHIV/AIDS and the quality of life of billions of people throughout the \nworld.\n  We have defeated infectious diseases before--sometimes on an even \nlarger scale. Smallpox, for example, killed 300 million people in the \n20th century. And as late as the 1950's, it afflicted up to 50 million \npeople per year. But by 1979 smallpox was officially eradicated thanks \nto an aggressive and concerted global effort.\n  What if we had not launched that effort in 1967? What if we had \nwaited another 35 years? Smallpox likely would have infected 350 \nmillion and killed 40 million more people. That is a hefty price for \ninaction--a price that we should be grateful we did not pay then, and \nwe should not want to pay now.\n  Right now we are losing the battle against HIV/AIDS. But that doesn't \nmean we can't win it in the end. Indeed, I believe we will ultimately \neradicate HIV/AIDS. We have the tools to slow the spread of the disease \nand provide treatment to those already infected. And we have the \nscientific knowledge to develop an effective vaccine. But we need to \nfocus our resources on what is truly needed and what is proven to work. \nAnd we need global leadership to meet a global challenge.\n  In 2020, when it is estimated that more than 85 million people will \nhave died from HIV/AIDS, how will we look back upon this day? Will we \nhave proven the experts right with inaction? Or will we have proven \nthem wrong with initiative? I hope that we will be able to say that in \nthe year 2002 we took our stand against HIV/AIDS and began to turn back \nwhat could have been, but never became the most deadly disease in the \nhistory of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7425-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7425-S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CBO ESTIMATE OF THE TAX SHELTER TRANSPARENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

It also would repeal the current rules regarding \n     registration of tax shelters and instead require persons who \n     assist with transactions in such shelters (``material \n     advisors'') to report certain information to the Secretary of \n     the Treasury. The bill would impose a penalty on those \n     material advisors who fail to file the information completely \n     and accurately.\n       The Congressional Budge Office (CBO) and the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the bill \n     would increase governmental receipts by $17 million in 2002, \n     by $601 million over the 2002-2007 period, and by about $1.5 \n     billion over the 2002-2012 period. Since S. 2498 would affect \n     receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       JCT has determined that the bill contains no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets \n     of state, local, or tribal governments. JCT has determined \n     that the provision of the bill relating to reportable \n     transactions and tax shelters contain private-sector \n     mandates, and that the cost of complying with these mandates \n     would exceed the threshold established by UNRA ($115 million \n     in 2002 adjusted annually for inflation) in 2005 and 2006.\n\n\n                 ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the \n     following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                                           -----------------------------------------------------\n                                                              2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Changes in Revenues\n \nEstimated Revenues........................................       17       59      102      134      140      147\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                            BASIS OF ESTIMATE\n\n       All estimates were provided by JCT.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. \n3764, the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. While not perfect, this is important \nlegislation. I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, for his \nrelentless effort to usher this landmark legislation through the \nSenate. I am proud to have worked with him on such an important cause.\n  To restore some level of confidence, the accounting reform \nlegislation we have passed is critical to stem the corporate greed \nthreatening our economy. Over the last several months the market has \nlost considerable value. The dollar is at a 2-year low. Investors are \nquestioning the strength of our financial markets. Each day seems to \nbring new revelation of corporate excess--some horrific story about \nunabashed corporate greed and malfeasance. It is a seemingly endless \nonslaught. We don't know where it will end. And, frankly, we fear how \ndeep it might go.\n  There is a crisis of confidence in American business. It runs deep, \nwith revelations about cooked books, fraudulent numbers, inflated \nvalues, and stock options that make the average working American--who \nearns about $31,000 a year and fears for his or her pension and health \ncare benefits--sick. In fact, a Pew Forum survey conducted in March, \nlong before the recent revelations, said the esteem in which business \nexecutives are held is falling by the day. I shudder to think what \nthose numbers would be now.\n  Something is clearly wrong with the way corporate America is doing \nbusiness. Everyone here knows that--and--if you follow the money--you \nwill see that investors also know it. They are registering their \nconcern by pulling out of the market. Some have lost their retirement \nsavings. Others have to postpone their retirement. They are unable to \npay college tuition. Surely they have a right to expect a little truth \nin accounting.\n  The accounting reform legislation we approve today goes a long way to \nrestore their confidence and stem the tide of market uncertainty. It \nwill bring accountability and transparency to corporations, their \nofficials, and their accountants. We should insist on nothing less.\n  In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley bill includes significant new \ncriminal laws for white collar offenses, and raises penalties for a \nnumber of existing ones.\n  I am proud to have sponsored, along with my good friend from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, S. 2717, the White-Collar Penalty Enhancement Act of \n2002. It grew out of a series of hearings I held this year in the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs in which we heard about the \n``penalty gap'' between white collar offenses and other serious Federal \ncriminal offenses. The Senate unanimously adopted our bill as an \namendment to the Sarbanes bill several weeks ago, and we are pleased \nthat its key provisions are in the legislation approved by the House-\nSenate conference. Let me briefly summarize those provisions which will \nbecome law once the President signs this legislation.\n  Our bill significantly raised penalties for wire and mail fraud, two \ncommon offenses committed by white collar crooks in defrauding \nfinancial victims. It also created a new 10-year felony for criminal \nviolations under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). \nUnder current law, a car thief who committed interstate auto theft was \nsubject to 10 years in prison, while a pension thief who committed a \ncriminal violation of ERISA was subject to up to 1 year in prison. Our \nbill now treats pension theft under ERISA like other serious financial \nfrauds by raising the penalties to 10 years.\n  Our bill also amended the Federal conspiracy statute which currently \ncarries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison. In contrast, in our \nFederal drug statutes, a drug kingpin convicted of conspiracy is \nsubject to the maximum penalty contained in the predicate offense which \nis the subject of the conspiracy--a penalty which can be much higher \nthan 5 years. I say what is good for the drug kingpin is good for the \nwhite collar crook. Thus, our bill harmonized conspiracy for white \ncollar fraud offenses with our drug statutes. Now, executives who \nconspire to defraud investors will be subject to the same tough \npenalties--up to 20 years--as codefendants who actually carry out the \nfraud.\n  Our bill also directed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review our \nexisting Federal sentencing guidelines. As you know, the sentencing \nguidelines carefully track the statutory maximum penalties that \nCongress sets for specific criminal offenses. Our bill requires the \nsentencing commission to go back and recalibrate the sentencing \nguidelines to raise penalties for the white collar offenses affected by \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, and most significantly, our bill required top corporate \nofficials to certify the accuracy of their companies' financial reports \nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Incredibly, under current law, there is no requirement that corporate \nofficials certify the accuracy of these reports. As we have seen in the \ncases of WorldCom and others, this is no small matter. Willful \nmisstatements about the financial health of a company--once uncovered--\ncan lead, almost overnight, to a company's bankruptcy, wholesale loss \nof jobs for its employees, and a total collapse in the value of the \ncompany's pension funds.\n  That is why Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan last week \ntestified before the Senate Banking Committee that imposing criminal \nsanctions on CEOs who knowingly misrepresent the financial health of \ntheir company is the key to real reform of corporate wrongdoing.\n  I am pleased that this centerpiece of the Senate-passed accounting \nbill is retained in the final legislation. Our provision is simple: \ncorporate officials who cook the books and then lie about their \ncompanies' financial health will go to jail. Our bill says that all \nCEOs and CFOs of publicly traded companies must certify that their \nfinancial reports filed with the SEC are accurate. If they \n``knowingly'' certify a false report, they are subject to a 10-year \nfelony; if they ``willfully'' certify a false report, they are subject \nto a 20-year felony.\n  But we may have left one stone unturned. I regret that this final \nbill makes a small but significant change from the original Biden-Hatch \namendment put the chairman of the board on the hook, along with the CEO \nand CFO. This final bill removed the board chairman from the group of \ncorporate officials who are required to certify the accuracy of the \nreports. I think that is a mistake. Contrary to what some in the \nbusiness community argued, requiring the board chairman to certify the \naccuracy of these financial reports would not have threatened the \nmanagement of a corporation or the integrity of its executives.\n  Rather, our bill merely would have formalized what should be normal \nprocedure--and what every American thinks is plain old common sense--\nnamely that corporate executives certify that their books are not \ncooked\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nand their numbers are truthful. I do not see--and I am sure the \nAmerican people fail to see--what is wrong with demanding truthfulness \nin the valuation of a publicly traded company. It would seem to me that \nthose in positions of responsibility in the business community, at \nevery level--from the chairman of the board on down--should embrace the \nnotion of truth in accounting.\n  Why would they demand anything less after what we have seen in the \nlast few weeks with a $4 billion discrepancy in WorldCom's books? After \nall, ``the buck stops'' with the chairman of the board--to whom the CEO \nand CFO report. It strikes me as crazy that we will now hold the CEO \nand CFO responsible, but not their boss. Indeed, as many have recently \npointed out, in most American corporations, the CEO is the chairman of \nthe board. To let board chairs off the hook could create a loophole \nwhere crooked CEO's simply change their title to escape accountability \nfor their corporate filings.\n\n  Some naysayers have suggested that the certification requirement \nwould undermine the ability of the chair to oversee and act \nindependently of the chief executive officer. It is absurd that a \nrequirement that merely prohibits top corporate officers from lying \nabout the company's financial health would sacrifice board \nindependence. If anything, it ensures proper oversight by fostering a \nhealthy division of responsibility between management and the board of \ndirectors, by encouraging the board chair to be actively engaged in the \nperiodic process of checking the accuracy of financial statements; and \nby recognizing that the board chair has a vital role in ``stopping \ncorporate debacles'' by not knowingly or willfully contributing to the \nfiling of false financial reports.\n  Other opponents suggested that the certification requirement would \nlikely drive independent chairmen out of business and discourage \notherwise good business leaders from serving on boards of directors. \nThis is the same old ``sky is falling'' claim that Wall Street uttered \nduring consideration of the original securities legislation in the \n1930s, and it has repeated this mantra with virtually every \ncongressional reform offered ever since.\n  Truth be told, the certification requirement only imposes criminal \nsanctions for top corporate officials who lie about their financial \nrecords. Specifically, it only applies to ``knowing'' and ``willful \nfailures to certify financial statements--a very high standard. It \nwould be one thing if the requirement applied criminal sanctions on a \n``strict liability'' or ``neglience'' standard to board chairs who \ncertify false reports. I could even understand their concern under the \noriginal ``reckless'' standard--that is, that the board chair ``should \nhave known'' that the statements were false. But our requirement is \nonly triggered where top corporate officials knowingly or willfully \ncertify financial statements that they know to be false. So, only top \ncorporate officers who are consciously aware of a false statement--and \nnot those who act out of ignorance, mistake, accident or even \nsloppiness--would conceivably be subject to criminal sanctions. It is \ntroubling, but quite revealing, that even this relatively meek \ncertification would alarm some in the business community.\n  Regrettably, that is the stone that was left unturned. I wish we had \nturned it. I wish we had, in our infinite wisdom, included board \nchairmen in our legislation.\n  Nevertheless, this bill represents a huge step forward. It will \nstrengthen accountability. It will tell CEOs and CFOs--we expect you to \nwatch your books, and not bury your heads in the sand!'' It will given \nprosecutors important new tools to fight white collar crime. It will \ngive judges the ability to impose meaningful sentences for white collar \ncrooks.\n  In closing, a common theme I have heard at our Crime Subcommittee \nhearings is that white collar crimes are not ``crimes of passion,'' as \na general rule. Rather, they are the result of a careful, ``cost-\nbenefit'' analysis in which the crook considers his chance of being \ncaught; and his chances of actually going to prison. To date, it was a \npretty safe bet for the white collar crook to assume he would avoid \ndetection, and, even if he was detected, he would not go to jail.\n  I have a message today for white collar crooks: ``We are deadly \nserious. We will prosecute you to fullest extent of the law. And we \nwill put you in jail for your crimes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7427-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7427-S7428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            INFESTED PINONS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my \nefforts to raise awareness of the dire situation we are facing in the \nwestern United States due to the ongoing drought.\n  I have been speaking on the Senate floor repeatedly emphasizing the \nimpact the drought is having on the west, and especially its impact on \nNew Mexico. The water situation has affected businesses and the \nlivestock industry, and it has turned forests into tinderboxes.\n  Now, it appears that there is another problem arising from the lack \nof water. A recent article by the Albuquerque Journal highlights the \nfact that ``hundreds of thousands of bark beetles [are] killing Pinon \npines all over New Mexico.'' These are ``trees that have survived New \nMexico's arid climate for 75 or 100 years [and] are [now] succumbing to \nthe beetles.''\n  Under normal conditions, stressed trees would use internal sap \npressure to fend off an infestation. However, under current conditions, \nthe trees do not have enough moisture to adequately fight back, and \nthey are overwhelmed by the beetles and devastated. They have to be cut \ndown, stacked, and covered with plastic to prevent the escape of the \nbeetles.\n  If New Mexico's Pinon trees suffer, so too will some area economies. \nNew Mexico is known for its unique food flavors and its native art. \nPinon nuts are a true New Mexico treat which can be harvested and eaten \nas a snack. Roasted nuts can sell for around $9 a pound and bring much \nneeded tourism dollars to our state. In addition, Pinon pitch can be \nused as a glaze for Navajo pottery providing the finishing touches to \ntheir beautiful designs. Prolonged damage to the Pinon trees will \ncreate further hardships for New Mexico's economy.\n  With each passing day, the conditions in New Mexico will continue to \nbecome worse. At some point or another, every individual in New Mexico \nwill feel the impact of this drought and continue to face hardships \nuntil we take proper action to alleviate the situation.\n  I ask that the July 24, 2002, Albuquerque Journal article entitled, \n``Parched Pinon Under Deadly Attack'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, July 24, 2002]\n\n                   Parched Pinons Under Deadly Attack\n\n                           (By Tania Soussan)\n\n       First came the fires. Then withered crops. Now the \n     drought's latest plague: hundreds of thousands of bark \n     beetles killing pinon pines all over New Mexico.\n       ``In many areas, they're taking out all of the trees,'' \n     said Bob Cain, a New Mexico State University forest \n     entomologist.'' . . . It's going to be a long time before \n     there's many pinon in there again.''\n       Even before the drought of 2002, the trees faced still \n     competition for water because forests have grown overly dense \n     during decades of human fire suppression.\n       The drought has made the situation even worse. Without \n     adequate water, the pinons can't repel the bark beetles that \n     burrow into vital tissues, lay eggs and munch away.\n       ``It's been something that's been building the last several \n     years, especially since 2000,'' Cain said, adding that the \n     bark beetles are one of nature's ways of thinning a forest.\n       Carol Sutherland, the New Mexico Department of \n     Agriculture's top bug expert, agreed.\n       ``Trees that are under stress are getting hammered badly by \n     all manner of bark beetles,'' she said recently.\n       The worst infestations are in the area between Magdalena \n     and Quemado in the western part of the state, around Ojo \n     Caliente in northern New Mexico, in the Sacramento Mountains \n     and Ruidoso.\n       Near Silver City, ponderosa pines also are being hit hard.\n       Even trees that have survived New Mexico's arid climate for \n     75 or 100 years are succumbing to the beetles this year, said \n     Terry Rogers, forest entomologist for the U.S. Forest Service \n     in New Mexico.\n       On a hillside outside of Santa Fe, Cain recently examined a \n     pocket of pinons fighting a hopeless battle for life. The \n     pine needles on one tree were turning a pale, whitish green. \n     Another tree already had gone reddish brown.\n       ``There's nothing you can do to save this tree,'' Cain \n     said. ``This drought has been so\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\n     severe that even trees that should have enough resources \n     around them are getting hit.''\n       Pencil lead-sized holes in the trunk marked where the \n     beetles entered, and small piles of fine sawdust on the \n     branches and the ground were signs of their success.\n       In addition, there were several ``pitch tubes'' on the \n     broad trunk. The tree had spurted out resin, or sap, in an \n     attempt to eject the beetles. A healthy tree can fight off \n     beetles that way, but drought means the trees don't have \n     enough moisture to produce the needed sap.\n       Bark beetles are efficient killers.\n       Once a few successfully bore into a pinon or ponderosa \n     pine, they send out a chemical signal that attracts thousands \n     of other beetles.\n       They invade the phloem tissue right under the bark, the \n     tissue that carries sugars from the pine needles to the \n     tree's roots. The beetles also carry pockets of fungus on \n     their bodies. The fungus attacks the water-conducting tissues \n     of the tree.\n       Once the signs of beetle infestation are clear, it's too \n     late to save the tree.\n       ``You really have no good evidence of beetles in the tree \n     until the tree is fading,'' Cain said. ``Insecticides are not \n     efficient at that point.''\n       The only solution is to cut down the tree and get rid of \n     it--and the beetles inside--to stop the beetle invasion from \n     spreading to other trees. To use it for firewood, first \n     stack the logs in the sun and cover them with plastic for \n     several days to kill the beetles.\n       The insecticide Sevin can be used to protect high-value \n     trees that are at risk, but Cain does not recommend it for \n     general use. Watering trees so they are able to fight off an \n     attack also can help.\n       ``The good news is if we get these monsoons, the trees will \n     become more resistant,'' he said.\n       Drought also has increased populations of spider mites in \n     corn crops in eastern New Mexico.\n       ``It can be quite severe,'' said Mike English, head of the \n     NMSU Extension Service's Agricultural Science Center in Los \n     Lunas. ``It can lose half your crop.''\n       The drought could be making blood-sucking kissing bugs a \n     problem in the southern part of the state, Sutherland said.\n       The bugs' usual prey, small rodents and birds, probably are \n     in shorter supply so they are biting people and leaving \n     behind big, itchy welts, she said.\n       ``You've seen mosquito bites but you ain't seen nothing \n     yet,''she said. ``These are a lot worse.''\n       Still, the situation in New Mexico could be worse.\n       Grasshoppers and Mormon crickets are ravaging crops and \n     pastures in Nebraska and other Western states in what could \n     be the biggest such infestation since World War II, according \n     to agricultural officials.\n       There were early reports of a few pockets of grasshopper \n     problems in New Mexico, in Lea and Eddy counties and near \n     Silver City, English said. But Sutherland said there were no \n     reports of major problems in the state as of mid-\n     July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7428-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE OREGON RED CROSS\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as I am sure many of my \ncolleagues are aware, as I speak here today on the floor, fire \ncontinues to rage across the state of Oregon. At last count, there were \nno fewer than fifteen fires burning throughout the state, leaving \nbehind hundreds of thousands of charred acres and a sobering path of \ndestruction. As such, I stand here to salute and pay tribute to the \nbenevolent Oregonians of the Red Cross who, throughout this tragedy, \nhave responded with remarkable compassion and service to their \ncommunities.\n  When fire first broke out near my own home in Pendleton, OR, the \nUmatilla Chapter of the Red Cross was there and opened an emergency \nshelter for residents of fire threatened homes. More than twenty paid \nand volunteer staff enlisted for what fortunately became a substantial \n``cold start'' exercise.\n  In Lake County, Oregon, where the Winter, Toolbox Complex, and \nGrizzly Complex fires have combined to form a 115,000 acre inferno, the \nRed Cross has been on the ground, organizing local residents and \nsetting up a shelter to disseminate information and to provide aid to \naffected families. That shelter remains on standby status today, \npending containment of the fire, which is not expected for another \nweek.\n  There are similar examples throughout the state and throughout the \ncountry of local Red Cross chapters responding to help friends and \nneighbors in need. For as tragic as this fire season has been to date, \nthe staff and volunteers of the Red Cross have responded with an equal \nlevel of kindness and selflessness.\n  This has been a very emotionally charged past few months. As a U.S. \nSenator and as an Oregonian, I am deeply proud of how the people in my \nstate have responded to life-threatening crises. The generosity shown \nby so many truly reaffirms one's faith in the goodness of people. \nToday, I salute the workers and the volunteers who gave and continue to \ngive of themselves to help our communities in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7428-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ROSELLA FRENCH PORTERFIELD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly \namazing and admirable individual, Mrs. Rosella French Porterfield. This \nSaturday, the Elsmere Park Board will be rededicating the Rosella \nFrench Porterfield Park to honor the retired educator, who played such \na vital part in the successful integration of the Erlanger-Elsmere \nIndependent School System.\n  A bronze plaque depicting Mrs. Porterfield holding the hands of a \nyoung Debbie Onkst of Erlanger, a white student who later followed in \nMrs. Porterfield's footsteps as a librarian for the school system, and \nElsmere Mayor Bill Bradford, northern Kentucky's first African-American \nMayor, will be unveiled.\n  Looking back on Rosella Porterfields' life and her many \naccomplishments, I am impressed the positive strides one African-\nAmerican woman was able to make in a nearly all-white community during \nthe 1950s. But once you hear people talk of Rosella, you understand the \nsimple fact that amazing people can do amazing things.\n  A Daviess County native, Rosella received a graduate degree during a \ntime when African-American women did not accomplish such things due to \ninstitutional and personal biases. Her first job as an educator was at \nBarnes Temple Church on Elsmere's Fox Street. After 7 years at Barnes \nTemple, Rosella moved to Wilkins Heights School in Elsmere, where she \nsuccessfully transformed the one depleted school library into a place \nthat fostered and encouraged educational excellence. But even as hard \nas Rosella worked, the segregated school system constantly worked to \nher disadvantage.\n  In 1955, 1 year after the U.S. Supreme Court abolished segregated \nschools, Rosella Porterfield approached Superintendent Edgar Arnett. \nShe told him the time was right to bring white and black together in an \neducational atmosphere. She firmly believed that if the kids could be \nbrought together in an effort to achieve common goals, they could learn \nto live together in peace and harmony. Mr. Arnett listened to Rosella \nand promptly took her proposal to the school board. In turn, the school \nboard unanimously approved a phased-in integration starting in the \nlower grades.\n  Erlanger-Elsmere schools integrated in what Time magazine recognized \nas a very smooth and peaceful manner, a very uncommon phenomenon at the \ntime. The schools were not forced to action by any outside factors such \nas government officials or military personnel. It was a voluntary and \nrational approach to a community's educational needs. This happened \nlargely because of the efforts of individuals like Rosella Porterfield.\n  I kindly ask that my fellow colleagues join me in paying tribute to \nMrs. Porterfield for her vision, persistence, and patience. When I \nthink of Rosella's actions and the effect she had on her community, I \nrecall the words of Winston Churchill, who said, in reference to the \nheroic efforts of Great Britain's RAF, ``Never have so many owed so \nmuch to so few.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7428-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7428-S7429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TONY TURNER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy dear friend, the late Tony Turner. On June 30, 2002, Tony passed \naway after succumbing to injuries suffered in a tragic car accident. He \nwas only 40 years old.\n  I want to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt condolences to \nhis wife Geraldine, his two children, Courtney and Cameron, and the \nrest of his family and friends. Tony made it easy for people to \nremember him, leaving behind a legacy as a loving husband and father, \nloyal friend, successful broadcaster, and community leader. He was a \nspirited individual who cherished life and enjoyed helping others. He \nwas\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nfamous for his self-deprecating sense of humor and brightened the lives \nof many people with his light-hearted jokes. Tony will be remembered \nfor many reasons, not the least of which is his dedication to his \nfamily and friends.\n  Born and raised in eastern Kentucky, Tony was a widely respected \nbroadcaster. Over the course of his 26-year career, he worked his way \nfrom the position of radio disc jockey to television news anchor and \nstation manager. Tony's passion for broadcasting developed at an early \nage. He landed his first job at WFSR radio in Harlan, and was general \nmanager of that station from 1976 to 1986. After 10 years in radio, \nTony moved to television and worked as a reporter and general \nassignment editor at WYMT-TV in Hazard. Tony was an outstanding \njournalist and had the ability to connect with just about everyone. His \nunique skills were quickly realized and he went on to become the \nstation's news director and 6 p.m. news anchor. In 2001, he was named \ngeneral manager and vice president of WYMT-TV.\n  Anyone who knows Tony can attest to the fact that he absolutely loved \npolitics. His fair and balanced approach to the subject was widely \nrespected in eastern Kentucky and he often was asked to moderate \npolitical debates. During his 16 years at WYMT-TV, he anchored a number \nof highly acclaimed political talk shows, including ``Issues and \nAnswers . . . The Mountain Edition'' and ``Point Counterpoint.'' I had \nthe pleasure of appearing on Tony's shows a number of times, and I \nalways enjoyed talking politics with him. Tony was an engaging \ninterviewer and never shied away from asking tough questions. At the \nsame time, he was always honest and fair. Tony Turner was a one-of-a-\nkind journalist and he will be sorely missed.\n  As much as he is recognized for his professional life, Tony is also \nwell known for his kind heart and commitment to public service. He was \ninvolved in a variety of good causes and actively used his high profile \nto better the lives of others. Tony was a longtime supporter and cohost \nof the annual Children's Miracle Network Telethon, which helped raise \nmoney for the University of Kentucky's Children's Hospital. He also was \nchairman of the board of directors of the Pride Program, and served on \nthe boards of the Center for Rural Development and the Eastern Kentucky \nLeadership Foundation. Additionally, he was an active member of the \nLoyall First Baptist Church.\n  At times like these, I am reminded of the frailty of life and the \nimportance of friends and family. Tony understood and valued these \nthings and has left a legacy of excellence for all to remember. \nAlthough his passing leaves a great void in the hearts of many, I hope \nit will be a comfort to his family and friends to know that he was \nloved and admired by countless people in his community and throughout \nthe State of Kentucky. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer \nour deepest condolences to his loved ones and express our gratitude for \nhis many contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7429-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING GUNNERY SERGEANT STEPHANIE K. MURPHY, UNITED STATES MARINE \n CORPS, ON BECOMING THE FIRST FEMALE DRILL INSTRUCTOR AT NAVAL OFFICER \n                            CANDIDATE SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, at this time of great challenge \nto our Nation, it is with immense pride that we take a moment to \nrecognize the efforts of the men and women in our armed forces. I rise \ntoday to honor one woman in particular who will be making history next \nweek. On Friday, August 2, 2002, the United States Navy's Officer \nCandidate School will graduate its first class trained by a female \ndrill instructor. Although women have played a vital role in our armed \nforces, and specifically in the Navy and Marine Corps, for many years, \nGunnery Sergeant Stephanie K. Murphy is the first Class Drill \nInstructor to train future Naval officers.\n  A native of Pine Bluff, AR, Gunnery Sergeant Murphy has served in the \nMarine Corps since 1988. In 1996, Murphy graduated from Drill \nInstructor School in Parris Island, SC where she completed six cycles \ntraining Marine enlisted recruits. After receiving an accelerated \npromotion to Gunnery Sergeant, Murphy requested to go to Pensacola, FL \nin September 2001 to train Naval Officer Candidates.\n  Gunnery Sergeant Murphy follows in the proud tradition of trail-\nblazing women in the military, women such as Opha Mae Johnson, who \nbecame one of the first 305 women accepted for duty in the Marine Corps \nReserve on August 12, 1918. During World War II, women returned to the \nCorps to ``free a man to fight.'' By the end of World War II, a total \nof 23,145 officer and enlisted women reservists served in the Marine \nCorps. Unlike their predecessors, women Marines in World War II \nperformed over 200 military assignments. In addition to clerical work, \ntheir numbers included parachute riggers, mechanics, radio operators, \nmap makers, motor transport support, and welders. Women Marines became \na permanent part of the regular Marine Corps on June 12, 1948 when \nCongress passed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act.\n  Today, women account for over four percent of all Marine officers and \nover five percent of the active duty enlisted force. Like their \ndistinguished predecessors, women in the Marine Corps today continue to \nserve proudly and capably in whatever capacity their country and Corps \nrequire.\n  Marine Corps drill instructors have helped train Naval Officer \nCandidates since the days of the Navy's World War II Pre-Flight \nTraining Schools. This link was reaffirmed following World War II to \nstrengthen the bond that connects the Navy/Marine Corps Team.\n  In an uncertain world, Americans know that we can count on our men \nand women in uniform. It is with overwhelming pride that we recognize \ntheir tremendous sacrifice and determination. We ask that you join us \ntoday in honoring Gunnery Sergeant Stephanie Murphy and all the \ncourageous individuals serving in the military.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7429-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7429-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7429-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to amend the National Maritime Heritage Act of 1994 \nto reaffirm and revise the designation of America's National Maritime \nMuseum, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing America's \nNational Maritime Museums Act of 2002. This legislation would designate \nan additional 19 maritime museums as ``American National Maritime \nMuseums'' nationwide. Maritime Museums are dedicated to advancing \nmaritime and nautical science by fostering the exchange of maritime \ninformation and experience and by promoting advances in nautical \neducation.\n  The America National Maritime Museum designation would include a \ncommitment on the part of each institution toward accomplishing a \ncoordinated education initiative, resources management program, \nawareness campaign, and heritage grants program. Maritime museums in \nAmerica will be dedicated to illuminating humankind's experience with \nthe sea and the events that shaped the course and progress of \ncivilization.\n  Museum collections are composed of hundreds of thousands of maritime \nitems, including ship models, scrimshaw, maritime paintings, decorative \narts, intricately carved figureheads, working steam engines, and much \nmore. Maritime museums offer a variety of learning experiences for \nchildren and adults through hands-on workshops and programs that focus \non maritime history.\n  Maritime lecture series presentations offer an opportunity to learn \nabout the history and lore of the sea from some of the nation's leading \nmaritime experts. Visitors learn the broad concept of sea power, the \nhistoric and modern importance of the sea in matters commercial, \nmilitary, economic, political, artistic, and social.\n  The legislation that I am proposing would help museums better \ninterpret maritime and social history to the public using their \nextensive collections of artifacts, exhibits and expertise. These \nprograms and facilities are used by schools, civic organizations, \ngenealogists, maritime scholars, and the visiting public, thus, serving \nstudents of all ages.\n  I urge all members of the Senate to join me in support of the \nAmerica's National Maritime Museums Act of 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. TORRICELLI):\n  S. 2805. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \ncriminal and civil liability for permitting an intoxicated arrestee to \noperate a motor vehicle; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress the serious national problem of drunk driving. The bill, \nentitled ``John's Law of 2002,'' would help ensure that when drunken \ndrivers are arrested, they cannot simply get back into the car and put \nthe lives of others in jeopardy.\n  On July 22, 2000, Navy Ensign John Elliott was driving home from the \nUnited States Naval Academy in Annapolis for his mother's birthday when \nhis car was struck by another car. Both Ensign Elliott and the driver \nof that car were killed. The driver of the car that caused the \ncollision had a blood alcohol level that exceeded twice the legal \nlimit.\n  What makes this tragedy especially distressing is that this same \ndriver had\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\nbeen arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, \nDUI, just three hours before the crash. After being processed for that \noffense, he had been released into the custody of a friend who drove \nhim back to his car and allowed him to get behind the wheel, with \ntragic results.\n  We need to ensure that drunken drivers do not get back behind the \nwheel before they sober up. New Jersey took steps to do this when they \nenacted John's Law at the State level. I am pleased to offer a Federal \nversion of this legislation today.\n  This bill would require States to impound the vehicle of an offender \nfor a period of at least 12 hours after the offense. This would ensure \nthat the arrestee cannot get back behind the wheel of his car until he \nis sober.\n  Further, the bill would require States to ensure that if a DUI \noffender arrestee is released into the custody of another, that person \nmust be provided with notice of his or her potential civil or criminal \nliability for permitting the arrestee's operation of a motor vehicle \nwhile intoxicated. While this bill does not create new liability under \nFederal law, notifying such individuals of their prospective liability \nunder State law should encourage them to act responsibly.\n  John's Law of 2002 is structured in a manner similar to other Federal \nlaws designed to promote highway safety, such as laws that encourage \nstates to enact tough drunk driving standards. Under the legislation, a \nportion of Federal highway funds would be withheld from States that do \nnot comply. Initially, this funding could be restored if States move \ninto compliance. Later, the highway funding forfeited by one State \nwould be distributed to other States that are in compliance. Experience \nhas shown that the threat of losing highway funding is very effective \nin ensuring that States comply.\n  I believe that this legislation would help make our roads safer and \nsave many lives. I hope my colleagues will support it, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that members of the Armed Forces \nperforming services on the Island of Diego Gracia shall be entitled to \ntax benefits in the same manner as if such services were performed in a \ncombat zone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2807. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of dependent care assistance programs sponsored by the \nDepartment of Defense for members of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills. One \nwill give tax relief to a small group of men and women in our armed \nservices stationed on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, \nsupporting the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. The second bill will \nexclude from gross income childcare benefits paid to members of our \narmed forces. These are small measures,but both will be of great \nbenefit to the men and women serving our country.\n  Diego Garcia is a British Territory lying seven degrees South \nLatitude off\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nthe coast of India, in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The island is 40 \nmiles around and encompasses an area of 6,720 acres, most of it \ndominated by a large lagoon. The land mass is actually very small. It \nis home to a joint British-United States Naval Support Facility, and \nwhile there are only a small handful of British Royal Navy personnel on \nthe island, there is a larger, tight-knit team of American Air Force, \nNavy, and Army personnel on the island. These men and women serving on \nDiego Garcia are supporting B-52 bombing missions and other operations \nover Afghanistan. Many of them are from the 2nd Bomb Wing and the 917th \nWing. Both units call Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana their home.\n  As a Nation, we provide members of our armed forces with a variety of \nbenefits, all of them deserve. They receive hardship duty pay of $150 \nper monthly for serving in austere regions of the World. They get \nimminent danger pay of $150 per month as compensation for being in \nphysical danger. One of the most generous benefits for those serving in \nthe war on terrorism is the combat zone tax exclusion. Members of the \narmed services do not pay Federal tax on compensation they for any \nmonth of service inside a combat one. They only have to serve on day in \nthe combat zone to get this benefit. The exclusion only applies to \npersonnel who receive imminent danger pay.\n  On Diego Garcia, the pilots and flight crews who fly the missions \nover Afghanistan are eligible for the income tax exclusion because they \nreceive imminent danger pay. But the men and women who load the \nbombers, fuel them, and maintain them are not eligible because they do \nnot enter the combat zone. My office was contacted by the officers who \nfly the bombing missions about this discrepancy. They asked me to help \nout their support crews, a gesture of selflessness that I want to \nhonor.\n  I recognize that the support crews may not receive imminent danger \npay, but their situation is not too different from Naval personnel \nperforming the same tasks on ships in the Arabian Sea. Naval support \ncrews receive imminent danger pay and are eligible for the tax \nexclusion, but they do not enter Afghanistan.\n  Diego Garcia is a beautiful place, but it is a long way from home. \nThe least we could do is treat everyone who has served on the island \nthe same. That is what my bill will do.\n  My second bill will correct an omission in the Tax Reform Act of \n1986. That Act contained a provision consolidating the laws regarding \nthe tax treatment of certain military benefits. The Conference Report \nto that Act contains a long list of benefits to be excluded from gross \nincome of military personnel. According to the report, this list was to \nbe exhaustive. The problem is that child car benefits are not on that \nlist.\n  I do not know if this omission was intentional. Perhaps at that time, \nchild care benefits were relatively unknown in the military. The \nConference Report gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to expand \nthe list of eligible benefits, but so far the Secretary has not \nprovided any guidance to the Department of Defense as to how these \nbenefits should be treated for tax purposes. While military families \nare not currently being taxed for child care benefits, the Department \nof Defense has indicated that it would like Congress to clarify that \nchild care benefits are not subject to tax. My bill will give our \nmilitary families and the Department of Defense a greater degree of \ncertainty.\n  Throughout our history, in time of war we have worked to make sure \nthat our armed forces have everything they need and we have spared no \nexpense in meeting that need. But the men and women on the ground often \nhave families back at home. We should make sure that we support them as \nwell. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7433-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 307--REAFFIRMING SUPPORT OF THE CONVENTION ON THE \nPREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME OF GENOCIDE AND ANTICIPATING THE \nCOMMEMORATION OF THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE GENOCIDE \nCONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1987 (THE PROXMIRE ACT) ON NOVEMBER 4, \n                                  2003\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 307\n\n       Whereas, in 1948, in the shadow of the Holocaust, the \n     international community responded to Nazi Germany's \n     methodically orchestrated acts of genocide by approving the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     the Crime of Genocide confirms that genocide is a crime under \n     international law, defines genocide as certain acts committed \n     with intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial or \n     religious group, and provides that parties to the Convention \n     undertake to enact domestic legislation to provide effective \n     penalties for persons who are guilty of genocide;\n       Whereas the United States, under President Harry Truman, \n     stood as the first nation to sign the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       Whereas the United States Senate ratified the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 19, 1986;\n       Whereas the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 \n     (the Proxmire Act) (Public Law 100-606), signed into law by \n     President Ronald Reagan on November 4, 1988, amended the \n     United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1091) to criminalize genocide \n     under the United States law;\n       Whereas the enactment of the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act marked a principled stand by the United \n     States against the crime of genocide and an important step \n     toward ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust, the \n     Armenian Genocide, the genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda, \n     among others, will be used to help prevent future genocides;\n       Whereas, despite the international community's consensus \n     against genocide, as demonstrated by the fact that 133 \n     nations are party to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and through other \n     instruments and actions, denial of past instances of genocide \n     continues and many thousands of innocent people continue to \n     be victims of genocide; and\n       Whereas November 4, 2003 is the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of \n     1987 (the Proxmire Act): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its support of the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (2) anticipates the commemoration of the 15th anniversary \n     of the enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation \n     Act of 1987 (the Proxmire Act) on November 4, 2003; and\n       (3) encourages the people and Government of the United \n     States to rededicate themselves to the cause of bringing an \n     end to the crime of genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7433-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7433-S7434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 308--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n         ``ONCE-A-DAY'' PROGRAM TO PROMOTE LOCAL FARM PRODUCTS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution \ncongratulating Bosnia and Herzegovina on the tenth anniversary of its \nrecognition by the United States.\n  During the decade since its recognition, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \nmade significant progress in overcoming the legacy of the bloody \nconflict of 1992-95, which was instigated by ultra-nationalist forces \nand claimed more than two hundred thousand lives and made millions more \nhomeless.\n  The NATO-led peacekeeping force, known originally as IFOR, now as \nSFOR, has provided the security umbrella that has allowed the slow, \ndifficult process of reconciliation and democracy-building to take \nplace.\n  The international community under the direction of a resident High \nRepresentative, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, the European Union, and many individual \ncountries have joined the United States in providing and delivering \neconomic and technical assistance to the citizens of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  Last year for the first time democratic, non-nationalist parties \ngained control of the national and Federation governments, and the \ngovernment of the Republika Srpska is considerably more democratic than \nit was under the infamous Radovan Karadzic.\n  Elections will be held this coming October, which will determine \nwhether the country will continue on a democratic, multi-ethnic, and \nfree market path. Obviously, it is in the interest of the people of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, and others, that it do \nso. Equally obviously, it is in the interest of the United States that \nBosnia and Herzegovina become a normal, peaceful, democratic country.\n  My Resolution commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the progress it has \nmade and urges it to take several steps to continue the process. They \ninclude: further strengthening of respect for human rights, of the rule \nof law, and of its free market economy; as rapidly as possible making \nfully operational all national institutions and state-level \ngovernmental bodies mandated by the Dayton Peace Agreement; creating a \njoint military command as soon as possible; accelerating the return of \nrefugees and displaced persons; and intensifying its cooperation with \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The \nHague, in particular surrendering to the Court individuals indicted for \nwar crimes.\n  The stability of the Balkans is essential for European stability. And \nstability in Europe is of fundamental importance to the United States \nof America. A peaceful, democratic, multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina \ncan be an important element in the new Balkans.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this Resolution, which makes clear \nour support for just such a Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7434-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7434-S7435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 310--HONORING JUSTIN W.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Health Care Liability \n     Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 2002''.\n\n                Subtitle A--Health Care Liability Reform\n\n     SEC. ____11. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--The civil \n     justice system of the United States is a costly and \n     inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care \n     liability and compensating injured patients and the problems \n     associated with the current system are having an adverse \n     impact on the availability of, and access to, health care \n     services and the cost of health care in the United States.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--The health care and \n     insurance industries are industries affecting interstate \n     commerce and the health care liability litigation systems \n     existing throughout the United States affect interstate \n     commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and \n     premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by \n     participants in the health care system.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--The health care liability \n     litigation systems existing throughout the United States have \n     a significant effect on the amount, distribution, and use of \n     Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide such individuals with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reform that is designed to--\n       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care \n     injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation;\n       (2) improve the availability of health care service in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and\n       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of the \n     current health care liability system of the United States to \n     resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health \n     care liability by reducing uncertainty and unpredictability \n     in the amount of compensation provided to injured \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. ____12. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     commences a health care liability action, and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is commenced, including the \n     decedent in the case of an action brought through or on \n     behalf of an estate.\n       (2) Clear and convincing evidence.--The term ``clear and \n     convincing evidence'' means that measure or degree of proof \n     that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm \n     belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations \n     sought to be established, except that such measure or degree \n     of proof is more than that required under preponderance of \n     the evidence, but less than that required for proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt.\n       (3) Collateral source rule.--The term ``collateral source \n     rule'' means a rule, either statutorily established or \n     established at common law, that prevents the introduction of \n     evidence regarding collateral source benefits or that \n     prohibits the deduction of collateral source benefits from an \n     award of damages in a health care liability action.\n       (4) Economic losses.--The term ``economic losses'' means \n     objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result \n     of the provision of (or failure to provide or pay for) health \n     care services or the use of a medical product, including past \n     and future medical expenses, loss of past and future \n     earnings, cost of obtaining replacement services in the home \n     (including child care, transportation, food preparation, and \n     household care), cost of making reasonable accommodations to \n     a personal residence, loss of employment, and loss of \n     business or employment opportunities. Economic losses are \n     neither noneconomic losses nor punitive damages.\n       (5) Health care liability action.--The term ``health care \n     liability action'' means a civil action against a health care \n     provider, health care professional, health plan, or other \n     defendant, including a right to legal or equitable \n     contribution, indemnity, subrogation, third-party claims, \n     cross claims, or counter-claims, in which the claimant \n     alleges injury related to the provision of, payment for, or \n     the failure to provide or pay for, health care services or \n     medical products, regardless of the theory of liability on \n     which the action is based.

Noneconomic losses are neither economic \n     losses nor punitive damages.\n       (13) Punitive damages.--The term ``punitive damages'' means \n     damages awarded, for the purpose of punishment or deterrence, \n     and not for compensatory purposes, against a health care \n     professional, health care provider, or other defendant in a \n     health care liability action.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       A health care liability action that is subject to this \n     title may not be initiated unless a complaint with respect to \n     such action is filed within the 2-year period beginning on \n     the date on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise \n     of reasonable care, should have discovered the injury and its \n     cause, except that such an action relating to a claimant \n     under legal disability may be filed within 2 years after the \n     date on which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a \n     health care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the \n     running of the statute of limitations under this section \n     shall be suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.\n\n     SEC. ____15. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if \n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--\n       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated \n     to the provision of health care services;\n       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to \n     suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to \n     provide health care services, the defendant deliberately \n     failed to avoid such injury; or\n       (3) acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a \n     substantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury \n     which the defendant failed to avoid in a manner which \n     constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard of \n     conduct in such circumstances.\n       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be \n     awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care \n     liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages, \n     including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against \n     the defendant.\n       (c) Separate Proceeding.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of any defendant in a \n     health care liability action, the trier of fact shall \n     consider in a separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; or\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n       (2) Only relevant evidence admissible.--If a defendant \n     requests a separate proceeding under paragraph (1), evidence \n     relevant only to the claim of punitive damages in a health \n     care liability action, as determined by applicable State law, \n     shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (d) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--In determining \n     the amount of punitive damages in a health care liability \n     action, the trier of fact shall consider only the following:\n       (1) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the \n     defendant.\n       (2) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of such \n     conduct by the defendant.\n       (3) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.\n       (4) The number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the \n     defendant of the kind causing the harm complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (5) Evidence with respect to awards of punitive or \n     exemplary damages to persons similarly situated to the \n     claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (6) Prospective awards of compensatory damages to persons \n     similarly situated to the claimant.\n       (7) Evidence with respect to any criminal or administrative \n     penalties imposed on the defendant as a result of the conduct \n     complained of by the claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (8) Evidence with respect to the amount of any civil fines \n     assessed against the defendant as a result of the conduct \n     complained of by the claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (e) Limitation Amount.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount of damages that may be awarded \n     as punitive damages in any health care liability action shall \n     not exceed 2 times the sum of--\n       (A) the amount awarded to the claimant for the economic \n     loss; and\n       (B) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n       (2) Application by court.--This subsection shall be applied \n     by the court and the application of this subsection shall not \n     be disclosed to the jury.\n       (f) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where \n     none exists under Federal or State law.\n\n     SEC. ____16. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action, if the \n     award of future damages exceeds $100,000, the adjudicating \n     body shall, at the request of either party, enter a judgment \n     ordering that future damages be paid on a periodic basis in \n     accordance with the guidelines contained in the Uniform \n     Periodic Payments of Judgments Act, as promulgated by the \n     National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in \n     July of 1990. The adjudicating body may waive the \n     requirements of this section if such body determines that \n     such a waiver is in the interests of justice.\n\n     SEC. ____17. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic \n     damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care \n     liability action shall be several only and may not be joint. \n     Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or \n     responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.\n       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--With respect \n     to punitive or noneconomic damages, the trier of fact in a \n     health care liability action shall determine the extent of \n     each party's fault or responsibility for injury suffered by \n     the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of responsibility \n     for such injury to each such party.\n\n     SEC. ____18. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A \n                   COLLATERAL SOURCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, the total amount of\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\n     damages received by an individual under such action shall be \n     reduced, in accordance with subsection (b), by any other \n     payment that has been, or will be, made to an individual to \n     compensate such individual for the injury that was the \n     subject of such action.\n       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of \n     damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under \n     subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such \n     award) that have been made or that will be made to such \n     individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of the action; minus\n       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse, \n     parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the \n     payments described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Determination of Amounts From Collateral Services.--The \n     reductions required under subsection (b) shall be determined \n     by the court in a pretrial proceeding.

Mr. President, on Saturday, June 22, our Nation lost one \nof its great heroes: My good friend, Justin Dart, Jr. Today, my \ncolleagues Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and Senator Gregg, and I are \nintroducing a bipartisan resolution to honor Justin Dart. His memorial \nservice will occur tomorrow, July 26, the 12th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  Justin Dart was the godfather of the disability rights movement. For \n30 years he fought to end prejudice against people with disabilities, \nto strengthen the disabilities right movement, to protect the rights of \npeople with disabilities. Millions of Americans with disabilities never \nknew his name but they owe him so much.\n  Justin was instrumental to the passage of the ADA and many other \npolicies of interest to individuals with disabilities. When President \nBush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act, he gave the first pen \nto Justin Dart. He truly was the one who brought us together and give \nthe inspiration and guidance to get this wonderful, magnificent bill \nthrough. I was proud to be at his side when he received the Medal of \nFreedom from President Clinton. Today we are proud to introduce this \nresolution to honor him and commemorate his tremendous contribution to \nthe lives of Americans with disabilities across this country.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements related thereto be printed in the Record \nat the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 2810 submitted earlier by Senators Hollings, \nMcCain, Burns, and Ensign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2810) to amend the Communications Satellite Act \n     of 1962 to extend the deadline for INTELSAT initial public \n     offering.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my Commerce \nCommittee colleagues to speak to legislation that would extend the \ndeadline for Intelsat to conduct the initial public offering required \nof it by the ORBIT satellite privatization law.\n  Under ORBIT, Intelsat must conduct an IPO by December 31, 2002. \nIntelsat has made substantial preparations to do just that. Recent \ndisastrous events in the telecommunications market, however, now make \nthis statutory deadline unrealistic and potentially contrary to the \npolicy objectives of ORBIT. This bill would therefore give Intelsat \nanother year in which to conduct its IPO and also provides the FCC \nauthority to allow an additional extension of time if warranted by \nmarket conditions.\n  The goal of ORBIT's IPO requirement was to substantially dilute the \nownership of the privatized Intelsat by its former owners, many of \nwhich are foreign government entities. I continue to support this goal. \nThe Commerce Committee has been provided with significant evidence that \nthis goal is already in the process of being achieved. For example:\n  July 18, 2001: Intelsat privatized in a transaction that resulted in \n14 percent of the new entity being held by non-signatory investing \nentities;\n  April 26, 2002; Intelsat filed its IPO registration statement with \nthe SEC;\n  May 2002: Natural dilution of Intelsat signatories continued as \nforeign governments privatized their telecom operations: Intelsat non-\nsignatory ownership increased to 22 percent;\n  June 14, 2002: The FCC issued its ORBIT Act report, finding that, \n``On the whole, we believe that U.S. policy goals regarding the \npromotion of a fully competitive global market for satellite \ncommunications services are being met in accordance with the Act.''\n  June 21, 2002: Intelsat received clearance from the New York Stock \nExchange to file a listing application to trade its ordinary shares on \nthat exchange.\n  This is a good start. More remains to be done, but it appears that \nIntelsat has been proceeding in a manner consistent with launching its \nIPO prior to the December 31, 2002 ORBIT deadline. Recently, however, \nuncontrollable external events overtook all of us. WorldCom's \nbankruptcy is but the latest financial debate in the telecommunications \nindustry, which has been unstable. Capital markets are extremely \nunsupportive of additional investment at this time. There arguably \ncould not be a worse time for a satellite communications company to \nconsider an IPO.\n  If forced to move ahead with an IPO before the end of 2002, Intelsat \nwill probably receive a reduced price for its shares offered. Foreign \nentities that still own significant portions of Intelsat are aware of \nthis likelihood and would therefore be discouraged from offering their \nownership interests for sale. Instead of the substantial dilution of \nprior owners contemplated by the ORBIT Act, a year--2002 IPO might not \nachieve much dilution whatsoever. In that instance, Intelsat would have \ncomplied with the procedural requirement of ORBIT without the \nsubstantive result that we in Congress sought: dilution of previous \nowners. Given the current adverse conditions in the stock market in \ngeneral and the telecommunications sector in particular, the only way \nto ensure the dilution results sought by ORBIT may be to allow Intelsat \nto further delay its IPO. That result is good public policy that is \nalso good for the long-term health of the satellite communications \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, this bill needs to be enacted this year. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support and I urge the prompt passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in just a few minutes, the Republican \nleader will be joining me on the Senate floor.\n  Before he gets here, I rise to thank my colleagues for the good work \nwe have been able to complete this week. It has been a very productive \nweek. We were able to pass unanimously the new Corporate Accountability \nAct after a great deal of effort on all sides. I complimented the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Mr. Sarbanes, on a number of occasions, but I want to \ncomplete our week this week by recognizing again his contribution.\n  The Appropriations Committee deserves commendation. They have \nreported out all the appropriations bills now.\n  In many ways, they are actually ahead of schedule, even though we \nhave had somewhat of a late start.\n  We finished the military construction appropriations bill this week. \nWe also finished the legislative branch appropriations bill and set up \nan opportunity to complete our work on the DOD appropriations bill next \nweek. There may be other appropriations bills that may be ready for \nconsideration next week as well. On the appropriations front, secondly, \nI thought we had quite a good week.\n  At long last we were able to move to conference on terrorism \ninsurance. I am hopeful in the not too distant future we will complete \nour work on that measure, as we did the Corporate Accountability Act. \nWe have done a number of nominations. We are now on track with regard \nto nominations. We confirmed a circuit court judge today, filed cloture \nWednesday and got cloture today on second one. That vote will occur on \nMonday night. It is currently my plan to move forward additional \njudicial nominees on Monday night as well.\n  In addition to the judicial nominees, we were able to complete our \nwork on nominations on some very important commissions. The SEC, for \nexample, had four outstanding vacancies. As a result of our work this \nweek, we were able to complete work on the SEC nominations. There is \nnow a full complement of SEC Commissioners. That, too, was an important \naspect of the work of the Senate.\n  Off the floor, there were a couple of other important matters that we \naddressed. The bankruptcy reform conference report is soon to be filed. \nIt was completed, the work was completed, as was the trade promotion \nauthority--not only trade promotion authority but the Andean Trade \nPromotion Act, as well as the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, the \npackage of bills, late last night. The conference report to that \npackage of bills was agreed to.\n  We are in a very good position now to move into the final week of \nthis work period. Senator Lott and I have had a number of constructive \ndiscussions about next week. Our purpose in coming to the floor is to \noutline for our colleagues what our expectations are, and I will do \nthat when he arrives.\n\n  I will also say, the confirmation of the district judge this morning \nbrings to a total of 61 the number of confirmations since we took the \nmajority a little over a year ago. That includes 49 district judges and \n12 circuit judges.\n  On Monday, as I noted, we intend to take up at least 1 more, if not \nadditional judges, and that would then bring to a total anywhere from \n62 to 64 judges in the time that we have had the majority.\n  We are making progress on judicial nominations. We are determined to \nattempt to clear the calendar with regard to those judicial nominations \nover the course of the next few days, if it is at all possible.\n  Whether we clear the calendar, I must say, depends on whether we get \nall the other work done as well. There has to be an understanding that \nwe do not have the luxury of focusing solely on nominations, as much as \nthat would be a good thing to do. We have to complete our work on the \nprescription drug benefit and generic drug benefit legislation. We want \nto call up the fast-track conference report and file cloture. We want \nto complete our work on the Defense appropriations bill, if that is \npossible. We want to work to proceed to the homeland security \nlegislation and file cloture on the motion to proceed to that bill.\n  We have a lot of work we need to complete before the end of next \nweek. Given the fact we will get a late start on Monday afternoon, \nSenators should be aware that we could be involved in late nights, and \nwe will certainly be here a week from this coming Friday.\n  I wanted to be sure my colleagues were made aware of our expectations \nfor the schedule for that period of time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum until the \narrival of the distinguished Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader and I \nhave been discussing the schedule for next week, as I noted a few \nmoments ago. We know there are many obstacles and many challenges we \nwill have to face next week. I believe it is important we come to the \nfloor to share with our colleagues at least what our intentions are and \nindicate that, on a bileadership basis, it is our desire to work \nthrough each of these priorities in an effort to get as much done as we \ncan and complete this work period as successfully as possible.\n  In keeping with that spirit, let me say it was our intention to \nattempt to complete our work on the prescription drug benefit by \nTuesday night. We, of course, will take up additional nominations on \nMonday, three judges, and additional Executive Calendar nominees. We \nwill chip away at that each day. We will be doing another block of \nnominations today. As we noted earlier this week, we are working under \na unanimous consent agreement to take up the DOD appropriations bill no \nlater than Wednesday. Now, it does not, of course, stipulate when on \nWednesday, so in keeping with that request and that consent, we are \nobligated to bring it up.\n  It is my expectation that certainly if the prescription drug benefit \nbill has been completed, we will be able to come to the DOD bill and \nstay on it until it has been finished. We recognize there are those who \nare in opposition to both the trade promotion authority as well as to \nHomeland Security. Yet it is our desire to complete work on the trade \npromotion authority bill, the conference report, next week. So we will \nfile cloture on the motion to proceed to the conference report in an \neffort to complete our work.\n\n  We also have a need to begin work on the homeland security \nlegislation. It was reported out of committee on a bipartisan basis, \nout of the Governmental Affairs Committee this week, so we will file \ncloture, recognizing that there will be a need to do so. We will file \ncloture on the homeland defense bill and have a vote on the motion to \nproceed to that bill prior to the end of the week.\n  So that clearly will require cooperation and a good deal of effort on \neveryone's part. I think there is a mutual interest in getting this \nwork done. Many of the issues that we will be taking up next week are \nhigh priorities for the administration, as they are for us. So I \nappreciate very much the distinguished Republican leader's interest in \nworking together to accommodate that schedule. I thank him for coming \nto the floor.\n  I yield the floor at this time for whatever remarks he may want to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his comments and for the effort that he has put into a number of \nthese issues this week. For every small agreement\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nthat is entered into on the floor it quite often represents hours of \neffort on our part, many times having had to go to Members repeatedly \nand work through concerns and legitimate disagreements. Then we finally \nget an agreement on the floor, and it moves quickly and it looks like \nit was a piece of cake, but it was not that way at all, as the \ndistinguished Senator in the chair knows because he is here on the \nfloor working these issues day in and day out.\n  As is always the case, this next week has the potential to be a very \nproductive week. One of the two busiest weeks and most productive weeks \neach year is the one right before the August recess and the one right \nbefore we go out at the end of the year. I remember one day, the last \nday of a session, we moved over 50 bills at the last half of the day \nwhen most Members had gone. But we had worked through a number of \nagreements.\n  Next week we have a chance to do a lot. I want to look back, though, \njust a moment, to this week because there were some significant \nachievements this week. It looked as if at times we were not reaching \nagreement--we weren't. But sometimes before you reach an agreement you \nhave to be clearly in disagreement. Maybe that is where we were this \nweek.\n  But we did finally start to break the deadlock and had a thaw on \nnominations. We had reached almost a record high of 90-something \nnominations pending on the calendar. But efforts were made to work \nthrough that. Senator Daschle and I had worked through it twice, only \nto be met with a different hold. But the White House worked out \nconcerns with Senator McCain and we started moving nominations, \nincluding, I think, some 15 last night. We are beginning to make a \nlittle progress on the judges.\n\n  We have some 204 nominations still pending in committees, but if \neverything goes according to normal practice around here, a lot of \nthose nominations will be coming out next week and we will be moving \nthem, hopefully, as fast as we can once we get them cleared.\n  We are doing some judges. It is difficult, but we are going to get \naction on one more circuit judge completed on Monday. We moved one \nother district judge last night and voted on that, I believe--this \nmorning, actually. We are going to do two more, I believe Senator \nDaschle said. So we are beginning to thaw that issue, and that is good.\n  On the accounting reform, I want to emphasize once again we not only \ngot an agreement on the conference, we got the conference done and sent \nto the President, and I believe that was a positive factor in beginning \nto restore confidence in our corporate world and accounting procedures.\n  The House is in the process, or has by now completed homeland \nsecurity legislation. The Senate committee completed markup and we are \nready to go forward. That was a very big achievement by the committee. \nEven though you disagree with some of what was done, they did get their \nwork completed and they reported it to the Senate, and we did the \nlegislative appropriations bill and we got an agreement to do the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill.\n  For our colleagues on my side of the aisle, they have been calling \nfor this. In fact, we are going to get it done, we are going to call it \nup next Wednesday, and we will complete it if it takes 2 hours a day or \n2 days, as Senator Daschle said. So those things we did, after a lot of \nwork, seeing some agreement reached.\n  On prescription drugs, we don't have agreement. It is obvious we had \nconcerns about the way it was brought to the floor and about some of \nthe legislation that was offered. But efforts are still underway to see \nif we can find common ground. We will continue to try to do that.\n  There is pending an amendment on medical malpractice. That is an \nissue that is very important to a lot of people of my State. There has \ndeveloped a real problem with tort reform and with doctors losing their \ninsurance coverage or leaving the State because there is no limit on \npunitive damages. No matter how this turns out in this debate, this is \na debate that we and the States of America are going to have to deal \nwith in some way.\n  We will have an opportunity late Monday afternoon and Tuesday to see \nwhat can be done on prescription drugs. I know there are conversations \ngoing on today between Members of the Senate and House, Republican and \nDemocrat, and also with the administration to see maybe what can be \ndone there. Senator Daschle has indicated that he would begin action to \nget a vote on at least cloture on a motion to proceed on homeland \nsecurity. I had hoped and he had hoped, and had stated, that we would \ndo our best to get homeland security completed before the August \nrecess. But there is a physical limit to what we can do in a limited \nperiod of time, especially if we have Senators who are going to \nexercise to their fullest their rights to have debate.\n  The trade conference report, I think the whole city was shocked this \nmorning when they got up and found out that there had basically been an \nagreement on the trade conference report. As I look at it, it sounds as \nif they have done a good job. I would probably change parts of it, and \nso would Senator Daschle, but I do think they probably have made a very \nwise move. Instead of subjecting themselves to 6 weeks of pressures and \ncounterpressures, they went ahead and addressed the issue and had the \nbill ready.\n\n  We are going to work together next week to take the early action \nnecessary to get cloture on fast track and complete action on that \nbill. This is a very important bill for the economy of our country and \nfor our ability to be involved in trade promotion and trade, fair trade \nand open trade, all over the world. We have kind of fallen behind in \nthat area with some other countries.\n  The bankruptcy conference report finally worked out, too. I would \nlike to see us even try to deal with that. If we cannot get that done \nnext week, we will be ready to go to it shortly after we return.\n  I do want to say to Senator Daschle and to others, I am working to \ntry--I discussed concerns about getting agreement to go ahead with the \nenergy and water appropriations bill. If we could add that to our list \nnext week, that would be very big. I don't find a lot of resistance to \nit, but we have had to clear it with some people who did have some \npotential amendments. There is one other concern related to that bill \nthat I am trying to work through.\n  We have just given a litany of bills. It will not be easy to get all \nthat done. We may not get it all done next week. But by working \ntogether and by asking our colleagues to cooperate with us, I think we \ncan produce an awful lot of good legislation next week. I would like to \nbe able to have a press conference next week as we go home and say: The \nSenate has done well. I haven't said that a lot lately, but I am \nprepared to do so when it is merited. I think there is a chance for \nthat to occur next week. We could have a really important legislative \nachievement next week with a little extra work and a little extra input \nfrom all of our colleagues.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for working with us to move these \nnominations. There are a lot of people who try to view every bill, \nevery nomination, as leverage on some other issue. At some point we \nhave to stop that and move them forward in order to do what the \nAmerican people expect us to do. I am going to be involved next week to \ntry to help in every way I can.\n  Quite often, Senator Daschle and I get accused of being on both sides \nof the same issue, by many different forces. It amazes me sometimes \nwhat I am supposed to have done. In fact, I saw yesterday where \nsomebody had put out that there was a Daschle-Lott agreement on \nprescription drugs. It came as a shock to Senator Daschle and me, but \nit was actually something in writing. Somebody downtown had a brilliant \nidea. Maybe we ought to look at it.\n  I am thankful for the comments of Senator Daschle, and I will work \nwith him next week to do everything we can to produce a good result. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Republican \nleader for the spirit of his comments, and indicate that he is so \ncorrect. There are so many times when there are rumors and there are \nallegations of all kinds, sometimes positive and\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\nsometimes negative, about things that he and I are doing, which is why \nI thought having a colloquy at the end of the week might be helpful.\n  With regard to the schedule, with regard to our intentions, let me be \nclear. It is my hope, based on the cooperative spirit that we both have \nattempted to articulate this afternoon, that we can get a lot done.\n  I have indicated to the President this week that it is my hope we can \nclear the calendar of all of the noncontroversial nominations, both \njudicial as well as executive appointments. That is what we will \ncontinue to try to chip away at. I don't see any reason why, at the end \nof the week, all noncontroversial nominations could not have been \nsuccessfully addressed. We will do that.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Lott's willingness to come to the \nfloor to restate our intentions to try to achieve this ambitious \nagenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/26/senate-section/article/S7442-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
