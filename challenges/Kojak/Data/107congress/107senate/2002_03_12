BEISTLINE, OF ALASKA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n               DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and proceed to the \nconsideration of Executive Calendar No. 706, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ralph R. \nBeistline, of Alaska, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Alaska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we are going to be voting in a few \nminutes on Judge Ralph Beistline to be United States District Judge in \nmy State of Alaska.\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\n  Senator Stevens, Representative Young, and I are very pleased that \nthis vote is about to take place. Before we vote, I would like to speak \nvery briefly on the qualifications of Judge Beistline.\n  First of all, I thank all my colleagues for moving expeditiously \nbecause in spite of the prevailing attitude in Alaska that it has taken \ntoo long to confirm him, by standards around here it has moved along \nquite nicely. So I very much appreciate that.\n  No one would question Judge Beistline's qualifications or his fitness \nto serve on the Federal bench. He has served with distinction in our \nState of Alaska for many years. He has always been an asset to his \ncommunity. He and Mrs. Beistline have had a commitment to furthering \nthe quality of life for Alaskans, which is exemplified by their \ncommitment to public service.\n  Judge Beistline is truly an Alaskan. He was born in Fairbanks, AK. \nThat happens to be my hometown. He is a graduate of the University of \nAlaska, Fairbanks, and the University of Puget Sound Law School. His \nheart has always been in the golden heart city of Fairbanks.\n  Judge Beistline served honorably in the Army National Guard, the Army \nReserves, and the Air National Guard for over 17 years. He was in \nprivate practice in Fairbanks, AK. During this time, Judge Beistline \ndistinguished himself as a hard-working, fair, honest, and very popular \nlawyer--if, indeed, that is the correct terminology for lawyers. \nNevertheless, he is very well respected. And I am always reminded--\nwell, it is inappropriate to reflect on lawyer jokes, so I will \nrestrain myself, with some reluctance.\n  Judge Beistline is a strong advocate for the rights of his clients. \nHe has always maintained respect for the courts and the legal system, \nand that respect is matched by the manner in which his peers admire and \nsupport him.\n  Since 1992, Ralph Beistline has served as Superior Court Judge for \nthe State of Alaska. Through his public service, Judge Beistline has \ndemonstrated the requisite legal temperament and the traits that will \nmake him clearly a distinguished Federal judge.\n  Obviously, he is committed to upholding the law, even if he may \ndisagree from time to time with it. Judge Beistline exhibits and \ndemands fairness, respect, and diligence from all of those who practice \nin his court. Most importantly, the judge has ensured that justice is \ndelivered fairly, responsibly, and in a timely manner. I would like to \namplify that note--in a timely manner. Oftentimes, there is a great \ndeal of frustration for those of us who believe that justice is not \ndone in a timely manner.\n  He is a longstanding and distinguished member of the Fairbanks \ncommunity, the Fairbanks Bar, and the Alaskan Bar. Judge Beistline has \nearned the respect of his colleagues. He has also earned the respect of \nour entire delegation--Senator Stevens, Representative Young, and \nmyself. We enthusiastically support his nomination and look forward to \nvoting on his nomination today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her attention.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, Ralph Beistline is a lifelong Alaskan, \nborn in Fairbanks. He grew up in Alaska and will bring that important \nprospective to the bench.\n  He served as a superior court judge from 1992 until today and for the \npast 5 years he has been the presiding judge in the Fairbanks Superior \nCourt.\n  He is married to Peggy Beistline and has five children: Carrie, \nDaniel, Tamara, Rebecca, and David.\n  He is the former president of the Alaska Bar Association, former \npresident of the Tanana Valley Bar Association, former president of the \nAlaska Conference of Judges, and a former member of the board of \ngovernors of the Alaska Bar Association. He has been a lawyer \nrepresentative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference and was a long \ntime pro-bono participant.\n  Ralph is also an executive board member of the Boy Scouts of America \nand a member of Igloo #4 Pioneers of Alaska.\n  Hailing from Fairbanks, Ralph will also bring further geographical \nbalance to the court.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch for moving his nomination to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, the Senate is voting on the 40th \njudicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reorganized after the Democrats became the majority \nparty in the Senate. With the confirmation of Ralph Beistline of \nAlaska, we will have confirmed more judges in the last 9 months than \nwere confirmed in 4 out of 6 years under Republican leadership.\n  The number of judicial confirmations over these past nine months--\n40--now exceeds the number of judicial nominees confirmed during all 12 \nmonths of 2000, 1999, 1997 and 1996. Thus, during the last 9 tumultuous \nmonths we have exceeded the one-year totals for 4 of the 6 years in \nwhich a Republican majority last controlled the pace of confirmations.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed. The larger number, the total judges \nconfirmed during President Clinton's two terms includes 2 years in \nwhich a Democratic majority proceeded to confirm 129 additional judges \nin 1993 and 1994. During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the \nSenate, judicial confirmations averaged 38 per year--a pace of \nconsideration and confirmation that has already been exceeded under \nDemocratic leadership over these past nine months.\n  During the recent Republican control of the Senate 46 nominees to the \nCourts of Appeal were confirmed, a rate of approximately seven per year \non average, including one whole session, 1996, in which no circuit \ncourt judges were confirmed at all. In only nine months of Democratic \ncontrol of the Senate, seven of President Bush's nominees to the Courts \nof Appeals have been confirmed. Two additional circuit court nominees \nhave had hearings and the hearing scheduled for next week will include \nanother circuit court nominee.\n  Under Democratic leadership we have had more hearings, for more \nnominees, and had more confirmations than the Republican leadership did \nfor President Clinton's nominees during the first 9 months of 1995. In \neach area--hearings, number of nominees given hearings, and number of \nnominees confirmed--this Committee has exceeded the comparable period \nwhen Republicans were in power. And 1995 was one of the most productive \nyears. It was 1996 and after that the Republican majority began \nstalling the judicial confirmation process and the session in which \nonly 17 judges were confirmed all year with none to the Courts of \nAppeals.\n  Additionally, under Democratic leadership, we have reformed the \nprocess and practices used in the past to deny Committee consideration \nof judicial nominees. The fact that 248 judicial nominees were \nconfirmed in the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican leadership does not \ndiminish the fact that almost 60 other judicial nominees never received \na hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee or received a hearing but \nwere never voted on by the Committee.\n  The Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, the Assistant Majority Leader, \nSenator Reid, and the members of the Judiciary Committee have worked \nhard to return the Senate's consideration of judicial nominations to a \nmore orderly and open process. We have been working hard to move away \nfrom the anonymous holds and inaction on judicial nominations that \ncharacterized so much of the period from 1995 through 2000.\n  Today's vote to confirm the 40th judicial nominee since the \nreorganization of the Committee last July demonstrates that we have \nmade a positive difference in the confirmation process by improving the \npace and fairness of consideration of nominees for lifetime appointment \nto the federal courts. Not only has the Senate been able to confirm \nmore judges in a shorter time frame than were confirmed in 4 of the \npast 6 years, but we have also done so at a faster pace than in any of \nthe recent 6\\1/2\\ years in which Republicans were most recently in the \nmajority.\n  I make these observations to set the record straight. I do not mean \nby my comments to be critical of Senator Hatch. Many times during the \n6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, I observed that were \nthe matter left up to us, we would have made more progress on more \njudicial nominees. I thanked him during those years\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n  With the confirmation of Ralph Robert Beistline, there will be no \nactive vacancies on the Alaska District Court. We have moved \nexpeditiously to consider and confirm Judge Beistline. He was nominated \nin November, received his ABA peer review in January, participated in a \nhearing in February, was reported favorably by the Committee last week, \nand is today being confirmed.\n  Judge Beistline has an extensive career litigating civil cases in \nstate and Federal courts, providing pro bono services in civil matters, \nincluding social security appeals. I congratulate the nominee and his \nfamily on his confirmation today.\n  This nominee has the support of both Senators from his home state and \nappears to be the type of qualified, consensus nominee that the Senate \nhas been confirming to help fill the vacancies on our Federal courts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? If no one yields \ntime, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we on the \nBeistline nominee?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are. Under the previous order, \nthe time was reserved, but all time remaining is under the control of \nSenator Leahy and those who have been scheduled.\n  Mr. HATCH. Since they are not here, I ask unanimous consent that I \nmight be able to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The vote is at 11, is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to support the confirmation of \nRalph R. Beistline to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nAlaska.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Judge Beistline's distinguished \nlegal career, and I have come to the opinion that he is a fine jurist \nwho will add a great deal to the Federal bench in Alaska.\n  Judge Beistline began his legal career as the first law clerk for the \nSuperior Court in Fairbanks, where he not only completed legal research \nand wrote opinions for three judges, but also held hearings in probate \nand uncontested divorce cases. Following his clerkship, he maintained a \nlitigation practice for 17 years. He left the practice of law to become \na State trial court judge, and he has earned a stellar reputation for \nfairness and hard work among lawyers and judges in his community.\n  I have every confidence that Judge Beistline will serve with \ndistinction on the Federal district court for the district of Alaska.\n  We are in the middle of a circuit court vacancy crisis, and the \nSenate is doing nothing whatsoever to address it.\n  There were 31 vacancies in the Federal courts of appeals when \nPresident Bush sent us his first 11 circuit nominees on May 9, 2001, \nand there are 31 today. We are making no progress.\n  Eight of President Bush's first 11 nominees have not even been \nscheduled for hearings, despite having been pending for 307 days as of \ntoday. All of these nominees received qualified or well-qualified \nratings from the American Bar Association.\n  A total of 22 circuit nominations are now pending for those 31 \nvacancies.\n  But we have confirmed only 1 circuit judge this year, and only 7 \nsince President Bush took office.\n  The sixth circuit is half-staffed, with 8 of its 16 seats vacant. \nThis crisis exists today despite the fact that we have 7 Sixth Circuit \nnominees pending motionless before the Judiciary Committee right now. \nAlthough the Michigan senators are blocking 3 of those nominees by not \nreturning blue slips, the other 4 are completely ready to go, all have \ncomplete paperwork, good ratings by the ABA, and most importantly, the \nsupport of both home State senators.\n  The D.C. Circuit is two-thirds staffed, with 4 of its 12 seats \nsitting vacant. This is despite the fact that President Bush nominated \nMiguel Estrada and John Roberts, who have not yet been given a hearing \nand whose nominations have not seen the light of day since they were \nnominated 307 days ago.\n  There is simply no explanation for this situation other than stall \ntactics.\n  The Senate Democrats are trying to create an illusion of movement by \ncreating great media attention concerning a small handful of nominees \nin order to make it look like progress.\n\n  Some try to blame the Republicans for the circuit court vacancy \ncrisis, but that is complete bunk. Just look at the record:\n  Some have suggested that 45 percent of President Clinton's circuit \ncourt nominees were not confirmed during his presidency. That number is \na bit of an Enron-ization. It is inflated by double counting \nindividuals that were nominated more than once. For example, by their \nnumbers, Marsha Berzon--who was nominated in the 105th Congress, but \nnot confirmed until the 106th--would count as two nominations and only \none confirmation. If you remove the double counting and count by \nindividuals, only 23 were not confirmed--that's 27 percent, as opposed \nto 45 percent.\n  And of those 23 nominees who did not move, 4 were withdrawn, 8 lacked \nhome State support, 1 had incomplete paperwork and another was \nnominated after the August recess in 2000. That leaves 9 circuit court \nnominees that did not receive action some of which had issues that I \ncannot discuss publicly.\n  Now, as I said, there are currently 31 circuit court vacancies.\n  During President Clinton's first term, circuit court vacancies never \nexceeded 21 at the end of any year.\n  There were only 2 circuit court nominees left pending in committee at \nthe end of President Clinton's first year in office. In contrast, 23 of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees were pending in committee at \nthe end of last year.\n  At the end of President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate \nhad confirmed 19 circuit judges and there were only 15 circuit court \nvacancies.\n\n  In contrast, today in President Bush's second year, the Senate has \nconfirmed 1 and there are 22 pending.\n  At the end of 1995, my first year as chairman, there were only 13 \ncircuit vacancies left at the end of the year.\n  At the end of 1996, the end of President Clinton's first term and in \na Presidential election year, there were 21 vacancies--only 1 higher \nthan the number the Democrats left at the end of 1993 when they \ncontrolled the Senate and Clinton was President.\n  Taking numbers by the end of each Congress, a Republican controlled \nSenate has never left as many circuit vacancies as currently exist \ntoday. At the end of the 104th Congress, the number was 18, at the end \nof the 105th Congress, that number was 14, and even at the end of the \n106th Congress, a Presidential election year, that number was only 25. \nToday there are 31 vacancies in the circuit courts.\n  Despite all the talk--and lack of action--the unmistakable fact is \nthat there is a circuit court vacancy crisis of 31 vacancies, which is \nfar higher than the Republicans ever let it reach, and the current \nSenate leadership is doing nothing about it. Actually, I should correct \nmyself, they are doing something about it: They are making it grow even \nlarger. They have acted with a deliberate lack of speed, and that is \nsomething the American people do not deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time having expired, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nRalph R. Beistline, of Alaska, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Alaska?

The arrangement has been made \nthat they are going to report back at 2:15 today after the party \nconferences are completed. If there is some hope that further \ndiscussion between them will bear some fruit, then we will go further; \notherwise, we are going to complete that matter today. Senator Gramm \nsaid he wants to speak on it for a while. He may have a second-degree \namendment.\n  I say to all Members, we need to move forward. As I indicated on \nbehalf of the majority leader today, we have light at the end of the \ntunnel. The minority leader has indicated he thinks we can finish this \nbill by a week from this Friday. We agree that is certainly the way it \nshould be.\n  We have some important matters to consider. We have to do something \nwith ANWR, we have to do something with CAFE standards, and \nelectricity. We hope those three very difficult, contentious issues can \nbe disposed of. And we would indicate we are going to finish \nderivatives before we move to something else, unless there is some \nagreement between the two Senators.

Mr. President, I concur with the statement of the \nmajority whip. I look forward to, hopefully, moving with some dispatch \non the energy bill. There are probably a few more contentious issues, \nas you know: Electricity, certainly ANWR, CAFE, renewables. So we have \nour work cut out for us. I encourage Members to try to recognize that \nit is very important we have an energy bill and we get it in \nconference.\n  I communicate to the majority whip, perhaps he can enlighten us at a \nlater time if indeed campaign finance reform is going to come into play \nand delay us. Perhaps he can do that at such time as he is able to give \nus some idea when that might occur. I assume that would not necessarily \ntake us off the bill.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott \nmet today with some of us, and it is believed that the campaign finance \nmatter can be resolved in as little as 3 hours, to complete everything \nwithin that period of time, and send it to the House. That certainly \nisn't done yet. Senator Daschle has asked for an agreement to be \nentered in the Record tomorrow in that regard. If that were the case, \nit would temporarily slow down this bill, but that is all.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that. I must say, I am pleased with the \noptimism shown by the majority whip.

Mr. President, yesterday our President, President \nGeorge W. Bush, marked the 6-month anniversary of the terrorist \nattacks. I think we would all agree he used some very strong words for \nour adversaries.\n  I quote President Bush:\n\n       Every nation in our coalition must take seriously the \n     growing threat of terror on a catastrophic scale--terror \n     armed with biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.\n\n  That was his comment yesterday.\n  Further, he stated:\n\n       Some states that sponsor terror are seeking or already \n     possess weapons of mass destruction. Terrorist groups are \n     hungry for these weapons and would use them without a hint of \n     conscience.\n\n  Further quoting him:\n\n       In preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \n     there is no margin for error and no chance to learn from \n     mistakes.\n\n  Further quoting him:\n\n       Our coalition must act deliberately, but inaction is not an \n     option.\n\n  I would refer to that again: ``inaction is not an option.''\n  He added:\n\n       Men with no respect for life must never be allowed to \n     control the ultimate instruments of death.\n\n  The President did not name names, but it is becoming increasingly \nclear that when we talk about targeting terror, we are talking about \ntargeting Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n  We know he has chemical weapons because we have watched him use them \non his own people. We know Saddam wants nuclear weapons because his \nchief bomb maker defected to the West\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\nwith a wealth of information on their program. We know, very well, he \nhas a missile capability because he fired dozens of missiles on Israel \nduring the gulf war.\n\n  So what has he been up to? We cannot say for sure because we have not \nhad a U.N. inspector there since December of 1998. So he has had 1999, \n2000, 2001--clearly over 3\\1/2\\ years to continue his development of \nweapons of mass destruction. We know that for a fact. We just do not \nknow what they are, and we do not know what he is going to do with \nthem. One can only imagine what he has been able to accomplish during \nthat timeframe.\n  Some of you may have seen the special on CNN the other day where they \nidentified clearly the threat of Iraq, and a historical review from the \ntime of the Persian Gulf war: His experimentation of using chemical \nweapons on his own people; his arsenal, a portion of which was \ndestroyed at that time under the U.N. auspices. Since that time we have \njust observed him as he continues to rule as a dictator, as one who \nobviously has seen fit to go to extraordinary means to ensure his own \nsafety, by simply wiping out those critics of his regime.\n  I am not going to try to typify this individual. I have met him. I \nhave been in Baghdad. As a matter of fact, I think I am the only \nSenator who is still in the Senate who met with Saddam Hussein prior to \nthe Persian Gulf war. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. McClure, was with us. \nSenator Dole was with us. Also, Senator Simpson from Wyoming was with \nus. The Senator from Ohio, Howard Metzenbaum, was with us.\n  It was a very interesting opportunity. We had been in Egypt and were \nadvised we should go over to visit Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We did go \nover there. We were met by our Ambassador, April Gillespie. We were \nsupposed to meet Saddam Hussein at the airport in Baghdad. She said \nthat she was sorry, that Saddam Hussein changed the itinerary. He was \nnot there. We were supposed to go up to Mosul.\n  So the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, who is still there, said that \nSaddam had sent his airplane down to take us up to Mosul. We were \nsomewhat reluctant to get in Saddam's airplane, as you might imagine. \nWe said: We will take our own airplane. We had an Air Force aircraft. \nThere was some discussion. Then they came back and said: No, the runway \nwas under repair. Our plane was too big; they would not be able to \naccommodate our airplane. Then Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said: I am \ngoing with you. That made us somewhat more at ease. Somewhat \nreluctantly, we did climb into the airplane and fly up to Mosul.\n  It was ironic because, when we landed, they said: we won't have to \ntake you back because we have finished repairing the runway and your \nairplane can come and get you. We knew we were set up to make a story.\n  We did go into a hotel and Saddam Hussein met us and was supposedly \ngoing to host lunch. We had a long discussion about human rights \nactivities. We talked about the cannons that had been found on the \ndocks in London. We discussed the triggering devices. And he had an \nanswer for everything. He would throw out a booklet designed by the \nBaghdad Institute of Technology. At one point he got rather belligerent \nand suggested we had no business in his country talking to him about \nthe attitude of the people of Iraq.\n  He asked us to go out on the balcony. And he said: There are five of \nyou, five helicopters. You can go anywhere in Iraq you want and ask \nwhat the people really think of Saddam Hussein. Howard Metzenbaum \ndeclined the invitation for reasons of security, to put it mildly. So \ndid the rest of us.\n  Nevertheless, we had an opportunity to observe this individual. To \nsuggest he is unpredictable is an understatement. He is very \nunpredictable. His value on human life, as evident over an extended \nperiod of time, speaks for itself.\n  One can conclude that Iraq is a very unstable area that we are \ndepending on for oil. As I am sure the occupant of the chair, the \nSenator from New York, recognizes, on a particular day of September 11, \nwe were importing a million barrels of oil a day from Iraq. At this \ntime it is a little over 800,000 barrels a day. Interestingly enough, \non that tragic day in September, that was a record, an 11-year-old \nrecord.\n  What do we do with his oil? We use it to drive to work, use it in \nschoolbuses, to take our kids, whatever. It is the fuel the Navy jets \nuse, which twice this year already bombed Saddam Hussein and every day \nenforces a no-fly zone over his skies. Last year Iraqis shot at U.S. \nforces some 400 times. We responded in force 125 times. I ask, can we \ncount on his oil if Baghdad is the next stop in the war of terror?\n  I have charts here that clearly show the increase of Iraqi oil \nproduction in the Mideast, and you can see 1.1 million barrels of Iraqi \noil--this is where American families get their oil--the Persian Gulf, \nalmost 3 million barrels; OPEC, 5.5 million barrels. Oil has jumped up \nto the highest price in 6 months. It is a little over $24.50 a barrel.\n  Gasoline prices are at the highest they have been in 6 months. This \nis indicative of particularly the power of the OPEC cartel, which, by \ncontrolling the supply, clearly controls the price.\n  We have other charts here that I think show a significant figure. We \nin this country have been able to do a pretty good job of conserving \nthrough higher efficiency. As this chart shows, consumption per \nthousand Btu has dropped from about 18 down to about 11 in the period \nof 1973 through the year 2000. That is a 42-percent decline. While \nconservation has made significant advancements, we still are \nsignificantly dependent on imported sources of oil for the reason that \nAmerica and the world moves on oil.\n\n  Here is a chart that is relatively new. It shows crude oil imports \nfrom Iraq to the United States in 2001. This is by month, January going \nover to September. That was an all-time high. That was at a time where \nthe terrorist activities took place in Pennsylvania and Washington and \nNew York.\n  It is very significant to recognize that we will have to deal with \nIraq, and the President has kind of laid down a card that suggests we \nwant to have U.N. inspectors in Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein laid down his card yesterday. His card was quite \nexpressive of the prevailing attitude of his regime. No, we are not \ngoing to let U.N. inspectors into Iraq.\n  So what are we going to do? It is our move next. We waited too long \nto deal with bin Laden. We waited too long to deal with al-Qaida. So \nthis is a scenario that won't be over this week or next. We cannot \nafford to wait too long to deal with Saddam Hussein. As long as he is \nin power, he will continue to threaten the world as a member of the \naxis of evil. All the tools he needs are now within his grasp.\n  Reducing foreign dependence on oil can lessen the influence and reach \nof Saddam Hussein. There are solutions that must begin right here at \nhome. Doing so will not only help ensure our energy security; it will \nfurther ensure our national security.\n  Again, I make another appeal to my colleagues to recognize the role \nthat Alaska could play by opening up the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. On each desk of Members, we have a series of exhibits that \nhighlight the reality associated with opening up this area. It is still \nvery difficult to get Members to focus on a couple of stark realities.\n  I point out again the size of the area in question in the green. That \nis 1.5 million acres. That is the only area up for proposal. ANWR \nitself is a much larger area. It is a 19-million acre area consisting \nof 8 million acres of wilderness and 9.5 million acres of refuge. The \ngreen area is the area in question. Then the idea is what would be the \nfootprint there? In the House bill, H.R. 4, the footprint is 2,000 \nacres. That is a conglomeration of just a combination of drilling \nactivities on land plus developing pipelines.\n  It cannot go over 2,000 acres. That is pretty insignificant \nconsidering using an area of 1.5 million acres.\n  As we look at the merits, the question is, Can we do it safely? The \nanswer is, yes, because we use new technology now. We have ice roads \nand these ice roads don't require gravel. They are simply a process \nwhere you lay water on the tundra, it freezes, and then you can move \nthe vehicles, you can move drilling rigs and so forth.\n  That shows a typical drilling rig. Beyond the area up on the top you \nsee the Arctic Ocean. You can see an ice road leading from the \nplatform. That is the new technology. To suggest we are\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\ngoing to leave a scar on the tundra in the summertime, which is quite \nshort--and I will show you a picture of the summertime, this area, \nwhich clearly is a result of the technology. There is a well that has \nbeen spudded in. You can see there are no roads to it because there was \nan ice road only during the winter.\n  Winter is pretty long up there. It is about 10\\1/2\\ months a year. \nThere are only about 40 days of ice-free time when the Arctic Ocean is \nopen.\n  Nevertheless, in spite of the facts relative to being able to open \nANWR, America's environmental community has latched onto this, and they \nhave misrepresented issue after issue. The issue they continually \npropose is that there is only a 6-month supply. We don't know what is \nin ANWR and they don't know. The range is from 5.6 billion barrels to \n16 billion barrels. If it were somewhere in the middle, it would be as \nbig as Prudhoe Bay, and Prudhoe Bay has contributed 20 to 25 percent of \nthe total crude oil production in the U.S. in the last 27 years.\n  Those are facts. If you look over here on this chart, you will see \nthe 800-mile pipeline. That infrastructure is already in place. That is \none of the construction wonders of the world. As a consequence, it has \nbeen able to move this volume of oil. It is only utilized to half of \nits capacity. It is currently carrying a little over a million barrels \na day. It can carry as many as 2 million barrels a day. So if oil is \ndiscovered in this magnitude, you would be putting a pipeline over from \nthe ANWR area to the 800-mile pipeline down to Valdez, and it is a \nrelatively simple engineering operation.\n  The question is, Do we want ANWR open and do we want to avail \nourselves of the likelihood of a major discovery? People ask, why ANWR? \nThat is the area where geologists tell us is the greatest likelihood \nfor the greatest discovery in the entire continent of North America. So \nto suggest it is a 6-month supply is unrealistic and misleading. If we \ndidn't import and produce any oil, theoretically, it might be a 6-month \nsupply. On the other hand, it is just as probable to suggest it would \nsupply the Nation with 20 to 25 percent of its total crude oil for the \nnext 30 or 40 years. If it comes in in the magnitude that we \nanticipate, it would offset imported oil from Iraq for 40 years and \nfrom Saudi Arabia for 30 years. The other issue is that it would take \nan extended timeframe to get on line. I remind colleagues that in 1995 \nwe passed ANWR. It was vetoed by the President. If we would have that \non line today, we would not be as dependent on Iraq as we are \ncurrently. So it is a matter that will come up before the Congress as \npart of the energy bill.\n  The House has done its job; it has passed H.R. 4 with ANWR in it. It \nis up to us to address this issue now. I encourage my colleagues to try \nto reflect accurate information, not misleading information that would \ndetract from the knowledge that we have gained in new technology in \nopening up this area safely and protecting the caribou. There is always \na new argument. New ones continually pop up. One is the question of the \npolar bear. Most of the polar bears are over by the area near Barrow, \nas opposed to the ANWR area. We acknowledge that there are a few in the \nANWR area. But the point is, under the marine mammal law, you can't \ntake polar bears for trophies in the United States. That has \nsignificantly increased the lifespan of the polar bear. If you want to \nhunt polar bear, go to Russia and Canada. You can't do it in the United \nStates. These are facts that are overlooked as we look at the arguments \nagainst opening this area.\n  The last point is, why disturb this unspoiled, pristine area? The \nfact is, this area has had the footprints of man on numerous occasions. \nIt was an area where there were radar stations, an area where there is \na Native village called Kaktovic, which has roughly 280 people. This is \na picture of the village. This is in ANWR--physically there. There is \nan airport and radar stations. You can see the Arctic Ocean. We have \npictures of the local community hall with kids on a snowmobile. This is \nvillage life in Arctic Alaska, way above the Arctic Circle. We have a \npicture showing kids going to school. These kids have dreams and \naspirations just as our kids. They are looking for a future--jobs, \nhealth care, educational opportunities. They are the same as anybody \nelse. Nobody shovels the snow here; nevertheless, it is a pretty hardy \nenvironment. To suggest that somehow this land is untouched is totally \nunrealistic and misleading.\n\n  Speaking for these children, I think we have an obligation to \nrecognize something. I have another chart that shows the Native land \nwithin ANWR and the injustice that is done to these people, and I think \nit deserves a little enlightenment.\n  This is the map that shows the top, and there are about 92,000 acres \nin ANWR that belong to the Native people of Kaktovic. It is a smaller \nchart. We should have that chart. What we have here--and let's go back \nto the other chart that shows Alaska as a whole because I can make my \npoint with that one. Within this area of the green, which is the Arctic \nCoastal Plain, up top we have the village of Kaktovic, and that little \nwhite spot covers the land that they own fee simple--92,000 acres. They \nhave no access across Federal land, which is what ANWR is. They are \nlandlocked by Federal ownership. So as a consequence, the concept of \nhaving fee simple land really doesn't mean very much if you can't use \nthe land and have access, and so forth.\n  They believe there is an injustice being done here in their Native \nland. While it is theirs, it doesn't provide them with any access--here \nis the chart I am looking for. Madam President, we have the specifics \nhere. This general area that you are looking at in pink is what we call \nthe 1002 area. That is a million and a half acres, where we are talking \nabout providing leases. The Native area is the white area. This is the \n92,000 acres. You can see the area offshore; that is the Arctic Ocean. \nIt is free of ice for only about 40 days a year.\n  The problem the Native people have is access because they cannot have \nany surface access outside their 92,000 acres of land. If they wanted \nto move over to where the pipeline is, they would move west and beyond \nthe area on the chart. The question is, Is it fair and equitable that \nthese people are prevented from having access?\n  We think there should be some provision in the ANWR proposal to allow \nthe Native residents of this area to have access across public land for \ntheir own benefit. We intend to pursue this in some manner in this \ndebate as we develop the merits of opening up ANWR. If we were to open \nit up for exploration, this would not be a question. Clearly, there is \na lack of support by Members, based on information from the \nenvironmental community that this area is undisturbed and should not be \ninitiated for exploration of oil and gas, even though geologists say it \nis the most likely area for a major discovery. Still we have an \ninjustice and an inequity to these people. I don't think there has been \nenough attention given to the plight of these people who, as any other \naboriginal people, are ensured certain rights under our Constitution, \nand those rights have not been granted them.\n  As a consequence, there is an injustice to the people of the village \nof Kaktovic and members of the Arctic Slope Aboriginal Corporation, \nwhich is the governing body in that area.\n  With that explanation, I encourage Members to think a little bit \nabout fairness and equity and what we owe these aboriginal people. We \ncertainly owe them reasonable access out of the lands they own fee \nsimple.\n  Madam President, nobody else is requesting recognition, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Mr. President, I have conferred with the managers of the \nbill, and with Senator Daschle, on the Feinstein amendment, which is \npending. During the break, there was a long conversation with the two \nmanagers, and with Senator Feinstein and Senator Gramm. It is believed \nit would be in the best interest to set this amendment aside and move \nto some other matters. Everyone should understand that we have every \nbelief that Senators Gramm and Feinstein are working in good faith to \ntry to come up with some way to resolve this issue. If in fact they do \nnot, though, Senator Daschle has indicated that he would be ready to \nfile a cloture motion on the Feinstein amendment so we can move forward \non that. We hope we do not have to do that. I am confident that we will \nnot. But in case we cannot resolve the matter, Senator Daschle is ready \nto file a cloture motion on the Feinstein amendment.\n  We will ask to move off this important matter dealing with \nderivatives. The two managers have some amendments they can work on \nthat wouldn't take long at all.\n  I have spoken to Senator Levin. He is going to come and offer an \namendment and/or substitute on the provision in the bill that deals \nwith CAFE standards. That should begin in the next 15 minutes or so. Is \nthat in keeping with what the two managers understand?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, let me say it is in \nkeeping, and I know the Senator from Idaho is here and ready to offer \nan amendment. His amendment is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I make some brief comments on the \namendment, I thank the assistant majority leader for allowing us to set \naside what is an important but I think contentious amendment if we \ndon't work out the tremendous complication of dealing with derivatives. \nIt is a complex area and we well ought to know what we are doing. \nMembers and staff of the Banking Committee are now working with Senator \nFeinstein on it. We are hopeful something can be worked out in this \narea.\n  I am pleased both sides have agreed to the amendment that I will send \nto the desk.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if the Senator from Idaho will yield, \nSenator Landrieu also has an amendment--the hydrogen protection \namendment--which we understand has been agreed to. She will offer that \namendment after Senator Craig's amendment. We hope to dispose of both.\n  There are two more amendments that we have not agreed to--Senator \nDomenici on spent fuel and Senator Landrieu on licensing new reactors. \nBut we can continue to work on those if we can dispose of the two.\n  I, of course, support Senator Craig's amendment as well.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2995 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2995 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program \n      within the Department of Energy to develop advanced reactor \n    technologies and demonstrate new regulatory processes for next \n                    generation nuclear power plants)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . NUCLEAR POWER 2010.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n       (2) Office.--The term ``Office'' means the Office of \n     Nuclear Energy Science and Technology of the Department of \n     Energy.\n       (3) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Nuclear Energy Science and Technology of the \n     Department of Energy.\n       (4) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Nuclear Power \n     2010 Program.\n       (b) Establishment.--The Secretary shall carry out a \n     program, to be managed by the Director.\n       (c) Purpose.--The program shall aggressively pursue those \n     activities that will result in regulatory approvals and \n     design completion in a phased approach, with joint \n     government/industry cost sharing, which would allow for the \n     construction and startup of new nuclear plants in the United \n     States by 2010.\n       (d) Activities.--In carrying out the program, the Director \n     shall--\n       (1) issue a solicitation to industry seeking proposals from \n     joint venture project teams comprised of reactor vendors and \n     power generation companies to participate in the Nuclear \n     Power 2010 program;\n       (2) seek innovative business arrangements, such as \n     consortia among designers, constructors, nuclear steam supply \n     systems and major equipment suppliers, and plant owner/\n     operators, with strong and common incentives to build and \n     operate new plants in the United States;\n       (3) conduct the Nuclear Power 2010 program consistent with \n     the findings of A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants \n     in the United States by 2010 issued by the Near-Term \n     Deployment Working Group of the Nuclear Energy Research \n     Advisory Committee of the Department of Energy;\n       (4) rely upon the expertise and capabilities of the \n     Department of Energy national laboratories and sites in the \n     areas of advanced nuclear fuel cycles and fuels testing, \n     giving consideration to existing lead laboratory designations \n     and the unique capabilities and facilities available at each \n     national laboratory and site;\n       (5) pursue deployment of both water-cooled and gas-cooled \n     reactor designs on a dual track basis that will provide \n     maximum potential for the success of both;\n       (6) include participation of international collaborators in \n     research and design efforts where beneficial; and\n       (7) seek to accomplish the essential regulatory and \n     technical work, both generic and design-specific, to make \n     possible new nuclear plants within this decade.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out the purposes \n     of this section such sums as are necessary for fiscal year \n     2003 and for each fiscal year thereafter.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the amendment authorizes a new program \nwithin the Department of Energy called Nuclear Power 2010. The new \nprogram was proposed in the administration's fiscal year 2003 budget. \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Landrieu, Senator Domenici, and Senator \nThurmond are supporters of this effort. We think it is the appropriate \ndirection to go in the development of a new energy package.\n  The goal of Nuclear Power 2010 is to aggressively pursue activities \nthat will result in the completion of designs for the next generation \nof nuclear reactors.\n  This program will also look for ways to reduce the regulatory \nuncertainties which have been obstacles to the building of new nuclear \nplants. This program would incorporate cost sharing between government \nand industry to ensure that the outcome of this program will be not \nonly beneficial but useful to both sides as new designs are developed.\n  This program will also garner the tremendous creativity of the \ntechnical minds within the Department of Energy and our National \nLaboratories--some great minds that have been sitting somewhat idle in \nthe area of new design and reactor development over the last number of \nyears.\n  In my home State of Idaho, for example, Argon West was the first ever \nnuclear effort that lit the first lightbulb. Strangely enough, a lot of \nfolks don't\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\nknow that about Idaho. But the reactor that generated that was an \nexperimental breeder reactor. That was well over 50 years ago.\n  Our National Laboratories have been extensively involved. This \nreinvolves them. We hope it reinvigorates them.\n  I think all of us recognize that clean sources of abundant energy are \ncritical for the future of this country. The cleanest is nuclear.\n  The 2010 amendment is the kind of program that I think sends us in \nthe direction that we want to see our energy base going as an integral \npart of energy's diverse mix in our country. We believe the 20 percent \nnow made up of current operating reactors will have to go higher in \nfuture years as we look at issues of climate change, weather, and, of \ncourse, the unpredictable fluctuation in a variety of other energy \nsources.\n  That is the purpose and the intent of the amendment. It has been \naccepted.\n  I hope this amendment can be voice voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment of the \nSenator from Idaho, and it certainly is acceptable on this side. I \nsupport the amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. We should \nadd it to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \nand compliment Senator Craig for his leadership on this issue and \nnuclear power in general. This amendment authorizes the Department of \nEnergy's Nuclear Power 2010 initiative, a multi-year program for the \nDepartment of Energy to partner with the private sector to explore both \nFederal and private sites that could host new nuclear plants; to \ndemonstrate the efficiency of and timeliness of key Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission licensing processes designed to make licensing new plants \nmore efficient, effective and predictable; and to conduct research \nneeded to make the safest and most efficient nuclear plant technologies \navailable in the United States.\n  I am a strong proponent of nuclear power because it is among the \ncleanest sources of energy in the world today. Additionally it is \nreliable, efficient and abundant. Presently, the United States gets \napproximately 20 percent of its power from nuclear plants. Those plants \nin operation currently cannot operate indefinitely. Accordingly, in \norder to maintain the energy production we receive from nuclear power \ntoday, the United States will need to build new nuclear facilities.\n  Fortunately, advanced reactor technologies are now available that are \nsafer, smaller and more capable. As we are all aware, however, bringing \nnew civilian nuclear plants on-line is a lengthy process. Regretfully, \nconsiderations such as site selection concerns, licensing impediments, \nand legal challenges have curtailed new nuclear plants.\n  In May of last year, I wrote to Vice President Cheney as head of the \nPresident's Energy Task Force. In my letter, I noted how pleased I was \nto learn that the Administration was committed to developing a \ncomprehensive national energy strategy that would include a renewed \nconsideration of nuclear power. I suggested to the Vice President, that \nthe Administration consider co-locating advanced technology commercial \nnuclear power production facilities on existing Department of Energy \nreservations.\n  Utilizing Department of Energy facilities would mitigate any number \nof problems associated with building new nuclear plants. To begin with, \nthere is no need to secure new land. In addition to the fact that this \nis already Federal property, in general, DOE facilities are large \nisolated areas that are highly secure. Also, individuals living near \nthese locations are usually supportive of nuclear initiatives. They \nknow that having a nuclear facility nearby is not a safety issue. As \nsuch, we avoid the ``not in my backyard'' syndrome. Finally, building \nnew nuclear reactors on existing DOE facilities reduces the amount of \nnew infrastructure required as companies would be ``leveraging'' \nagainst what already exists at these locations.\n  The Energy Task Force and Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham did not \nrequire much convincing. The Secretary called upon industry to \ndetermine interest in developing advanced technology commercial nuclear \nplants at DOE locations. I have been advised that a number of proposals \nwere received from some of the top energy companies in the Nation.\n  When Secretary Abraham unveiled the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative, he \nannounced awards to two nuclear utilities to conduct initial studies of \nseveral sites that could eventually host new nuclear plants. In \naddition to several private sites, the Secretary identified the \nDepartment of Energy's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory in Idaho, the Savannah River Site in my hometown of Aiken, \nSC, and the Portsmith site in Ohio as sites to be considered.\n  These DOE sites were ideal locations to locate nuclear projects fifty \nyears ago. With the right physical characteristics, experienced \nworkforces and supportive local communities, they remain so today. I \nbelieve it makes perfect sense to use these existing assets as a \nplatform upon which to expand our civilian nuclear power capabilities.\n  This initiative is good government and I am pleased that it is \nincluded in this package.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join Senator Bingaman in support of \nthe amendment. It establishes a program within the Department of Energy \nto aggressively pursue activities that will lead to, hopefully, the \ndevelopment of new nuclear plants.\n  As we know, nuclear power currently contributes about 20 percent of \nthe total energy produced in this country. France is at about 75 \npercent; Sweden is at about 46; Japan, 30 percent. So, clearly, this is \nan amendment that will be an investment in the future. We support the \nadoption of the amendment. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2995) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2993\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment that \nsubsequently was set aside. It is amendment No. 2993. The amendment is \nto establish a National Power Plant Operations Technology and Education \nCenter. The amendment, I believe, is noncontroversial.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska indicated he would accept the \namendment. I believe the Senator from New Mexico indicated the same. I \nask that it be immediately considered favorably by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nmy understanding is that we are still examining it. I have no reason to \nbelieve there will be an objection, but staff has asked for a little \nmore time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in response to Senator Dorgan, we have \ncleared the amendment. I appreciate his forbearance. We had one \nquestion that has been answered satisfactorily. So I urge the Senator \nto go ahead. I support the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ncourtesy. I ask for the immediate consideration of amendment No. 2993.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate on the amendment, without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2993) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2996 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have one more amendment we would \nlike to resolve on behalf of myself and Senator Daschle. This is an \namendment covering rural and remote communities. My understanding is, \nit is cleared on both sides.\n  I would ask the majority for any comments they may care to make.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we do not object to this amendment. It \nis supported on this side. I urge that the Senate proceed to dispose of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska, [Mr. Murkowski], for himself and \n     Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 2996.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering on behalf \nof myself and Senator Daschle establishes the Rural and Remote \nCommunity Fairness Act. This amendment addresses serious electricity \nand infrastructure concerns of rural and remote communities. Of \nparticular interest to the amendment's cosponsor, Senator Daschle, are \nthe provisions that address the concerns of rural and remote \ncommunities that suffer from high out-migration. We have well-\nestablished programs for urban areas. And I support them.\n  These programs were established to help resolve the very real \nproblems found in this Nation's cities. But our rural and remote \ncommunities experience equally real problems--and they are not \naddressed by existing urban programs. They have been left out. Not only \nare these communities generally ineligible for the existing programs--\ntheir unique challenges require a different focus and approach.\n  The biggest single challenge facing small rural communities is the \nexpense of establishing a modern infrastructure. The existence of a \nmodern infrastructure is necessary for a safe environment and a healthy \nlocal economy. There is a real cost in human misery and to the health \nand welfare of everyone--especially children and elderly--from poor or \npolluted water or bad housing or an inefficient and expensive power \nsystem.\n  The problems in Alaska are a perfect example: 190 villages have \n``unsafe'' sanitation systems; 135 villages still use ``honey buckets'' \nfor waste disposal; and only 31 villages have a fully safe, piped water \nsystem.\n  It is not surprising that Hepatitis B infections in rural Alaska are \nfive times more common than in urban Alaska. Similarly, most small \ncommunities and villages in Alaska are not interconnected to an \nelectricity grid and rely upon diesel generators.\n  Electricity prices in Alaska can be stunningly high. For example: the \nManley Utility--77 cents per kilowatt hour; Middle Kuskokwim Electric--\n61 cents/KWh. But so too can electricity prices in other small \ncommunities across our nation. For example: Matinicus Plantation \nElectric in Maine--30 cents/KWh; Bayfield Electric in Michigan--17 \ncents/KWh; New Hampshire Electric--15 cents/KWh; Fishers Island in New \nYork--23 cents/KWh.\n  Compare these prices to the national average of around 7 cents per \nkilowatt hour--and you can see the problem we need to address.\n  We just have to do better if we are to bring our rural communities \ninto the 21st century--to enjoy the fruits of economic growth--to have \nsafe drinking water--to have affordable energy.\n  How will this amendment address these problems?\n  First, it authorizes $100 million per year for block grants to \ncommunities served by utilities who have 10,000 or fewer customers who \npay more than 150 percent of the national average retail price for \nelectricity. These small communities may use the grants for \ninfrastructure improvement including weatherization; modernizing their \nelectric system; and assuring safe drinking water and proper waste \nwater disposal.\n  Second, it authorizes electrification grants of $20 million per year \nto small, high-cost communities. These grants can be used to increase \nenergy efficiency, lower electricity rates, or provide or modernize \nelectric facilities.\n  Third, it addresses the problem of high electricity prices in \nAlaska--a problem that will diminish as new, efficient electric \ngeneration can be installed.\n  Fourth, it addresses the very real problems of communities that have \na high rate of out-migration. It provides affordable housing and \ncommunity development assistance for rural areas with excessively high \nrates of outmigration and low per-capita income levels. This is a very \nsignificant problem for Senator Daschle's State of South Dakota.\n  This amendment makes a significant step toward resolving the critical \nsocial, economic and environmental problems faced by our Nation's rural \nand remote communities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2996) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is in the \nChamber and ready to speak on the amendment Senator Levin and he are \nintending to offer. The floor is open for their discussion at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2997 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n       (Purpose: To provide alternative provisions to better \n     encourage increased use of alternative fueled and hybrid \n     vehicles.)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the managers of \nthe bill. Senator Levin will be in the Chamber shortly, but I thought I \nwould go ahead and make some remarks prior to the offering of this \namendment, which I think is a very significant one.\n  There are many important issues in an energy bill, but what happens \nto our automobile economy, what happens to the workers, what happens to \nthe people who buy them, what happens to the people on the highways \nshould be a very important consideration.\n  I think when you talk about energy and fuel economy standards, the \nimpact on jobs and safety need to be at the top of anyone's list. That \nis why I am pleased to join my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, \nin crafting a commonsense amendment to the energy bill that will \nincrease passenger car and light truck efficiency while protecting \njobs, highway safety, and consumer choice.\n  Before we get into the details of the amendment--and we will be \ngetting into lots of details, probably more than anybody wants to know \nabout corporate average fuel economy--let me just take a moment to \nreview the state of our economy.\n  A few weeks ago, I was disappointed that the Senate had stalled out \non an economic stimulus package. We have been in a recession for \nmonths, and although there are signs of a recovery, there are still \nmany Americans without jobs.\n  Of course, as you know, we did pass a smaller bill to increase the \ntime of payment for unemployment compensation that did have a portion \nof the stimulus package in it.\n  Now, what would be the link between higher fuel economy standards and \neconomic recovery and stimulus and jobs? I will tell you.\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\n  I have listened to the car manufacturers, the working men and women \nin the unions who build the cars, and the other impacted groups, and \nthe significantly higher CAFE standard, or the miles per gallon, which \nwill be required for vehicles that are included in Senator Daschle's \nenergy bill that he created, without committee action, has a very real \nlikelihood of throwing thousands of Americans out of work, including \nmany of the 221,000 auto workers in Missouri.\n  That is because the only way for car companies to meet the \nunrealistic numbers in the underlying amendment is to cut back \nsignificantly on making the light trucks, the minivans, and the SUVs \nthat the American consumers want, that the people of my State and the \npeople of the other States want--to carry their children around safely \nand conveniently, to do their business. If they have jobs in one of the \ntrades, they need minivans and compartment trucks and others to carry \ntheir goods. If they are farmers, they need pickup trucks to take care \nof their livestock and to haul equipment and feed.\n  I know some in this Chamber believe our fellow Americans cannot be \ntrusted to make the right choice when purchasing a vehicle. But when it \ncomes down to choosing between the consumer and the Government as to \nwho is best to make a choice, I will side with the consumer every time.\n  I don't pretend to know what is best for each of the 15 million \nAmericans who will be purchasing a new vehicle this year and the ones \nnext year or in the years after. Those who want higher Government CAFE \nor miles-per-gallon standards always claim to have the best interests \nof the consumer in mind and always promise that the last thing they \nwant to do is hurt the car manufacturers. Well, they have missed the \nmark by a mile with language that ended up in the bill before us today.\n  Proponents portray this CAFE provision, authored by Senator Kerry and \nothers, as reasonable and necessary. I have other words in mind to \ndescribe it. It is antisafety, anticonsumer and antijob.\n  I also have the numbers to consider during this debate. How about 6.6 \nmillion. That is the number of Americans employed in direct or spin-off \njobs related to the automotive industry. In fact, every State in \nAmerica is an auto State. We all know that Michigan, Indian, Missouri, \nand Ohio are big manufacturing States. But even smaller States such as \nNebraska, New Hampshire, and Delaware have suppliers and other \nindustries where success and business profitability is directly related \nto the large car assembly plants in the Nation.\n  As we struggle to get our economy moving again, we ought to be \ndeveloping proposals that will increase the number of jobs. \nUnfortunately, the underlying miles-per-gallon standard in this bill by \nSenator Daschle does just the opposite. It must be removed. It must be \nreplaced.\n  I recognize there are competing views on this subject. Some of my \ncolleagues prefer to listen to the arguments put forth by those who \nhave never built a vehicle, never visited a plant, or don't even have \nan elementary understanding of how a car works.\n  I prefer to listen to those who are actually engaged in the business \nof making cars, of designing cars, servicing cars, selling cars and \ntrucks. They tell me one consistent message: The CAFE provision is a \njob killer, a threat to the safety of our friends and families and a \nmandated market that eliminates consumer choice. For those who say, too \nbad, we must force Detroit to build more fuel-efficient cars and \ntrucks, do you know that under CAFE it doesn't matter what the \ncompanies manufacture and build? It is calculated based on what the \nconsumer buys.\n  There are over 50 of these high economy models in the showrooms \nacross America today. But guess what. They represent less than 2 \npercent of total sales. Americans don't want them. You can lead a horse \nto water; you can't make him drink. You can lead the American consumer \nto a whole range of fancy, lightweight, long-distance automobiles, but \nyou can't make them buy them.\n  Meanwhile, consumers from families, soccer moms, farmers, people with \nteenagers, people with soccer teams, they want the minivans. A \nconstituent of mine, Laura Baxendale in Ballwin, MO, asked:\n\n       Senator, our mini-van is used to transport two soccer \n     teams, equipment and seven players, how would this be \n     possible in a smaller vehicle?\n\n  I have to tell Ms. Baxendale, the bad news is they would have to have \na string of golf carts. You can see the golf carts going down the \nhighway to soccer practice, maybe two kids in each golf cart. It is not \na very safe or efficient way to transport.\n  Here is a quote from Jeffrey Byrne, of Byrne Farm in Chesterfield, \nMO:\n\n       As a farmer I do not purchase pickup trucks because of \n     their fuel economy, I purchase them for their practicality.\n\n  He buys them because he needs them. He is taking care of his \nlivestock. Did you ever try to put a load of hay in the back of a golf \ncart? It doesn't make a very big delivery vehicle.\n  Under the new CAFE numbers, the production of these popular vehicles \nwould need to be curtailed. I don't want to tell a mom and dad in my \nhome State they can't get the SUV they want because Congress decided \nthat would be a bad choice. I don't think that is a sound way to set \npublic policy. After hearing from assembly line workers, farmers, auto \ndealers, and others directly impacted by Government CAFE standards, I \nfully believe the appropriate fuel economy standards are best decided \nby experts within the Department of Transportation who have the \ntechnology and the scientific know-how to determine what is feasible to \nhelp lead us down the path towards the most efficient, economical, and \nenvironmentally friendly standards, rather than by politicians choosing \nsome political number out of the air. We could get in a bidding war, \nbut we are bidding on something we know nothing about--how efficient \ncan engines be made.\n  Under the Levin-Bond amendment, the experts at the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration are directed to refer to sound \nscience in promulgating an appropriate and feasible increase. Think of \nthat. This would be historic, if this body said we are going to use \nsound science on a technological issue before us. Senator Levin and I \nbelieve the time has come. This amendment will strengthen the \nregulatory process to ensure that the miles per gallon or CAFE levels \nare accurate and reflect the needs of consumers, the technology \ndevelopment, without undo consequences for safety and jobs.\n  Ultimately, I do believe science, not politics, should drive the \ndeliberations on the CAFE or miles-per-gallon standards. I would be \nmost interested to see what hard data and solid science our colleagues \nwho have pushed for this 35-mile-an-hour CAFE standard say justifies \nit, the standard in the bill. I am waiting to see what scientist thinks \nthere is a technology to meet it. I don't believe I would hold my \nbreath because I don't think it exists.\n  This is, unfortunately, a political number pulled out of thin air. \nEven worse, it is a number that could have deadly consequences for \nAmerican drivers and passengers. I have read the 2001 National Academy \nof Sciences report on the CAFE standard. Let me share with you a key \nfinding about safety and higher standards.\n  This is a report in USA Today. It says:\n\n       The fatality statistics show that 46,000 people have died \n     because of a 1970s-era push for greater fuel efficiency that \n     has led to smaller cars.\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences say:\n\n       In summary, the majority of that committee finds that the \n     downsizing and weight reduction that occurred in the late \n     1970s and in early 1980s most likely produced between 1,300 \n     and 2,600 crash fatalities and 13,000 to 26,000 serious \n     injuries in 1993.\n\n  They estimate that 2,000 people were killed in 1993. I fear that has \nbeen replicated every year since. It goes on to say:\n\n       If an increase in fuel economy is effected by a system that \n     encourages either downweighting or the production and sale of \n     more small cars, some additional traffic fatalities would be \n     expected.\n\n  That National Academy of Sciences report offers all of us clear \nguidance and expert scientific analysis as we debate fuel economy \nlevels. I would also point out that the NAS panel was extremely careful \nto caution its readers that its fuel economy targets were not \nrecommended CAFE goals because they did not weigh considerations such \nas employment, affordability, and safety.\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n  These are the quotes from the National Academy of Sciences that I \nhave just given you. I will leave it up so my colleagues can read it. I \nwill have a copy of the report on the floor. I am sure everybody will \nbe as fascinated as I have been to read it because it contains \nimportant information.\n  Opponents of our amendment may question how effective the experts at \nNHTSA will be in leading the new fuel economy standards. Some might \nprefer that Congress set a political number as we find in the current \nenergy bill. Our amendment takes an approach that, rather than politics \nand guesswork, hard science and technological feasibility should be the \nprime consideration in the development of any new CAFE standards.\n  I will ask that my colleague from Michigan, who is going to describe \nthis amendment, give you the details. I will just say that it is \nvitally important that we strike the people killing, jobs killing, \nmarket killing, CAFE or miles-per-gallon provisions currently in S. 517 \nbecause they would only hurt the consumer and do very little for fuel \neconomy. Let's save jobs and save American lives by voting yes on the \nLevin-Bond amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my good friend from \nMissouri for the tremendous effort he has put into fashioning this \nbipartisan approach to increasing fuel economy. He has played an \nindispensable role. I am very much appreciative of that and, of course, \nhis presentation today.\n  This bipartisan approach is an alternative to the language in the \nsubstitute that is pending, the language which I will refer to as the \nKerry-Hollings language. Our amendment is aimed at increasing fuel \neconomy. That is No. 1. We want to increase fuel economy. We want to do \nit in a way that also allows the domestic manufacturing industry in our \nU.S. economy to thrive as well. We think we can accomplish both goals. \nWe don't think these are mutually exclusive goals, inconsistent goals, \nor goals that are in conflict with each other, providing we do it \nright. If we do it wrong, we will have a very negative effect on the \nAmerican economy and on manufacturing jobs in America. If we do it \nwrong, we will not even benefit the environment the way we should. I \nwill get into the right way and the wrong way in a few moments.\n  We really have a three-point policy that we are talking about--three \npolicies that we want to emphasize in this amendment. First is the need \nto increase fuel economy in our vehicles. That is policy No. 1.\n  No. 2, we put a much greater emphasis on incentives to achieve that \ngoal, positive ways of achieving that goal. We do it in a number of \nways in this bill. We have a requirement here that the Government \npurchase a large number of advanced technology vehicles. Government \npurchases are a way of advancing the way of fuel economy. The Presiding \nOfficer is a member of the Armed Services Committee and may remember \nthat last year in our defense authorization bill we actually put in a \nrequirement that the Defense Department, starting in the year 2005, \npurchase hybrid vehicles. What this bill does is it applies the same \nprinciple to the balance of our Federal Government so that we use the \npurchasing power, the pulling power, the positive power of Government \npurchases to provide a market for advanced technology vehicles or \nhybrids.\n\n  We also have a greater emphasis on joint research and development. \nThe administration has proposed an approach, which is a very useful \napproach, built on what was called the ``partnership for a new \ngeneration of vehicles,'' which the last administration put into place, \nwhich is based on partnerships between the Federal Government and the \nprivate sector in trying to develop new technology. The administration \nnow has talked about moving with greater emphasis on fuel cells--they \ncall it the ``freedom car.''\n  We would add about 40 percent additional funds to advanced technology \nresearch and development between the private sector and the Federal \nGovernment. That is the second thing we do in terms of positive \nincentives to try to achieve greater fuel economy.\n  A third thing that we would do, we would do it in a separate bill, so \nthat this bill would not be subject to a point of order, or subject to \na slip that the House of Representatives might be able to file against \nit. We do something on the tax credit side. We would significantly \nenhance the tax credits--tax deductions--that are provided for both \nadvanced technologies and for new technologies. In the provision that \nis going to be offered, I believe, which has been adopted by the \nFinance Committee, for electric vehicles, we would increase the \nexisting electric vehicle tax credit up to a maximum of $6,000 for 6 \nyears, beginning this year going through 2007. For fuel cell vehicles, \nwe would establish a tax credit up to a maximum of $11,000 for 8 years, \nbeginning in the year 2004, ending in 2011. For hybrid vehicles, the \nseparate amendment we will be offering would establish a tax credit up \nto a maximum of $5,000 for hybrid vehicles for 6 years, beginning in \n2004.\n  We also would have a greater emphasis on using tax deductions for \ninfrastructure equipment and infrastructure for fuels and alternative \nfuels--for hydrogen. We would take the existing tax deductions and make \nthem last longer. We would apply them to a greater range of equipment, \nand we would also establish a tax credit of up to $30,000 for the cost \nof installation of alternative fuel and hydrogen distribution \nequipment, beginning in 2002 and ending in 2007.\n  There are--in addition to what I have just outlined--some research \nand development programs that we would emphasize. On diesel research, \nwe would coordinate with the Secretary of Energy on an accelerated R \nprogram to improve diesel combustion. We would have a fuel cell \ndemonstration program between the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Those, briefly, are the things we would do to create positive \nincentives, market pull, and partnerships between the Federal \nGovernment and the private sector, to try to get us to a greater level \nof fuel economy.\n  Our third policy is based on our belief that there are a host of \nfactors that should be considered before the CAFE requirement is \nadopted. We think there should be a new CAFE requirement. Our provision \ncalls upon the Department of Transportation to increase--that is our \nword--standards for cars and light trucks based on the consideration of \na number of factors. Then we list the factors that we hope the \nDepartment of Transportation will consider. They include technological \nfeasibility. That is the only one that is in the bill before us.\n\n  The bill says it would take the most advanced technologies, assume \nthey will be incorporated into vehicles, and then do not consider, \nhowever, the other factors that we say logically must be considered \nbefore a new CAFE standard is adopted, such as cost-effective \nGovernment motor vehicle standards on fuel economy. For instance, what \nis the impact on our tailpipe emission standards?\n  The need to conserve energy; that is obvious. We all want to do that. \nThat is a goal. The desirability of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign \noil, clearly, that is one of our goals. What is the effect on motor \nvehicle safety? As the Senator from Missouri pointed out, the study of \nthe National Academy of Sciences shows that there is a loss of lives \nand a significant number of injuries which result when you raise the \nCAFE standards, as we did some years ago. I will get back to the safety \nissue in a moment because it is a factor that should be considered. \nThat is all we are saying. We are saying that it is logical and \nrational to have a process where other factors beside potential \ntechnological advances should be considered in setting a new CAFE \nstandard.\n  The adverse effects of increased fuel economy standards on the \nrelative competitiveness of manufacturers, I will come back to that \nissue because the CAFE structures had a discriminatory impact on the \nAmerican auto industry with vehicles just as fuel efficient, I \nemphasize. I want to spend some time on that issue in a moment.\n  The American-manufactured vehicles are just as fuel efficient, and \nthey are put in a negative position, vis-a-vis the imports, because of \nthe CAFE structure--the fact that it looks at a fleetwide average \nrather than looking at class of vehicles compared to class of vehicles.\n  Instead of saying the same size vehicle will be subject to the same \nCAFE\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nstandard, the same mileage standard, it lumps together all vehicles of \na manufacturer, and the results are, in my judgment, bizarre and costs \nhuge numbers of American jobs without the benefit to the environment.\n  We would ask the Department of Transportation, during this period of \ntime that we give to them, to consider rulemaking would also take a \nlook at the effect on U.S. employment, the effect on near-term \nexpenditures that are required to meet increased fuel economy standards \non the resources available to develop advanced technology.\n  What is the relationship between requiring short-term gains on the \nneed to make leap-ahead technologies available to us earlier, to make \nthe advanced hybrids available earlier--and I emphasize advanced \nhybrids available earlier--to make the fuel cells available to us in 10 \nyears instead of 20 years? What is the impact on taking arbitrary \nnumbers requiring the auto industry year by year to meet those \nstandards on what our ultimate goal I hope will be, which is huge \nreductions in the use of oil by the advanced technologies called \nadvanced hybrids and fuel cells?\n  Another thing we would require is that the National Research Council, \nthe part of the National Academy of Sciences that reported in a report \nentitled ``Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy \nStandards,'' which was issued in January of this year--we would require \nthat report be considered.\n  I am going to give some quotations, as the good Senator from Missouri \ndid, from that report because we think that report is an important \nreport.\n  The time line we would give the Department of Transportation is 15 \nmonths to complete the rulemaking for light trucks, and 24 months to \ncomplete their rulemaking for passenger cars. If they do not complete \nit, it would be in order, under an expedited process, for Congress to \nthen take up alternatives which could be considered. It at least puts \nin place a rational system of looking at many criteria which are \nrelevant to the question of where the new standards for fuel economy \nought to be instead of arbitrarily picking a number out of the air, \nhaving staff, for instance--apparently we are told staff is considering \nsome numbers--and come up with a conclusion that we could impose a 36-\nmile-per-gallon or a 34-mile-per gallon requirement on the entire \nfleet, lumping together trucks and passenger cars.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield at the end of my remarks. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Instead of doing that, we should have a rational rulemaking process \nthat is put in place for a fixed period of time that then makes a \ndecision on what the new standards should be. That would be subject to \nlegislative review under existing law, under an expedited process. It \ncan then be vetoed, and under our bill, if there is no report within \nthat fixed period of time, it would then be in order, under the \nexpedited process, to offer alternatives to it.\n  Those are some of the provisions of our alternative. We think it is a \nmuch more rational process. It takes advantage of a rulemaking \nopportunity where various criteria can be considered, where safety \nfactors can be considered--and I want to get to safety factors in a \nmoment--where we can look at the discriminatory impact on various \nmanufacturers that are put in different positions, put in worse \npositions. Even though their cars are equal or better in terms of fuel \nefficiency, they are put in a negative position vis-a-vis their \ncompetition.\n\n  What is truly bizarre, it seems to me, is it is the American \nmanufacturers that are put in that discriminatory position, that \nnegative position, not based on their efficiency, because we are going \nto go through that in a minute, but based on the way this CAFE \nprovision is structured. It puts American jobs at risk with no benefit \nto the environment. It does not help our environment or the air to push \nsomebody into an equally efficient or less efficient imported vehicle \nthan a domestic vehicle that is equally efficient or more efficient. We \nare not doing anything for the air, and we are costing American jobs.\n  That is the effect of the CAFE structure. It seems to me, at a \nminimum, we should ask the Department of Transportation to include in \ntheir rulemaking review what are the adverse effects of increased fuel \neconomy standards on the relative competitiveness of manufacturers.\n  I wish to show a few charts.\n  This is a chart which I have produced which compares, class by class, \nsome American-made and imported vehicles. This is not a chart which was \nproduced by the auto industry. It was produced by me. It obviously does \nnot include every vehicle, but we believe it makes an important point, \nwhich is that American vehicles, class by class, are at least as fuel \nefficient as foreign vehicles.\n  This chart shows trucks, pickups, SUVs, and the minivan. Those are \nthe three vehicles we studied.\n  A similar chart can be made for passenger vehicles. We did not do \nthat because that has not been the focus, but we are perfectly happy to \ncompare numbers on passenger vehicles provided we are comparing apples \nand apples, providing we are comparing classes of vehicles of the same \nrelative size.\n  We can also look at passenger vehicles, and we can reach basically \nthe same conclusion. The problem is, if you lump all the different \nclasses of vehicles together, at that point you come up with a system \nwhich has a discriminatory impact on some manufacturers, and it is the \nAmerican manufacturers that carry the brunt of that disparate impact.\n  Take a look, for instance, at the large SUVs. Ford Expedition gets 15 \nmiles per gallon. GMC Yukon gets 15 miles per gallon. Dodge Durango \ngets 15 miles per gallon. The Toyota Land Cruiser gets 14 miles per \ngallon. If people want to choose a Toyota, that is their business, but \nit seems to me we should not be creating a system which pushes people \nto imports because Toyota can produce hundreds of thousands of \nadditional Land Cruisers without any negative effect in terms of their \nbumping up against the CAFE limit when the Land Cruiser is not as fuel \nefficient as the American vehicles.\n  Midsize SUVs: Ford Explorer, 17 miles; Chevrolet Trail Blazer, 18 \nmiles; Jeep Liberty, 17 miles; Toyota 4Runner, 17 miles--equal or a \nlittle better fuel efficient in case of the Trail Blazer. It is the \nsame with the small SUV, the large pickup, and the small pickup.\n  We can go through these one by one, but in each case, the U.S. \nvehicles are either as fuel efficient or slightly more. One can also \npick cases where an imported vehicle may be 1 mile per gallon or \nsomewhat more efficient. Those cases will exist if one looks at it \nenough.\n  If we look at the entire picture class by class, American vehicles \nare as fuel efficient as imported vehicles, or in the cases I gave--and \nin many other cases--more fuel efficient.\n  We have a situation called CAFE where foreign manufacturers are \nrelatively unconstrained by CAFE because of a fleet mix, not because \nthey are more fuel efficient class by class.\n  Nothing is gained for the environment if an imported SUV is bought \ninstead of an American-made SUV where the American SUV is at least as \nfuel efficient as the foreign SUV. Nothing is gained for the air, but a \nlot of American jobs are lost.\n  If we look at the opportunity for just one manufacturer--let me back \nup 1 minute.\n  This is the impact of a 36-mile-per-gallon combined car/truck \nstandard on five manufacturers. Honda only has to increase theirs by 20 \npercent; Toyota, 36 percent; GM, 51 percent; Ford, 56 percent; \nDaimlerChrysler, 59 percent.\n  Again, I emphasize, because this is the key point, those disparate \nimpacts have nothing to do with the relative fuel efficiencies of the \nvehicles of the same class. It has to do with the fleet mix.\n  What we have put in place--I guess the word ``bizarre'' is as close \nas I can come to it, because this does not do anything for the \nenvironment to push people into an imported vehicle which is no more \nfuel efficient than a domestic.\n  If people want to buy an imported vehicle, that is their judgment, \nthat is their business, but for us to have a structure which pushes \npeople in that direction because we constrain the number of larger \nvehicles which the American manufacturers can produce,\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nalthough they are equally efficient and many times more efficient in \nterms of fuel than the imports, it seems to me does not do anything for \nthe environment and it costs American jobs. That is something we should \navoid. We ought to take the time to avoid it.\n  We ought to have a regulatory process where people can look at the \ndisparate impacts on various manufacturers, as well as all of the other \ncriteria which ought to be used, such as vehicle safety.\n  I will read a couple of statements from the National Academy of \nSciences study relative to safety. Page 27: The downsizing and \ndownweighting of the vehicle fleet that occurred during the 1970s and \nearly 1980s still appear to have imposed a substantial safety penalty \nin terms of lost lives and additional injuries. Page 70: There would \nhave been between 1,300 and 2,600 fewer crash deaths in 1993. That is \nthe year they studied. They picked the year, not me. They picked the \nyear 1993 to look at the impact of CAFE on safety. The National Academy \nof Sciences said--not the American auto industry, not the insurance \nindustry but the National Academy of Sciences--there would have been \nbetween 1,300 and 2,600 fewer crash deaths in 1993 had the average \nweight and size of the light-duty motor vehicle fleet in that year been \nthat of the mid-1970s.\n  Similarly, it was estimated there would have been 13,000 to 26,000 \nfewer moderate-to-critical injuries. These are deaths and injuries that \nwould have been prevented in larger, heavier vehicles given their \nimprovements in vehicle occupant protection and the travel environment \nthat occurred during the intervening years.\n  In other words--and this is the bottom line for me--these deaths and \ninjuries were one of the painful tradeoffs that resulted from \ndownweighting and downsizing and the resultant improved fuel economy. \nPainful tradeoffs. Should somebody consider that? Is it worth \nconsidering between 1,300 and 2,600 deaths in 1993? That is the typical \nyear they picked. Should that not be at least a factor on the scale?\n  It is not on the scale in the language that is in the substitute \nbefore us. We want to put it on that scale. There is no one of these \nfactors which by itself ought to result in any particular outcome. All \nof these factors ought to be weighed, but that is not what is in the \nsubstitute. In the substitute is a number, arbitrarily selected, which \nin the judgment of some--and we do not know how, we do not have a \ncommittee report to help us through that mine field. All we know is we \nhave a number and then we are told that is reasonable; they can do \nthat.\n\n  Look, they can produce vehicles that get 40 miles per gallon. Sure, \nthey can. They can produce electric vehicles which even do better than \nthat. The question is, Are there people who want to buy them? That is \nalways the question. In trying to determine that, do we want to try to \nfactor in what is the cost?\n  I urge people to take a look at the National Academy of Sciences \ntables when it comes to costs. They are complicated, they are \ntechnical, but they are worth looking at.\n  Now, the National Academy does not conclude what a new CAFE number \nshould be. We should set the policy, it says, and we are. In this \namendment, we are setting the policy. Our policy is, we want to rely \nmore on positive incentives. Our policy is, we want to increase fuel \neconomy. Our policy is, we want to look at a lot of provisions which \nare relevant to the question of what the new CAFE numbers should be; \nnot just the one factor which the proponents of the language in the \nsubstitute rely on, which is potential technological feasibilities, but \nother factors: costs, safety, adverse effects on relative \ncompetitiveness of manufacturer, effect on U.S. employment and the \nNational Research Council's entire report.\n  I talked about the disparate effects.\n  The amendment I have made reference to I would now send to the desk \non behalf of myself, Senators Bond, Stabenow, and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Bond, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2997 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. The National Academy of Sciences report also makes some \nreferences to these disparate impacts on different manufacturers of \nCAFE, and this is what they say on page 102: That one concept of equity \namong manufacturers requires equal treatment of equivalent vehicles \nmade by different manufacturers.\n  Equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \nmanufacturers seems pretty reasonable to me. This is what they say \nabout that: The current CAFE standards fail this test. If one \nmanufacturer was positioned in the market selling many large passenger \ncars, thereby was just meeting the CAFE standard, adding a 22-mile-per-\ngallon car would result in a financial penalty or would require \nsignificant improvements of fuel economy for the remainder of the \npassenger cars.\n  Then they also say on page 69: A single standard that did not \ndifferentiate between cars and trucks would be particularly difficult \nto accommodate. On page 15: For foreign manufacturers, the standards \nappear to have served more as a floor towards which their fuel economy \ndescended in the 1990s. This is the result of CAFE. This is the \nadditional sales of large pickups and SUVs which would be allowed under \nCAFE under today's standard because of the way it is based.\n  GM, again whose vehicles are equally fuel efficient class by class \nwith their imported competitors: Toyota and Honda, zero. They are up to \nthe limit. Because of the fleet mix, Toyota can sell 312,000 \nadditional, Honda 324,000 additional. If one adds credits which have \nbeen built up over the years to that, it reaches, I believe, a million. \nThat is the CAFE system.\n  Should somebody look at that system? Is that a system which is worth \nlooking at again to see whether or not in fact it has these kinds of \ndisparate impacts?\n  The National Academy acknowledges that the current CAFE standards \nfail the test of manufacturers of equivalent vehicles receiving equal \ntreatment.\n  That ought to be enough, it seems to me, to say we should take \nanother look at the CAFE structure. Someone ought to take another look \nat it. There ought to be a regulatory process where people can come in, \nmake arguments, where people who have the responsibility to look at all \nthe criteria weigh the criteria, publish a proposed rule for comment, \nand get comment on it. That is not what is proposed in the substitute. \nIt is proposed we get an arbitrary number and say that is what it will \nbe because some people think that is doable. Some people here, \napparently, and some of the outside folks they rely on think that is \ndoable.\n  That is not a rulemaking process, it seems to me, that looks at all \nthe criteria that need to be looked at when we have something as \nimportant as this is for the economy of this country.\n  I will be happy to answer questions of my friend from Massachusetts \nif they are still on his mind after I close.\n  In conclusion, the stakes we have are huge for the environment and \nfor the economy. I have been sensitive to the environment all my life, \ncoming from a State where the environment is absolutely critical, where \nwater and air mean everything. We are in the middle of the greatest \nbatch of fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes. We care deeply \nabout it. We are a State where environment is high on everybody's list.\n  I will take a back seat--since we are talking about vehicles--to \nnobody when it comes to my belief we should protect the environment. I \nbelieve we can protect the environment in a way which does not \nnegatively impact our economy if we will do it the right way, if we \nwill go at this the right way, with greater emphasis on positive \nincentives, but greater caution, before we pick a number which we then \nimpose on an industry, particularly when we know from the NAS study \nthat the CAFE system has not been equitable, that it treats equivalent \nvehicles of different manufacturers in an equal way.\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\n  We can fix that--it will take a little time--if we will turn this \nover, with a fixed calendar and schedule, to a regulatory body which \nhas the responsibility to do this, and then watch them go through a \nprocess, issue a regulation, publish that regulation, either adopt it \nor veto it under existing law, and if they do not comply with the \ncalendar we set for them, we then have an expedited process here to \nconsider alternatives, including those offered by my good friend from \nMassachusetts and my friend from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to strongly \nsupport the Levin-Bond-Stabenow-Mikulski amendment.\n  First, I thank my colleague from Michigan for all his leadership and \nhard work on this proposal which I believe strikes a balance to be able \nto bring together the common goals of increasing fuel efficiency and \nalso making sure we are protecting jobs and supporting the growth in \nthe American economy. I support and thank my friend from Missouri for \nhis hard work and leadership on this issue as well.\n  I begin by saying that this debate is not about whether or not we \nshould increase vehicle fuel efficiency. I agree with Senator Kerry \nabout the importance of creating more fuel efficient cars and SUVs, not \nonly because it would decrease our oil consumption and our dependence \non foreign oil, but because of the important benefits it has our \nenvironment. What this debate is really about is what is the best way \nto increase fuel efficiency without having negatively affected U.S. \nmanufacturers and American jobs.\n  Before I discuss the Kerry-McCain CAFE proposal, I address the myth \nthat the Big Three's vehicles are not as fuel efficient as their \nforeign competitors. When CAFE was first enacted as a part of the 1975 \nEnergy and Policy Conservation Act over 25 years ago, the Big Three \nwere criticized for lagging behind their foreign competitors by making \nbigger, less fuel efficient cars. A lot has changed since the CAFE \nsystem was first implemented and this is not your mother's Big Three. \nWhen you compare foreign and American vehicles that are in the same \nweight and class, the American vehicles are as fuel efficient, and \noften more fuel efficient than their foreign counterparts.\n  For example, the Toyota Camry, one of the most popular cars in \nToyota's fleet, is less fuel efficient than all of its Big Three \ncompetitor passenger cars we compare. Both the Ford Taurus and the \nDaimlerChrysler Concord have a city/highway fuel economy of 23 miles \nper gallon, which is 1 mile per gallon more fuel efficient than the \nToyota Camry. The GM Impala has a city/highway fuel economy of 25 miles \nper gallon--it is 2 miles per gallon more fuel efficient then the \nToyota Camry. This is true across the Big Three's fleets--pound for \npound, as my colleague from Michigan likes to say, American cars are as \nfuel efficient as their foreign competitors.\n  This is true even for the biggest, heaviest American SUV. This chart \nshows the fuel economy of the largest SUV models, all of which have \nlarger, more powerful engines. All of the Big Three SUVs have better \nfuel economy than the Toyota Land Cruiser Wagon. The DaimlerChrysler \nDurango, Ford Expedition, and GM K1500 Suburban have a city/highway \nfuel economy of 15 miles per gallon, which is 1 mile per gallon more \nfuel efficient than the Toyota Land Cruiser Wagon.\n  The question becomes, with all of these more fuel efficient vehicles \nin their fleets, why does the Big Three have a lower CAFE number than \nits foreign competitors? It is because the CAFE system does not reflect \nthe real fuel economy of the cars and trucks in an automaker's fleet; \ninstead it really reflects what vehicles consumer purchase. The CAFE \nnumber does not reflect the fuel economy improvements of each vehicle; \ninstead CAFE represents the averaged fuel economy of an automaker's \nentire fleet which depends on how many of each model consumers actually \nbuy. Therefore, an automaker can increase the fuel efficiency of all of \ntheir vehicles but still have a declining CAFE average depending on \nwhat models sell the most.\n\n  For example, over the past 3 years GM has introduced new truck and \nSUV models that are more fuel efficient than the models they replaced. \nThey are introducing more fuel-efficient trucks and SUV models than the \nmodels they replaced. But GM's light truck CAFE number has either \nremained flat or actually gone down.\n  This is the bizarre situation that Senator Levin talked about. That \ndoesn't make any sense. But in 2000, GM introduced reengineered full-\nsize SUVs--the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon--which have an \nincreased fuel economy of 4 percent over the models they replaced. The \nmore fuel efficient 2000 models sold were 190,000 more than the \nprevious models, but the GM's light truck CAFE number actually \ndecreased because of increased sales of these more fuel-efficient SUVs.\n  That doesn't make any sense. That is why we are objecting to the \ncurrent process for CAFE.\n  Let me talk about another chart.\n  In model year 2000, GM's combined car and truck CAFE average was 24.2 \nmiles per gallon. For model year 2001, GM made fuel economy \nimprovements to eight different vehicles in their fleet --the Ventura, \nthe Park Avenue, the Bonneville, the Impala, the Grand Prix, the \nDeVille, and the Aurora. For all of these models, the fuel efficiency \nnumbers went up.\n  Some of the vehicles had a 17-percent, 19-percent, or 6-percent \nimprovement in fuel economy over the models of the previous years. But \ndo you know what GM's combined car and truck CAFE average was for model \nyear 2001? It was 24.2, the same as model year 2000. GM improved the \nfuel economy of eight vehicles, and their CAFE numbers stayed the same. \nHow does a system that does not reflect actual improvements in vehicle \nfuel economy and penalizes automakers for doing the right thing make \nany sense?\n  The proposal of Senator Kerry and others builds upon this flawed \nsystem and further compounds the anticompetitive and discriminatory \nimpact on our Big Three automakers. Currently, the Big Three automakers \nmake a higher proportion of trucks than cars. Because of their product \nmix, this CAFE proposal creates impossible fuel economy targets for \nU.S. automakers without really affecting the foreign competitors, which \nis a major concern for me.\n  DaimlerChrysler, for example, has a fleet mix of approximately 65 \npercent light trucks and 35 percent passenger cars. Assuming we close \nthe so-called SUV loophole and DaimlerChrysler's light truck fleet \nachieved 28 miles per gallon, its passenger car fleet would have to \naverage over 76 miles per gallon to achieve the 36-mile-per-gallon \nfleetwide average.\n  That is the problem with CAFE. However, Honda, which has a fleet mix \nof approximately 20 percent light trucks and 80 percent passenger cars, \nwould only have to achieve a passenger car fleet average of 38 miles \nper gallon to achieve that same 36-mile-per-gallon fleetwide average.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. Furthermore, this CAFE \nproposal will not guarantee a more fuel-efficient SUV. But it will \nguarantee that the SUV will be made by Honda or Toyoto instead of an \nAmerican-made auto company.\n  I can tell you as someone coming from the great State of Michigan \nthat this is not something the people of my great State want to see \nhappen, nor should we want it to happen nationally. The impact is \nserious for us in terms of jobs and the economy. Foreign manufacturers \nalready control a large share of U.S. car sales. Trucks and SUVs are \nthe last domestic stronghold, but the same shift to foreign \nmanufacturers is already evident in the truck market.\n  This CAFE proposal places an anticompetitive cap on how many trucks \nand SUV's the Big Three can produce, but leaves their foreign \ncompetitors unencumbered to expand into the truck and SUV market. \nCompetitors with fewer sales in the truck and SUV market would be able \nto increase their sales in this area resulting in a transfer of market \nshare, without a net gain in fuel economy. For example, Toyota can \nproduce up to 250,000 more Tundras today, without increasing any \nvehicle fuel efficiency and without going below the currently mandated \nCAFE requirements. Imagine how many more Tundras Toyota could build \nunder this CAFE proposal while our American\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\nautomakers are restrained from competing in that important market.\n  These foreign competitors also have more CAFE credits built up from \nprevious model years due to their mainly smaller vehicle mix. By \napplying these credits to future model years, foreign automakers would \nbe able to further fill the demand for larger vehicles that would be \nleft unmet by the restraints placed on our American automakers. For \nexample, at the end of model year 2001, Toyota has about $140 million \nin CAFE credits. This would allow Toyota to produce up to 1.1 million \nTundras at current CAFE standards before exhausting its built-up \ncredits.\n  The Kerry-McCain proposal also does not address the pick-up truck \nproblem in any meaningful way. The Kerry-McCain proposal would exempt \nheavy duty pick-up trucks weighing between 8,500-10,000 pounds, but \nthat is just a restatement of current law because trucks in this weight \nrange are already exempted from CAFE. This proposal fails to address \nthe concerns of farmers, ranchers and other pick-up truck consumers, \nsince the overwhelming majority of pick-up trucks would fall below this \n8500 pound limit.\n  I want to stress that I am not advocating that we protect the Big \nThree from market competition. I am not supporting a freeze on CAFE \nstandards because I do not believe the Big Three should avoid producing \nmore fuel efficient cars and SUVs.\n  We are not arguing about a freeze. We are talking about a better way \nto do this that moves us forward and that gets us to where we all want \nto go in a way that does not penalize the domestic automakers and cost \njobs.\n  But like a CAFE freeze, this proposal also protects a group from real \nmarket competition and thwarts increases in fuel efficiency; however, \nthe group that this proposal protects is not the Big Three, but their \nforeign competitors like Honda and Toyota.\n  It is also important to remember that the 36-miles-per-gallon number \nin this CAFE proposal is not anywhere in the National Academy of \nScience's report. Even under the optimistic scenarios in the NAS \nreport, which assume that consumers are willing to recover the higher \ncosts of the technology over a 14-year period instead of a 3-year \nperiod and assume ``average'' technology costs, only subcompact \npassenger cars are projected to reach the 36 mpg within the 10-15 year \ntimeframe. Under these optimistic 14-year payback and ``average'' costs \nprojections, the highest level for any light truck, which is for small \nSUVs--is only 32.6 miles per gallon. This CAFE proposal sets a number \nthat according to the experts at NAS, only a smallest passenger car \ncould meet!\n  This proposal legislates a market advantage for foreign automakers, \nwhile in essence forcing a production cap on our American automakers' \nmost popular vehicles.\n  The EV-I--an electric car--was produced not 10 minutes from my house \nin Lansing, MI. That plant was closed because they weren't getting \nenough volume in production. People weren't buying it. We need to find \nways to make that more attractive, which is what our proposal does by \nhelping with infrastructure, bringing the price down, and creating more \nvolume.\n  Our American automakers will be forced, unfortunately, under the \nunderlying proposal, to respond in a number of undesirable ways to meet \nthis unrealistic overall CAFE number, all of which make them less \ncompetitive in the car and light truck market.\n  First, they will be forced to cut vehicles from their fleets or place \na production cap on certain cars, which will result in more layoffs and \nplant closures, I fear.\n  For example, if GM addresses the fairly immediate 3-mile-per-gallon \nincrease in the light truck standard by simply eliminating its least \nfuel-efficient products, seven plants in five States employing 38,000 \nauto workers and 154,000 auto and supplier jobs would be at risk. And \nGM's sales volume in the light truck market would be reduced by over 1 \nmillion vehicles.\n  Our U.S. automakers also could be forced to strip their vehicles of \nfeatures consumers want, such as engine size and power to meet this \nhigh CAFE number, giving foreign automakers that will not have to \neliminate these features a huge competitive advantage.\n  Lastly, they could reduce the weight of cars, which will compromise \nvehicle safety, as has been talked about before, since producing \nsmaller, lightweight vehicles that can perform using low-power, fuel-\nefficient engines is the most affordable way for automakers to meet the \nCAFE standards. None of these options are good for our American \nautomakers or for our consumers.\n  Placing U.S. automakers at a competitive disadvantage by penalizing \ntheir most popular vehicles will lead to more layoffs and a weaker U.S. \nauto industry. And we certainly do not need this at this time or any \ntime. It is apparent to all of us debating this issue that the auto \nindustry is not at its economic strongest right now. Practically every \nweek one of our U.S. automakers announces another round of layoffs. \nOver the past year, our big three automakers--GM, Ford, and \nDaimlerChrysler--have announced almost 70,000 layoffs and job cuts and \n11 plant closures. That is 70,000 in 1 year. Our domestic automakers \nhave already been severely weakened by the current recession. I fear \nthat the underlying proposal to raise CAFE standards will only \nexacerbate this problem by placing uncompetitive restrictions on our \nU.S. automakers without effectively increasing vehicle fuel economy.\n  In Michigan, over 1 million people are either directly or indirectly \nemployed by our domestic auto industry. While the economic impact is \nparticularly devastating in Michigan, this is not just a Michigan \nissue. The auto industry is the largest industry in the United States \nand creates over 6.6 million jobs directly or indirectly.\n  Our amendment--the Levin-Bond-Stabenow-Mikulski amendment--increases \nvehicle fuel efficiency without placing anticompetitive restrictions on \nour U.S. automakers. This amendment helps decrease our fuel consumption \nand dependence on foreign oil in the short term by increasing CAFE for \nlight trucks and cars. But, most importantly, the amendment looks to \nthe future, which is something we all want to do, and provides the \nmarket incentives and investments in developing technologies such as \nhybrids, fuel cells, and clean diesel vehicles that will really \nrevolutionize the American automobile industry.\n  The amendment directs the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration to complete a rulemaking to increase fuel efficiency for \nlight trucks within the next 15 months and for passenger cars within \nthe next 24 months, but it also requires NHTSA to consider the flaws \nthat we have been talking about today in the current CAFE system as \nthey do this rulemaking. NHTSA would examine important issues that have \nbeen talked about, such as adverse competitive impacts of CAFE on our \nU.S. automakers, impacts on U.S. employment, technology costs, and \nnecessary lead time, the effects of vehicle safety, and the effects on \nthe environment before setting a CAFE number, not after.\n\n  The CAFE proposal in the energy bill puts the cart before the horse, \nI fear, and sets a 36-mile-per-gallon number before having NHTSA have \nthe opportunity to examine all of these factors.\n  We need to let the experts at NHTSA do their job. NHTSA is properly \nequipped to address the fundamental changes that have occurred within \nthe industry over the last several years, and to evaluate our current \neconomic situation, technology, and capabilities regarding a higher \nCAFE standard.\n  In the past, Congress has enacted a CAFE freeze preventing NHTSA from \nmoving forward with issuing new CAFE regulations. Now that the freeze \nhas expired, we should not interfere with NHTSA's ability to do its job \neffectively.\n  Congress also needs to help automakers move in the right direction \ninstead of pulling them in the wrong direction. Foreign and domestic \nautomakers have already invested millions of dollars in developing \ncleaner, better technologies. These investments are starting to pay off \nfor the American consumer.\n  For example, DaimlerChrysler will be producing a hybrid electric \nDodge Durango SUV starting in 2003, which will have 20 percent better \nfuel economy than the conventional Durango, without compromising safety \nor comfort. A hybrid electric version of the DaimlerChrysler Dodge Ram \npickup truck also will go into production in\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\n2004. Ford is currently developing a hybrid Ford Escape SUV which will \nbe capable of being driven more than 500 miles on a single tank of gas.\n  In addition to these great technological developments, automakers \nhave been working on fuel cell vehicles which could revolutionize the \nautomobile sector within the next 15 years. The CAFE proposal in the \nenergy bill will force automakers to divert funding and research away \nfrom these important technological advances and make meeting these \nincremental CAFE increases a funding and research priority. That is a \nmajor concern of mine. They are moving in the right direction. The \nunderlying Kerry proposal would force them to change direction to meet \nsome shorter term goals. This CAFE proposal also locks the automakers \ninto a rigid fuel efficiency plan for the next 10 years, setting back \nthe progress they are making putting these important technologies into \nplace.\n  Instead of placing restrictions on what our automakers produce, we \nshould be looking for ways to help them introduce these better, cleaner \ntechnologies. The Levin-Bond amendment includes these incentives, such \nas Federal fleet purchase and alternative fuels requirements and a real \nFederal investment in hybrid, clean diesel, and fuel cell research and \ndevelopment-- all the things we know have to happen.\n  The amendment requires that 10 percent of the light-duty trucks in \nFederal fleets be hybrid vehicles by 2007, and requires the Federal \nGovernment to use alternative fuels in all of their dual-fueled \nvehicles. The amendment also increases funding for the Freedom Car \nInitiative for fuel cell vehicles by 40 percent.\n  Finally, the Levin-Bond alternative includes important consumer tax \ncredits for electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles, which will be \noffered in a separate amendment. These tax incentives will help create \nand build market demand for the most efficient hybrid, electric, and \nfuel cell vehicles, instead of locking automakers into costly \nincremental CAFE increases.\n\n  I urge my colleagues today to vote for the Levin-Bond amendment and \nsupport increased fuel efficiency and a vibrant, economically healthy \nU.S. auto industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic cosponsor of \nthe Levin-Bond amendment on these CAFE standards.\n  Our amendment, I believe, provides a strategy for energy conservation \nwhile safeguarding American jobs. I believe in energy conservation. I \nbelieve it is an absolute national necessity. But I also believe in job \nconservation--American job conservation.\n  I believe we can improve the fuel efficiency of our cars without \nsticking a knife through the hearts of our Nation's auto workers.\n  I believe we can do it by applying four criteria. These are criteria \nI know the Presiding Officer has helped develop. We need to achieve \nreal savings in oil consumption. We need to preserve U.S. jobs. And \nwhatever we do must be realizable and achievable. That means giving \ncompanies a reasonable lead time to adjust their production, to \ndevelop, test, road test--not laboratory test--and implement new \ntechnologies. What works well in the lab doesn't always work so great \non the beltway.\n\n  We also have to create incentives to enable companies to achieve \nthese goals. Incentives are a favorable tax policy. I don't believe the \nKerry-McCain proposal meets those criteria, but I do believe the Levin-\nBond amendment really does.\n  In terms of the Kerry-McCain language, as I understand it, it will \nrequire a 50-percent increase in CAFE standards to reach 36 miles a \ngallon by the year 2015, enabling the National Highway Transportation \nSafety Administration to combine car and truck fleets into one \ncategory. You have to listen to that. It would combine car and truck \nfleets into one category--that means we take apples and oranges and say \nthat fruit salad is the same--creating a single standard for both cars \nand trucks that would help foreign car manufacturers and penalize U.S. \nautomobile workers for selling vehicles that we Americans are \nabsolutely buying.\n  Why would this help foreign car makers? When you look at the fuel \nmileage or the achievement in mileage, European and Japanese automobile \ncompanies in various categories roughly achieve the same fuel \nconsumption standards, but foreign manufacturers sell many more small \ncars. They not only sell small cars, they sell microcars, those really \nlittle cars that look as if they are golf carts on wheels. Then when \nyou include their SUVs and light trucks, their average fuel efficiency \nstandard is lower--not because their SUV fuel efficiency standards are \nlower or that their light trucks are lower, it is because they sell \nmore of these microcars. That is why they are able to comply with \nhigher CAFE standards.\n  I believe we do need conservation. There is no doubt we need to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. We all acknowledge that half of \nour oil is imported. A quarter of our oil is imported from the Persian \nGulf. We know we need to reduce our dependence. But we could do it \nthrough the kinds of recommendations made in the Bond-Levin amendment.\n  Before I go on to talk about Bond-Levin, let me talk a little bit \nabout the Kerry-Hollings proposal. I know my colleagues have worked \nvery hard on this, and we all share the same national goals. But how we \nget there I am not so sure is in the national interest.\n  First, it is unfair to American workers because it gives foreign \nmanufacturers a leg up in the middle of a recession. It is arbitrary, \nand it is also unattainable, setting very aggressive standards on too \nshort of a time line. And it would limit consumer choice by effectively \ncapping the sales of light trucks. There are other ways to achieve fuel \nconservation.\n  I want to come back to the whole idea about foreign car companies \nproducing smaller cars and that is what their customers buy. There is \nno doubt that Americans are buying these microcars. There is no doubt \nabout it. They are usually younger or older or often a second car in \nthe family. For middle-class families, though, they are not the core \ncar. The core car is an SUV or a minivan. I will talk about that in a \nminute.\n  When we talk about, again, achieving those standards, putting \neverybody and everything in the same category, quite frankly, it is \nlike putting a bagel in with strawberries, and the strawberries are \nlower in calories and the bagel is not, and saying, we are going to \nhave the average of calorie consumption. Do you follow that? Or \nraspberries. I think a lot about this amendment--some of it is \nraspberries.\n  We need to recognize that over the past decade the U.S. car \nmanufacturers have struggled to meet CAFE requirements across a full \nline of vehicles in both cars and trucks.\n  American consumers are really obsessed with safety. This is why many \nof them are turning to a larger car. The Kerry-McCain amendment does \neffectively cap the sale of light trucks, since the default level for \nlight trucks is not achieved by any light truck on the road today.\n  Some people are talking about exempting the light trucks. I am for \nthat. If there is a pickup truck waiver, I am going to vote for it. But \nvery often that is a guy thing, though many women do drive light \ntrucks. But most women are driving minivans and SUVs. A couple years \nago, all we who hold elective office were very busy chasing the soccer \nmom. We wanted the soccer moms' vote. But while we were chasing the \nsoccer moms, the soccer moms were chasing after car companies that made \nSUVs and minivans. And why do American women love SUVs and minivans? \nBecause they need increased passenger capacity and they want increased \nsafety.\n  When you are a soccer mom and you are picking up the kids or you are \ncarpooling or have kids with gear, such as the soccer kids, or the \nlacrosse kids or the ice-skating kids, they come with their own gear. \nSome children have backpacks as large as a marine going off to \nAfghanistan. Those mothers need large capacity.\n  Do you know what else they need? They need passenger safety. They \nwant to have a bulkier car in order to be able to protect their \nchildren on these highways and byways that we are now constructing. \nAnyone who rides the 495 beltway in Washington or 695 in Baltimore \nknows we face big trucks; we face\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\nroad rage. Mothers want to be in the functional civilian equivalent of \na Humvee. Why? Because they are scared. They are scared for their \nchildren and for their safety. So they go big and they go bulk.\n  Do we approve of it? Would we like better fuel efficiency? The answer \nis, absolutely, yes. I know a lot about these minivans because General \nMotors makes two of them, the Chevy Astro and the GMC Safari, right in \nmy hometown of Baltimore. Right this minute at Broening Highway in \nBaltimore, there are 1,600 employees working to produce these Astro and \nSafari vans. In 1 year they make 80,000 vehicles. That keeps 1,600 \nworkers happy and 80,000 consumers happy.\n  That 1,600 sounds like a lot of jobs. In 1978, we had 7,000 jobs. We \nhave downsized. We have modernized. We have strategized. But we are \ndown close to 6,000 jobs.\n  I feel very close to these workers. I grew up 4 miles from this \nplant. My dad had a grocery store. People who worked at General Motors \nand Bethlehem Steel were not units of production or those who have to \ngive way to displacements in the info age. They were our neighbors; \nthey are our neighbors.\n  What did we know about the General Motors plant? It was a union job. \nWe knew it offered a good job at good wages and good benefits. We knew \nthey were good neighbors because they sponsored the little leagues and \nwere one of the largest contributors to the United Fund to be able to \nhelp others who didn't quite have the good jobs and the good wages that \nthey did.\n  For our working men, they could actually go to work and not only put \nin an honest day but get a fair pay back to be able to raise their \nfamilies and pursue the American dream.\n  In my hometown of Baltimore among African-American men, when I grew \nup, Baltimore was a segregated town. But down there at the steel mill \nin the UAW line, it is where African-American men went to get a decent \njob. If you were an African-American male in Baltimore, you had two \nchoices where you could have a decent job, decent benefits, and a \nchance to be able to move up. It was either a civil servant job, such \nas at the post office, or it was a union job, such as at General \nMotors. As more and more women came into the workplace, again, for many \nwomen, General Motors was the place to go. We employed the ``Norma \nRaes'' of automobile manufacturing.\n\n  We are talking about honest Americans who get up and work hard every \nday. They wanted the American dream, and they had opportunities. People \nwith European ethnic heritage and people with African-American heritage \nhad a chance to work hard and move up. Many of them had a chance to go \non to higher education, and their children did also. But we now have \nthese 1,600, and when this goes, it goes. When this goes, it really \ngoes. There is nothing else there. We can talk about digital harbor or \nsmokestacks and cyberstacks, and we can be cute and clever; but when \nthis goes, it goes forever.\n  Now, I am on this floor fighting for those people. Do you know why? \nTheir sons are actually the ones who went to Vietnam, the ones who were \nin Desert Storm, and the ones who are in Afghanistan. During the \nVietnam war, there was no draft counseling in that line. Every time \nAmerica calls, these kinds of workers step forward. Often, their \nbrothers are our firefighters and our police. These are the ordinary \nAmericans who, every day, are willing to step up.\n  So while we are talking about hybrids, and while we can nibble at our \nsushi and talk about the future that is going to be ozone-ready, we \nhave to think about who is going to work in this country and where they \nare going to work. Do we want to give up on our manufacturing base? I \ndon't think so, and I hope not. Whether it is in Detroit, or Maryland, \nor whether it is other States that employ them--and we are happy to \nhave the Hondas. I have a UAW plant up in western Maryland that is now \npart-owned by Volvo. We are happy to have them because they honor their \ncontracts.\n  But I think we ought to start honoring our contract. We ought to have \na contract with the American workers. There is something about America \nwe need to remember: That as we defend America from foreign foes, we \nneed to defend America from the loss of jobs to foreign imports, or to \nsomething called CAFE, or let's put everybody in the same pot and \nmeasure the standards in the same way.\n  Mr. President, 1,000 workers were recently laid off at General Motors \non a temporary shutdown because of a lot of this. I could go on about \nthose workers, but I think I have made my point. Just remember, when \nthese jobs go, they go, and they will never come back. While we are so \nbusy putting everything on a fast track to Mexico, I will tell you that \nthey go to Mexico first, and then they find Mexico too expensive and \nthey go to Central America, and then they go on to China. So we have to \nstart making some tough choices.\n  We could go on to talk about the other issues, but I know we also \nneed to look at the other alternative. I believe the Levin-Bond \namendment is a very sensible alternative. It really works to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, but it also insists that we look at the \neffect on U.S. employment; that we look at motor vehicle safety; that \nwe look at the cost and lead time for the introduction of new \ntechnology. I believe new technologies will help us lead the way.\n  I think it also gives us an open-ended dodge ball kind of situation \nbecause it gives two dates and time lines to the Department of \nTransportation. It says we have to increase standards for light trucks \nin 15 months. It says for passenger cars we have to have a rule within \n6 months. It also separates out standards for cars and light-duty \ntrucks. Remember, this is one of the crucial aspects of this amendment. \nIt separates out the standards for cars and light-duty trucks. We can \ncompete with anybody in the world. But where you have a \ndisproportionate thing going on in the market, it renders us almost \nhelpless.\n  The automakers such as DaimlerChrysler have a fleet that is roughly \n70 percent light trucks, while manufacturers such as Honda have a fleet \nthat is less than 30 percent light trucks. I believe the Levin-Bond \namendment does it very well.\n  We need tax incentives on electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and \nhybrid electric vehicles. Everybody likes them. I will see if they work \nover time. I have seen a lot of these kinds of cars come and go. Some \nwork very well, some sputter and end up in a junkyard clutter. I don't \nknow where they will go, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. \nI want to see the technologies road tested more before they are \nintroduced.\n  I know others want to speak. I believe we can have energy \nconservation and job conservation, innovative solutions, improved \ntechnology, and the setting of realistic goals. That is what Levin-Bond \ndoes. When you look at Levin-Bond, you see that it saves energy, jobs, \nand it saves lives. For those now who are speaking in the Chamber so \npassionately about energy independence and why it is in our national \nsecurity interest, I hope we talk about trade adjustment and start \nstanding up for steel and what we need to do to make sure we are steel-\nindependent. I hope we have the same passion in standing up for our \nsteelworkers. I am going to stand up for those hardhats every day any \nway I can, whether it is in the automobile industry, or whether it is \nin the steel industry, and so on.\n  For all of those men and women who, every day, at plant gates shook \nmy hand--and their hands were calloused, and they would go home with \nbad backs and varicose veins--Barbara Mikulski is on their side, and I \nhope the rest of the Senate is also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \ncomments now of a number of my colleagues--each of those who are the \nsponsors of the Bond-Levin amendment--and I have really listened with \ninterest because the debate that I think the Senate deserves to have \nright now is one based on the truth, based on the facts, based on \nscience, and based on history. I have heard some of the most remarkable \nAlice-in-Wonderland comments in the last few minutes that I find it \nhard to believe we are really talking about the same thing.\n  Senator Bond suggested that if we don't accept their amendment, \npeople\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nare going to actually be driven into getting into golf carts--a string \nof golf carts--which is not a very efficient way for a family to be \ntransported. I heard another comment that we don't want to push people \ninto imported vehicles. Well, of course, we don't.\n  I just listened to a very appropriate and distinguished speech about \nworkers in this country. I remember with great pride that moment in \n1971 when Leonard Woodcock introduced me to the United Auto Workers and \nI was inducted as a lifetime member. I don't know anybody who runs for \noffice in this country on a getting-rid-of-jobs platform. I don't know \nanybody who comes to the floor of the Senate suggesting, knowingly--and \nI hope not negligently and inadvertently--that a plan they are \nsubmitting is going to render Americans jobless.\n  I am here to defend the workers in Detroit, and in other parts of \nthis country, just as much as anybody else. When I hear the notion \ninvoked about who goes to fight our wars and who comes back as veterans \nand these are the people who work there--I know those people, and you \nbet I want them to keep working. I believe they can keep working. There \nis nothing that suggests that somebody in Detroit cannot make a better \ncar than the Japanese. There is nothing to suggest that a Detroit \nworker, or one in any other part of the country, can't make a better \nand more efficient car than the Germans. American workers are the best \nworkers, the most productive workers in the world. Those workers are \nhandicapped by choices made by management.\n  The worker does not decide what the model is going to be. The worker \ndoes not decide which car is going to be manufactured and what the \nchangeover date will be. They report every day and go to the floor. \nThey punch in and make the cars that the designers and the executives \ngive them to make, and they do it well.\n  I proudly drive one of those minivans. I drive a Chrysler minivan. I \nthink it is a terrific car. It is my second one, and I hope to get \nanother one down the road.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you something: There is nothing in the \nCAFE standard that makes me believe I will not be able to drive a \nminivan at any time in the future. Nothing.\n  What kind of scare tactic is this? Do you want to put the lie to \nthis, Mr. President? Here it is: ``Coming in 2003. The Ford Escape \nhybrid electric vehicle, the first high-volume, mainstream alternative \nto the traditional powertrain in nearly 100 years.'' Bill Ford, \nchairman of the Ford Motor Company.\n  Congratulations, Mr. Ford. I hope your stock goes up. I hope you will \nbe recognized as the leading CEO in the country for starting to promote \nefficient vehicles.\n  The fact is that on its own Web site, the Ford Motor Company says: \n``A vehicle''--I want to juxtapose this. I want to read a paragraph \nfrom an editorial in Automotive News. It is about the CAFE hearings in \nthe Commerce Committee, at a time when the industry refused to discuss \nany notion of improving fuel economy.\n  I point out this editorial in Automotive News:\n\n       Let's get real. It's time for automakers to deal \n     forthrightly with fuel economy issues. These are not the \n     1970s or 1980s or even the 1990s. To deny or refuse to admit \n     that there is technology that can reduce fuel consumption \n     significantly is ludicrous. The industry's credibility is at \n     stake.\n\n  Let me emphasize, this is Automotive News writing that the industry's \ncredibility is at stake. I urge my colleagues not to be intimidated by \nthese hollow threats.\n  This is what Ford Motor Company says:\n\n       A vehicle that gives you all the room and power you want, \n     but uses half the gasoline.\n\n  Half the gasoline. What kind of situation is this? I do not know how \nmany millions of dollars have been spent in the last weeks on \ntelevision advertising to farmers that you cannot farm in a compact \ncar. Well, no; whatever. Really? I mean, what a phenomenal concept. \nPeople believe that? CAFE standards do not even apply to tractors. They \ndo not even apply to heavy trucks now. And if we do our will in the \nSenate, they probably will not apply to pickup trucks. What are we \ntalking about here?\n  The chart of the Senator from Michigan is a very selective chart. It \ndoes not show all the vehicles in the mix. I will come back to that in \na minute.\n  We heard a threat about safety. We heard a reading from the National \nAcademy of Sciences about safety. That was page 28 of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. Let me read page 70 from the National Academy of \nSciences. It says as follows:\n\n       It is technically feasible and potentially economical to \n     improve fuel economy without reducing vehicle weight or size \n     and, therefore, without significantly affecting the safety of \n     motor vehicle travel.\n\n  Those workers in Detroit and elsewhere, about whom we all care, can \nbuild the cars of the future. They can build a more efficient vehicle. \nThey can build the hybrid electric SUVs with all the room and all the \npower one would want and twice the mileage if Detroit will choose to \nask them to do so.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. It is about the future for our \ncountry in national security, on environmental issues such as global \nwarming, and even it is about whether or not we intend to be \ncompetitive with the Japanese and Germans because, as I will show, the \nJapanese and Germans are building vehicles that Americans want and \nincreasingly they are growing the marketplace in the United States.\n  Let me go to that for a moment, if I may. This is a chart--I do not \nhave it blown up--but this is Toyota's North American operation. In \nfact, in the last years, we reached a peak of automotive employment in \nthe United States in 1999. We have lost a few workers in the last few \nyears, I acknowledge that, but we did it without CAFE standards. One \nreason is because the companies moved some plants to Mexico. They do \nnot tell you that.\n  Even while they are doing that, Toyota and Honda are moving plants to \nthe United States. Look at this map. We have Toyota in New York; Toyota \nin Buffalo, WV; Toyota in Georgetown, KY; Toyota in Columbus, IN; \nToyota in Princeton, IN; Toyota in Huntsville, AL; St. Louis and Troy, \nMO; Newport Beach, CA; Torrance, CA; Ann Arbor, MI; Freemont, CA; \nTorrance-Gardenia, CA; Long Beach, CA; Whitman, AZ.\n  The same pattern can be shown for other automakers. Now they are \nmaking something like 600,000 vehicles in the United States. What kind \nof vehicles are they selling in the United States, even though the Big \nThree continue to dominate the market? I understand that. But you have \nto look at trends. You have to look at the direction in which you are \nmoving.\n  In 1975--and I want to go back to this because this is an important \npart of the context of this debate. This debate is not just about this \nmoment in time. It has a history and we have to balance the choices we \nface today against the history of where we have traveled.\n  I want to show this chart, but let me go to the beginning. Motor \nvehicle miles in the personal automobile vehicle are at the lowest \nlevel in 20 years. We are going backwards in fuel efficiency.\n  My colleagues say: Oh, we are moving up in this direction; we do not \nneed to have a dictate from Congress; we are going to get there because \nthe automobile industry is going to get there without a mandate.\n  Let me show the record for the last years. From 1988 until the year \n2001, of all the new technologies that were developed by the American \nautomobile industry, 53 percent of those new technologies went into \nhorsepower; 18 percent went into acceleration; 19 percent went into \nweight; minus 8 percent went into fuel efficiency.\n  We now have cars on the road that can go 140 miles an hour, even \nthough the speed limit is 65, 70, 80 permissibly in some places. One \ncan only go so fast between stoplights in many cities.\n  Minus 8 percent on fuel efficiency. I like driving a big car, too. I \nam just like any other American. Indeed, for a number of years, all of \nus have been forced to think in the defensive way that has been \nreferred to. You see another big car on the road, you get a little \nintimidated and say: Gee, if I am going to protect my kids, I am going \nto have a big car on the road, too.\n  In fact, what has happened in the last years, according to the \nNational Academy of Sciences that the Senator from Michigan quoted is \nthat the Toyotas and the Honda Civics went from weighing about 1,800 \npounds up to 2,600\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\npounds. The Honda Civic grew in weight, and indeed some of the other \nbig SUVs grew also. It is true if a Honda Civic hits a big SUV, your \nchances of doing well in the Honda Civic are not as great. I understand \nthat.\n  The older National Academy of Sciences study, which the Senator \nrelies on when he talks about safety, did not include airbags. It did \nnot include the new standards of restraints. It also did not include \nwhat we have in our bill, which are rollover standards, because the \nbiggest single problem for Americans in terms of SUVs is rolling over \nand being crushed because we have no standard for the roof and for the \nroll capacity of the car. So the fact is these cars can be made \nefficient and safe at the same time.\n  They are trying to scare people with this safety standard. I heard \none of my colleagues say we have to do this based on science. Well, it \nis based on science. It is not arbitrary. This is not a figure picked \nout of the sky, as one of my colleagues has said. This is a figure that \nis less than many scientific analysis say we can achieve.\n  I want to make very clear to my colleagues that this is not a vote \nbetween the Kerry-Hollings 35-mile-per-gallon standard and the Levin-\nBond proposal. The reason it is not that vote is that Senator McCain, \nSenator Collins, Senator Snowe, Senator Gordon Smith, and Senator \nChafee have joined together with Senator Feinstein and others on our \nside of the aisle with a proposal that alters the current Kerry-\nHollings proposal. It is not my preference, but I understand the votes \nin the Senate, and it is what we need to do to compromise. It will \nreduce the standard in the bill today to about 32 miles per gallon if \nthe full trading program is used, which I ask my colleagues to think \nabout.\n  The current fleet average is about 25 miles per gallon. If we cannot \ngo 7 miles per gallon in 13 years, what can we do? That is the vote. \nThis is a vote whether or not we want no standard at all and you turn \nit over to NHTSA, which has a long reputation of being managed by \nadministrations and by outside interests and not being able to set the \nstandard. It is not even staffed efficiently enough today to be able to \ndo it. The NAS is in fact better staffed and has had more background \nresearch than they have done in years, because on the other side of the \naisle in 1995 Speaker Gingrich and the Republicans brought a complete \nprohibition on the ability of the EPA to even analyze what might be the \nbenefits of raising the standards.\n  That tells you a huge story. It says what you have is an ongoing \nprocess by which the industry is fighting against whichever forum might \nbe the least friendly to it. When Congress might do something, they say \ngo to NHTSA if the administration has a handle on NHTSA. When NHTSA \nmight do something, if they are in control of Congress they say go to \nCongress; Congress ought to do it.\n  In 1989 and 1990, they specifically said, we really think NHTSA is \nthe proper place to do this. Then lo and behold, the Republicans \ncontrolled the House and the Senate in 1995 and Andrew Card, then \nrepresenting the automobile manufacturers, said, oh, no, we do not \nthink NHTSA is the right place, contrary to what they had said for the \nlast few years. They said, we had better go to Congress.\n\n  What we see today is an effort to congressionally implement the same \nkind of forum shopping for the least standard possible for the least \nenvironmental effort possible.\n  I want to show a little bit more of this history. My colleagues may \nnot be familiar with the background, but let me point to some of the \ncomments of the industry in the last years as we analyze where we are \ntrying to go.\n  I also want to put in proper perspective what I said about these \nadvertisements. In the last 3 weeks, this is what the industry has said \npublicly:\n\n       Make no mistake, the Senate proposals would eliminate SUVs, \n     minivans and pickup trucks. If these proposals pass, the only \n     place you will see a light truck is in a museum.\n\n  What they said in 1975 was:\n\n       If this proposal becomes law and we do not achieve a \n     significant technological breakthrough to improve mileage, \n     the largest car the industry will be selling in any volume at \n     all will probably be smaller, lighter, and less powerful than \n     today's compact Chevy Nova, and only a small percentage of \n     all models being produced could be that size.\n\n  That was the threat in 1975. That was General Motors. Let me read \nwhat Chrysler had to say:\n\n       In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full-size sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing \n     subcompact-size cars, or even smaller ones, within 5 years, \n     even though the Nation does not have the tooling capacity or \n     capital resources to make such a change so quickly.\n\n  Did that happen? Did any of this happen?\n  Then Ford said:\n\n       Many of the temporary standards are unreasonable, \n     arbitrary--\n\n  ``Arbitrary,'' that is a word we have heard again--\n\n     and technically unfeasible. If we cannot meet them when they \n     are published, we will have to close down.\n\n  The fact is, the industry flourished. The industry met the standards, \nand more people were employed. The industry actually turned around and \nbecame competitive.\n  Our colleague, Senator Fritz Hollings, helped write these laws. He \nwas in the Senate then. I expect he will be in the Chamber to talk \nabout that experience. Senator Hollings heard these same arguments, and \nSenator Hollings said then:\n\n       I am not trying to shut you down. I am trying to save your \n     jobs.\n\n  That is in fact what happened. I say the same thing to those workers \nin Detroit about whom we care. We are trying to save jobs in America by \nmaking an industry that is so reluctant to embrace change live up to a \nstandard that will make their automobiles competitive. In fact, the \nNational Academy of Sciences says the cost of doing this is saved to \nthe consumer in the gasoline savings over the lifetime of a car. The \ngasoline savings will save the differential in cost, in addition to \nwhich we are prepared to provide a tax credit to people who buy the \nefficient cars. So we can make up the difference of cost to Detroit. We \ncan make up the difference of cost largely to the consumer if that is \nwhat we want to do. This is not a zero sum game of jobs or national \nsecurity, protecting the environment, reducing our dependence on oil, \nand being more efficient, and reducing, incidentally, extraordinary \ncosts to our citizens of the air quality that they breathe.\n  I might add, if we were to do what we are seeking to do, we would cut \nglobal warming pollution by 176 metric tons by the year 2025. There is \nno other effort in the United States of America that is as \nsignificantly capable of adding now to the Clean Air Act efforts \nalready in effect than to try to join the world in being responsible \nabout global warming. That is part of what this vote is about.\n\n  The scare tactics being used by the industry today are absolutely no \ndifferent than the scare tactics they used 25 years ago, when there was \na completely opposite outcome from what they predicted. Every \nscientific input and analysis shows you can create net jobs at no net \ncost to the consumer with no loss of safety. That is the finding of the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  I would love to see a list of what consumer group in America, what \nenvironmental group in America, supports Bond-Levin. What consumer \ngroup in this country will say safety is compromised? None. Not one. \nWhy? Because they do not support Bond-Levin.\n  I will tell you why. Let me read a statement from the two important \nautomobile safety groups in America, the Public Citizen and Center for \nAutomobile Safety, are both supporting a CAFE standard.\n  This is what they say: The auto industry is using an outdated, \ninaccurate, and hypocritical argument about safety to try to derail \nstronger corporate average fuel economy standards. Public Citizen and \nthe Center for Auto Safety have long been two of the strongest voices \ncalling for safer vehicles in the United States. We do not believe that \nstricter fuel economy standards must cost lives, and we know that a \nstrong fuel economy bill can save lives by changing the nature of \nAmerica's vehicle fleet.\n  How does it change the nature of America's vehicle fleet? Very \nsimply: It reverses this trend where all the technology goes into \nhorsepower and acceleration--for cars that already go\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\ntwice the speed limit--and puts some of it into weight and fuel \nefficiency so you actually reduce the largest weight and size. You do \nnot have to give up any capacity within a car. A minivan will stay a \nminivan. It will still take soccer moms to soccer games. It can still \nbe filled up with whatever the legal number of kids is, and dogs, and \nall of the paraphernalia of sports. But guess what. It will get to the \nsoccer game costing less money. It will get to the soccer game in a way \nthat repays the cost of the car over the lifetime and may even create \ngreater savings, and savings when our standards for rollover and safety \nare adopted.\n  This is the most bogus argument I have ever heard in my life. The \nhistory of this issue proves it is.\n  Honda, in its testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, said \nthe following: Honda concurs with the dissenting opinion expressed in \nthe National Academy of Sciences report that the data is insufficient \nto conclude any safety compromise by smaller vehicles. The level of \nuncertainty about fuel economy-related safety issues is much higher \nthan stated in the record. Significantly, existing studies do not \naddress the safety impact of using lightweight materials without \nreducing size, especially for vehicles with advanced safety \ntechnologies.\n  I might add that we specifically looked for a rollover proposal that \nwould greatly improve the safety standard.\n  The other day in the Washington Post there was an analysis by the \nWashington Post that said the threats of the industry are false. That \nis the language of the Washington Post.\n\n       Although any increase in gas mileage inevitably will come \n     at a cost--\n\n  And I have acknowledged that there is some increase in cost--\n\n     the estimates of the National Academy are $500 to $2,000 over \n     the period of time.\n\n  But the notion that the bill would rid American highways of SUVs and \npickup trucks, as some auto industry ads explicitly claim, is false.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article ``Fuel \nEconomy Turns Emotional'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2002]\n\n                 Debate on Fuel Economy Turns Emotional\n\n       With a hearty shove from Detroit, Senate opponents of a \n     bill to raise automotive fuel economy standards--part of \n     broader energy legislation now on the Senate floor--are \n     painting the measure in apocalyptic terms, sketching dire \n     consequences for the nation's armada of SUVs and minivans.\n       Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) calls the \n     proposal--by Sens. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and John McCain \n     (R-Ariz.)--an example of ``nanny government'' that would \n     deprive him of the SUV he uses to haul around his three \n     grandchildren.\n       Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) whose wife drives a Nissan \n     Pathfinder, warns that higher fuel standards will force such \n     drastic reductions in vehicle size and weight that traffic \n     fatalities will increase ``by the thousands.''\n       And Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) believes the legislation \n     should at least make an exception for pickups, which he \n     described as the ``think tank of rural America'' because \n     ``more problems have been solved on the tailgates of pickup \n     trucks after a long day's work than have been solved \n     anywhere.''\n       Such emotive language is typical of the unfolding Senate \n     debate on the legislation, which would raise average fuel \n     economy standards for the American automobile fleet from 24 \n     miles per gallon to 36 miles per gallon by 2015. As described \n     by opponents, the measure is an elitist assault on a \n     cherished national birthright that would compromise safety, \n     limit consumer choice and impose undue hardships on Americans \n     who have come to depend on big, powerful vehicles for work \n     and play, especially in rural areas.\n       As is often the case when Washington debates policy, \n     however, emotions and symbols are getting more attention than \n     substance. Although any increase in gas mileage inevitably \n     will come at a cost, the notion that the bill would rid \n     American highways of SUVs and pickup trucks--as some auto \n     industry ads explicitly claim--is false.\n       ``The fact of the matter is, you might have to use some of \n     this improved fuel efficiency to improve economy rather than \n     increasing performance, but certainly it doesn't mean that \n     you couldn't have an SUV,'' said Adrian Lund, chief operating \n     officer of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a \n     member of a blue-ribbon panel that studied the issue for the \n     National Academy of Sciences last year.\n       Paul Portney, chairman of the panel and president of the \n     think tank Resources for the Future, called the legislation \n     ``somewhat aggressive.'' But he said it was ``roughly \n     consistent with what the academy identified as being \n     technologically possible, economically affordable and \n     consistent with the desire of consumers for passenger \n     safety.''\n       He added, ``There are technologies out there that would \n     make it possible, if given enough time, like 10 to 15 years, \n     for [manufacturers] to meet these standards without \n     decreasing the size of the cars or increasing the price too \n     much.''\n       Those on the other side of the debate, of course, have also \n     been known to gloss over inconvenient data. As the \n     legislation is structured, for example, manufacturers could \n     chose to improve fuel economy not only by technology but also \n     by cutting weight, which could make vehicles less safe, Lund \n     said.\n       In similar vein, raising the Corporate Average Fuel \n     Economy, or CAFE, standard would force manufacturers to \n     divert resources into fuel efficiency at the expense of \n     performance improvements sought by consumers, such as better \n     acceleration or new dashboard gadgets like on-board computers \n     and satellite navigation systems.\n       ``There are exaggerated claims on both sides,'' Portney \n     said. ``It's certainly not the case that we can ambitiously \n     boost fuel economy and laugh all the way to the bank doing \n     it. It diverts car companies from doing things they would \n     otherwise do.''\n       But the trade-offs associated with higher fuel economy \n     standards may be less burdensome than some in the auto \n     industry, or Congress, would suggest. For example, the higher \n     purchase cost of a fuel-efficient vehicle would likely be \n     offset by lower gasoline costs over time.\n       Nor is it clear that stiffer mileage rules would compromise \n     safety. Last month, a consulting firm hired by Honda Motor \n     Co. reported that reducing the weight of cars and light \n     trucks by 100 pounds would actually improve safety, albeit by \n     a ``small and statistically insignificant'' margin. The \n     finding contradicted an earlier finding by the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration that higher mileage \n     standards--and lower vehicle weights--had added to highway \n     deaths.\n       Such nuances get short shrift in industry ad campaigns. The \n     Coalition for Vehicle Choice, which is backed by the three \n     major auto manufacturers, is running print ads in New \n     Hampshire urging voters to contact their senators on behalf \n     of ``the endangered SUV and pickup.'' The ad shows a \n     snowmobile blasting through a drift above the caption, \n     ``Without SUVs, you're looking at one expensive piece of \n     garage furniture.''\n       ``Imaging climbing an icy mountain, towing your snowmobile, \n     but instead of driving a pickup or an SUV, you're driving a \n     compact car,'' the ad says. ``That's what you could be forced \n     to do, if some U.S. senators get their way.''\n       A similar ad--paid for by groups such as the U.S. Chamber \n     of Commerce and the National Automobile Dealers Association--\n     shows a forlorn looking man next to an SUV, a canoe strapped \n     to the roof and two small girls sitting on the hood. ``We \n     work hard all year so our family can go fishing and camping \n     together,'' the ads says. ``We couldn't do it without our \n     SUV.''\n       Many of those arguments were repeated almost verbatim last \n     week on the Senate floor. Lott said the CAFE measure would \n     rob him of quality time with his grandchildren because he \n     likes ``them to be able to ride in the same vehicle with \n     me.''\n       As it happens, Lott is already doing his part for \n     conservation. He drives Honda CRV, one of the smallest and \n     most fuel-efficient SUVs on the market.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in 1972, 1973, and 1990, each time the auto \nindustry has said: We cannot do this.\n  They said it about seatbelts. They said it about laminated \nwindshields. They have said it about every single requirement, each \ntime Congress has agreed we ought to try to do these things. This is \nnot arbitrary. Congress has made decisions about safety, fuel \nefficiency.\n  We invited Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat to testify before our \ncommittee. In 1975, Mr. Eizenstat was the domestic policy adviser to \nPresident Carter. He was part of the team that developed the first CAFE \nstandards. His testimony speaks very directly to this issue. I will \nquote from his testimony. He said: In spite of the obvious merits of \nthe standards, the American automobile manufacturers were opposed to \nthe regulations. I remember their opposition well. In my role as \ndomestic policy adviser to President Carter, I was part of the team \nthat developed the first CAFE standards. Those standards set the fuel \neconomy levels for the period 1977 to 1985, starting at 18 miles per \ngallon in 1977 and rising to 27.5 in 1985.\n  He said: I specifically remember a meeting in the Cabinet office with \nPresident Carter and the heads of the Big Three automobile \nmanufacturers: Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, in which all three \nstrongly opposed the imposition of fuel economy standards. They claimed \ntheir companies lacked the technology to reach the standard that the \nadministration had in mind.\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\n  Does that sound familiar? Yet once the CAFE standards were \nimplemented, all three companies met and exceeded the standards.\n  I can imagine the pressure you are under from those same companies \nand others as you consider raising the standards. But as you embark on \nthis process, I strongly urge you to recall our experiences in \ndeveloping the first set of CAFE standards. You should feel confident \nthat the automobile manufacturers do have the ability to achieve and, \nin fact, surpass whatever standards you set.\n  I believe Ambassador Eizenstat has proven himself to be an enormously \ncapable negotiator, and very studious, and I think most people would \nagree one of the most thoughtful contributors to positive dialog in the \npolitical process in this country. He said we should do this; we can do \nthis. He testified before the committee, as, I might add, did countless \nother entities in this country that were affected one way or the other \nby the potential of this change.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true, in the view of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, that various claims have been made over the past several \nyears, particularly back in the 1970s, the last time CAFE standards \nwere increased, in fact, these comments were tantamount to the end of \nWestern civilization as we know it? Is there a strange similarity \nbetween those comments made in the 1970s and those made today? Has the \nSenator noticed that?\n  Let me give an example, Daimler-Benz senior vice president, from the \nNew York Times: We are facing a radical and unrealistic proposal. The \nproponents are being dishonest. You cannot get 35 miles per gallon and \nstill have sport utility vehicles and minivans.\n  Bill Burke, the No. 3 man at Ford, in June 1976: In a year to 18 \nmonths, I see a rising demand at the small end. It will be pretty hard \nfor any but pint-size cars to get that kind of mileage.\n  Mr. Morrison, GM spokesman, said it would be virtually impossible to \nmeet standards resembling that. We will have to tear our product line \nup.\n  In 1974, a Ford representative said before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, on which Senator Kerry and I serve, that CAFE will require \nthe Ford product to consist of either all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles or \nsome types of vehicles ranging from a subcompact to perhaps a Maverick.\n  The spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said that \nif these proposals pass, the only place you will see a light truck is \nin a museum.\n  Is there a haunting similarity between those comments made back in \nthe 1970s and today that the Senator from Massachusetts may have \ndetected at the same time the Ford Motor Company advertises a 40-mile-\nper-gallon SUV by the year 2003? Does the Senator find a certain irony \nin these historical perspectives on this issue?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona that each and every one of those comments is just a mirror \nimage of the comments being made by the industry today.\n  As I mentioned before the Senator came to the floor, I read an \neditorial which came from one of the automotive magazines that \nspecifically said the industry's credibility is on the line and that \nthey have to get serious.\n  I met with some of the industry's representatives. I talked to Mr. \nFord on the telephone for a few minutes. I said I thought it would be \ngood if we tried to get together and do something thoughtfully.\n  I asked the industry this question: Is it possible for you to agree \nthat you could get 1 mile per gallon over the next 30 years? They \nabsolutely refused to acknowledge they could get 1 mile per gallon. \nWhy? Because they simply want this issue to go over to NHTSA where they \nbelieve they have the ability to have more impact and control the \noutcome.\n  The Senator's question is right on point. These are the exact same \nscare tactics.\n  The Senator from Missouri came down here and suggested that people \nand soccer moms will have to drive in a long line of golf carts because \nthey could not drive their minivans. With all due respect to the \nSenator from Missouri, that is one of the most ridiculous things I have \never heard in my life. The fact is, Ford Motor Company has an ad \nshowing the SUV with all the room and all the power. A soccer mom could \nget in it and get 40 miles to the gallon, and a minivan can drive with \nthe same engine, or even a better one.\n  In Europe today, they are making diesel engines that get 40 or 50 \nmiles to the gallon. Shame on the United States. Our automobiles aren't \nable to give our drivers that kind of gas savings and performance. Why \nnot? We are anxious to try to get our cars that kind of mileage. I want \na UAW worker producing that car ahead of some worker in Germany or in \nJapan. I want our automobile industry to be the industry that is \nselling those vehicles. The workers in Detroit ought to be rising up \nnot about CAFE standards; they ought to be knocking on the doors of the \nexecutives and saying: Why aren't we building better cars, bigger cars, \nand cars with more improved fuel efficiency? You could build a bigger \ncar--even bigger than the ones we have today.\n  Incidentally, some Suburbans, one of the biggest vehicles of all, \ndoesn't come under the CAFE standards right now. You can buy all the \nSuburbans you want. You can buy a heavy duty truck that is under the \nexemptions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  One of the aspects of this issue that has to some degree been ignored \nin our desire for comfort and convenience for the American people is \nthe issue of health aspects. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts \nis familiar with the problem that we have in my home State of Arizona, \nparticularly in the valley where 3 million people reside in the sixth \nlargest city in America. The Arizona Republic, a few days ago on March \n9, had an editorial entitled ``Legislature Must Attack Brown Clouds.'' \nIt said:\n\n       We've always known the Valley's Brown Cloud is ugly and \n     unhealthy. Now we know it can be deadly.\n       A new study indicates that years of breathing that haze of \n     particulate pollution will significantly raise a person's \n     risk of dying of lung cancer and heart attack.\n       For lung cancer,the risk is the same as living with a \n     cigarette smoker, according to a report published this week \n     in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The \n     study, funded by the National Institute of Environmental \n     Health Sciences, is compelling because of its breadth: \n     Researchers followed half a million people across the country \n     over two decades.\n       While the Valley has made strides in reducing carbon \n     monoxide and ozone pollution, we've had trouble getting a \n     handle on pollution from airborne particles.\n       No, it's not just desert dust. The most dangerous particles \n     are much smaller, 2.5 microns or less, so tiny that it takes \n     at least 28 to equal the diameter of a human hair. These \n     ultra-small particles, which wreak havoc by penetrating deep \n     into the lungs, come from combustion.\n       In the East and Midwest, the biggest culprits for such \n     particulate pollution are coal-burning power plants. So it's \n     worrisome that the Bush administration is considering changes \n     in the rules for power plant expansion that could bring \n     increased emissions.\n       Here in the Valley, as elsewhere in the West, a big part of \n     our particulate pollution spews out of tailpipes.\n\n  I am not sure. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts thinks it \nis fair for us to address this issue of emission standards without \ndiscussing at length the abundance of information concerning health \nrisks to the American people. I have a chart here on sources of carbon \nmonoxide. In Phoenix, AZ, on the road, Mobile, it is 64 percent.\n  There is another article that I have here of February 1, 2002:\n\n       Study Links Smog To Rise in Asthma Cases of Children Who \n     Play Outside.\n\n  Guess what States, according to this study, generally speaking, have \nthe highest chronic pollution level in the United States. They are \nArizona, California, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\n  I wonder if the Senators from Michigan and Missouri are concerned \nabout the fact they are on the top 10 list of pollution problems which \ncause health problems and difficulties to their citizens.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts agrees that there are \ncompelling health issues here that have to be addressed as a result of \nthe fact that we failed to enact simple, fairly easy changes in our \nemission standards\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\nwhich would, perhaps, in the case of one study, save between 650 and \n1,000 lives just in Phoenix, AZ, alone.\n  I am curious if the Senator from Massachusetts believes that perhaps \nwe might be neglecting an important factor in the pollution of places \nsuch as my home State of Arizona where people were once sent because \nthey had respiratory problems. Now we have pollution problems that are \ncausing risks to people's health. A lot of that pollution is directly \nrelated to that, as the Arizona Republic says, ``spewing out of \ntailpipes.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the question very much. I was \nnot aware actually of the particular study to which the Senator has \nreferred. But I appreciate it enormously because he is absolutely \ncorrect that the health issue is one of the most important issues.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to the fact that the existing CAFE \nstandards--the ones we passed in 1975--cut gasoline use. By cutting \nthat gasoline use, incidentally, we cut almost the amount we were then \nimporting from parts of the gulf. But we reduced the amount of \nhydrocarbon emissions, which is a key source of smog, and which is a \nkey source of particulates, as the Senator from Arizona has just \ndescribed, which particularly affects seniors and children. It affects \nall adults, but particularly we have seen an increase in the rise of \nasthma among children in the United States because of the quality of \nair that is being breathed.\n  Higher gas mileage cars and trucks played a key role in virtually \neliminating smog in Denver, which during the 1980s, as everybody knows, \nhad a dangerous level of pollution. Los Angeles also gained enormously. \nAnd there is a huge gain in public health for the elderly and all \nasthma sufferers in the country.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona. He is absolutely correct.\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he will \nyield for another question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts would support \na proposal that would force any American family to give up a sport \nutility vehicle. I would wonder--in fact, I am the proud owner of sport \nutility vehicles. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts would not \njoin all of us in seeking Ford Motor Company to live up to their \nadvertising in developing a 40-mile-per-gallon sport utility vehicle, \nwhich I would be one of the first to buy.\n  Wouldn't we reduce some of this rhetoric that has been going on since \nthe 1970s on the part of the automobile manufacturers? And if my memory \nserves me correctly, every single step of the way--from CAFE standards, \nto airbags, to seatbelts--the automobile manufacturers have said they \nwere unable to comply, at least initially, whether it be in safety or \nwhether it be in CAFE standards or any other improvement.\n  So would the Senator agree with me that if there were any prospect of \nreducing the options of the American people, if there were any prospect \nthat we were doing anything other than encouraging what is mostly \nexisting technology to be implemented by the automobile manufacturers \nof America, we would not be proposing this legislation?\n  The fact is that for every single improvement the automobile industry \nhas made in America, they have been dragged, kicking and screaming, \nevery step of the way. And we have just been over some of those quotes \nover a period of many years.\n  So I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts would respond, again, \nto the really almost irresponsible charges that have been made, \nparticularly by the manufacturers, about the catastrophic events that \nmight take place, when the fact is, we support strongly the ability of \nAmericans to have a wide choice in their use of conveyance, \nparticularly those of us in the West who travel long distances with our \nfamilies.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I really welcome that question. I \nappreciate it from the Senator.\n  Let me personalize it a little bit.\n  I drove a Lincoln Navigator until a couple years ago. I got rid of it \nbecause of its inefficiency in fuel. I am sorry to say that. I said to \nthe dealer: You really ought to urge the Ford Motor Company to produce \na car that is more efficient.\n  I am proud to say Ford Motor Company is now evidently doing exactly \nthat. I would love to drive one that had the efficiency. My wife drives \nan SUV. My stepson has an SUV. My daughter is currently driving an SUV.\n  I have no question but that if we pass a CAFE standard, each and \nevery one of them will continue to be able to drive an SUV. We can all \nbuy an SUV in America that is more efficient, that saves, over the life \nof the car, the cost of the difference of the technology.\n  Let me share with the Senator from Arizona that Honda has introduced \nits Insight. It is a two-seater. It gets about 60 miles per gallon on \nthe highway. It is about to introduce a hybrid Civic, a two-door and a \nfour-door, in 2002. Toyota sells the hybrid Prius. It is a four-door. \nIt gets 48 miles per gallon combined in the United States. There is a \nminivan in Japan that gets nearly 40 miles per gallon. Within a few \nyears, they are going to sell about 300,000 hybrids globally. They have \nannounced that they are going to be profitable in this field.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan or some Senator is going to point \nout that the Ford Motor Company is going to produce at a loss this \nparticular SUV shown in this picture I have in the Chamber. That is \ntrue for now because they have just started it. They do not have the \nmarket penetration yet. They have not fully developed the marketing, \nand they have not gained the market share.\n  So, indeed, it is similar to the Pentagon. When the Pentagon buys \nonly X number of hammers, as we remember, or toilets, they cost tens of \nthousands of dollars. But if they are mass produced, then you begin to \nbring the cost down, and particularly if you market effectively.\n  I think the first CEO in this country who sells to Wall Street the \nnotion that they are going to be profitable selling the cars of the \nfuture is going to drive up the stock of that motor company. And they \nought to be thinking about how to grab the market share in the most \ncompetitive way that is most effective in the long term.\n  That is what this can do. That is why Ford Motor Company is already \nadvertising the vehicle that ``gives you all the room and power you \nwant''--all the room and power you want--``but uses half the \ngasoline.'' That is on their Web site today. They are bringing it out \nnext year.\n  I am confident, with appropriate marketing, just as the Prius, just \nas Honda and Toyota, they can begin to get profitable very rapidly. But \nhere is the rub: They did not do it back in 1975, until Congress said: \nThis is our national priority. And they are not going to do it now \nuntil Congress sets a goal and begins to push the process forward. What \nwe are reaching for as a goal is not an arbitrary goal.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona, without losing my right to the floor, \nif I may, is it not true that we held a series of hearings in the \nCommerce Committee, with the best scientific experts from across the \ncountry, who came and testified before us regarding the ability to do \nthis without losing jobs?\n  Mr. McCAIN. To respond to my friend from Massachusetts, indeed they \ndid. I also believe that since the Senator from Massachusetts and I can \ncount votes pretty well, the opponents of what we are trying to do--\nlet's face it, the Levin-Bond amendment basically does nothing to \nimprove fuel efficiency, and that is a fact.\n  Sooner or later, we will see more and more pictures such as we have \nseen here in this editorial, which says: ``Valley's Brown Cloud nearly \nobscures downtown Phoenix from atop South Mountain.'' You will see that \nin Albuquerque. We already see it in Detroit. We see it in Boston. We \nsee more and more studies of the health risks that air pollution causes \nto young and old Americans.\n  I believe that sooner or later our constituents will demand that we \nrise up and repudiate and rebuke the automobile manufacturers of \nAmerica, that refuse to be concerned about the health of Americans, \nmuch less the problems with our dependency on foreign oil.\n  And, yes, every objective observer, every environmental group in \nAmerica,\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\nbelieves we need to do a lot more than anything that is embodied in the \nLevin-Bond amendment.\n  I thank my colleague for his question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me share with all of my colleagues--and \nI particularly call the attention of the Senator from Arizona to this--\nan article from the Wall Street Journal dated March 7. I ask unanimous \nconsent the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 7, 2002]\n\n   Ford Aims To Sell a Gas-Electric SUV That Will Offer Sizable Fuel \n                               Efficiency\n\n                         (By Norihiko Shirouzu)\n\n       Detroit.--As the Senate gears up to debate the fuel economy \n     of sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks, a senior Ford \n     Motor Co. executive said the No. 2 auto maker aims to sell \n     ``tens of thousands'' of a small, superfuel-efficient Escape \n     SUV powered by a gasoline-electric ``hybrid'' propulsion \n     system.\n       Prabhakar Patil, head of Ford's program that aims to launch \n     the Escape hybrid by the end of 2003, said at an auto-\n     industry conference here yesterday that the hybrid Escape \n     isn't intended as a niche vehicle. Ford sees a good chance \n     for the vehicle to become a ``mass-market vehicle,'' he said.\n       Mr. Patil said that if it was priced today, the Escape \n     hybrid would likely have as much as a 25% price premium over \n     the conventional gasoline-powered Escape, which he said would \n     put the SUV's price tag somewhere around $25,000. The vehicle \n     is expected to deliver nearly 40 miles per gallon of gas in \n     city driving.\n       Ford's bullish comments about the potential of hybrid \n     vehicles comes amid intensified jockeying in Washington over \n     whether to significantly toughen federal auto-mileage rules.\n       The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which \n     administers the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, \n     proposed extending for another four years a controversial \n     provision in the rule that lets auto makers get extra credit \n     for building so-called dual-fuel vehicles. Those vehicles can \n     run either on gasoline or on so-called E85, a blend of 85% \n     ethanol and 15% gasoline. NHTSA conceded that the ``vast \n     majority of dual-fuel vehicles rarely operate on alternative \n     fuel''--a fact that has led critics to dub the dual-fuel \n     provision a big loophole in the CAFE rule because it gives \n     auto makers leeway to build more gasoline-thirsty trucks. \n     NHTSA Administrator Jeffrey Runge said that having vehicles \n     that are able to run on E85 ``contributes to domestic energy \n     security'' and ``provides consumers an alternative'' in the \n     event of a gasoline shortage.'' NHTSA proposed extending the \n     dual-fuel credit, which was set to expire with the 2004 auto-\n     model year, to the 2008 model year.\n       Meanwhile, in the Senate, two Democrats, Sen. John Kerry of \n     Massachusetts and Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, are \n     nearing an agreement with several Republicans including Sen. \n     John McCain of Arizona on a bipartisan proposal to require \n     cars and light trucks together to average 36 mpg by 2015, \n     according to Senate staffers familiar with the discussion. \n     Today, cars and trucks average about 24 mpg, the lowest level \n     in two decades. Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) and Sen. Kit \n     Bond) (R., Mo.) were finalizing an alterate proposal that \n     would send the CAFE question to the Bush administration's \n     NHTSA.\n       The auto industry has been pushing for such a move.\n       Mr. Patil noted that whether Ford can turn a profit with \n     the hybrid Escape, with its costly gas-electric propulsion \n     system, hinges largely on whether the government offers tax \n     incentives on such vehicles. Late last month, President Bush \n     said he wants more tax incentives for hybrid and fuel-cell \n     (of hydrogen-driven) vehicles. Those incentives are provided \n     in the bill the Senate will consider.\n       Another Ford executive, John Wallace, said in an interview \n     that a $3,000 tax incentive for the purchase of a gas-\n     electric hybrid should ``solve the problem'' and help make \n     the Escape hybrid profitable immediately. ``We welcome tax \n     incentives to get there quickly,'' Mr. Patil said, referring \n     to being profitable with the Escape hybrid.\n       Mr. Patil said Ford is already ``looking to expand hybrid \n     offerings'' beyond the Escape hybrid. Hybrids are ``the first \n     credible alternative to gasoline engines,'' he said. Other \n     auto makers are also pushing plans to expand the use of \n     hybrid-drive technology. Masatami Takimoto, a senior Japan-\n     based executive for Toyota Motor Corp., said at the Society \n     of Automotive Engineers conference that Toyota hopes to sell \n     300,000 hybrids a year around the world within the next five \n     years. Toyota's second hybrid for the U.S. market will \n     probably be an SUV. Given the popularity of SUVs in North \n     America, ``I believe it's a good idea'' to make a second \n     hybrid product a SUV in the market here, he said. Toyota \n     currently sells a small hybrid sedan called the Prius. The \n     auto maker sold 15,500 Prius models in the U.S. in 2001. The \n     only other hybrid currently sold in the U.S. in Honda Motor \n     Co.'s two-seater subcompact called the Insight. Honda's \n     second hybrid, a Civic, will arrive in showrooms starting in \n     April.\n       There are no tax incentives currently on either the Prius \n     or the Insight, and neither model line is profitable in \n     dollar terms.\n       Mr. Takimoto, who oversees powertrain development in Japan \n     for Toyota, said there is a ``tough battle'' looming between \n     advanced diesel engines and gas-electric hybrid propulsion \n     systems. He believes hybrids are ``proceeding a step ahead'' \n     of diesels and gasoline-powered engines.\n       A recent J.D. Power & Associates survey of some 5,200 \n     recent new-vehicle buyers found ``a greater willingness to \n     pay for hybrid vehicles than previous believed,'' according \n     to the consulting firm. It said hybrids are ``getting a solid \n     green light'' from consumers. The survey said 30% of the \n     respondents indicated they would ``definitely'' consider a \n     gas-electric hybrid vehicle. J.D. Power said the survey's \n     margin of error was plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in this Wall Street Journal article, the \nheadline which reads: ``Ford Aims to Sell a Gas-Electric SUV That Will \nOffer Sizable Fuel Efficiency,'' the question was asked of somebody at \nFord whether they could turn a profit with the hybrid Escape--that is \nthis vehicle shown in the picture I have in the Chamber; it is called \nthe Escape--since it has a more costly system.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan is going to say, well, this costs \nmore, and it will not turn a profit. Let me just answer that question \ndefinitively right now.\n  Quoting the article:\n\n       [A] Ford executive, John Wallace, said in an interview that \n     a $3,000 tax incentive for the purchase of a gas-electric \n     hybrid should ``solve the problem'' and help make the Escape \n     hybrid profitable immediately. ``We welcome tax incentives to \n     get there quickly,'' . . . referring to being profitable with \n     the Escape hybrid.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a tax incentive from the Finance Committee. \nThis car can be profitable immediately, according to the Ford Motor \nCompany itself.\n  I think we really need to start debating reality. The Senator from \nMichigan has a chart there. The chart shows a number of vehicles. I \nhave a copy of the chart right here. This is a small one of theirs. \nThis chart has large SUV, midsize SUV, small SUV, large pickup, small \npickup, minivan. It doesn't show all the rest of the automobile fleet. \nIt just shows the big cars. But even those vehicles may not be fairly \nrepresented here.\n  By not including cars, the chart excludes entire classes of vehicles, \nand they exclude vehicles within classes. So you don't get an entire \nfair comparison. Let me give an example. At the subcompact class--this \nis not included here--the Honda Civic is significantly more efficient \nat 38 miles per gallon than the General Motors Metro which is at 32 \nmiles per gallon, or the GM Saturn at 30 miles per gallon, or the Ford \nEscort at 28 miles per gallon. You get a distortion of how the fleet \nworks today.\n  Secondly, the Big Three, sent the Committee charts similar to this \none, and they entirely excluded compact cars in their analysis. In this \nclass of vehicles, there are four Toyota and Honda cars: the Prius, \nEcho, Civic, and Corolla. They are, on average, significantly more \nefficient than the closest General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler cars. \nToyota sells the Prius at 48 miles per gallon, the Echo at 36 miles per \ngallon, the Corolla at 33 miles per gallon. Honda sells the Civic at 34 \nmiles per gallon. The closest General Motors car is the Prism at 32 \nmiles per gallon. The closest Ford is the Escort at 29. And the closest \nDaimlerChrysler is the Neon at 27.\n  None of this is represented in the charts. The Senator from Michigan \nsays it doesn't make sense to have this system where you have a whole \nfleet, let's divide it up into these sectors. Let's make an attribute \nsystem if that's what is needed. I looked at that because both \ntechnology and market mix matter. I am willing to do that, because the \nSenator is not entirely wrong. Right now, here in the Chamber, let's go \nto a back room, divide it up into those sectors, give NHTSA the \nauthority to divide up the classes, but let's agree to divide it up \nwith a goal that we are going to reach by a certain point in time. If \nwe did that, we could all have agreement.\n  But they won't agree to a goal. There is no goal in the Bond-Levin \namendment, no goal whatsoever. They want to set up some criteria which \ncan be the subject of lawsuits for years to come, turn it over to \nNHTSA. And if NHTSA comes up with a 1-mile-per-gallon differential, \nthere is no expedited\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\nprocedure, no ability for Congress. All they have to do is come up with \nsomething.\n  It is the artful dodge. It is the great escape--not to do any \ndisservice to the name of Ford's car. It is simply inappropriate to \nsuggest that this does anything. The attributed system the Senator from \nMichigan talks about is not even in his own bill. There is no \nrequirement that they set up an attributed system.\n  Why is that true? Because the industry doesn't want it. The industry \nlikes the system they have today. And they testified before our \ncommittee that they want to keep the system they have today because the \nsystem they have today gives them flexibility. It gives them the \nability to choose and to decide what fleet of cars they are going to \nmake. If you had an attributed system, then you would be locked in to \nwhat you have to achieve in a particular class and you can't balance \nother sectors of your fleet against components of that class.\n  That is why the industry does not want it. It makes for great \nsubterfuge here in the Senate Chamber.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do you know there is going to be a response from the \nproponents of the legislation which has already provided some very \ninteresting rhetoric?\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he is aware of \nan article in the Washington Post on Sunday, March 10, entitled \n``Debate On Fuel Economy Turns Emotional.'' It starts out by saying:\n\n       With a hardy shove from Detroit, Senate opponents of a bill \n     to raise automotive fuel economy standards--part of broader \n     energy legislation now on the Senate floor--are painting the \n     measure in apocalyptic terms, sketching dire consequences for \n     the Nation's armada of SUVs and minivans.\n\n  It goes on to quote some of our colleagues, quotes such as ``nanny \ngovernment''; higher fuel standards will force such drastic reductions \nin vehicle size and weight that traffic fatalities will increase ``by \nthe thousands.'' Then the article goes on to say--I wonder if the \nSenator has seen it--\n\n       As is often the case when Washington debates policy, \n     however, emotions and symbols are getting more attention than \n     substance. Although any increase in gas mileage inevitably \n     will come at a cost, the notion that the bill would rid \n     American highways of SUVs and pickup trucks--as some auto \n     industry ads explicitly claim--is false.\n       ``The fact of the matter is, you might have to use some of \n     this improved fuel efficiency to improve economy rather than \n     increasing performance, but certainly it doesn't mean that \n     you couldn't have an SUV,'' Adrian Lund, chief operating \n     officer of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a \n     member of a blue-ribbon panel that studied the issue for the \n     National Academy of Sciences last year.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator realizes how important that statement is from \na chief operating officer of the Insurance Institute for Highway \nSafety, a member of a blue-ribbon panel that studied the issue for the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       Paul Portney, chairman of the panel and president of think \n     tank Resources for the Future, called the legislation \n     ``somewhat aggressive.'' But he said it was ``roughly \n     consistent with what the academy identified as being \n     technologically possible, economically affordable and \n     consistent with the desire of consumers for passenger \n     safety.''\n       He added, ``There are technologies out there that would \n     make it possible, if given enough time, like 10 to 15 years, \n     for [manufacturers] to meet these standards without \n     decreasing the size of the cars or increasing the price too \n     much.''\n\n  All of us are entitled to our opinion. Everybody is entitled to the \nrhetoric. That is one of the entertaining things about the floor of the \nSenate. But when you call in the experts, usually their opinions have \nsome significant weight.\n  Those on the other side of the debate, of course, have also been \nknown to gloss over inconvenient data. As the legislation is \nstructured, for example, manufacturers could choose to improve fuel \neconomy not only by technology but also by cutting weight.\n  I hope when Senators decide on this issue, they will listen to the \nresults of scientific studies, listen to the experts who have been \ninvolved years and years, as opposed to the rhetoric we see coming out \nof Detroit, MI, from an organization whose credibility over the years \nhas been sadly strained.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts is aware of these \nindividuals and these findings by a blue-ribbon panel that studied the \nissue for the National Academy of Sciences as short a time ago as last \nyear.\n  I thank my colleague for responding.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Arizona again. This article is a \nvery important article. He was not here at the time, but I asked \nunanimous consent, and it is part of the record now in this debate.\n  What is very significant is that you have neutral people--and the \nNational Academy of Sciences does not try to get into the politics; it \nis science, and we ought to respect that--who have said point blank \nthat the claims of the automobile industry are false. Americans deserve \nsomething better than having some of the major corporations in America \nlie to them about choices we face in this country. That is what they \nhave been doing.\n  To hear a Senator come to the floor of the Senate and suggest soccer \nmoms are going to have to get into golf carts and drive down the road \nin a string of golf carts just defies imagination. It is incredible.\n  Let me point out to the Senator from Arizona--because I only showed \npart of the distortion of these charts--the Big Three presented a car \nassessment to the committee. But, again, they used highly selected \nvehicles when they did it. They excluded some cars in order to provide \na skewed picture. The Big Three car assessment showed the fuel economy \nof five different 6-cylinder cars--the Ford Taurus, DaimlerChrysler \nConcorde, Chevrolet Impala, Honda Accord, and the Toyota Camry. The \nchart showed that the five cars have similar fuel economy.\n  In the cars, they failed to show that the Honda Accord and Toyota \nCamry come with a standard 4-cylinder engine. The 6-cylinder engine is \nan option. The reason is, the technology they have developed allows the \nAccord and Camry 4-cylinder engines to offer greater performance and \nfuel economy--so much so that they can compete with the 6-cylinder Ford \nTaurus, Chrysler Concorde, and Chevrolet Impala. This is demonstrated \nby the fact that 70 percent of all the Accords sold are 4 cylinder. So \nthey send you the 6-cylinder comparison, but they don't show the car in \nthe same class. They have a smaller engine and more effective \ntechnology. Earlier, I showed the technology differentials.\n  In the technology, Honda and Toyota have used 4-valve cylinder \ntechnology. I might add, there are a series of technologies available \nnow. This is very important for our colleagues to focus on. The \ntechnology exists today, according to the National Academy of Sciences. \nThe National Academy of Sciences doesn't even take into account hybrid \nvehicles. It doesn't even take into account diesel injection. It \ndoesn't even take into account fuel cells, which may come on line \nwithin the next 13 years, particularly if we pass the components of our \nlegislation to accelerate that.\n  So if you include hybrid and diesel injection, 35 miles per gallon is \na achievable, and more could be done. Ford is telling you that by \nadvertising a car that can get 40 miles per gallon. There it is. It \nshould be the end of the debate. Ford Motor Company should be ending \nthe debate right now because they are telling us we can have a car next \nyear that gets 40 miles per gallon, and the Ford Motor Company has told \nus it can be profitable right away with a tax credit.\n  So this is really crunch time for the Senate, I guess; this is basic \nchoice. Are we going to support the concept that the Senate has a \nnational security interest in saving the barrels of oil and reducing \ndependency on oil, especially our imports from the Persian Gulf by \nincreasing CAFE standards over the next 15, 20 years? Do we want to \nvote that we ought to have cleaner air to reduce pollution, reduce \nglobal warming, reduce lung cancer, to improve the health of asthmatics \nand of our seniors? Do we want to vote that we can have a car that is \ncompetitive with Japan and Germany and allows our workers in Detroit, \nand elsewhere in this country, to continue to be employed in this \nNation in a competitive industry that is moving into the future and \noffering America the cars of the future?\n  That is what this vote is about. It is a straightforward vote about \nthe future\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nof our country in many different regards. I hope our colleagues will \nsimply not be intimidated by this onslaught of money that is buying \nadvertising time to scare Americans based wholly on some fanciful and \ntotally distorted argument that has no basis in science and, most \nimportantly for our debate, in truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on \nbehalf of the position that the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Arizona have articulated and in opposition to this \namendment Senator Levin and Senator Bond have proposed.\n  I want to start by asking the real basic question, which may be \nobvious to a lot of folks, but it seems basic to me, that is, why are \nwe even dealing with the issue of vehicle fuel efficiency as part of an \nenergy bill? Some people might say energy involves drilling wells, not \nvehicle fuel efficiency. But it seems to me there is an answer to that.\n  Let me get one of these charts up and I can make the point I am \ntrying to make. This first chart, which I showed earlier in the debate \non the energy bill, tries to talk about U.S. oil consumption, because \nwe give a lot of speeches on the Senate floor about how we want to \nreduce our dependency on foreign oil, we want to be more efficient in \nour use of foreign oil, we want to consume less.\n  Well, this is consumption. Millions of barrels of oil are consumed \nper day in this country. You can see the top line is for total oil \ndemand. The total oil demand has been going up. The line that comes \ndown on the right-hand side of the chart is for the years 2001 and \n2002. You can see that the projection for the remainder of the time \ncovered by this chart--up to 2020, the next 18 years--for the remainder \nof that time oil consumption in the United States is expected to \nincrease very substantially.\n  You may ask, why is it increasing so much? It is obviously increasing \nbecause of the transportation demand. When we talk about the \ntransportation demand, we are talking about gasoline. The oil comes in, \nwe refine it, turn it into gasoline, put it in our cars, our SUVs, and \nin our trucks, and that is what is driving total oil demand up and up \nand up. People say, well, why in the world are we importing more than \nhalf of the oil that we are consuming?\n  The truth is, domestic production of oil peaked in 1970. It has been \ngoing down ever since. Whether we open ANWR or not, it will continue, \nover the long term, to go down because we have 3 percent of the world's \nreserves of oil. So we need to also look--in addition to production--at \nconsumption. That is what this chart tries to do. That is why we are \ndealing with vehicle fuel efficiency. We are trying to flatten out that \ntop line, total oil demand, so it doesn't increase dramatically, and we \nare trying to flatten out the transportation demand so it doesn't \nincrease so dramatically, and that will flatten out the top line.\n  There is another chart I want to show to explain why we are trying to \ndeal with fuel efficiency as part of this bill. Let me put that up. \nThis is a chart that came out of the National Academy of Sciences \nstudy, which has been referred to so many times by Senators Levin, \nBond, McCain, and Kerry. It shows what has happened to passenger and \nlight truck fuel economy between the years 1965 and 2000. You can see \nthat between 1965 and about 1975 nothing happened. The miles per gallon \nof new passenger and light truck vehicles coming onto the market was \njust flat. That is the red line and the green line over at the left. \nThey are flat. Then you see a dramatic increase between about 1976 and \n1985 or 1986. You see a dramatic increase for the top line, new cars, \nand the next line down is new light trucks. So you can see that all of \nthose have gone up substantially during that time period.\n  The real issue, and the important thing about this chart, is what \nhappens from about 1989 until the present. The reality is that we have \nstagnated. There has been no improvement in this country in corporate \naverage fuel economy for vehicle fuel efficiency since 1989. In fact, \nfor the entire fleet, it has declined. We are actually less efficient \nin our use of gasoline today than we were in 1989.\n  That is why it is important as part of a comprehensive energy bill \nthat we try, once again, to address corporate average fuel efficiency; \nthat we, once again, try to put in law some requirement.\n  What is at stake in this amendment that Senator Levin and Senator \nBond have brought to the floor? The underlying bill, the bill before \nus, sets a figure. It tries to say: Let's become more efficient, and \nhere is the goal, here is the target, here is what we need to try to \ndo.\n  Very simply, what we have in the Levin-Bond amendment is an \nelimination of that goal, an elimination of that target. It sets up a \nprocedure which kicks the issue back to the administration.\n  The administration has been very outspoken about the fact that they \noppose the provision in our bill. The President has opposed it; the \nadministration has opposed it; the Secretary of Energy opposed it. They \ndo not think we should be mandating anything in law in the way of \nimproved efficiency in cars, trucks, and SUVs.\n  This amendment would kick it back to the administration, to NHTSA, as \nit is always referred to--the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration--and have them study this issue and come up with a set \nof regulations.\n  Quite frankly, when my colleague, my good friend from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, urged at the beginning of this debate this afternoon \nthat I read his amendment--that is always a dangerous thing to do in \nthe Senate; very few of us read the amendments on which we vote, but I \ndid. I read the amendment.\n  It has some of the most unusual provisions I have encountered in the \nSenate. It has what are called expedited procedures. It says, first, if \nthis amendment is adopted, that the Secretary of Transportation would \nhave 6 months to issue proposed CAFE regulations on passenger \nautomobiles. Then he would have 2 years for final regulations to be \nissued. He would have 15 months to issue final CAFE regulations on \nnonpassenger automobiles.\n  If the Secretary goes ahead and issues something in the way of \nregulations, then that is the end of it. It is pretty clear in the \namendment. Those become the law.\n  If, on the other hand, he fails to meet those deadlines in 2 years \nfrom now--2 years from the effective date of the act, so perhaps if we \nactually pass an energy bill, that might be 2 years from this summer or \n2 years from this fall--if the Secretary fails to meet those deadlines, \nthe Congress can pass a bill under expedited procedures to override \nwhat the administration has determined.\n  The expedited procedures dramatically limit what we are able to do. \nBasically, they tell us what the title of the bill is going to be, for \nany bill to override the regulations; they tell us precisely that we \nare limited in the bill to inserting a particular CAFE miles-per-gallon \nnumber, and a year, and substituting that for what the administration \nhas come up with, and it limits us to four amendments in the Senate, \ntwo to be offered by the majority leader, two to be offered by the \nminority leader, and four amendments in the House of Representatives.\n  I have been around here a long time, and I have never seen the \nability of the Senate to amend and consider legislation in a flexible \nway so constrained. That is what the amendment proposes, and that is \nwhat Senators will be signing on to if they decide to support the \namendment.\n  I urge any Senator who has an interest in the procedures of the \nSenate and has concern about limiting the ability of Senators to offer \namendments to read the amendment in some detail.\n\n  The amendment does, as I say, eliminate any specific number. There is \nno number as to what CAFE standard we hope to get to in the future.\n  As I see it, this is something of a test in the Senate as we \ndeliberate on these issues. The test is: Can we, as a country, as a \nGovernment, as the Senate, do anything significant to increase fuel \nefficiency when gas prices are as low as they are?\n  The last time we acted, let's face it, we acted because there was a \nreal crisis in the Middle East--in the seventies. People were shocked \ninto realizing that dependence on foreign sources of oil\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nwas a problem for us. Today that is not that big a problem. One can buy \na tank of gas in Albuquerque for $1.12 a gallon. It is hard to get \npeople worked up about the continued addiction we have to cheap gas \nunder those circumstances. Nobody thinks too much about it.\n  As to the argument that soccer moms are going to be disadvantaged, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has talked about that.\n  I am persuaded that Ford Motor Company can make an SUV that is fuel \nefficient. They can make a pickup that is fuel efficient. Each of the \nother major manufacturers can do the same thing. I do believe we need \nto focus their attention on that as a priority, and that is what the \nunderlying legislation is trying to do.\n  As to the argument that U.S. manufacturers are going to lose jobs, I \nthink it is sad that we have lost such confidence in U.S. industry and \nU.S. ingenuity that we are claiming we cannot do this, this is an \nimpossible mountain to climb, our manufacturers cannot possibly be held \nto this kind of enormous standard.\n  When President Kennedy challenged the country to put a man on the \nMoon, it is fortunate we were not tasking the automobile industry to do \nthat. They would have come back, I am sure, and indicated it was just \ntotally impossible.\n  The country can meet this challenge. We can produce more energy, and \nwe have many provisions in this bill to try to do that. But we can also \nuse the energy we have in a more efficient way, and part of that is \nthrough vehicle fuel efficiency. We need to do something significant in \nthis area.\n  I hope the Levin-Bond amendment is not adopted because it does take \nthe teeth out of the legislation in terms of any real requirement for \nimproved efficiency.\n  I do not question anyone's motives. I am just telling you that the \neffect of it will be to essentially say: Status quo is fine; the \nadministration can study this for a couple of years; if the President \ndecides there is something that ought to be changed in current law, he \ncan propose that in regulation; otherwise, Congress should back off.\n  That is a sad signal to send, and I hope we do not send that message. \nI urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment when it does come up \nfor a final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened to the debate carefully, and \nI appreciate the points that have been made by my good friend, the \nchairman of the Energy Committee. I remind all those who are following \nthe debate that it is relatively easy to set targets of achievement, \nand in this particular bill we have set the year 2013 in which to \nachieve 35 miles per gallon under CAFE. We are now roughly at 24.\n  Our past experience with setting these kinds of goals is not very \ngood. The first thing that is wrong with this is, in another 10 or 11 \nyears many of us are not going to be here, so we are not going to be \nheld accountable, because the goals we set today and our ability to \nachieve them in 10 or 11 years are fraught with an awful lot of \ninconsistencies based particularly on past history.\n  The CAFE programs have led to an increase in fleet average fuel \neconomy from 13 miles per gallon in 1975 to 22 miles per gallon in \n1987.\n  The 1987 fleetwide fuel economy stagnated as consumers shifted their \npurchase patterns to light trucks and SUVs that were covered by the \nlower CAFE standards.\n  Starting in 1995, the Congress----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I prefer to go ahead with the rest of my statement. I \nwill be happy to yield for a question upon the completion of my \nstatement.\n  Starting in 1995, the Congress prevented changes in fuel economy \nstandards for all vehicles. Such restrictions were lifted starting with \nthe model year 2004. In 1992, the Senate marked up a bill with CAFE, I \nmight add, and ANWR, and dropped it in conference. The only thing we \ngot out of that was low-flush toilets. That was the tradeoff: We traded \noff ANWR and we traded off CAFE and got low-flush toilets, some of \nwhich are not quite up to the job.\n  Tomorrow I will speak a little bit more about this issue. I, again, \nremind Members of the fallacy of setting goals and not being present to \nbe held accountable.\n  We are familiar with the amendment, that it would conduct a multiyear \nrulemaking. It would provide new spending authorizations for advanced \nvehicle technology research and development and that it would require \nthe Federal Government to purchase hybrid and alternative-fuel vehicles \nand use alternative fuels. When combined with the considerable tax \nincentives for advanced fuel technology that is in the finance package, \nwhy, what we see in the Levin-Bond amendment offers a sensible way to \nachieve fuel efficiency gains and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nIt does so in a way that would not hurt the U.S. consumer. It would not \nincrease vehicle costs to consumers and protect American jobs as well \nas American lives.\n  By comparison, my reading of the underlying Kerry proposal would \nincrease the cost of new trucks and SUVs by as much as $1,200. This is \naccording to the National Academy of Sciences. If we cannot trust them \nfor objectivity, I do not know who we could trust.\n  It would limit consumer choice by forcing automakers to produce \nsmaller vehicles that do not perform necessarily to all the consumer \nneeds. It would lead to the loss of, as we have seen in the debate, \nseveral hundreds of thousands of jobs for hard-working Americans at a \ntime when our economy obviously needs those jobs. It would reduce the \nrate of economic growth by as much as $170 billion over the next 20 \nyears, according to the Energy Information Administration, and cost \nseveral thousand additional deaths and tens of thousands of injuries in \nthe coming decades.\n  We talk a lot about safety. Common sense dictates that a larger and \nheavier automobile will be safer in an accident. Yet it is clear there \nis no possible way to meet the drastic increase in fuel economy \nrequirements proposed by the Kerry amendment without reducing the size \nand weight of vehicles. That is just a fact.\n  The Energy Information Administration conducted an analysis of the \nKerry proposal. The EIA found the average weight of passenger cars and \nlight trucks produced to meet CAFE standards would be substantially \nreduced: a decrease of 640 pounds for passenger cars and 850 pounds for \nlight trucks and SUVs. Even with the reasonable assumptions and \navailability of advanced vehicle technology, this is, in my opinion, a \ndangerous downsizing of automobiles.\n  EIA's analysis suggests it is simply impossible to attain 35 miles \nper gallon by 2015 at any cost. That is a pretty broad statement, \n``impossible to attain at any cost.''\n\n  To get beyond 30 miles per gallon in that same time frame, even more \nreduction of weight would be necessary. In study after study, safety \nexperts have concluded that reducing the weight of vehicles leads to \nhigher fatalities and injuries. Using the same relationship used by \nNHTSA in the studies of automobile size and weight, and passenger \ninjuries, we come up with a recognition that weight reduction resulting \nfrom the Kerry CAFE proposal could very likely lead to an additional \n15,000 deaths and 65,000 injuries in the next 10 years.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that some Members of this body who demand \nenvironmental regulations regardless, even if one person, one animal, \nor one plant is threatened, now stand before us with a fuel economy \nproposal which will undoubtedly kill thousands of American drivers in \nthe coming years because of these lighter cars and injure tens of \nthousands more.\n  These are the same Senators who worry about the threat to caribou \nfrom exploration activities in ANWR, and I get a little befuddled. Are \nthey the same ones who now propose what a USA Today article in 1993 \ncalled ``Death By The Gallon\"?\n  We are all entitled to our opinion, but are we somehow to believe our \ncolleagues want us to, perhaps, put caribou first rather than put \npeople first?\n  What I have behind me is a chart from the National Academy of \nSciences, and I think it deserves to be quoted. This is from July 2001. \nA review of the CAFE program found the following:\n\n       In summary, the majority of the committee finds that the \n     downsizing and weight\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\n     reduction that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s \n     most likely produced between 1,300 and 2,600 crash fatalities \n     and 13,000 and 26,000 serious injuries in 1993.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to yield at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  That is 26,000 to 52,000 additional deaths since 1980 and nearly a \nhalf a million additional serious injuries due to too-rapid increases \nin CAFE standards.\n  Why is this? Well, again we have the National Academy of Sciences, \nand they said it best. Again, I refer to this chart:\n\n       An increase in fuel economy is affected by a system that \n     encourages either downweighting or the production and sale of \n     more small cars. Some additional traffic fatalities would be \n     expected.\n\n  EIA's analysis predicts this will happen, even as we fall short of \nreaching the aggressive 36-mile-per-gallon fleet average. If CAFE \nstandards are increased dramatically over too short a period of time, \nautomakers will have no choice but to downsize and downweight their \ncars and trucks to meet the standard.\n  Rather than choosing an arbitrary number, or Senators engaging in a \nbidding war for the endorsement of--well, I say the environmental \nlobby, because they are the ones behind this primarily--should we not \ninstead rely on the expertise of the engineers at NHTSA to balance the \ncompeting concerns of fuel economy, passenger safety costs, and \nconsumer needs? In spite of our efforts to generate consensus at a town \nhall meeting that is this Senate debate, this type of technology \ndemands engineers who know what they are talking about.\n  The Levin-Bond approach lets the experts, not the politicians, \ndetermine the maximum feasible fuel economy increase. Not only does the \nKerry CAFE proposal put the American driver at risk, but I think it \nputs our economy at risk as well. It should be obvious that \ntechnologies needed to increase fuel economy cost money and increase \nthe purchase price of a vehicle. The EIA estimates a cost increase of \n$535 per passenger car and $961 for light trucks and SUVs to get to \n30.2 miles per gallon. Without a dangerous reduction in weight, the NAS \nestimates a cost increase of $690 for passenger cars and $1,200 for \nlight trucks and SUVs to reach 30.5 miles per gallon.\n  If the Kerry proposal is adopted, I think Americans can look forward \nto getting less car for more money. EIA projects that passenger car \nhorsepower will decline by 24 percent and light truck horsepower, \napproximately 18 percent. Smaller, less powerful vehicles with fewer \nfeatures, this is not what the American consumer wants.\n  That is not reflective of the standard of living we have in this \ncountry. Families, especially those with children, want larger and \nsafer vehicles, and most drivers want utility and comfort as well.\n  Under the Kerry proposal, automakers will be unable to produce \nminivans and SUVs large enough to meet the needs of the average \nAmerican family. It is not just families and SUVs. What about a farmer \nwho needs to haul hay? Will he buy a pickup truck with a 4-cylinder \nengine? Certainly not. What parent driving a carpool will be willing to \nmake multiple trips to pick up half a dozen kids after school? What \nrecreation enthusiast will buy a truck or SUV that will not tow a boat \nor RV on a weekend vacation? What construction worker, laborer, or \ncontractor will buy a vehicle that requires several trips to haul tools \nand materials? Without choices for new vehicle purchases, consumers \nwill be far more likely to hold on to their existing vehicles, thereby \nmaking fuel economy gains even less and less likely and increase our \ndependence on foreign oil. The end result will be somewhat catastrophic \nto our already struggling U.S. auto industry.\n  The Kerry proposal reduces auto sales by 220,000 in 2010 and 604,000 \nin 2015. Automakers will also suffer stiff fines, up to $40 billion \nover the next 20 years for failing to meet new CAFE standards.\n  Fewer sales suggest reduced profitability. This adds up to fewer \njobs. EIA suggests job losses of 207,000 in 2010 and 435,000 in 2015. \nShouldn't a good energy policy create jobs rather than destroy them and \nput people out of work?\n  This chart shows jobs in the United States auto industry through the \ncountry. In Texas there are 318,000. New Mexico has 21,000. \nMassachusetts has 117,000. Need I say more?\n  America's auto industry drives the economy in all 50 States, \nincluding my home State of Alaska. The automobile industry is one of \nthe Nation's largest, 6.6 million jobs directly or indirectly created. \nFor every autoworker who loses his or her job, seven others are lost in \nrelated industries: Steel, iron, textiles, plastic, and so on. Certain \nStates, some whose Senators support this amendment, would be hardest \nhit. In Michigan, over a million; in Ohio, half a million; in \nCalifornia, 492,000; in Illinois, 312,000; in New York, 274,000. \nImagine factories shutting, whole towns wiped out, all the jobs in any \nof these States eliminated overnight--moved overseas, as foreign \nautomakers gain an increasing share of the U.S. automobile market.\n  We have quotes from labor businesses, safety experts, and so forth. \nIt is no small wonder that the American workers, the United Auto \nWorkers, AFL-CIO, the American Iron and Steel industry, oppose the \nKerry proposal. So does the American Chamber of Commerce, American \nbusinesses, the Business Roundtable, the Associated Builders and \nContractors. They support Levin-Bond as a way to improve fuel economy \nwithout sacrificing hard-working American jobs.\n  The United Auto Workers say:\n\n       It [Kerry-McCain] calls for excessive, discriminatory \n     increases in CAFE standards that would lead to substantial \n     job loss for American workers in the auto industry.\n\n  The Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       The proposal would dramatically affect the functionality \n     and performance of vans, pickup trucks and sport utility \n     vehicles that businesses and consumers rely upon.\n\n  The AFL-CIO:\n\n       The proposed increase is too high and too quick, exceeding \n     even the most optimistic projections by the National \n     Academy of Sciences.\n\n  And finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety:\n\n       Any fuel conservation measure that increases the use of \n     light cars will do so at a cost of unnecessary crash deaths \n     and injuries.\n\n  That is the analysis, Mr. President.\n  And now national security. If it was clear that the Kerry CAFE \nproposal would guarantee energy independence or substantially reduce \nour need for foreign oil, we might be willing to bear its harsh costs. \nThe reality is, CAFE standards have provided few, if any, of the \nsecurity benefits promised by the proponents. There is little reason to \nbelieve that further increases in CAFE will provide any national \nsecurity benefit.\n  The CAFE program was introduced 25 years ago with the intention of \nreducing U.S. oil imports and consumption. Yet today we import more \nforeign oil than ever and our gasoline consumption is at an all-time \nhigh for a very simple reason. We have a high standard of living in \nthis country. We have no other mode of transportation to generate \nmovement of individuals other than oil. The world moves by oil. America \nmoves by oil. The planes do not move in and out of here on hot air.\n  The reasons are simple. While passenger car fuel economy has doubled \nand light truck fuel economy has increased by over 50 percent, the CAFE \nprogram has had no effect on any other factors that determine our \ntransportation fuel use: the size of the vehicle fleet, which is \ndictated by our population; how vehicles are driven, including vehicle \nmiles traveled in a calendar year; and the kind of vehicles consumers \ncall for.\n  In each survey of consumer preferences, safety, performance, comfort, \nand utility rank above fuel economy in determining what vehicles are \npreferred. Automakers currently offer 50 different vehicle models that \nget 30 miles per gallon or better, but the 10 most fuel-efficient \nvehicles make up only 1\\1/2\\ percent of the sales.\n  This suggests that the American consumer is making a determination of \nhis or her choice and that choice is not made necessarily on fuel-\nefficient vehicles but on other considerations: Safety, comfort, and so \nforth.\n  As we look at this chart which shows passenger car and light truck \nsales by State, we can see the States whose 2000 new light truck \nregistrations are 60 percent or over are in the green. These are the \nwestern areas that have to drive farther. The blue States are those\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nwhose 2000 new light truck registrations are 50 to 59 percent, and the \nothers are States where new light truck registrations are 49 percent or \nunder. In 36 States, consumers favor light trucks. That is just the \nharsh reality between passenger cars and light trucks.\n  Again, it is a matter of choice. Consumers have voted with their \nwallets. Sales of light trucks and SUVs surpass sales of passenger \nvehicles in 36 out of 50 States. In 1980, light trucks and SUVs \ncomprised only 17 percent of sales, and now they are more than half. \nConsumers have chosen performance and features over fuel economy and \nfuel savings. Analysis suggests this trend will continue.\n  Even with CAFE, petroleum demands are expected to increase by 25 \npercent to more than 25 million barrels per day in the year 2020. The \nactual petroleum saved by higher CAFE standards, according to EIA, is \nroughly 1.3 million barrels per day, about the same as we can produce \nfrom ANWR during the same period. While production of domestic oil from \nANWR and Alaska would obviously reduce foreign oil imports, higher CAFE \nstandards may not. Instead of reducing the need for crude oil, high \nCAFE standards reduce the needs for gasoline and diesel. Rather than \nreduce our dependence on Persian Gulf crude oil, higher CAFE standards \nwould reduce the needs for import of these products primarily from \nCanada and the Virgin Islands. Clearly, the national security threat \ndue to our dependence on Middle East oil remains, even with CAFE.\n  Finally, by fostering the use of advanced vehicle technologies, \nexpanding alternative fuel use, the Levin-Bond approach to fuel economy \nwill reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create hundreds of thousands \nof new jobs, protect American families and workers from injury or \ndeath, provide consumers with vehicle choice they need, and increase \neconomic growth.\n  In contrast, in my opinion the dramatic and ill-advised increase in \nCAFE standards proposed in the underlying bill will hardly make a dent \nin our imports of foreign oil and do nothing to ensure our national \nsecurity, throw hundreds of people--thousands of people--on the street, \nout of work, and lead to tens of thousands of new deaths and crippling \ninjuries on the roads of America; deprive workers and small businesses \nof their vehicles they need to go about their daily lives, and \npotentially make the difference between economic growth and prosperity \nor economic gloom and recession.\n  Clearly, the Levin-Bond amendment is a better way forward to truly \nimprove the economy. I intend to vote for it, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I would like to show one chart in conclusion. This was as a \nconsequence of our discussion earlier about what a difference the \nincrease in domestic production means relative to our overall \nconsumption. I want to go back and show what happened to the Alaska \nproduction, represented by the blue line, from 1973 to 1999--clear \nacross the board.\n  During this period from 1973 to 1999, you see the production of \nAlaskan oil in blue starts and goes up and comes across. The \ninteresting thing is something happened in 1977. You see that big jump \nthat occurs? What happened is we came on line with Prudhoe Bay. It made \na tremendous difference.\n  What happened in the red chart when we did that? This is what we were \nimporting in the early 1970s. We were importing somewhere in the area \nof 6 million barrels a day. It suddenly dropped. It dropped \ndramatically because we increased domestic production in this country.\n  I am tired of hearing arguments that say, if you bring on oil from \nANWR, it will not make a difference. It will make a dramatic \ndifference, and this is proof.\n  What did we bring on at that time? We brought an additional 2 million \nbarrels on line. That is what we brought in during that period, right \nin there. When you see the significant drop in the red line, that is \nwhy it happened. If we can open up ANWR, we will see the same drop in \nimported oil. It will not relieve us, but it will make a difference.\n  I yield for a question to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Has the Senator finished?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska yielded for a question \nto the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator has finished, I want to claim the floor, \nand then I will ask a question, if I may.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to respond to the question now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No, but I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will ask the Senator a number of \nquestions, if I might.\n  First, the Senator quoted a study. It is the EIA study. The Senator \nquoted a study and suggested the study says you cannot reach 35 miles \nper gallon.\n  Is the Senator aware that the study did not analyze the Kerry-McCain \nsubstitute at all, which seeks to get 36 miles per gallon but with a \ncushion for trading? Is he aware that was not even analyzed?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, this Senator was aware of that. We asked for an \nanalysis of the bill as it was at the time of our request.\n  Mr. KERRY. So in effect we have a proposal on the floor that the \nstudy of the Senator does not address at all, or we will have a \nproposal.\n  The second question: Is the Senator aware the model he referred to is \nnot a fuel economy model, it is an economic model of the U.S. energy \nsystem which has a series of statements about pricing and efficiencies \nthat it does not take into account?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Account, if I may, of what?\n  Mr. KERRY. Specifically, I quote from the study. The study says that \npredicting energy prices depends on events that shape energy markets \nthat are ``random and cannot be anticipated.''\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That should not prevent us from trying to predict \nfuture events, should it? I would say that statement, in general terms, \nis consistent with the reality that the price of fuel is primarily \ncontrolled by OPEC through their cartel and they have set a floor and \nset a ceiling. The floor is $22; the ceiling is $28. They have exceeded \nthat. Any time they have fallen below that, they have quickly reduced \nthe supply and the price has gone up. So that is what controls the \nprice of fuel in this country. It is OPEC.\n  Mr. KERRY. But it did not take into account what the benefits might \nbe if, in fact, that happened again and we went back to the 1973 \nsituation. So in effect the study does not take into account the \npotential of that major price differential.\n  But much more important, is the Senator aware that the list of \ntechnology on which the assumption is based, that you cannot meet 35 \nmiles per gallon, is a very different list from the list of technology \navailable under the National Academy of Sciences? And is the Senator \nalso aware that the study assumes that you include all 8,500-pound \nvehicles, which we do not include? So if you take out the 8,500-pound \nvehicles, the study of the Senator is completely inapplicable.\n  Is he aware of that, that we do not have 8,500-pound vehicles in our \nproposal?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't think the Senator from Massachusetts has \noffered his bill as yet, so we do not know what is in it. What we do \nknow is the EIA's projections are not statements of what will happen \nbut what might happen, given known technologies, current technology, \ndemography, and the trends in current laws and regulations. We had EIA \nanalyze the proposal as it was at the time of our request, several \nweeks ago, and before the Senator from Massachusetts made his changes.\n  I find the argument the Senator from Massachusetts makes on \ntechnology to be interesting: on one hand, he is suggesting the \ntechnology is likely to occur for vehicle efficiency, but, on the other \nhand, I am promoting ANWR, saying technology advancements will allow us \nto do it safely. He dismisses technology on one hand and promotes it on \nthe other. I happen to believe that technology is applicable in both \nareas.\n  But what I find objectionable is the idea of setting a goal in the \nyear 2013, or thereabouts, and not being held accountable. It is very \neasy for Members\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nto say let's go ahead and vote for the 35 or 36 miles per gallon, \nbecause we are not going to be here to be held accountable for it. The \nexperience we had has been disastrous, relative to meeting these goals, \nbecause obviously the American public has a certain concern about what \nthey want to buy. It is associated with a standard of living. It is \nassociated with the advancement, obviously, in technology.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Alaska, first of all, I would \nask him to speak for himself as to whether or not--I know he does not \nintend to be here in 12 or 13 years, but a lot of other of my \ncolleagues do.\n  Second----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I just might be here.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I may say to my friend from Alaska, who may be--on this \nsubject of this technology--I completely accept the technology. I am \nnot arguing about the technology availability in Alaska. That has \nnothing to do with the Alaska argument. It is a question, not about \ntechnology, it is a question about good energy policy. That is another \ndebate. It will happen in the next few days. But I say to my friend \nfrom Alaska, with respect to technology, these are technologies that \nare currently available. They are not taken into account in the study.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has listed these technologies. The \nstudy he cites does not even take into account hybrids.\n  My friend from Illinois has a chart over there--I had it over here \nearlier--that shows what can happen with hybrids. You bring a hybrid \nSUV on line and you get double the mileage. The study doesn't even take \nthat into account.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me respond to the last question, if I may. The \nsame National Academy of Sciences study on which the Senator bases his \nlegislative proposal, with new technologies, has estimates of cost and \nimpact as in the EIA study. I think what the Senator is suggesting is \nthe use of additional technologies which EIA believes are not \nnecessarily cost efficient.\n  Higher CAFE standards means higher costs. Data from the National \nAcademy of Sciences make this clear--$690 more for passenger cars at \n33.5 miles per gallon, and $1,260 more for light trucks and SUVs at \n27.5 miles per gallon in 2015. The Energy Information Administration \nclearly says cost is going to be higher--$535 for passenger cars and \n$961 for light trucks and SUVs.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts can argue the point, but I suggest he \nargue with the National Academy of Sciences or EIA.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again there is nothing to argue about with \nthe National Academy of Sciences because they did not take it into \naccount either. But they acknowledge it. They acknowledge they did not \ntake into account hybrids. My colleague has not answered the question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The question is a matter of choice for the American \npublic in purchasing these hybrids. They can purchase them now. You can \ngo out and get a car that gets 50 miles per gallon if you wish.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator mentioning $1,200. \nThat is an accurate statement of the up side cost that is talked about \nin the National Academy of Sciences report. They also talk about the \nlow side of $500--so, $500 to $1,200. I accept that. He is absolutely \ncorrect. It will cost a little bit more. But what he doesn't say and \nwhat they never say is that the savings in gasoline over the life of \nthe car pay for the cost. Moreover, we are prepared to give a tax \ncredit.\n  Is the Senator aware that Ford Motor Company executive, John Wallace, \nsaid in an interview that with a $3,000 tax incentive for the purchase \nof the gas-electric hybrid, that would solve the problem of \nprofitability and they would be profitable immediately with the Ford \nEscape? Is the Senator aware that Ford Motor Company says they can be \nprofitable immediately with the tax credit which we are going to pass?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts is aware \nthat in order for the car to basically amortize the cost of saving \ngasoline, the individual would have to keep that car about 14 years. \nThe American public is not of a mind to keep a car that long.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is not my question. With a tax credit, is it \nprofitable immediately?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. One could argue that it is profitable because a tax \ncredit is a subsidy.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is only to bring it on line. The Senator said you \ncan't be profitable.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I quoted the National Academy of Sciences, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts is arguing the point that it wasn't included \nin his particular amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Actually, the National Academy of Sciences--I have the \nreport right here--says specifically that without the cost, without \nloss of jobs, and without loss of safety, you can have a car that \nincreases fuel efficiency up to 37 miles per gallon. That is what the \nNational Academy of Sciences says. They don't tell you you have to do \nthat, but they say you can do it. It is technologically feasible today. \nSo you can, in fact, do that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the Senator from Massachusetts has to be \ncareful in his generalities because the Ford Escape isn't a real SUV. I \nunderstand its towing capacity is only 1,000 pounds. That means you \ncan't really tow your boat to where you are going to launch it because \nit is simply not heavy enough, if indeed it can only tow 1,000 pounds.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts can argue the point. But it is either \nfact or fiction. Is the Ford Escape a real SUV, or a mini-SUV, and is \nit limited to a certain load area?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator that is their \nfirst report. Let me say that over the course of the next 15 years, \ngiven the technologies that are available to us, you have the \nreliability to bring on line a car that can tow any size boat, and the \nvehicles you need for that fall outside the CAFE standard because of \nweight--this perfect capacity to have all the towing you want, all the \ncarrying capacity, and all the lift capacity and still drive a more \nefficient vehicle. But I also want to ask the Senator--he said we are \ngoing to lose safety. I want to have the Senator from Illinois have a \nchance. He mentioned safety.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have the floor, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts is aware.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may, the Senator said we will lose the \nsafety. He quoted the National Academy of Sciences. Is the Senator \naware that the National Academy of Sciences said specifically on page \n70 of the report that it is technically feasible and potentially \neconomic to improve fuel economy without reducing vehicle weight or \nsize, and therefore without significantly affecting the safety of motor \nvehicle travel?\n\n  Is he also aware that the most important entities in this country \nwith respect to safety--Public Citizen and the Center for Auto Safety--\nare both opposed to the Levin amendment and support the effort to have \nCAFE standards for a safety basis?\n  I want the Senator to hear this, if I may.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assumed the Senator from Massachusetts was going to \nask me a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I asked the question. I want to supplement the question. I \nwant to see if the Senator is aware of this finding. This is Public \nCitizen:\n\n       The industry's primary support for its position comes from \n     a highly controverted study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences, which, in turn, based its conclusions on research \n     by Charles Kahane of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration.\n       The data used in the study are from 1993 and, therefore, \n     fails to reflect advances in passenger protection, such as \n     dual airbags and head injury protection.\n       The study misleadingly held crashworthiness protection \n     constant, despite the fact that many lives could be saved by \n     design changes and cost-effective safety improvements.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to respond.\n  Mr. KERRY. There are additional findings. In fact, the finding of the \nNational Academy of Sciences is that it would not affect safety. That \nis, in fact, the current finding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, this comes from the National Academy \nof Sciences. It reads as follows:\n\n       Contrary to recommendations, the NAS report says that the \n     proposal establishes both unreasonable targets and \n     unreasonable timetables.\n\n  According to the NAS report, technology and changes require a very \nlong\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\ntime to be introduced into the manufacturer's product line, which I \nthink paraphrases what the Senator from Massachusetts said because he \nsaid it will take time for the minivan, if you will, to evolve into \nwhat we would all like, and that is a multipurpose minivan.\n  They further go on to say that technology changes require a very long \ntime to be introduced. Any policy that is implemented too \naggressively--that is, too short a period of time--has the potential to \nadversely affect manufacturers, their suppliers, their employees, and \nconsumers.\n  The NAS report says further:\n\n       But it is clear that there were more injuries and more \n     fatalities than otherwise would have occurred had the fleet \n     in recent years been as large and heavy as the fleet of the \n     mid-1970's.\n\n  Those facts are on the basis of experience.\n\n       To the extent that size and weight of the fleet have been \n     constrained by CAFE requirements, the current committee \n     concludes that those requirements have caused more injuries \n     and more fatalities on the road than would otherwise have \n     occurred. Recent increases in vehicle weight, while resulting \n     in some loss of fuel economy, have probably resulted in a \n     reduction of motor vehicle crash deaths and injuries.\n\n  This is in the NAS report, page 2-29.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator hasn't answered my question. I \nagree with that. I know exactly what they say with respect to that. But \nhe hasn't acknowledged that the findings of Public Citizen and the \nCenter for Auto Safety point to the fact that the analysis on which the \nconclusion was based is flawed because it is not based on current \nsafety capacity. It is not based on dual airbags. It is not based on \nlighter materials. It is not based on new technology. It is based on \nwhat happened in the transition. I want to explain why it happened.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Isn't it based on a historical evaluation of what has \nhappened? And so it is factual in relationship to actual statistical \ninformation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me again say what it relates to.\n  Specifically, the data used in the study is from 1993--not 2002. It \nfails to reflect the changes in passenger protection. It doesn't \nreflect dual airbags. It doesn't reflect what we have in our bill, \nwhich is rollover safety. Ten thousand people lost their lives last \nyear because SUVs roll over. They have a 75-pound roof. The car is so \nheavy that it crushes them. The industry has resisted that protection. \nFor a small cost, you could save those 10,000 lives.\n  That is in our bill. It is not in their bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is that portion in the bill?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes. This is in our bill. It is introduced. It is on the \nfloor now. You are about to strip it. But that is what is here.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is not my understanding. I would appreciate the \nSenator from Massachusetts advising us just where specifically that is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is taking the NAS study.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I noticed that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the same breath, the Senator from Massachusetts says \nNAS found an increasing safety standard, and that his proposed level \nwill not affect safety. There was no such finding by the NAS.\n  Would the Senator from Alaska agree?\n  Would the Senator from Alaska agree that when the NAS said that it is \ntechnically feasible and potentially economical to improve fuel economy \nwithout reducing vehicle weight or size, and, therefore, without \nsignificantly affecting the safety of motor vehicle travel, they were \nnot talking about increasing fuel economy to the Kerry level?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. They were just simply saying, it is possible to increase \nfuel economy. You might be able to increase fuel economy by 1 mile per \ngallon without affecting safety. They did not reach a conclusion there. \nThis line has been quoted----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am asking the Senator from Alaska a \nquestion.\n  Does the Senator from Alaska agree that the National Academy of \nSciences does not specify what increase in CAFE would be possible in a \nway which does not affect, in a negative way, safety? Would the Senator \nfrom Alaska agree with that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely. That is my understanding.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is there a committee report on \nthe proposal, the Kerry proposal? And has the Commerce Committee given \nany views on the proposal?\n  Mr. KERRY. No. Mr. President, no there is none.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is there a reason why that has not occurred?\n  Mr. KERRY. Because we ran out of time. The leader made a decision \nthat there was not time for the committee to act. There, clearly, would \nhave been a majority in the committee, but we did not have time because \nof the schedule of the Senate. And the majority leader made a decision \nto try to meld it with the energy bill in order to keep his commitment \nto you, I believe, to bring the energy bill here at the appropriate \ntime after the recess.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows, the \nleadership has seen fit to basically go around the committee process \nbecause the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has not met in a \nmarkup since October. We had no opportunity to address amendments and \nbring in debate and develop a consensus. That is why I think it is \nunfortunate that so much of the process we are going through now is a \nmatter of educating Members. Because it did not occur in the Commerce \nCommittee, it did not occur in the Finance Committee, and it certainly \ndid not occur in the committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee because the majority leader saw fit to pull it from \nthe committee in October.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts is well aware of why it was \npulled. It was pulled because we had the votes to vote out an ANWR \namendment, which would have put us in a position, as we debate the \nenergy bill, of not having to come up with 60 votes, as the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has threatened in his filibuster statement that he \nis going to filibuster the ANWR amendment.\n  But from the standpoint of equity and fairness, what we have not had \nan opportunity to do within the Energy Committee is to have amendments \ncome up, develop a bill, and vote it out. And it was done for one \nspecific reason. And it was done very early. This was done back in \nOctober. So we did not work, in the Energy Committee, on a bill so that \nwe would have a consensus of both Democrats and Republicans as we \naddress some of these complex issues.\n  So from the standpoint of not having time, we are all in the same \nboat, only I think it is fair to say the Energy Committee really took \nit in the shorts, if you will pardon the abbreviation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, in his memory here--he \nhas been here quite a while--is it not fair and accurate to say that \nwhen the Republicans were in control, the majority leader, on a number \nof different occasions, did exactly the same thing? Is that fair?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am so pleased the Senator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. KERRY. Is that accurate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Has asked that question because it is totally \ninaccurate. The Republican majority leader----\n  Mr. KERRY. Is totally inaccurate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Has never ever taken away----\n  Mr. KERRY. Never circumvented?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I finish the answer--has never ever taken away the \nfunction and responsibility of the committees to meet.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is not what I asked.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the Senator will look up the Record, they have \nnever seen, in the 22 years I have been here, an occasion where the \nmajority leader has absolutely forbid the committees to meet. The \nRepublican leader may have moved bills without going through the \ncommittee, but never, never, never. So there is a difference. There is \na significant difference here.\n  This is a usurping of the committee process and function by the \ndictate of\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nthe majority leader because he knew we had the votes to vote out ANWR. \nThat is what is so undemocratic about this process.\n  Is the Senator from Massachusetts willing to give us an up-down vote \non ANWR?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am asking the question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am going to answer. I am asking recognition to be able \nto do that, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls the time, and \nI believe he has yielded to the Senator for the response.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would be delighted to answer the \nquestion. And, at the same time, may I say to the Senator, look, my \nquestion to him was whether or not a majority leader on the other side \nhas circumvented. I did not ask him whether they met or not.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Because he has never done it.\n  Mr. KERRY. And he has circumvented.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. He has never done it by pulling the authority----\n  Mr. KERRY. But he has done it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Of the committee of jurisdiction away from the process \ngoing on in the committee or forbid the committee from even holding \nmarkups for fear they would be somewhat confrontational.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I can't speak to the question of \nmethodology. I simply am asking about the result. My result answer is \naffirmative.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the minority leader were here, he would cite the \nspecific differences. The Senator from Massachusetts can either accept \nmy explanation or not. But factually, what happened is that the \ncommittee was forbidden to address any business before the committee. \nSo we have not had any markups. We have not had opportunities to offer \namendments.\n  That did not occur in the Commerce Committee. You had a process. He \nfinally pulled it. It did not occur in the Finance Committee because he \nfinally pulled it. But in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee we \nwere simply forbidden, and that was it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think that the assistant majority leader \nmay or may not have a better history of that than I do, but I just want \nto say something. With respect to--I ask the Senator from Alaska about \nthis. The other day, in the Washington Post, Paul Portney, who is the \nchairman of the National Academy of Sciences panel that the Senator \nreferred to --and he is the president of the think tank--said that what \nwe are proposing in our bill is--I am quoting--``roughly consistent \nwith what the Academy identified as being technologically possible, \neconomically affordable, and consistent with the desire of consumers \nfor passenger safety.'' Is the Senator aware that the chairman of the \npanel signed off on that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thought the Senator from Massachusetts was going to \nrespond to my question; which was, Is he going to allow a 50-vote on \nANWR? I don't think he addressed that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will. Mr. President, let me say pointedly, I have been \nhere now for 18 years. And in the 18 years that I have been here, as \nthe Senator from Alaska knows, there are certain kinds of issues that \nrise to such a level of both emotional as well as substantive quality \nand contest that they always require 60 votes.\n  I have seen time after time on both sides of the aisle--it is just \nthe difficulty here--if you have a contested issue, that is \nsignificantly contested on both sides, almost every time here it does \nnot happen unless one side or the other musters 60 votes. It may be \nregrettable, but many people believe that is one of the great \nprotections of the Senate, so we do not rush to do things that we \nregret or even as a way of protecting the minority. It is what our \nforefathers put in place. And I have said that I will exercise that \nprivilege afforded us by the rules of the Senate. And that is what I \nintend to do on that subject.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am glad that the----\n  Mr. KERRY. May I say, it is not with any disrespect for the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I admire his tenacity. I know this means a great deal to \nhim. We just happen to differ. And I think it is an issue that has to \nbe resolved with those 60 votes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  To suggest that we do not want to move into these things too rapidly, \nthis issue has been before this body for many, many years.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not a movement of rapidity. We passed opening \nANWR in 1995, as the Senator from Massachusetts will recall, and it was \nvetoed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, I am not saying rapidly. I am \nsaying that sometimes applies.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It was vetoed by President Clinton. Had we proceeded \nwith it at that time, we would now know what we had. And I think that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has forgotten one thing. On matters of \nnational security--and certainly national security is an issue, as we \nlook at our situation with Iraq, our dependence on imported oil from \nSaddam Hussein, the fact that we are enforcing a no-fly zone, risking \nthe lives of men and women--on September 11, we were importing over a \nmillion barrels of oil a day from Iraq. We are threatened now relative \nto the exposure of terrorism from that part of the world. And the \nSenator from Massachusetts has chosen not to let 50 percent of the \nSenate make a decision on a matter of national security. He has chosen \non his own to filibuster something that has never been done in my \nunderstanding of the traditions of the Senate on a matter of national \nsecurity.\n\n  This is what the ANWR issue is. It is the national security of our \ncountry because, obviously, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows \nvery well, when there is a shortage of oil, the price goes up. The \nSenator from Massachusetts would recall in 1973, when we had the Arab \noil embargo, when we had the Yom Kippur War, we were 37-percent \ndependent on imported oil. Today we are 57- to 58-percent dependent. \nWhat happened in 1973, we had gas lines around the block. There was \nfrustration. People were blaming government.\n  I would hope this never happens again, but if it does, I suggest the \nSenator from Massachusetts will have to reflect on the attitude he \nproposes to take.\n  On national security items, it is uncalled for to try to establish a \nfilibuster to reflect an individual and a particular group that has \nmilked this issue for virtually all it is worth. I am talking about \nAmerica's extreme environmental community.\n  There is absolutely no evidence that ANWR can't be opened safely. And \nthe residents of my State of Alaska happen to support it. The Native \nresidents of Kaktovik, the area that is affected, support it. ANWR can \nbe on-line in a relatively short period of time. It can mean as much in \noil coming into this country and being produced as Prudhoe Bay did. \nThat was 20 to 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in the United \nStates for the last 27 years.\n  Those are the facts. The debate we will have on that issue will take \ncare of it. It certainly is not in the best traditions of the Senate to \ntake a national security interest and mandate a cloture 60 vote point \nof order. That is what the Senator has chosen to do.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for an announcement to the Senate, \nwithout the Senator losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. We have had a number of calls in both cloakrooms as to what \nwill happen tonight. We are very close to having a unanimous consent \nagreement proposed to the Senate that would set up a vote on this \nmatter that is now before the Senate at 11:30 tomorrow morning. We also \nhave recognized Senator Miller has been waiting to offer his amendment. \nHe would do that after we come in in the morning so we would be able to \nhave the two votes in the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I had a \ndiscussion with Senator Miller. My understanding was that the debate on \nhis amendment would occur after the disposition of the Levin-Bond \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If I misspoke, I am sorry. We have a lot of people waiting, \nand we are going to offer a unanimous consent request to set up things \nin the morning\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nand tomorrow afternoon. If people would be kind enough when there is a \nbreak in the speeches in the next 10 minutes or so, I would like to \noffer the request so we can move on.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, point of personal privilege.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor to Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may not yield the floor to another \nSenator.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I had an inquiry to the distinguished deputy \nmajority leader. We have been promised to see a copy of the amendment \nthat is to be offered. Before we agree on the unanimous consent request \non this side, we would like to see a copy of that amendment. I wonder \nif we could be accommodated.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have so ordered the unanimous \nconsent agreement that that should not be a concern to the Senator. \nNone of his rights or privileges would be lost. We will go over that \nwith him prior to offering it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri now has the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to address a number \nof things that have been said on the floor. Before doing that, I would \nask if the distinguished majority whip had further comments. I did not \nmean to cut him off.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that. The Senator certainly has not lost his \nright to the floor. Tonight anyone who wants to speak on this amendment \nshould talk as long as they want. We have a number of people in the \nChamber who wish to talk. Certainly we are going to complete debate on \nthis tonight. That is mainly what the unanimous consent agreement does. \nIt sets up a vote in the morning. So if everyone would be understanding \nof that, in the immediate future we will offer the request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Missouri yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For a question of the majority whip, if I could: Did I \nunderstand the majority whip to indicate that the debate on this \namendment would be completed tonight under this proposed UC?\n  Mr. REID. Let me respond to the Senator from Michigan, yes, the \ndebate would be finished tonight. We would have 5 minutes on each side \nin the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Prior to the vote?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor. Does \nthe Senator from Missouri yield for a parliamentary inquiry to the \nSenator from Illinois?\n  Mr. BOND. For a parliamentary inquiry, I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire of the Chair, is there any control in a \nunanimous consent or rule of the Senate relative to the order of \nspeaking as to whether Members will each have a chance to speak once \nbefore a Member speaks a second time or what order Members will be \nrecognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no controlling unanimous consent at \nthis time with regard to debate on this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I inquire of my colleague from Missouri if he could \ngive me an indication of how long he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. I have \nbeen waiting since about 3:45 because there were a number of points \nthat were raised by my good friend from Massachusetts. He was kind \nenough to pay attention to some analogies I drew. It is probably going \nto take me 10 to 15 minutes to correct the Record. But I am very \nsympathetic to the needs of my other colleagues who wish to speak, and \nI do need to straighten that out. With the Chair's permission, I will \ngo ahead and reclaim my time and begin by making, first, a request.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I realize that. I am asking if I could ask him just a \nquick inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Missouri yield for a \nrequest of the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to the Senator's \nspeeches and questions, and I have a number of answers to questions he \nhas already raised. I prefer to answer those questions, and then I \nshall be happy to entertain such remaining questions. But he has \naddressed in his statements a number of questions to me. I am looking \nforward to the opportunity to attempt to answer those questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, unless it is from the majority whip, I would \nprefer to go on with my statement. I have told the Senators that I \nwould hope to be able to complete this in less than 15 minutes, if I \ncould reclaim the floor.\n  First, there was a statement by my friend, the Senator from Arizona, \nthat there is nothing going to be done to improve fuel efficiency under \nthe Levin-Bond amendment.\n  I refer the Senator from Arizona to section 801, the very first page. \nIt directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue new regulations \nsetting forth increased fuel economy standards for automobiles that are \ndetermined on the basis of maximum feasible average fuel economy \nlevels, taking into consideration the matters set forth in subsection \nF. That essentially lists all of the factors included in the National \nAcademy of Sciences study.\n  Frankly, it says, ``setting forth increased average fuel economy \nstandards.''\n  There have been questions raised by the Senators from Massachusetts \nand Arizona as to whether there would be any action by the Department \nof Transportation. It is important to point out to whoever still \nremains that Secretary Mineta, in July of 2001, requested that Congress \nremove riders preventing the Department of Transportation from revising \nthe current CAFE standards.\n  Once Congress did that, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration--which I will refer to as NHTSA--moved expeditiously in \nresuming CAFE rulemaking and published a notice on January 24, and on \nFebruary 7 issued a request for comment for new CAFE standards for \nlight trucks, requested public input. On February 1, the Secretary sent \na letter to Congress urging that DOT be given the necessary authority \nto reform the CAFE program. The administration has requested an \nincrease in NHTSA's budget to accomplish the development of the new \nstandards and has begun updating its 1997 analysis of vehicle size.\n  So I think NHTSA, which the National Academy of Sciences study said \nshould move forward, has shown it is willing to do so and that it is \nanxious to do so.\n  Now, one other item has been raised. My colleague from Massachusetts \nhad a great line, a wonderful line, saying they had the most efficient \nworkers and the U.S. auto industry can turn out the best cars around \nbut they are forbidden to do so by the ``terrible management.'' It is \nall the management and the designers. Do you know something, Mr. \nPresident. The people saying they don't want those minicars are the \nconsumers. The people who determine what the national auto- and truck-\nbuying public consume are the consumers themselves.\n  There are some in this body who think we can tell them that it is \ngood for you, eat your spinach--even if you don't like it. They tried \nto tell them to eat their spinach. They got 50 different small cars \nthat meet very high standards. Yes, by God, some of them are golf \ncarts. I love the golf carts. They are going to be all over the place \nif we have this absolutely arbitrary 37-mile-per-gallon fleet average, \nor 35, or whatever they come up with in their secondary amendment. We \nare going to be driving lots of golf carts because they will make it. \nBut only 1.5 percent of vehicle sales in the United States today--even \nthough there are 50 different models--are of the mini subcompacts that \nget the very high miles per gallon average.\n  For those people who want to drive them and want to save gasoline, \nmore power to them. That should be their choice. That should be the \nconsumer's choice. There have been a lot of statements made about the \nfact that, well, the only arguments against increased\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nCAFE are from the automakers. There are those of us who are supporting \nthe Levin-Bond amendment who believe that the basis for our concern and \nfor our amendment is the National Academy of Sciences study.\n  I had my breath taken away by the attacks on the National Academy of \nSciences, but I will quote some figures from it.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said it is technically feasible and \npotentially economical to improve fuel economy without reducing vehicle \nweight or size. It goes on to say that two members of the committee \nbelieve it may be possible to improve fuel economy without any \nimplications for safety, even if down-weighting is used. So that \nstatement from the National Academy of Sciences shows that the rest of \nthe members of the panel said it would have an impact on safety.\n  Furthermore, the committee states that it recognizes the automakers' \nresponses could be biased, but extensive downsizing that occurred after \nfuel economy requirements established in 1970 suggest that a likelihood \nof a similar response to further increases in fuel economy requirements \nmust be considered seriously. From this, I repeat the message \npreviously received--that we will be getting into smaller cars that are \nmore dangerous.\n  Speaking of smaller cars, my colleague from Massachusetts talked \nabout the Escape hybrid electric vehicle. Well, the rest of the story, \nand what he did not tell you, is that the Escape, which is the basic \ncar, can only tow 1,000 pounds. It is a small front-wheel drive. The \nhybrid would cost $3,000 to $5,000 more, and it is 1,000 pounds \nlighter. Now, 1,000 pounds is a significant factor because that is \nbasically what the lower weight of vehicles after the CAFE standards \nwent into effect--what resulted in the roughly 2,000 deaths per year \nthat the National Academy of Sciences foresaw.\n  There may be some people who want the hybrid electric vehicle. But if \nI were driving young children in my family around, I don't think I \nwould want to go with a smaller car. There is no assurance that the \nconsumers are going to buy it. That is the problem with some of these \ncommand-and-control decisions from Washington. They say that if we \ndirect the manufacturers to build it, then the consumers will buy it. \nWell, American consumers like to make choices themselves. Sometimes \nthey say we are not going to buy them.\n  The 10 most fuel-efficient cars in America account for only 1.5 \npercent of auto sales. In a recent survey of attributes, they show that \nthe consumers value safety, comfort, utility, performance, and fuel \neconomy ranks at the bottom.\n  In addition, when we talk about the technological improvements, \nCongress is not making the laws of physics. We are not changing \nscience.\n  The safety improvements add weight to the vehicles. The heavier the \nvehicle, the more energy it takes to move it down the road and it \nresults in a decrease in fuel economy.\n  The National Committee of Sciences report said:\n\n       If an increase in fuel economy is affected by a system that \n     encourages either downweighting or the production in sale of \n     more small cars, some additional fatalities would be \n     expected.\n\n  In addition, the Senator from Massachusetts said unequivocally that \nNAS, in its report, said a fleet of 37 miles per gallon could be \nreached with existing technology and without any loss of jobs.\n  That is just simply not true. Nobody can find a reference in this \nwonderful National Academy of Sciences report. I hold it up. It is a \nlittle dog eared. I have been looking for the statement cited as gospel \nby the Senator from Massachusetts. It is not in there. There are not \neven any fleetwide numbers in the report. Rather, there are cost-\nefficient fuel economy levels for 10 different subclasses of light-duty \nvehicles. Nowhere are those numbers sales weighted to yield a fleet \naverage.\n  Of the six cost-effective scenarios examined by the National Academy \nof Sciences panel, is there even 1 of the 10 classes estimated to be \nable to reach that level? There are subcompact and compact cars which \nunder a 3-year payback period could get up to 30 miles per gallon, and \nthe highest light truck value is only 24.7 miles per gallon.\n  The National Academy of Sciences report in no way suggests that a 37, \n35, 32--whatever number you want to give me--is achievable.\n  Also, my friend from Massachusetts cited a Consumers Union study on \npossible safety effects. Unfortunately, that CU study used an invalid \ncomparison of vehicle crash death rates published by the Insurance \nInstitute for Highway Safety to suggest that drivers of Honda Civics \nare at less risk than drivers of Chevrolet Surburbans. The Insurance \nInstitute says:\n\n       Such a claim is absurd on the face of it. Plus, the \n     comparison is invalid. The two death rates are not \n     statistically different, as indicated by the confidence \n     bounds we published. Also . . . nonvehicle factors such as \n     use patterns and driver demographics influence vehicle death \n     rates, and these are likely to vary across different vehicle \n     types such as small cars . . . and very large sport utility \n     vehicles.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Insurance Institute for\n\n\n                                               Highway Safety,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: This is in response to your request for \n     reactions to statements in a letter sent by the Consumer \n     Union (CU) to members of the Senate on possible safety \n     effects of pending fuel economy legislation. The CU letter \n     seriously misrepresents the adverse safety consequences of \n     reducing vehicle weights to improve fuel economy.\n       First, CU uses an invalid comparison of vehicle crash death \n     rates published by the Institute to suggest that drivers of \n     Honda Civics are at less risk than drivers of Chevrolet \n     Suburbans. Such a claim is absurd on the face of it. Plus the \n     comparison is invalid. The two death rates are not \n     statistically different, as indicted by the confidence bounds \n     we published. Also (as noted in our publication) nonvehicle \n     factors such as use patterns and driver demographics \n     influence vehicle death rates, and these are likely to vary \n     across different vehicle types such as small cars (Civics) \n     and very largest sport utility vehicles (Suburbans).\n       Even though we pointed out to CU the potential influences \n     of nonvehicle factors on the computed death rates, the letter \n     claims that ``when we take all crash factors into account in \n     the real world the Honda Civic had fewer driver fatalities \n     than the Chevrolet Suburban.'' This is a complete \n     misrepresentation. Nonvehicle factors such as use patterns \n     and driver demographics were not taken into account. The \n     claim that ``all crash factors'' were taken into account is \n     wrong. No nonvehicle crash factors were accounted for when \n     the death rates were computed.\n       Second, the CU letter distorts basic facts concerning \n     occupant safety and vehicle weight. The evidence is \n     overwhelming that the lightest passenger vehicles (which \n     consume less fuel per mile) offer much less protection to \n     their occupants than heavier vehicles (which consume more \n     fuel per mile). It also turns out that the safety benefits to \n     vehicle occupants diminish as vehicles get heavier and \n     heavier, so we don't have to choose the heaviest passenger \n     vehicles to get good crash protection. Still, we should \n     avoid the lightest ones.\n       It is sometimes claimed that the high crash risks for \n     occupants of light vehicles are entirely due to the adverse \n     consequences of collisions with heavier passenger vehicles \n     and, therefore, it is the heavy vehicles that are the \n     problem. It is correct that heavier vehicles increase the \n     risks for occupants of light vehicles in two-vehicle crashes, \n     but this effect makes only a relatively small contribution to \n     the high risks for light car occupants. Our October 30, 1999 \n     newsletter, Status Report (enclosed), pointed out in an \n     article on crash compatibility that almost 60 percent of the \n     deaths of occupants of the lightest cars (\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1775-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, I rise to address the issue of \nderivatives. The name itself would almost put people to sleep; the \ndetails of it are very complicated. It is a process that is done by \nmajor corporations, which is what brings it to our attention at the \nmoment. Unfortunately, the proposition that is before us is an answer \nlooking for a problem. It is not a solution to what has happened.\n  Enron has raised many concerns regarding the state of our energy \nmarkets. However, as investigations into the collapse of the company \nare showing, the failure of Enron was likely due to unethical and \npossibly illegal accounting techniques used by executives at the \ncompany. We need to make one thing clear: The trading of energy \nderivatives had nothing to do with the collapse of Enron. In fact, \nEnron's trading platform was one of the most lucrative parts of the \ncompany.\n  Enron is not an accounting problem; it is not a business problem. It \nis probably a fraud problem.\n  During debate on the Commodities Futures and Modernization Act, we \nexamined extensively the oversight and regulation of energy \nderivatives. It was done the right way. It was done with hearings, with \ncommittee markup, with floor debate. This has been brought directly to \nthe floor. It has bypassed the other processes.\n  What we concluded using the correct process was the proper amount of \noversight for a new and emerging business. We did the debate on the \nCommodities Futures and Modernization Act, and we examined extensively \nthe oversight and regulation of the energy derivatives--the way it is \nsupposed to be done. What we concluded was the proper amount of \noversight for a new and emerging business had been put into law.\n  If we start to regulate an industry that is in its infancy, we run \nthe risk of stifling competition and reducing the possibility of it \nreaching its full potential.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified last week before \nthe Senate Banking Committee. I want to echo a few of his comments \nregarding the regulation of energy derivatives.\n  Chairman Greenspan said it was crucially important that we allow \nthose types of markets to evolve amongst professionals who are most \ncapable of protecting themselves far better than either we, the Fed, \nCFTC, or the OCC could conceivably do. The important issue is that \nthere is a significant downside if we regulate where we do not have to \nin this area. Because one of the major--and indeed the primary--areas \nfor regulation and protection of the system is counter-party \nsurveillance--that the individual private parties, looking at the \neconomic events of the status of the people with whom they are doing \nbusiness. . . . We've got to allow that system to work, because if we \nstep in as government regulators, we will remove a considerable amount \nof the caution that is necessary to allow those markets to evolve. And \nwhile it may appear sensible to go in and regulate, all of our \nexperience is that there is a significant downside when you do not \nallow counter-party surveillance to function in an appropriate manner.\n  I think we are glazing the eyes over here, but essentially Mr. \nGreenspan said it is too early to do anything based on the act that we \nalready did.\n  Selling derivatives is a way for companies that can't afford risk to \npass it on to companies that are willing. We have done that for a long \ntime in the insurance business. This is another form of corporate \ninsurance.\n  There is no indication that trading of energy derivatives contributed \nin any way to the collapse of Enron. However, if, in fact, Members \nthink we need to look at legislation in this area, we should examine it \nin a reasonable process--not by offering on the floor amendments to a \nnewly enacted piece of legislation. I certainly appreciate and respect \nMembers' attention to examining the energy markets, but we should take \nthat through the committee process so Members have a chance to hear \ntestimony and pose questions to experts in this area.\n  It is a difficult area; it is a complicated area. Supporters of this \namendment claim that Enron has such a large market share of this \nbusiness that they were able to provide undue influence over the energy \ntrading.\n  To the contrary, during and after the collapse of Enron, there were \nno interruptions of trading. Other market participants stepped in and \nassumed volume. There were no price swings or collapses of the energy \nmarket. This is a perfect example of market forces working the way they \nwere intended.\n  The CFMA provided legal certainty for commercial parties not executed \non futures exchanges--legal certainty, taking away some of the risk, \nselling some of the risk. This amendment could be interpreted to cover \nall transactions between commercial parties conducted either by e-mail \nor over the phone. The effect of this amendment would likely be \ndecreased market liquidity because of increased legal and transactional \nuncertainties. Additionally, energy companies may be discouraged from \nusing derivatives to hedge price risks. This could result in more price \nvolatility in energy markets, which will hurt the very consumers the \nlegislation seeks to help.\n  This amendment would also require electronic trading exchanges to set \naside capital, even if they do not participate in trading. For \ninstance, the Intercontinental Exchange allows buyers and sellers of \nenergy derivatives to exchange offers through an electronic program. \nThis exchange is already regulated by the CFTC and gives the CFTC \naccess to its trading screens. This amendment would require the \nIntercontinental Exchange to set aside capital, even though it only \nfacilitates transactions and does not trade. This requirement could \nforce ICE to cease operations--forcing buyers and sellers of energy \nderivatives into the over-the-counter market. This is why CFTC Chairman \nNewsome has said the CFTC does not require this new authority.\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\n  Because of my concern for this issue, I recently wrote to the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission to get his views \nregarding this amendment. Mr. Pitt responded:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission believes this \n     legislative change is premature at this time.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            United States Security\n\n\n                                      and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     proposed amendment #2989 (Congressional Record, March 7, \n     2002, p. S1685), introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein and \n     others, to S. 517, the pending Senate energy legislation. \n     This amendment would repeal key provisions enacted as part of \n     the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (P.L. 106-534) \n     applicable to over-the-counter derivatives contracts in \n     certain energy products.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission believes this \n     legislative change is premature at this time--barely more \n     than a year after the CFMA's enactment. Because of on-going \n     federal investigations, the lack of rigorous analysis about \n     the CFMA's effect on the derivatives markets as a whole, and \n     the absence of a determination about what role (if any) over-\n     the-counter derivatives played in the collapse of Enron or \n     the California energy crisis of last summer, we do not \n     believe that any action should be taken until all of the \n     facts are available for evaluation.\n       Thank you for giving the Commission an opportunity to \n     comment on this legislative proposal.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Harvey L. Pitt,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask that Members step back and, if there is a problem, \nlet's address it in a responsible manner through the normal process. \nLet's begin to hold hearings on energy trading, and after we have had \ntime to evaluate what we have learned, we can look forward to a \nreasonable solution. This is too early and takes away the opportunity \nto sell off risk by some other companies. I ask for you to defeat the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1776-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I refer my colleagues to an incident \nthat has perhaps occurred without the knowledge of those who are \nlamenting that our dependence on imported oil has been relieved \nsomewhat because prices are down.\n  I call to the attention of my colleagues the fact that oil is now at \na 6-month high. It is over $24.50 a barrel and going up. It is the \nhighest in 6 months. This is caused by the cartel called OPEC and its \ncommitment to maintain a price level somewhere between $22 and $28. \nThey do that by addressing the supply of oil on the world market.\n  Another very significant event occurred yesterday. This event was the \nresponse of Saddam Hussein to a request from the United Nations that \ninspectors again be allowed into Iraq. Saddam Hussein in effect told us \nto take a hike. He refused to allow inspectors into his country. We \nhave not had inspectors in there in over 2 years.\n  What does this mean? It is in the eyes of the beholder, but clearly \nhe has made his call. The next call has to be made by our President and \nthe U.N. Are we going to force our inspectors to go into Iraq? What are \nthe circumstances surrounding this issue?\n  One can conjecture that if we look at bin Laden, at the al-Qaida, we \nwill wish we would have taken action prior to what occurred in \nassociation with the terrorist attacks on New York at the Twin Towers, \nthe Pentagon, and the situation we are in of fighting terrorism. Could \nwe have initiated an action sooner?\n  We could have, but we didn't. In the case of Iraq, the recognition \nthat we all are very much aware that Saddam Hussein is proceeding with \nweapons of mass destruction, many of my colleagues perhaps saw the CNN \nhour program the night before last on Iraq, the fact that he is using \npoison gas on some of his own people; that he has developed mass \ndestruction weapons with warheads that obviously have biological as \nwell as perhaps nuclear capability, clearly a delivery system that \nwould take them from Iraq to Israel, one has to wonder just when we are \ngoing to address this reality and how we are going to do it.\n  I won't belabor my point other than to try and draw some attention to \nthe fact that, indeed, it is a time for alarm. This is a time when the \nUnited States is importing from Iraq nearly 800,000 barrels of oil a \nday. As we reflect on how to relieve that increasing dependence, how do \nMembers reflect upon just how serious a threat Saddam Hussein is to \npeace in the western world? How do we address our concern over the \nreality that he has weapons of mass destruction? How are we going to \nreflect on just how we are going to reduce our dependence on oil from \nthe Mideast when we look to the Saddam Husseins of this world to \nprovide us with our needed oil as opposed to developing oil reserves \nhere at home, either in the Gulf of Mexico or in the State of Alaska?\n  This is a factor we will have to face because at some point in time, \nclearly, we will have to address the threat of Iraq and Saddam Hussein. \nIt is my hope that we can somehow prevail on getting inspectors in \nthere and relieving this threat. Saddam Hussein has clearly told us \notherwise. He told us yesterday to go take a hike.\n  I know the beliefs of the Chair with regard to the national security \ninterests of our Nation as we continue to depend on unstable sources \nfor our energy. I wish that more Members would concern themselves with \nthis threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1776-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN MEMORY OF TECHNICAL SERGEANT JOHN A. CHAPMAN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the heroic \nlife of Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman, whose family is from \nWindber, PA. Sergeant Chapman, who was buried today, was killed on \nMonday, March 4th, during a fierce firefight after his helicopter was \nshot down by al-Qaida fighters in Afghanistan.\n  Sgt. Chapman, who was only 36 years old, is survived by Valerie, his \nwife of 10 years, and by their 2 young daughters, Madison age 5, and \nBrianna age 3. While I know that this loss is devastating to the entire \nChapman family, I can confidently say to Sgt. Chapman's two young \ndaughters that their daddy died for a great cause and that this cause \nwas to protect the world and this Nation against evil people. These \npeople seek to destroy the very foundation of our country which allows \nall of us to be free and safe and prosperous.\n  As a Nation, we have been very fortunate in recent years; we have not \nhad to face many casualties while defending our freedom. The death of \nSgt Chapman and the seven other servicemen killed last week really hit \nhome. These losses are painful, but this war has a real purpose, and a \nreal national security implication. In my mind, the sacrifice made by \nthese men is as important as any made during the great wars that we \nhave fought in the past. We never like to lose even a single life. Each \ncasualty we read about in the newspapers means the world to someone who \nhas lost a father, a brother, or a friend. I grieve with the Chapman \nfamily and all of the families that have made this ultimate sacrifice, \nbut it is important to remember that they did not die in vain. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with the Chapmans as they go through this \ndifficult time. Sgt. Chapman died to protect the core values which \ndefine our country, and we will always remember him as a hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1776-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1776-S1777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The week of March 18th in Greenville, SC, The \nGreenville Hospital System Children's Hospital is celebrating Children \nand Healthcare Week with a number of valuable activities for health \ncare professionals, parents, and community partners.\n  The activities are aimed at increasing public, parental, and \nprofessional knowledge of the improvements that can be made in \npediatric health care. In particular, it stresses new ways to meet the \nemotional and developmental needs of children in health care settings. \nAmong the scheduled events are: continuing education classes for \nmedical residents and support staff, an awards ceremony to honor local \nindividuals who have dedicated their lives to pediatric care, a special \ntribute service to honor children, and a family event for employees. \nLack of quality health care should never be an impediment to the long-\nterm success of our nation's children, and I commend Greenville's \ndedication to Children and Healthcare Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1777-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1777-S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month. This time has been appropriately designated to reflect \nupon the important contributions and heroic sacrifices that women have \nmade to our Nation and to consider the challenges they continue to \nface. Throughout our history, women have been at the forefront of every \nimportant movement for a better and more just society, and they have \nbeen the foundation of our families and communities.\n  In Maryland, we are proud to honor those women who have given so much \nto improve our lives. Their achievements illustrate their courage and \ntenacity in conquering overwhelming obstacles. They include Margaret \nBrent, who became America's first woman lawyer and landholder, and \nHarriet Tubman, who risked her own life to lead hundreds of slaves to \nfreedom through the Underground Railroad. Dr. Helen Taussig, another \ngreat Marylander, developed the first successful medical procedure to \nsave ``blue babies'' by repairing heart birth defects. Her efforts laid \nthe groundwork for modern heart surgery. We are all indebted to Mary \nElizabeth Garrett and Martha Carey Thomas who donated money to create \nJohns Hopkins Medical School on the condition that women be admitted. \nAnd jazz music would not be complete without the unforgettable voice of \njazz singer Billie Holiday who also hailed from Baltimore City. Their \naccomplishments and talent provide inspiration not only to Marylanders, \nbut to people all over the globe.\n  My good friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \nis a tremendous example of the commitment and dedication women give to \npublic service. From her background as a social worker to her election \nto the U.S. Senate, Senator Mikulski, who has served longer than any \nother woman currently in the Senate has always worked to ensure all \npeople are treated fairly. She appropriately played a key role in \nestablishing this month when in 1981, she cosponsored a resolution \nestablishing National Women's History Week, a predecessor to Women's \nHistory Month. Today, I wish to honor her dedication and service to the \npeople of Maryland and this Nation.\n  While we recognize famous women, it is important that we acknowledge \nthe contributions of others who daily touch our lives: Our favorite \nteacher who gives us the confidence and knowledge to know that we were \ncapable of success; the single mother or grandmother who toiled at a \nlow-paying job for years to guarantee that the next generation in her \nfamily received better education and career opportunities; and the \nprofessional women who volunteer the little spare time they have to \nread to children or speak to student groups, inspiring young people to \naim for goals beyond what they may have otherwise imagined.\n  Women's History Month is a fitting time to honor the women of the \nArmed Services who risk their lives in our fight against terrorism. \nFrom the American Revolution and the Civil War through modern day armed \nconflict, American women have sacrificed next to their husbands, sons, \nbrothers and fathers to preserve the freedom upon which this Nation was \nfounded. Currently, more than 6,000 women in the Armed Services are \ncourageously fighting in our war against terrorism and almost 15 \npercent of the 1.4 million soldiers volunteering in our military are \nwomen. These modern day heroines, giving of their time, knowledge, and \nlives should not be taken for granted.\n  Women have made great strides in overcoming historic adversity and \nbias but they still face many obstacles. Unequal pay, poverty, \ninadequate access to healthcare and violent crime are among the \nchallenges that continue to disproportionately affect women. Working \nwomen earn 74 cents to every dollar earned by men. What is more \ntroubling is that the more education a woman has, the wider the wage \ngap. According to a recent Census Bureau report, the average American \nwoman loses approximately $523,000 in wages and benefits over a \nlifetime because of wage inequality. Families with a female head of \nhousehold have the highest poverty rate and comprise the majority of \npoor families.\n  Women continue to be under-represented in high-paying professions and \nlag significantly behind men in enrollment in science programs. A \nrecent General Accounting Office study found that, after controlling \nfor education, age and race, women managers still earned less than \nfull-time male managers. Increasing the number of senior level women in \nall fields begins with encouraging girls' interest and awareness in \nschool illustrating that their options are limitless.\n  As our population ages, we must also address the special challenges \nof older women. Women live an average of 6 years longer than men. \nConsequently, their reduced pay is even more detrimental given their \nincreased life expectancy as they are forced to live on less money for \na longer period of time. In addition, more women over age 65 tend to \nlive alone at a time when illness and accidents due to decreased \nmobility are more likely. For these women, it is imperative that we \nguarantee that Social Security and Medicare remain solvent for future \ngenerations.\n  I believe we should use this month as an opportunity to reflect not \nonly on the achievements and challenges of American women, but to \nrecognize those of women internationally. We know that a variety of \nills hinder the potential of women in many parts of the world, labor \npractices that oppress women and girls, the rapid spread of HIV and \nAIDS, and limited or non-existence suffrage rights. We must broaden \naccess to education, the political process, and reproductive health \nglobally so that girls and women everywhere can maximize their options. \nTo have a credible voice in the international arena, the United States \nmust lead by example, showing that American women enjoy these rights \nfully.\n  During my service in Congress, I have strongly supported efforts to \naddress women's issues and eradicate gender discrimination and \ninequality. I have co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would \nprovide more effective remedies to victims of wage discrimination on \nthe basis of sex. I have also supported the Equity in Prescription \nInsurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act, which would prohibit health \ninsurance plans from excluding or restricting benefits for prescription \ncontraception if the plan covers other prescription drugs. In order to \nbuild a national repository of the contributions of women to our \nNation's history, I co-sponsored legislation to establish a National \nMuseum of Women's History Advisory Committee. In addition, I remain a \nconsistent supporter of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution. \nI am proud of these efforts and I will continue my commitment to bring \nfuller equality to all women.\n  While obstacles remain, women have achieved impressive progress. This\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\ngood news includes a decline in the poverty rate for single women and \nan increase in those holding advanced degrees. Recent figures show \nwomen received approximately 45 percent of law and 42 percent of \nmedical degrees awarded in this country. This is a dramatic improvement \nfrom a few decades ago and should continue as more and more women enter \nprofessional programs.\n  In my home State of Maryland, as in the Nation, women are a guiding \nforce and a major presence in our national business sector. From 1987 \nto 1999, the number of women-owned firms in the United States grew by \n103 percent. Women were responsible for 80 percent of the total \nenrollment growth at Maryland colleges and universities throughout the \nlast two decades.\n  Indeed women continue to make great progress. As we highlight their \naccomplishments in history this month, I believe it is also important \nto educate present and future generations about gender discrimination \nso that we do not repeat past mistakes. America must remain vigilant in \neradicating these injustices. I am confident that the women of America \nwill lead this journey and continue to exemplify and advocate for those \nvalues and ideals which are at the heart of a decent, caring and fair \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1778-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1778-S1780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, history has shown us that a Nation \ndedicated to equal rights for women and girls is a more prosperous \nNation, a healthier Nation, a more educated Nation, a more just Nation, \na more peaceful Nation, and a more democratic Nation. Today I rise once \nagain to add my voice and stand in solidarity with women and girls \naround the world in their struggle for basic human rights. I rise to \ncommemorate March 8, 2002, International Women's Day.\n  Until the entire world recognizes the simple fact expressed by my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Clinton, that ``women's rights are human \nrights'' we must continue to raise awareness about the plight of women \nand girls around the world and in our own country. Indeed, while I have \nbeen encouraged by the gains made since the United Nations first \ndesignated March 8 as International Women's Day in 1975, there is still \na great deal of work ahead of us and I would like to take this time to \ndiscuss several critical issues that I believe are vital to the lives \nof women and girls and require U.S. leadership: international family \nplanning assistance, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women, CEDAW, rape as an instrument of war, and \nthe plight of women in Afghanistan.\n  Each of us, I believe, understands very well the issue of United \nStates assistance to international family planning organizations. There \nhave been few issues in recent years that have been more debated, with \npeople of good intentions on both sides of the issue. Consequently, I \nwas dismayed that the Bush Administration considered withholding the \n$34 million U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Fund, \nUNFPA, an amount allocated to it by law and, after months of \nnegotiations, and with bipartisan support. I wrote to President Bush \nurging him not to withhold the funds as such a decision would be a \nserious mistake and a blow to U.S. leadership in combating \noverpopulation.\n  You simply cannot deny the importance of family planning assistance, \nespecially for the very poor. There are now more than 6 billion people \non this Earth. The United Nations estimates this figure could be 12 \nbillion by the year 2050. Almost all of this growth will occur in the \nplaces least able to bear up under the pressures of massive population \nincreases. The brunt will be in developing countries lacking the \nresources needed to provide basic health or education services.\n  Let us strive to ensure that women have access to the educational and \nmedical resources they need to control their reproductive destinies and \ntheir health so that they will be able to better their own lives and \nthe lives of their families\n  Everyone should recognize that international family planning programs \nreduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards around the \nworld; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine \nthe number and spacing of their children.\n  We must counter the attacks made by the anti-choice wing of the \nRepublican party in recent years and make it perfectly clear that no \nU.S. international family planning funds are spent on international \nabortion.\n  It is worth noting that the Department of State recognized the vital \nrole of the UNFPA in family planning assistance and provided $600,000 \nto the Fund for sanitary supplies, clean undergarments, and emergency \ninfant delivery kits for Afghan refugees in Iran, Uzbekistan, and \nTajikistan. This is just one of many examples of UNFPA's commitment to \nbettering the lives of women and children around the world.\n  Since the debate is unlikely to end, we must work harder to ensure \nthat the United States reclaims its leadership role on international \nfamily planning and reproductive issues. On International Women's Day, \nI urge my colleagues to support full funding for the UNFPA and other \ninternational family planning programs.\n  Another year has gone by and I am saddened and disappointed to note \nthat the Senate still has not acted on the Convention to Eliminate All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women. It has been more than twenty \nyears since the United States actively participated in drafting the \nConvention and President Carter signed it on July 17, 1980. Yet, we are \nstill waiting for the United States, the lone superpower and champion \nof democracy and human rights, to take a stand for the rights of women \nand girls and ratify the convention.\n  Notably absent from the list of 161 countries who have ratified the \nconvention, the United States joins a rather dubious club of non-\nratifiers: Iran, North Korea, and Sudan. Surely this is not the company \nwe want to keep. Surely we want to be known as a leader when it comes \nto defending the human rights of women and girl who are unable to \ndefend themselves.\n  Do we want to be the lone democracy not to ratify? Do we want to \nwatch China, the People's Republic of Laos, and Iraq, countries we \nregularly censure for human rights abuses and who have either signed or \nagreed in principle, pass us by?\n  There is no reasonable justification for our failure to act. Is the \nconvention a technically demanding agreement requiring years of study \nand investigation? Does it ask the United States to go far beyond our \nown goals and ideals? Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Here is what the convention says: It requires States to take all \nappropriate steps to eliminate discrimination against women in \npolitical and public life, law, education, employment, health care, \ncommercial transactions, and domestic relations. Nothing more, nothing \nless. Simplicity is the hallmark of this agreement.\n  Every day that goes by without ratification, we further risk losing \nour moral right to lead in the human rights revolution. By ratifying \nthe convention, we will demonstrate our commitment to promoting \nequality and to protecting women's rights throughout the world. By \nratifying the convention, we will send a strong message to the \ninternational community that the U.S. understands the problems posed by \ndiscrimination against women, and we will not abide by it. By ratifying \nthe convention, we reestablish our credentials as a leader on human \nrights and women's rights.\n  As we commemorate International Women's Day, I call on my colleagues \nin the Senate to move forward and ratify the convention on \ndiscrimination against women.\n  Eliminating the use of rape as an instrument of war must be a high \npriority for the United States and the international community. It is \nan issue that continues to cause me great concern.\n  We have seen in recent years how rape has moved from being an \nisolated by-product of war to a tool used to advance war aims. In \nBosnia, Rwanda, and East Timor soldiers and militiamen used rape on a \norganized, systematic, and sustained basis to further their goal of \nethnic cleansing. In some cases, women were kidnaped, interned in camps \nand houses, forced to do labor, and subjected frequent rape and sexual \nassault.\n  Something had to be done and so I was pleased that the United \nNations, in\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nsetting up the war crime tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda, \nrecognized rape as a war crime and a crime against humanity.\n  Finally, on February 22, 2001, following a period of inaction when it \nappeared that those indicted for perpetrating these crimes would not be \nbrought to justice, the international tribunal in The Hague sentenced \nthree Bosnian Serbs to prison for rape during the Bosnian war. I was \nvery pleased the court took this step but we still have a long ways to \ngo. Estimates are that up to 20,000 women in Yugoslavia were \nsystematically raped as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and \ngenocide. Many perpetrators still remain at large.\n  Nevertheless, the court has stated loud and clear that those who use \nrape as an instrument of war will no longer be able to escape justice. \nThey will be arrested, tried, and convicted. As Judge Florence Mumba of \nZambia stated, ``Lawless opportunists should expect no mercy, no matter \nhow low their position in the chain of command may be.''\n  I commend the victims who courageously came forward to confront their \nattackers and offer testimony that helped lead to the convictions. I am \nhopeful more will come forward. On International Women's Day, I urge \nthe administration and the international community to join me in \ncontinuing the fight to end the practice of rape as an instrument of \nwar, and to pursue justice for its victims.\n  For years when I addressed the condition of women and girls in \nAfghanistan, I did so with a sense of sadness, anger, and despair. I \nnow do so with a sense of optimism, hope, and determination.\n  One of the great stories of our campaign against terrorism is the \nliberation of the women and girls of Afghanistan from the chains \nimposed on them by the Taliban regime. We all know the story of how \nwomen and girls were treated: banned from work and school, confined to \ntheir homes behind darkened windows, and required to wear full-length \nveils, or burka, and to be accompanied by a male relative when in \npublic.\n  Now, the women of Afghanistan, who have suffered under brutal regimes \nand seen their families destroyed by war, are beginning to leave their \nhomes without fear, earn a living, receive desperately needed medical \nattention, get an education, and participate in public life. I am \nespecially pleased that Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, \npicked two women to serve in his Cabinet. It is a welcome change from \nthe past and a step toward equal rights for all Afghans.\n  Clearly, there is much work to be done to improve the lives of women \nand girls in Afghanistan and the United States must be actively \ninvolved in that endeavor. I was proud to co-sponsor S. 1573, the \n``Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001,'' which authorized the \nPresident to provide educational and health care assistance for the \nwomen and children living in Afghanistan and as refugees in neighboring \ncountries. President Bush signed the bill into law on December 12, \n2001. This is the first step of a long journey and I urge my colleagues \nto stay the course and support additional assistance in the coming \nyears ahead.\n  On International Women's Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to a \nbetter future for the women and girls of Afghanistan. We must let them \nknow that they are no longer alone, that we will stand by their side, \nand we will not abandon them again.\n  We must debate and ratify the convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and \nour resources to international family planning programs. We must not \nignore the use of rape as an instrument of war. We must help the women \nand girls of Afghanistan realize their hopes and dreams.\n  We cannot afford to remain silent. We cannot afford to place women's \nrights on a second tier of concern of U.S. foreign policy. On \nInternational Women's Day, the United States and the international \ncommunity must take a strong stand and issue a clear warning to those \nwho attempt to rob women of basic rights that the world's governments \nwill no longer ignore these abuses, or allow them to continue without \nrepercussion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as we celebrate National Women's History \nmonth, I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary women, past and \npresent, who have shaped the rich history of our great Nation.\n  The month of March has been designated as National Women's History \nmonth to celebrate the remarkable accomplishments of women throughout \nhistory. My distinguished colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski and \nSenator Orrin Hatch, cosponsored legislation over 20 years ago \ndeclaring National Women's History Week. I salute my colleagues for \ntheir leadership in establishing this now month-long celebration of the \nmany contributions made by women.\n  This year's national theme, ``Women Sustaining the American Spirit,'' \ncould not be more appropriate. Our Nation prides itself on the \naccomplishments of women and their ability to fully participate in our \nsociety. I have the distinct privilege of working with 13 women \nSenators who are powerful examples of the progress that our Nation has \nmade. This spirit of democracy was tested on September 11, when we were \nreminded that our ideals continue to threaten those who fear the \ninevitability of progress.\n  As a consequence of these events, Americans were exposed to the \ndisturbing plight of women in other parts of the world. We learned that \nunder the oppressive Taliban regime, women could not work outside the \nhome and were denied basic rights such as access to education and \nhealth care. Not only were women precluded from contributing to \nsociety, but they were denied equal protection under the law.\n  The attacks faced by our country were aimed at undermining the great \nstrides we have made in our history. Yet the rest of the world watched \nas our Nation united and demonstrated that even a devastating attack \ncould not crush our spirit--an American spirit that has been molded by \nthe accomplishments of women throughout our history, including the \nlegacy left by a well-known Illinois woman.\n  Jane Addams of Chicago, IL, was a socially conscious community leader \nwho worked tirelessly to sustain the American spirit. Addams founded \nthe famous Hull House settlement in Chicago in 1889, where she and \nother residents provided services for the surrounding neighborhood. \nThese vital services included kindergarten and daycare facilities for \nchildren of working mothers, an employment bureau, medical care, legal \naid, and vocational skills. After a few short years, the settlement was \nserving over 2,000 people a week.\n  Despite the enormous success of her charitable efforts, Addams \nrealized that real gains could not be achieved without working to \nchange laws for the better. To achieve this goal, Addams lobbied the \nState of Illinois to examine laws governing child labor, the factory \ninspection system, and the juvenile justice system.\n  As we celebrate the contributions that women have made, the legacy of \nJane Addams reminds us of the continuing need for improvement in the \nareas of social reform that she worked so tirelessly on several years \nago. Today, parents rely on childcare arrangements more than ever. The \nChildren's Defense Fund reports that an estimated 13 million children \nunder the age of 6 spend part of their day in the care of someone other \nthan their parents. In Illinois, 61 percent of all children under the \nage of 6 have working parents. Yet working families at all income \nlevels still struggle to find the high-quality care their children need \nat a cost that is affordable. Full day care can cost between $4,000 and \n$10,000 per year, frequently surpassing average tuition costs for \npublic universities. At the same time, the Children's Defense Fund \nreports that more than one out of four families with young children \nearns less than $25,000 per year.\n  Today, parents also encounter a childcare system that is an uneven \nand inadequate patchwork of services. States and cities vary widely in \nthe areas of provider education and training requirements, \navailability, and quality of programs. The gap between what we know is \nso important for children and what we put into practice is too large. \nAs a nation, we have an interest in healthy, successful children who \nhave the tools they need to learn in the classroom.

Madam President, today I commend the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica on the anniversary of its 90th year of operation.\n  The objective of the Girl Scouts is ``to discover the fun, \nfriendship, and power of girls together.'' Experiences such as field \ntrips, community service, and working with others help them to develop \ntheir full potential. These actions are greatly needed in America and \nan amazing feat when you consider that 99 percent of all adults that \nparticipate in leading the Girl Scouts are volunteers. The effects of \nthis organization extend not from one generation but to many, with the \noldest active member being 97, and the youngest, the new Brownie, \nstarting out at age 5.\n  The Girl Scouts is a quintessential American institution that has \nexported its successful strategy to 140 countries, and a worldwide \nfamily of 8.5 million girls. The Girl Scouts participate in cultural \nexchanges that allow many to gather worldwide experiences that they \notherwise would not have been able to attain. There is even a bi-\npartisan Troop Capitol, made up of Congressional members from both the \nSenate and House. The women of the Senate have dedicated the book Nine \nand Counting to the girls of America, with some of the proceeds going \nto the Girl Scouts.\n  The GSA has spent much of its time teaching young women about \nprofessional fields that do not ordinarily attract women. The past \nyear's focus was the field of engineering. The girls not only studied \nengineering but also had the opportunity for a hands-on approach, \nthanks to the Society of Women Engineers donating their time. Girls \nsucceed when we set the bar high for them. The Girl Scouts gives them \nthe skills, but more importantly the confidence, to reach these goals \nand beyond.\n  We must thank Juliette Gordon Low, who on this day in 1912 founded \nthe Girl Scouts. Her desire and foresight to create an organization for \nyoung girls started with 18 girls and a budget that was funded by \nselling her pearl necklace. It has become one of the most recognized \norganizations in America.\n  Though some traditions thankfully remain steadfast, notably the \nexceptional Thin Mint cookies, the GSA has evolved to address the \nevents of the day. From Women's Suffrage to Civil Rights to the \nenvironment, this organization has not backed away from taking a stand \non the issues. They have an amazing past and a bright future. I am sure \nthey will continue to be a force to be reckoned with, a positive force \nshaping the lives of tomorrow's leaders. Congratulations to the Girl \nScouts and thank you to all those who have contributed their time, \nenergy, and love to making this organization an American success story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1780-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY CHEERLEADING SQUAD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I have the privilege and \nhonor of sharing with my fellow colleagues the most recent and \nastounding accomplishment of the University of Kentucky Cheerleading \nsquad. This year the UK Cheerleaders won their eighth straight \nUniversal Cheerleaders Association's, UCA's, National College \nCheerleading Championship for NCAA Division 1-A schools. These young \nmen and women deserve our recognition and admiration for their efforts.\n  The UK squad has now won UCA's National Championship an unprecedented \ntwelve times, in 1985, 1987, 1988, 1992, and 1995-2002, more than any \nother Division 1-A school. In fact they are the only squad to ever win \nback to back championships twice and also the only team to win three, \nfour, five, six, seven, and now eight titles in a row. They are widely \nrecognized as the best of the best in the Cheerleading community and \nhave been a key contributor to the University's athletic success. The \nWildcat basketball team is arguably the most storied program in the \nNation and much of their success can be attributed to the enthusiasm \nand spirit generated by the Cheerleading squad. For those who have \nnever had the opportunity of seeing a game in Rupp Arena, I can tell \nyou that the atmosphere is absolutely electric.\n  Besides the attention they receive on the court from the UK students \nand fans, the Cheerleading squad has also been covered by the national \nmedia. The squad has been featured on such programs as, ``Evening \nNews,'' Connie Chung's ``Eye to Eye,'' and the ``CBS Morning Show,'' as \nwell as in ``Southern Living,'' ``Gentlemen's Quarterly,'' ``ESPN the \nMagazine,'' and ``Seventeen'' magazines. This recognition does not come \nwithout a price however. These young men and women sacrifice a \nconsiderable amount of their time and energy practicing, learning, and \nmastering their extremely difficult routines. This often means long \npractices and endless hours in the weight room. These young men and \nwomen are athletes in every sense of the word.\n  I applaud the University of Kentucky Cheerleading squad for their \ncommitment and dedication to their goals and dreams. They represent the \nUniversity and the Commonwealth of Kentucky in a classy and \nprofessional manner. I am proud of each and every one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1780-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1780-S1781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ESSEX FELLS CELEBRATES CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, it is with great pride that I \nbring to your attention a lovely hamlet in Essex County, NJ, Essex \nFells, which is celebrating its centennial year on March 31, 2002. \nIncorporated as a borough on March 31, 1902, it is governed by an \nelected body consisting of a mayor and six council members.\n  Essex Fells is the smallest community in Essex County, covering an \narea of a little more than 1.3 square miles. However, within the small \nconfines of this bucolic community, Essex Fells maintains many areas \nfor the enjoyment of its residents. The Glen is a green open space that \ncontains native trees, shrubs, vines, and flowers. The Trotter Tract is \nan 83-acre area that is home to many species of flora and fauna and \nbeautiful nature trails. Each autumn, the brook that runs through Essex \nFells is dammed to crate a skating pond. Grover Cleveland Park, a \ncounty park of approximately 42 acres of lush manicured lawns and large \ntrees, borders Essex Fells and Caldwell, NJ.\n  Rich in history, the township was established in 1699 by Robert Treat \nand Jasper Crane and settled by people migrating from Connecticut. A \nland blessed with rolling farmland and wooded retreats, the acreage was \noriginally named Newark after their home in England--Newark on Trent. \nShortly after that, the settlers petitioned the crown for the title to \ntheir new homeland. It was granted and in 1701 the settlers purchased \nan additional 13,500 acres from the Native Americans for $325,000. \nRealizing the value of this land, the Crown attempted to rescind the \nsettlers' title and the colonists subsequently revolted earning the \narea the nickname, ``the cockpit of the American Revolution.''\n  In the late 1800s, Anthony J. Drexel, of the Philadelphia banking \nfamily, who had successfully developed other residential communities \nacquired the estate of General William Gould to form a planned \nresidential community. Named for Drexel's son-in-law--John R. Fell and \nthe county, Essex--Essex Fells developed as many turn of the century \ncommunities did, as a direct result of the growth of the railroad \nsystem. All the same, much care was given to maintain the tranquility \nand serenity of the original community.\n  One hundred years later, Essex Fells is still an ideal ``small town \ncommunity.'' The neighborhoods remain tree-lined and neighbors know \neach other. Most recently, citizens of Essex Fells were called into \nservice following the horrific attacks on the World Trade Center. Fire \nChief Rupert Hauser and\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\nthe Essex Fells Volunteer Fire Department immediately deployed to New \nYork to cover station houses for New York firefighters while they \nworked at Ground Zero on the search and rescue efforts.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mayor Edward \nAbbott and the citizens of Essex Fells on their centennial. May they \nhave another hundred years of prosperity and community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1781-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TWO CALIFORNIA TEAMS ON CHAMPIONS DAY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I would like to honor two \nnational collegiate championship teams from my State of California. \nThey are great examples of team spirit and cooperation: the Santa Clara \nUniversity women's soccer team and the Stanford University women's \nvolleyball team.\n  The Santa Clara University women's soccer team won the 2001 NCAA \nCollege Cup Championship this past fall. The team won its first \nnational title in their fifth trip to the College Cup, and this is the \nfirst outright NCAA championship in the school's history.\n  The members of the 2001 Santa Clara University women's soccer team \nare: Holly Azevedo; Jessica Ballweg; Emma Borst; Lana Bowen; Jaclyn \nCampi; Kristi Candau; Ynez Carrasco; Kerry Cathcart; Devvyn Hawkins; \nBree Horvath; Anna Kraus; Leslie Osborne; Erin Pearson; Chardonnay \nPoole; Erin Sharpe; Katie Sheppard; Danielle Slaton; Alyssa Sobolik; \nTaline Tahmassian; Allie Teague; Aly Wagner; and Veronica Zepeda.\n  I congratulate the team and their head coach, Jerry Smith.\n  The Stanford University women's volleyball team won the 2001 NCAA \nNational Championship this past fall. The team won its fifth national \nchampionship, which is a record.\n  The members of the 2001 Stanford University women's volleyball team \nare: Michelle Chambers; Tara Conrad; Sara Dukes; Leahi Hall; Jennifer \nHarvey; Jennifer Hucke; Ashley Ivy; Emily Lawrence; Robyn Lewis; Sara \nMcGee; Ogonna Nnamani; Anna Robinson; Sara Sandrik; and Logan Tom.\n  I congratulate the team and their head coach, John Dunning.\n  Both teams are an inspiration to all, especially to young women and \ngirls who are themselves members of sports teams.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe eligibility of certain expenses for the low-income housing credit; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill improve the effectiveness of one of the most effective programs we \nhave to help Americans get affordable housing, the Low Income Housing \nTax Credit. I am proud to be joined in this effort by my esteemed \ncolleagues Senator Hatch, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kerry and Senator \nTorricelli.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit was created in 1986 to attract \nprivate sector capital to the affordable housing market. It has been \nthe major engine for financing the production of low income multi-\nfamily housing. The program offers developers and investors in \naffordable housing credit against their Federal income tax in return \nfor their investment. Since its inception, the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit has assisted in the development and availability of roughly \n850,000 new and rehabilitated units of affordable housing.\n  Last fall, the Internal Revenue Service issued its first guidance in \nthe program's 16 year history. That guidance was issued in the form of \nseveral technical advice memoranda, or TAMs, and specified which \ndevelopment costs will be eligible and ineligible for the credit, known \nas eligible basis.\n  TAMs are not official guidance, reviewed by the Treasury Department, \nbut instead, IRS legal opinion providing direction to IRS agents \nconducting audits. They are not citable in court proceedings because \nthey are not official guidance. In the absence of official guidance, \nTAMs could be taken as the official government position. In fact, that \nis exactly what is happening. The IRS's position is contrary to common \nindustry practice, and eliminates many reasonable, legitimate and \nnecessary costs from the tax credit. This has caused uncertainty among \ninvestors as to whether the credits for which they have been paid, will \nbe realized. Moreover, these guidelines could adversely affect the \nability of States to target affordable housing to those who need it the \nmost.\n  It is important to understand, this legislation will not increase the \nnumber of low-income housing tax credits available. The maximum amount \nof credits that states may allocate to developers of affordable housing \nproperties is set by the Internal Revenue Code. Thanks to legislation \nthat we enacted in 2000, the amount available to each state has \nincreased from $1.50 to $1.75 times the State's population.\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nThat 40 percent increase is expected to produce about 30,000 more units \na year. Since the unmet demand for affordable housing is many times \ngreater than what can be built with the help of the credit, our \nlegislation should not affect revenues. In fact, the only way for this \nlegislation to have a revenue impact is if the legislation makes it \neasier for the States to use the credits we intend for them to have \nunder present law.\n  What this legislation does do, however, is very important. To \nunderstand its importance, it may be useful to have a little background \non how the low-income housing tax credit works.\n  In economic terms, the credit is equity financing which replaces a \nportion of debt that would otherwise be necessary to finance a \nproperty. By replacing debt, credits work to reduce interest costs. \nThis allows a property owner to offer lower rents than otherwise would \nbe the case.\n  The most unique feature of the program is that State Housing Finance \nAgencies award Federal tax credits to developers of rental housing. \nSince these agencies have considerable flexibility in how they \ndistribute the credits, developers compete for the limited number of \ntax credits by submitting project proposals. The Housing Finance \nAgencies rate the proposals, and allocate credits to individual \nproperties based on criteria provided in the Internal Revenue Code, and \non the State's particular housing needs and priorities.\n  The amount of credits a State may allocate to a particular property \nis also limited by the Internal Revenue Code. The limit is determined \nas percentage of the basis of a property. The basis is, generally \nspeaking, the costs of constructing a building that is part of an \naffordable housing project. Non-federally subsidized new construction \nmay receive a 9-percent credit. Existing buildings and new buildings \nreceiving other Federal subsidies may get a 4-percent credit.\n  The problem at hand is this. The IRS takes the position that certain \nconstruction costs should not be included in basis. This position makes \na large number of affordable housing properties financially infeasible, \nand weakens the economics of those that still pass minimum underwriting \nrequirements. The loss of equity would surely affect the properties \nthat serve the lowest income tenants, provide higher levels of service, \nor operate in high cost areas. The reason that this is problematic is \nsimple. Reducing the amount of credits does not reduce the development \ncosts. It merely removes a source of financing, forcing either higher \nrents or lower quality construction.\n  Apparently, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service \nagree that this is an issue worthy of review, as both agencies have \nincluded it in their business plan. As recently as this month, the IRS \nissued new guidance on one of the items addressed by the TAMs, but \nthere does not appear to be a full review of the effect of the \npositions set forth in the TAMs anytime soon.\n  This legislation would amend Section 42(d) of the Internal Revenue \nCode to specify that various associated development costs are to be \nincluded in eligible basis. In many cases, the largest item excluded \nfrom eligible basis under the TAMs is ``impact fees.'' Impact fees are \nfees required by the Government ``as a condition to the development'' \nand considered ineligible because they are one-time costs, unlike \nbuilding permits which need to be renewed each time a building is \nbuilt. These fees cover a wide range of infrastructure improvements \nincluding sewer lines, schools, and roads. Certainly, whether or not \nthey are includible in basis for the purpose of calculating the amount \nof tax credit, these costs will be incurred and will impact the \neconomics of the property. As I mentioned previously, the IRS has \nrecently addressed the inclusion of impact fees in eligible basis, but \nnot other costs directly related to building construction.\n  Other items that would be severely restricted or excluded from \neligible basis under the interpretations expressed in the TAMs are site \npreparation costs, development fees, professional fees related to \ndeveloping the property, and construction financing costs. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will clarify that any cost \nincurred in preparing a site which is reasonably related to the \ndevelopment of a qualified low income housing property, any reasonable \nfee paid to the developer, any professional fee relating to an item \nincludible in basis, and any cost of financing attributable to \nconstruction of the building is includible in basis for the purpose of \ncalculating the maximum amount of credit a state may allocate to a low-\nincome housing property.\n  The intent of these clarifications is simply to codify common \nindustry practice before the issuance of the TAMs. Not only will the \nlegislation allow the low-income tax credit program to provide better \nquality housing at lower rental rates than would be possible if the \npositions taken in the TAMs are followed, but clarification will help \nsimplify administration of the credit by giving both taxpayers and the \nInternal Revenue Service a clearer statement of the standards that \napply in calculating credit amounts.\n  Our economy is not doing as well as we would like, and there is a \nsignificant likelihood that we are going to need even more affordable \nhousing in the not too distant future. We should be proud that we \nincreased the amount of low-income housing tax credits that will be \navailable to help finance this housing. What we need to do now is to \nmake sure that these credits are used as efficiently as possible to \nprovide housing for those who need it the most. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will help achieve that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2006\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXPENSES FOR LOW-INCOME \n                   HOUSING CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 42 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to low-income housing \n     credit) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(8) Associated development costs included in basis.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Solely for purposes of this section, \n     associated development costs shall be taken into account in \n     determining the basis of any building which is part of a low-\n     income housing project to the extent not otherwise so taken \n     into account.\n       ``(B) Associated development costs.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), the term `associated development costs' \n     means, with respect to any building, such building's \n     allocable share of--\n       ``(i) any cost incurred in preparing the site which is \n     reasonably related to the development of the qualified low-\n     income housing project of which the building is a part,\n       ``(ii) any fee imposed by a State or local government as a \n     condition to development of such project,\n       ``(iii) any reasonable fee paid to any developer of such \n     project,\n       ``(iv) any professional fee relating to any item includible \n     in the basis of the building pursuant to this paragraph, and\n       ``(v) any cost of financing attributable to construction of \n     the building (without regard to the source of such financing) \n     which is required to be capitalized.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to--\n       (1) housing credit dollar amounts allocated after December \n     31, 2001, and\n       (2) buildings placed in service after such date to the \n     extent paragraph (1) of section 42(h) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 does not apply to any building by reason of \n     paragraph (4) thereof, but only with respect to bonds issued \n     after such date.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee, Senators Graham and Hatch, to introduce legislation \nto clarify the rules governing the low-income housing tax credit. This \ntax credit has played a critical role in the construction and \nrenovation of housing for low-income Americans.\n  The Internal Revenue Service has issued five technical advice \nmemoranda, TAMs, affecting the definition of eligible basis as defined \nin section 42(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. These TAMs had the \neffect of reducing the amount of tax credits available with respect to \nprojects financed with low-income housing tax credits. The bill we \nintroduce today recognizes that certain expenses are legitimate \ndevelopment costs that are properly includible in the basis eligible \nfor the tax credits. Among these development costs are: state and local \nimpact fees, site preparation costs, reasonable development fees, \nprofessional fees, and construction financing costs, excluding land \nacquisition costs.\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\n  The TAMs drew unworkable distinctions among various costs developers \nincur when they build low-income housing. For example, under the law as \ninterpreted by the IRS, a low-income housing developer would have to \ndistinguish between those trees and shrubs planted near a housing unit \nand those planted elsewhere on the property. The costs of trees and \nshrub near the housing unit could be included in basis; the costs of \nother landscaping could not. Rules like this are not only illogical; \nthey also impose unnecessary burdens both on developers of affordable \nhousing projects, but also on the IRS itself, whose employees must draw \nthese highly technical distinctions when they audit the project. Our \nbill includes fair and rational rules, introducing the concept of \n``development cost basis'' in lieu of ``adjusted basis'' to determine \nwhich costs may qualify for tax credits. It assures that reasonable and \nlegitimate expenses which incurred only for the purpose of building \nlow-income housing will be eligible for tax credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2007. A bill to provide economic relief to general aviation \nentities that have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of \nthe terrorist attacks perpetuated against the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Senate \ncompanion to HR 3347, the General Aviation Industry Reparations Act of \n2002. This bill directs to the President to provide compensation to \nGeneral Aviation for losses incurred as a result of the terrorist \nattacks on September 11, 2001.\n  Many have the misperception that the entire aviation industry was \neligible for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and \nSystems Stabilization Act, PL 107-42. However, that act dealt only with \nscheduled airline service. As a consequence General Aviation, a very \nimportant segment of the aviation industry, has yet to be made whole \nfor actions taken by the federal government following the terrorist \nattacks of September 11th.\n  The national airspace system re-opened to commercial aviation on \nSeptember 13, 2001. General Aviation was allowed limited Instrument \nFlight Rules, IFR, flights, operating under guidance and direction from \nair traffic controllers, with restrictions on September 14th. The more \ncommon, Visual Flight Rules, VFR, flights (which cannot be done in \ninclement weather since pilots are not under the guidance of air \ntraffic controllers) were grounded until September 19 and then only \nlimited flights could operate outside of ``enhanced'' Class B airspace, \nthe airspace surrounding the nation's 30 busiest airports. In fact, \nenhanced Class B airspace did not return to the pre-September 11th \ndesign until December 19th.\n  Contrary to what some think, General Aviation is much more than \nweekend recreational pilots. It is made of a hundreds of small business \npeople who make their living either servicing general aviation \naircraft, instructing student pilots, using general aviation aircraft \nto transport people, products and materials or perform various services \nsuch as report on traffic conditions in congested metropolitan areas, \ncheck the condition of energy pipelines, crop dusting, banner towing \nand many other uses. The fact is that general aviation performs a very \nimportant function in our economy beyond recreational flying.\n  Working closely with General Aviation groups such as the Aircraft \nOwners and Pilots Association, AOPA, which has worked hard to explain \nthe scope of general aviation to members of Congress and how critical \nit is to the nation, I think we have a very balanced package.\n  The General Aviation Industry Reparations Act of 2002 would \ncompensate General Aviation and their employees for economic injuries \ncaused by September 11. As defined by the bill ``general aviation'' \nincludes ancillary businesses as well. Thus, parking garages, car \nrental companies or other aviation related business that were not \ncovered by PL 107-42 would be eligible for compensation under this \nbill. In addition, the bill extends compensation to employees who were \nlaid off due to the slow down of business following September 11 in the \nform of reimbursement for health care costs and it requires businesses \nwho accept compensation to provide health care coverage for existing \nemployees.\n  The bill provides three forms of compensation. Loan Guarantees of $3 \nbillion from the amount made available for the commercial airlines. \nGrants totaling $2.5 billion and like the commercial aviation industry \nthe opportunity to purchase War Risk Insurance with the assistance of \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  Finally, spending in the bill would be designated as emergency \nspending for scoring purposes. Normally I would oppose such a \ndesignation but I believe in this instance we have successfully met the \ncriteria for an emergency. These benefits are not open ended, \ncompensation is only available for losses incurred between September 11 \nand December 31, 2001. Not all losses are eligible under the bill, only \nthose that can be shown to be a direct result of the government actions \nfollowing September 11. Businesses who choose to take advantage of the \nloan guarantees must demonstrate an ability to pay back the loans and \nthe government has the right to benefit from profits made as a result \nof a government backed loan.\n  In short, I believe this is a responsible bill and I hope that we \nwill be able to fully debate the merits of the package on the floor and \neventually have a vote on the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 2008. A bill to prohibit certain abortion-related discrimination \nin governmental activities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ABORTION NON-DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       Section 245 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     238n) is amended--\n       (1) in the section heading, by striking ``regarding \n     training and licensing of physicians'' and inserting \n     ``regarding training, licensing, and practice of physicians \n     and other health care entities'';\n       (2) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``to perform such \n     abortions'' and inserting ``to perform, provide coverage of, \n     or pay for induced abortions'';\n       (3) in subsection (c)(2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``or other health professional,'' after \n     ``an individual physician'';\n       (B) by striking ``and a participant'' and inserting ``a \n     participant''; and\n       (C) by inserting before the period the following: ``, a \n     hospital, a provider sponsored organization, a health \n     maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any \n     other kind of health care facility, organization or plan''; \n     and\n       (4) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``standards'' and \n     inserting ``standard''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 2010. a bill to provide for criminal prosecution of persons who \nalter or destroy evidence in certain Federal Investigations or defraud \ninvestors of publicly traded securities, to disallow debts incurred in \nviolation of securities fraud laws from being discharged in bankruptcy, \nto protect whistleblowers against retaliation by their employers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Corporate \nand Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002.'' I want to thank the \nmajority leader, and Senators Durbin and Harkin for joining me as \noriginal cosponsors in this effort to prevent corporate and criminal \nfraud, protect shareholders and employees, and hold wrongdoers \naccountable for their actions.\n  This bill is a crucial part of ensuring that the corporate fraud and \ngreed that have been on display in the Enron debacle can be better \ndetected, prevented and prosecuted. We cannot legislate against greed, \nbut we can do our best to make sure that greed does not succeed.\n  The fraud at Enron was not the work of novices. It was the work of \nhighly educated professionals, spinning an intricate spider's web of \ndeceit. They created sham partnerships with names like Jedi, Chewco, \nRawhide, Ponderosa\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nand Sundance to cook the books and trick both the public and federal \nregulators. The actions of Enron's executives, accountants, and lawyers \nexhibits a ``Wild West'' attitude which valued profit over honesty.\n  Nor is this web of corporate deceit the end of the Enron story. When \nthey thought that investigators might be coming, what did these \n``professional'' men and women apparently do? First, they warmed up the \nshredders and began destroying evidence. Then, after they successfully \nshredded thousands of documents, they began the finger pointing. Now, \nthe Enron executives are blaming their accountants at Arthur Andersen; \nthe accountants are blaming the executives right back; and they are \nboth blaming their lawyers.\n  The truth is that just as there was enough greed to go around, there \nis now enough blame to go around. But the blame does not end with the \npeople involved in this case. It extends to our courts, our regulators, \nand to Congress, whose actions in the past decade helped create the \npermissive atmosphere which allowed Enron to happen. No one in Congress \nintended for such outrageous conduct to happen, but now it is our job \nto stop it.\n  We must restore accountability. Accountability is important because \nEnron is not alone. At a Judiciary Committee hearing which I recently \nchaired, experts gave the public markets grave warnings, it is likely \nthat there are more ``Enrons'' lurking out there waiting to be \ndiscovered. Waiting to be discovered not only by investigators or the \nmedia but by the more than one in two Americans who depend on the \ntransparency and integrity of our markets.\n  The majority of Americans depend on our capital markets to invest in \nthe future needs of themselves and their families, from their \nchildren's college fund to their retirement nest eggs. American \ninvestors are watching what we do here and want action. We must act now \nto restore confidence in the integrity of our markets and deter fraud \nartists who think that their crimes will go unpunished. Restoring such \naccountability is what this bill is all about.\n  This bill has three major components that will enhance \naccountability. First, this bill provides prosecutors with new and \nbetter tools to effectively prosecute and punish those who defraud our \nNation's investors, which means ensuring our criminal laws are flexible \nenough to keep pace with the most sophisticated and clever con artists. \nIt also means providing criminal penalties which are tough enough to \nmake them think twice about defrauding the public.\n  Second, this bill provides tools that will improve the ability of \ninvestigators and regulators to collect and preserve evidence which \nproves fraud. That means ensuring that corporate whistleblowers are \nprotected and that those who destroy evidence of fraud are punished. \nThird, the bill protects victims' rights to recover from those who have \ncheated them. In short, this bill is going to both save documents from \nthe shredder and send wrongdoers to jail once they are caught.\n  This bill is only one part of the response needed to solve the \nproblems exposed by Enron's fall. Securities law experts, consumer \nprotection groups, and others Members of Congress, both in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives, have made other proposals and \nintroduced legislation that deserves careful consideration. Working \nwith the majority leader, we have developed a comprehensive plan to \nattack this problem. Certainly, in light of recent events, we must \ncarefully reexamine both the decisions of the Supreme Court and our \ncurrent laws. Despite the best of intentions, our laws may have helped \ncreate an environment in which greed was inflated and integrity \ndevalued. This bill is an important starting point in that process. Let \nme explain its provisions.\n  Section 2 of the bill would create two new 5 year felonies to clarify \nand plug holes in the existing criminal laws relating to the \ndestruction or fabrication of evidence, including the shredding of \nfinancial and audit records. Currently, those provisions are a \npatchwork which have been interpreted, often very narrowly, by Federal \ncourts. For instance, certain of the current provisions in Title 18, \nsuch as Section 1512(b), make it a crime to persuade another person to \ndestroy documents, but not a crime for a person to personally destroy \nthe same documents. Other provisions, such as Section 1503, have been \nnarrowly interpreted by courts, including the Supreme Court in United \nStates v. Aguillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), and the First Circuit in \nUnited States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641 (1st Cir. 1996), to apply \nonly to situations where the obstruction of justice may be closely tied \nto a judicial proceeding that is already pending. Still other \nprovisions, such as sections 152(8), 1517 and 1518 apply to obstruction \nin certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, \nexaminations of financial institutions, and healthcare fraud. In short, \nthe current laws regarding destruction of evidence are full of \nambiguities and limitations that should be corrected.\n  Section 2 would create a new felony, 18 U.S.C. section 1519, for use \nin a wide array of cases in which a person destroys evidence with the \nspecific intent to obstruct a Federal agency or a criminal \ninvestigation. There would be no technical requirement that a judicial \nproceeding was already underway or that the documents were formally \nunder subpoena. The law would also be used to prosecute a person who \nactually destroys the records themself in addition to one who \npersuades another to do so. The law would apply to the intentional \nshredding of evidence in any matter within Federal regulatory or civil \njurisdiction, such as an SEC or civil fraud matter, as well as criminal \njurisdiction, eliminating another series of technical distinctions \nimposed by some courts under current law.\n\n  Second, Section 2 creates a 5-year felony, 18 U.S.C. section 1520, to \npunish the willful failure to preserve financial audit papers of \ncompanies that issue securities as defined in the Securities Exchange \nAct. The new statute, in subsection (a), would require that accountants \npreserve audit records for 5 years from the conclusion of the audit. \nSubsection (b) would make it a felony to knowingly and willfully \nviolate the 5-year audit retention period. This section both penalizes \nthe willful failure to maintain specified audit records and sets a \nbright line rule that would require accountants to put strong \nsafeguards in place to ensure that such records are, in fact, retained. \nHad such clear requirements been in place at the time that Arthur \nAndersen was considering what to do with its audit documents, countless \ndocuments might have been saved from the shredder.\n  Section 3 of this bill proposes an amendment to the civil Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations, RICO, statute, enhance the \nabilities of Federal and State regulators to enforce existing law. It \nwould give State Attorneys General and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, ``SEC'', explicit authority to bring a suit under the civil \nRICO provisions. Currently, only the U.S. Attorney General has such \nauthority under RICO. At a Judiciary Committee hearing on Enron's fall, \nWashington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire strongly supported \nthis change, testifying that State and local law enforcers are on the \nfront lines in protecting consumer's rights. Providing such authority \nto State Attorneys General and to the SEC would provide them a potent \nweapon in that battle and would allow us to take advantage of their \nsignificant expertise in protecting consumers.\n  Others have suggested that we also consider repealing the one-of-a-\nkind securities fraud exception to civil RICO, created in 1995 over the \nveto of President Clinton. Congressman Conyers, the distinguished \nranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has already \nintroduced a bill to repeal this unique exemption. As someone who voted \nagainst the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and voted to \nsustain President Clinton's veto, I did not support this one-of-a-kind \nexemption when it became law. Now, given what has happened in our \nmarkets, I think that we all need to consider whether or not the \nexemption for securities fraud makes sense. No one who voted for the \n1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act or voted to override \nPresident Clinton's veto meant for Enron to occur, but now that it has \noccurred, none of us can ignore it.\n  In addition to giving the SEC the authority to sue under civil RICO, \nwe have to ensure that the SEC has all the powers and resources that it \nneeds to protect our Nation's shareholders. The\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nSEC needs to have sufficient attorneys, training, and investigative \nresources, and enough power to pursue the most complex of cases against \nthe best funded defendants in our legal system. In particular, one idea \nthat is worth serious consideration is amending the statutes related to \nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow SEC attorneys in fraud \ninvestigations to seek search warrants from a Federal judge, the same \nway that Department of Justice attorneys currently may, when they can \ndemonstrate probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. \nTaking such a step might allow the SEC to act more quickly and to \nprevent the destruction of documents and evidence in the future, as \nthey were not able to do in the Enron case. The SEC has to have the \ntools it needs to protect what has truly become a nation of \nshareholders.\n  Section 4 of this bill would amend the Bankruptcy Code to make \njudgments and settlements based upon securities law violations non-\ndischargeable, protecting victims' ability to recover their losses. \nCurrent bankruptcy law may permit such wrongdoers to discharge their \nobligations under court judgments or settlements based on securities \nfraud and other securities violations. This loophole in the law should \nbe closed to help defrauded investors recoup their losses and to hold \naccountable those who perpetrate securities fraud after a government \nunit or private suit results in a judgment or settlement against the \nwrongdoer.\n  State securities regulators have indicated their strong support for \nthis change in the bankruptcy law, and I have received letters \nsupporting the passage of this bill from the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, whose membership includes the securities \nadministrators in all 50 States and Vermont's chief banking and \nsecurities regulator. Under current laws, State regulators are often \nforced to ``reprove'' their fraud cases in bankruptcy court to prevent \ndischarge because remedial statutes often have different technical \nelements than the analogous common law causes of action. Moreover, \nsettlements may not have the same collateral estoppel effect as \njudgments obtained through fully litigated legal proceedings. In short, \nwith their resources already stretched to the breaking point, these \nState regulators have to plow the same ground twice in securities fraud \ncases. By ensuring securities fraud judgments and settlements in State \ncases are non-dischargeable, precious state enforcement resources will \nbe preserved and directed at preventing fraud in the first place.\n  Section 5 would protect victims by extending the statute of \nlimitations in private securities fraud cases. This section would set \nthe statute of limitations in private securities fraud cases to the \nearlier of 5 years after the date of the fraud or 3 years after the \nfraud was discovered. The current statute of limitations for such fraud \ncases is 3 years from the date of the fraud. This can unfairly limit \nrecovery for defrauded investors in some cases. As Attorney General \nGregoire testified at our recent hearing, in the Enron State pension \nfund litigation the current short statute of limitations has forced \nsome States to forgo claims against Enron based on securities fraud in \n1997 and 1998. In Washington State alone, the short statute of \nlimitations may cost hard working State employees, firefighters and \npolice officers nearly $50 million, lost Enron investments which they \ncan never recover under current law.\n  Especially in complex securities fraud cases, the current short \nstatute of limitations may insulate the worst offenders from \naccountability. As Justices O'Connor and Kennedy said in their dissent \nin Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis, & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 111 S. Ct. \n2773 (1991), the 5-4 decision upholding this short statute of \nlimitations in most securities fraud cases, the current ``one and \nthree'' limitations period makes securities fraud actions ``all but a \ndead letter for injured investors who by no conceivable standard of \nfairness or practicality can be expected to file suit within 3 years \nafter the violation occurred.'' The Consumers Union also strongly \nsupports the bill, and views this section in particular as a needed \nmeasure to protect investors.\n\n  The experts agree with that view. In fact, the last two SEC Chairmen \nsupported extending the statute of limitations in securities fraud \ncases. Then Chairman Arthur Levitt testified before a Senate \nSubcommittee in 1995 that ``extending the statute of limitations is \nwarranted because many securities frauds are inherently complex, and \nthe law should not reward the perpetrator of a fraud, who successfully \nconceals its existence for more than 3 years.'' Before Chairman Levitt, \nin the last Bush administration, then SEC Chairman Richard Breeden also \ntestified before Congress in favor of extending the statute of \nlimitations in securities fraud cases. Reacting to the Lampf opinion, \nBreeden stated in 1991 that ``[e]vents only come to light years after \nthe original distribution of securities, and the Lampf cases could well \nmean that by the time investors discover they have a case, they are \nalready barred from the courthouse.'' Both the FDIC and the State \nsecurities regulators joined the SEC in calling for a legislative \nreversal of the Lampf decisions at that time.\n  In fraud cases the short limitations period under current law is an \ninvitation to take sophisticated steps to conceal the deceit. The \nexperts have long agreed on that point, but unfortunately they have \nbeen proven right again. As we know from recent experience, it only \ntakes a few seconds to warm up the shredder, but unfortunately it will \ntake years for victims to put this complex case back together again. It \nis time that the law be changed to give victims the time they need to \nprove their fraud cases.\n  Section 6 of this bill ensures that those who destroy evidence or \nperpetrate fraud are appropriately punished. It would require the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission, ``Commission'', to consider \nenhancing criminal penalties in cases involving the actual destruction \nor fabrication of evidence or in serious fraud cases where a large \nnumber of victims are injured or when the victims face financial ruin.\n  Currently, the United States Sentencing Guidelines recognize that a \nwide variety of conduct falls under the offense of ``obstruction of \njustice.'' For obstruction cases involving the murder of a witness or \nanother crime, the guidelines allow, by cross reference, significant \nenhancements based on the underlying crimes, such as murder or \nattempted murder. For cases where obstruction is the only offense, \nhowever, they provide little guidance on differentiating between \ndifferent types of obstruction. This provision requests that the \nSentencing Commission consider a specific enhancement in cases where \nevidence and records are actually destroyed or fabricated in order to \nthwart investigators, a serious form of obstruction.\n  This provision, in subsections 3 and 4, also requires the Commission \nto consider enhancing the penalties in fraud cases which are \nparticularly extensive or serious. The current fraud guidelines require \nthe sentencing judge to take the number of victims into account, but \nonly to a very limited degree in small and medium-sized cases. \nSpecifically, once there are more than 50 victims, the guidelines do \nnot require any further enhancement of the sentence, so that a case \nwith 51 victims may be treated the same as a case with 5,000 victims. \nAs the Enron matter demonstrates, serious frauds, especially in cases \nwhere publicly traded securities are involved, can effect thousands of \nvictims. The Commission may well have not foreseen such extensive \ncases, and subsection 3 requires it to reconsider whether they merit an \nadditional enhancement.\n  In addition, current guidelines allow only very limited consideration \nof the extent of devastation that a fraud offense causes its victims. \nJudges may only consider whether a fraud endangers the ``solvency or \nfinancial security'' of a victim to impose an upward departure from the \nrecommended sentencing range. It is not a factor in establishing the \nrange itself unless a bank is the victim. Subsection 4 requires the \nCommission to consider requiring judges to consider the extent of the \nfraud in setting the actual recommended sentencing range in cases such \nas the Enron matter, where many private victims have lost their life \nsavings.\n  Section 7 of the bill would provide whistleblower protection to \nemployees of publicly traded companies who report acts of fraud to \nFederal officials\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nwith the authority to remedy the wrongdoing or to supervisors or \nappropriate individuals within their company. Although current law \nprotects many government employees who act in the public interest by \nreporting wrongdoing, there is no similar protection for employees of \npublicly traded companies who blow the whistle on fraud and protect \ninvestors. With an unprecedented portion of the American public \ninvesting in these companies and depending upon their honesty, this \ndistinction does not serve the public good.\n  In addition, corporate employees who report fraud are subject to the \npatchwork and vagaries of current State laws, even though most publicly \ntraded companies do business nationwide. Thus, a whistleblowing \nemployee in one State may be far more vulnerable to retaliation than a \nfellow employee in another State who takes the same actions. \nUnfortunately, one thing that often transcends State lines, as we all \nknow from the State tobacco litigation, are certain companies with a \ncorporate culture that punishes whistleblowers for being ``disloyal'' \nand ``litigation risks.''\n  Most corporate employers, with help from their lawyers, know exactly \nwhat they can do to a whistleblowing employee under the law. \nUnfortunately, Enron has supplied us with another grievous example of \ncorporate conduct as shown by a recently released email from one of \nEnron's lawyers. The email responds to a request for legal advice after \nan Enron employee tried to report accounting irregularities at the \nhighest levels of the company in late August, 2001:\n\n       You asked that I include in this communication a summary of \n     the possible risks associated with discharging (or \n     constructively discharging) employees who report allegations \n     of improper accounting practices: 1. Texas law does not \n     currently protect corporate whistleblowers. The supreme court \n     has twice declined to create a cause of action for \n     whistleblowers who are discharged . . .\n\n  This legal advice lays bare the fact that employees who do the \n``right thing'' are vulnerable to retaliation. After this high level \nemployee at Enron reported improper accounting practices, Enron is not \nthinking about firing Arthur Andersen, they are considering discharging \nthe whistle blower. No wonder that so many employees are scared to come \nforward. Our laws need to encourage and protect those who report \nfraudulent activity that damages investors in publicly traded \ncompanies. That is why this bill is supported by groups such as the \nNational Whistleblower Center, the Government Accountability Project, \nand Taxpayers Against Fraud, who have written a letter calling this \nbill ``the single most effective measure possible to prevent \nrecurrences of the Enron debacle and similar threats to the nation's \nfinancial markets.''\n\n  This bill would create a new provision protecting employees when they \ntake lawful acts to disclose information or otherwise assist criminal \ninvestigators, Federal regulators, Congress, their supervisors, or \nother proper people within a corporation, or parties in a judicial \nproceeding in detecting and stopping actions which they reasonably \nbelieve to be fraudulent. Since the only acts protected are ``lawful'' \nones, the bill would not protect illegal actions, such as the improper \npublic disclosure of trade secret information. In addition, a \nreasonableness test is also provided under the subsection (a)(1), which \nis intended to impose the normal reasonable person standard used and \ninterpreted in a wide variety of legal contexts. See generally Passaic \nValley Sewerage Commissioners v. Department of Labor, 992 F. 2d 474, \n478. Certainly, although not exclusively, any type of corporate or \nagency action taken based on the information or the information \nconstituting admissible evidence would be strong indicia that it could \nsupport of such a reasonable belief. Under this bill's new protections, \nif the employer does take illegal action in retaliation for such lawful \nand protected conduct, subsection b allows the employee to elect to \nfile an administrative complaint at the Department of Labor, as is the \ncase for employees who provide assistance in airplane safety, or to \nbring a case in Federal court, with a jury trial available for an \naction at law. See United States Constitution, Amendment VII; Title 42 \nUnited States Code, Section 1983.\n  Subsection (c) of this section would require both reinstatement of \nthe whistleblower, double backpay, and compensatory damages to make a \nvictim whole. In severe cases, where the finder of fact determines that \nunderlying fraud posed a substantial risk to the shareholders' or the \ngeneral public's health, safety or welfare, punitive damages would be \nallowed in the discretion of the finder of fact based on a number of \nenumerated factors. The bill does not supplant or replace State law, \nbut sets a national floor for employee protections in the context of \npublicly traded companies.\n  Section 8 of the bill would create a new ten year felony under Title \n18 for defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. Currently, \nunlike bank fraud or health care fraud, there is no generally \naccessible statute dealing with the specific problem of securities \nfraud. In these cases, Federal investigators and prosecutors are forced \neither to resort to a patchwork of technical Title 15 offenses, which \nmay criminalize particular violations of securities law, or to treat \nthe cases as generic mail or wire fraud cases and to meet the technical \nelements of those statutes, with their 5 year maximum penalties.\n  This bill, then, would create a new ten year felony for securities \nfraud, a more general and less technical provision comparable to the \nbank fraud and health care fraud statutes in Title 18. Specifically, it \nwould add a provision to Chapter 63 of Title 18 which would criminalize \nthe execution or attempted execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud \npersons in connection with securities of publicly traded companies or \nobtain their money or property. The provision would provide needed \nenforcement flexibility in the context of publicly traded companies to \nprotect shareholders and prospective shareholders against all the types \nof schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may devise in the \nfuture.\n  This bill can only be part of the needed response to the problems \nexposed by the Enron debacle. It is clear that changes are needed to \nrestore accountability in our markets. As a lawyer and a former \nprosecutor I am appalled at the role that lawyers and accountants \nplayed in the Enron case. Instead of acting as gatekeepers who detect \nand deter fraud, it appears that Enron's accountants and lawyers \nbrought all their skills and knowledge to bear in assisting the fraud \nto succeed and then in covering it up. We need to reconsider the \nincentive system that has been set up that encourages accountants and \nlawyers who come across fraud in their work to remain silent.\n  Others have suggested that we restore aider and abettor liability to \nthe law as it existed for almost five decades before the Supreme Court, \nin another 5-4 decision, took away the ability of private parties to \nsue aiders and abettors for securities fraud. I hope that Senators on \nthe Banking Committee will seriously consider this change, which \nrestores the ability to hold liable accountants and lawyers who \nknowingly or recklessly provide substantial assistance in perpetrating \na fraud. Others have also proposed to restore joint and several \nliability in securities fraud cases so that fraud victims are not left \nempty handed watching the accountants, lawyers, and executives point \nfingers at each other, until they can blame everything on the one \ncompany that files for bankruptcy protection, like Enron, another \nchange worth careful consideration. In short, we have to ask ourselves \nwhether, as a nation, we have unintentionally stacked the deck against \nfraud victims. I think that we have, and we need to have the courage to \nadmit it and reshuffle the cards to restore basic fairness.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce the ``Corporate \nand Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002.'' I look forward to \nworking with members on both sides of the aisle to enact its provisions \ninto law.\n  I ask unanimous consent for this bill to be printed in the Record \nalong with the sectional analysis and a copy of the entire e-mail \ndocument to which I referred as well as the letters of support which I \nhave referenced.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\n                                S. 2010\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR DEFRAUDING SHAREHOLDERS OF \n                   PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1348.

Title.\n       ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act.''\n     Section 2. Criminal Penalties for Altering, Destroying, or \n         Failing to Maintain Documents\n       This section provides two new criminal statutes which would \n     clarify and plug holes in the current criminal laws relating \n     to the destruction or fabrication of evidence, including the \n     shredding of financial and audit records. Currently, those \n     provisions are a patchwork which have been interpreted in \n     often limited ways in federal court. For instance, certain of \n     the current provisions make it a crime to persuade another \n     person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually \n     destroy the same documents yourself. Other provisions have \n     been narrowly interpreted by courts, including the Supreme \n     Court in United States v. Aguillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), to \n     apply only to situations where the obstruction of justice can \n     be closely tied to a pending judicial proceeding.\n       First, this section would create a new 5 year felony which \n     could be effectively used in a wide array of cases where a \n     person destroys or creates evidence with the specific intent \n     to obstruct a federal agency or a criminal investigation. \n     Second, the section creates another 5 year felony which \n     applies specifically to the willful failure to preserve audit \n     papers of companies that issue securities.\n     Section 3. Amendment to Improve Enforcement of Civil RICO\n       This section proposes an amendment to the civil RICO \n     provision found at 18 U.S.C. Section 1964 which would enhance \n     the abilities of federal and state regulators to enforce \n     existing law by giving State Attorneys General and the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, explicit authority \n     to bring a suit under the civil RICO provisions. Currently, \n     only the Attorney General has such authority under RICO.\n     Section 4. Bankruptcy\n       This provision would amend the Federal bankruptcy code to \n     make judgments and settlements arising from state and federal \n     securities law violations brought by state or federal \n     regulators and private individuals non-dischargeable. Current \n     bankruptcy law may permit wrongdoers to discharge their \n     obligations under court judgments or settlements based on \n     securities fraud and securities law violations. This loophole \n     in the law should be closed to help defrauded investors \n     recoup their losses and to hold accountable those who \n     perpetrate securities fraud.\n     Section 5. Statute of Limitations\n       This section would set the statute of limitations in \n     private securities fraud cases to the earlier of 5 years \n     after the date of the fraud or three years after the fraud \n     was discovered. The current statute of limitations for \n     private securities fraud cases is the earlier of three \n     years from the date of the fraud or one year from the date \n     of discovery. In the Enron state pension fund litigation, \n     the current short statute of limitations has forced some \n     states to forgo claims against Enron based on securities \n     fraud in 1997 and 1998. Victims of securities fraud should \n     have a reasonable time to discover the facts underlying \n     the fraud.\n       The Supreme Court, in Lampf v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350 \n     (1991), endorsed the current short statute of limitations for \n     securities fraud in a 5-4 decision. Justices O'Connor and \n     Kennedy wrote in their dissent in the Lampf decison: ``By \n     adopting a 3-year period of repose, the Court makes a \n     Sec. 10(b) action all but a dead letter for injured investors \n     who by no conceivable standard of fairness or practicality \n     can be expected to file suit within three years after the \n     violation occurred. In so doing, the Court also turns its \n     back on the almost uniform rule rejecting short periods of \n     repose for fraud-based actions.''\n     Section 6. Review and Enhancement of Criminal Sentences in \n         Cases of Fraud and Evidence Destruction\n       This section would require the United States Sentencing \n     Commission, ``Commission'', to consider enhancing criminal \n     penalties in cases involving the actual destruction or \n     fabrication of evidence or in fraud cases in which a large \n     number of victims are injured or when the injury to the \n     victims is particularly grave, i.e. they face financial ruin.\n       This provision first requires the Commission to consider \n     sentencing enhancements in obstruction of justice cases where \n     physical evidence was actually destroyed. The provision, in \n     subsections 3 and 4, also requires the Commission to consider \n     sentencing enhancements for fraud cases which are \n     particularly extensive or serious. Specifically, once there \n     are more than 50 victims, the current guidelines do not \n     require any further enhancement of the sentence, so that a \n     case with 51 victims may be treated the same as a case with \n     5,000 victims. In addition, current guidelines allow only \n     very limited consideration of the extent of financial \n     devastation that a fraud offense causes to private victims. \n     This section corrects both these problems.\n     Section 7. Whistleblower Protection for Employees of Publicly \n         Traded Companies\n       This section would provide whistleblower protection to \n     employees of publicly traded companies, similar to those \n     currently available to many government employees. It \n     specifically protects them when they take lawful acts to \n     disclose information or otherwise assist criminal \n     investigators, federal regulators, Congress, supervisors (or \n     other proper people within a corporation), or parties in a \n     judicial proceeding in detecting and stopping fraud. Since \n     the bill's provisions only apply to ``lawful'' actions by an \n     employee, it does not protect employees from improper and \n     unlawful disclosure of trade secrets. In addition, a \n     reasonableness test is also set forth under the information \n     providing subsection of this section, which is intended to \n     impose the normal reasonable person standard used and \n     interpreted in a wide variety of legal contexts. See \n     generally Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners v. Department \n     of Labor, 992 F. 2d 474, 478. Certainly, although not \n     exclusively, any type of corporate or agency action taken \n     based on the information, or the information constituting or \n     leading to admissible evidence would be strong indicia that \n     it could support of such a reasonable belief. If the employer \n     does take illegal action in retaliation for lawful and \n     protected conduct, subsection (b) allows the employee to \n     elect to file an administrative complaint or to bring a case \n     in federal court, with a jury trial available in cases where \n     the case is an action at law. See United States Constitution, \n     Amendment VII; Title 42 United States Code, Section 1983. \n     Subsection (c) would require both reinstatement of the \n     whistleblower, double backpay, compensatory damages to make a \n     victim whole, and would allow punitive damages in extreme \n     cases where the public's health, safety or welfare was at \n     risk.\n     Section 8. Criminal Penalties for Securities Fraud\n       This provision would create a new 10 year felony for \n     defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. The \n     provision would supplement the patchwork of existing \n     technical securities law violations with a more general and \n     less technical provision, comparable to the bank fraud and \n     health care fraud statutes. The provision would be more \n     accessible to investigators and prosecutors and would provide \n     needed enforcement flexibility and, in the context of \n     publicly traded companies, protection against all the types \n     schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may devise in \n     the future.\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and \n           Health Care Administration,\n                                    Montpelier, VT, March 8, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Your staff recently forwarded a copy of \n     a bill you intend to introduce entitled, ``Corporate and \n     Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002''. I read your \n     proposed legislation with special interest, as I am a trustee \n     of the Vermont State Teachers' Retirement Board. That system \n     recently experienced some losses due to its investment in \n     Enron, as did the other state retirement systems.\n       I believe that your bill will have a significant and \n     positive effect on how we investigate and punish those \n     involved in cases of corporate and criminal fraud. The \n     provision of your bill making judgments arising from state \n     and federal securities law violations non-dischargeable under \n     the federal bankruptcy code is particularly welcome. This \n     improvement in the law would materially improve the ability \n     of defrauded investors to recoup their losses. I also support \n     your proposed expansion of the statute of limitations in \n     private securities fraud cases. This longer statute of \n     limitations will result in investors, including state \n     retirement funds, enjoying a more level playing field when \n     they are defrauded by complex schemes that they could not \n     reasonably be expected to discover within the current three \n     year period.\n       I also support the provisions in the bill to clarify the \n     criminal laws concerning the destruction or fabrication of \n     evidence and the enhancement of criminal sentences in cases \n     of fraud and destruction of evidence. As the agency charged \n     with examining financial institutions, the integrity of \n     records is essential to our ability to do our jobs. Clear \n     federal laws and increased criminal penalties will provide \n     powerful deterrents to evidence destruction and securities \n     fraud. I also support the expansion of civil RICO to allow \n     state attorney generals and the SEC to bring civil RICO \n     suits.\n       Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance on \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Elizabeth Costle,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Whistleblower Center,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: Since 1988 the National Whistleblower \n     Center has aided or defended hundreds of employees who have \n     disclosed fraud and criminal activities within the public and \n     private sectors. During this time we have become painfully \n     aware of the major loopholes which often leave courageous \n     employees without any legal protection. One of the most \n     notorious loopholes exists under the securities laws, in \n     which employees who report fraud upon stockholders have no \n     protection under federal law. It is truly tragic that \n     employees who are wrongfully discharged merely for reporting \n     violations of law, which may threaten the integrity of \n     pension funds or education-based savings accounts, have no \n     federal protection. This point was made perfectly clear by \n     the recently released internal memorandum from attorneys for \n     Enron. According to Enron's own counsel, employees who raised \n     concerns over that company's accounting practices had no \n     protection under federal law and could be fired.\n       With this background in mind, the National Whistleblower \n     Center strongly commends you for introducing the Corporate \n     and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002. This law would \n     protect employees who disclose Enron-related fraud to the \n     appropriate authorities. It is modeled on the airline safety \n     whistleblower law, which overwhelmingly passed Congress with \n     strong bi-partisan support. The next time a company like \n     Enron seeks advice from counsel as to whether they can fire \n     an employee, like Sharon Watkins, who merely discloses \n     potential fraud on shareholders, the answer must be a \n     resounding ``no.'' That can only happen if the Corporate and \n     Criminal Fraud Accountability Act is enacted into law.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Stephen M. Kohn,\n       Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n     Kris Kolesnik,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Government Accountability Project and Taxpayers Against \n           Fraud,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing the Corporate Fraud and Criminal Accountability \n     Act of 2002. This is a landmark proposal, for which we offer \n     our complete support. The bill promises to make whistleblower \n     protection the rule rather than the exception for those \n     challenging betrayals of corporate fiduciry duty enforced by \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would be the \n     single most effective measure possible to prevent recurrences \n     of the Enron debacle and similar threats to the nation's \n     financial markets, shareholders and pension holders. It also \n     would be a breakthrough in implementing recommendations \n     pending since 1985 by the Administrative Conference of the \n     United States for a consistent, coherent system of corporate \n     whistleblower protection.\n       The Government Accountability Project (GAP) is a nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan public interest law firm dedicated since 1976 to \n     helping whistleblowers, those employees who exercise freedom \n     of speech to bear witness against betrayals of public trust \n     that they discover on the job. GAP has led the campaign for \n     passage of nearly all federal whistleblower laws over the \n     last two decades, as well as a model law approved by the \n     Organization of American States to implement its Inter-\n     American Convention Against Corruption. Two decades of \n     lessons learned are summarized in GAP's book The \n     Whistleblower's Survival Guide: Courage Without Martyrdom. \n     Taxpayers Against Fraud, The False Claims Act Legal Center \n     (TAF) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest \n     organization dedicated to combating fraud against the Federal \n     Government through the promotion and use of the federal False \n     Claims Act and its qui tam whistleblower provisions. TAF \n     supports effective anti-fraud legislation at the federal and \n     state level and, as part of its educational outreach, \n     publishes the False Claims Act and Qui Tam Quarterly Review.\n       This bill is outstanding good goverenment legislation. It \n     uses the best combination of provisions that have proven \n     effective in other contexts. It has the modern burdens of \n     proof in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, and offers \n     choices of forum that virtually guarantee whistleblowers will \n     have a fair day in court. Most significant, it closes the \n     loopholes that have meant whistleblowers proceed at their own \n     risk when warning Congress, shareholders or even their own \n     management or Board Audit Committees of financial misconduct \n     threatening the health both of their own company and, in some \n     cases, the nation's economy. You have our unqualified pledge \n     of helping to finish the public service you started by \n     introducing this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Moorman,\n       Executive Director, TAF.\n     Tom Devine,\n       Legal Director, GAP.\n                                  ____\n\n         North American Securities Administrators Association, \n           Inc.,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The North American Securities \n     Administrators Association, Inc., (NASAA), organized in 1919, \n     is the oldest international organization devoted to investor \n     protection. Its membership consists of the securities \n     administrators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, \n     Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. NASAA is the voice of \n     securities agencies responsible for grass-roots investor \n     protection and efficient capital formation.\n       NASAA members collectively bring thousands of enforcement \n     actions against violators of securities laws in an effort to \n     protect investors from fraud and abuse in connection with the \n     offer and sale of securities.\n       We have reviewed a draft of the Corporate and Criminal \n     Fraud and Accountability Act of 2002, and we support it. Our \n     focus is on the section that would prevent the discharge of \n     certain debts in bankruptcy proceedings. At the present time, \n     the bankruptcy code enables defendants who are guilty of \n     fraud and other securities violations to thwart enforcement \n     of the judgments and other awards that are issued in these \n     cases.\n       We support Section 4, as drafted, because it strengthens \n     the ability of regulators and individual investors to prevent \n     the discharge of certain debts and hold defendants \n     financially responsible for violations of securities laws. \n     This issue is of great interest to state securities \n     regulators, and we commend you for addressing it in the \n     proposed legislation.\n       NASAA and its members are prepared to work with you as the \n     legislative process continues. We support your effort to \n     enhance the ability of state and federal regulators to help \n     defrauded investors recoup their losses and to hold \n     accountable those who perpetuate securities fraud.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Joseph P. Borg,\n\n                                      NASAA President, Director of\n     Alabama Securities Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Jordan, Carl.\n     Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 7:02 PM.\n     To: Butcher, Sharon (Enron).\n     Subject: Confidential Employee Matter.\n\n                Attorney Client Privileged Communication\n\n       Sharon: Per your request, the following are some bullet \n     thoughts on how to manage the situation with the employee who \n     made the sensitive report.\n       1. I agree that it is a positive that she has requested \n     reassignment to another department. Assuming a suitable \n     position can be found, I recommend documenting in memo form \n     that the transfer is being effected per her request. This \n     would be worded to convey that the company has considered and \n     decided to accommodate her request for reassignment. See \n     comments below re additional items to be addressed in the \n     memo.\n       2. I suggest that the memo also name a designated company \n     officer for her to contact in the unlikely future event that \n     she believes she is being retaliated against for having made \n     the report. Case law suggests that she then will have the \n     burden of reporting\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\n     any perceived retaliation and allowing the company a \n     reasonable opportunity to correct it before quitting and \n     asserting a constructive discharge. (Note: If there is any \n     chance that the decision might be made in the future to \n     discharge the employee for making the report--e.g., if the \n     company concludes that the allegations were not made in good \n     faith--then this assurance probably should not be given, at \n     least until later when (if) the company is satisfied that the \n     employee was not acting in bad faith or otherwise \n     improperly.)\n       3. The memo should contain language that conveys that the \n     other terms of her employment--specifically, its at-will \n     status--remains unchanged. This is to avoid any future claim \n     that the understandings surrounding the transfer constitute a \n     contractual obligation of some sort.\n       4. The new position, as we discussed, should have \n     responsibilities and compensation comparable to her current \n     one, to avoid any claim of constructive discharge.\n       5. As we discussed, to the extent practicable, the fact \n     that she made the report should be treated as confidential.\n       6. The individual or individuals who are implicated by her \n     allegations should be advised to treat the matter \n     confidentially and to use discretion regarding any comments \n     to or about the complaining employee. They should be advised \n     that she is not to be treated adversely in any way for having \n     expressed her concerns.\n       7. You indicated that the officer in charge of the area to \n     which the employee may be reassigned would probably need to \n     be advised of the circumstances. I suggest he be advised at \n     the same time that it is important that she not be treated \n     adversely or differently because she made the report. And \n     that the circumstances of the transfer are confidential and \n     should not be shared with others.\n       You also asked that I include in this communication a \n     summary of the possible risks associated with discharging (or \n     constructively discharging) employees who report allegations \n     of improper accounting practices:\n       1. Texas law does not currently protect corporate \n     whistleblowers. The supreme court has twice declined to \n     create a cause of action for whistleblowers who are \n     discharged; however, there were special factors present in \n     both cases that weighed against the plaintiffs and the court \n     implied that it might reach a different conclusion under \n     other circumstances.\n       2. Regardless of the whistleblower issue, there is often a \n     risk of a Sabine Pilot claim (i.e., allegation of discharge \n     for refusing to participate in an illegal act). Whistleblower \n     cases in Texas commonly are pled or repled as Sabine Pilot \n     claims--it is often an easy leap for the plaintiff to make if \n     she had any involvement in or duties relating to the alleged \n     improper conduct. For example, some cases say that if an \n     employee's duties involve recording accounting data that she \n     knows to be misleading onto records that are eventually \n     relied on by others in preparing reports to be submitted to a \n     federal agency (e.g., SEC, IRS, etc.), then the employee can \n     be subject to criminal prosecution even tho she did not \n     originated the misleading data and does not prepare the \n     actual document submitted to the government. Under such \n     circumstances, if the employee alleges that she was \n     discharged for refusing to record (or continuing the practice \n     of recording) the allegedly misleading data, then she has \n     stated a claim under the Sabine Pilot doctrine.\n       3. As we discussed, there are a myriad of problems \n     associated with Sabine Pilot claims, regardless of their \n     merits, that involve allegations of illegal accounting or \n     related practices. One is that the company's accounting \n     practices and books and records are fair game during \n     discovery--the opposition typically will request production \n     of volumes of sensitive material. Another problem is that \n     because accounting practices often involve judgments in gray \n     areas, rather than non-judgmental applications of black-\n     letter rules, there are often genuine disputes over whether a \n     company's practice or a specific report was materially \n     misleading or complied with some statutory or regulatory \n     requirements. Third, these are typically jury cases--that \n     means they are decided by lay persons when the legal \n     compliance issues are often confusing even to the lawyers and \n     experts. Fourth, because of the above factors, they are very \n     expensive and time consuming to litigate.\n       4. In addition to the risk of a wrongful discharge claim, \n     there is the risk that the discharged employee will seek to \n     convince some government oversight agency (e.g., IRS, SEC, \n     etc.) that the corporation has engaged in materially \n     misleading reporting or is otherwise non-compliant. As with \n     wrongful discharge claims, this can create problems even tho \n     the allegations have no merit whatsoever.\n       These are, of course, very general comments. I will be \n     happy to discuss them in greater detail at your convenience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/12/senate-section/article/S1792-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2995.
