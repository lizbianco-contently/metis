Madam President, before my friend from Utah leaves the \nfloor, I want to renew another unanimous consent request. I, along with \na number of other people, were at the White House\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nyesterday. They were asking us what we were going to do about getting \nappropriations bills passed, especially the military bill that affects \nour defense.\n  We have 13 appropriations bills. Two of them are defense related--\nmilitary construction and defense.\n  We reported out of the appropriations subcommittee yesterday the \nlargest military appropriations bill in the history of the country--\nsome $350 billion, approximately. The Military Construction \nSubcommittee reported it out. It came out of the committee, and we want \nto bring this to the floor. We have wanted to get it here for 2 weeks. \nThey won't let us. The excuse now is forest fires.\n  The defense of this country depends on our doing these bills. \nMilitary construction is important for the fighting men and women of \nthis country. We have 10 or 11 forest fires burning in Nevada right \nnow. The people of Nevada want to go forward to help the service men \nand women of this country with military construction.\n  It is an excuse. It doesn't matter what we do over here to get a bill \nup. It doesn't matter what we do. It isn't quite right.\n  I renew my request that Senators Feinstein and Hutchinson--the two \nmanagers of this bill--be allowed to bring this up under the time \nagreement that has been offered previously, which is 45 minutes for the \nbill and 20 minutes for Senator McCain.\n  I would be happy to read it in its entirety. I have done that so many \ntimes that I almost have it memorized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to proceed under the terms \nand conditions of the previous unanimous consent request that I have \nmade in this body, and that we be able to take the bill up as soon as \nthe two leaders agree that it can be done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, on the same basis as before, reserving \nthe right for my leadership to examine it, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate my friend from Utah, but \nhaving the leadership examine it, Senator Lott has been out here on the \nfloor saying he thinks it is the right thing to do.\n  It is too bad. I haven't changed a single word of the two requests I \nhave made--one being the terrorism insurance bill going to conference, \nand the other simply allowing us to bring a bill to the floor. They \nwon't allow us to do that. That is too bad for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6878-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. \n812, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 812) to amend the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act to provide greater access to affordable \n     pharmaceuticals.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New Hampshire or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, just to state the obvious so all of our \ncolleagues understand exactly where we are, the bill before the Senate \nis the Schumer-McCain Greater Access to Affordability Pharmaceuticals \nAct of 2001.\n  This legislation closes loopholes in the law that deny patients \naccess to low-cost, high-quality generic drugs.\n  It is the most important single step the Senate can take to slow the \ngalloping increase in the cost of prescription drugs, and make \nmedicines more affordable for all Americans. I anticipate that other \nconstructive measures to control the cost of prescription drugs may be \noffered as amendments to this underlying legislation when we get to the \nlegislation.\n\n  We have been denied the opportunity, for the last 2 days, to get to \nthis legislation, but I believe there will be an overwhelming vote in \nthe Senate to say: Let's move ahead on this legislation.\n  To a very real extent, what the Senate does with this legislation is \na key indication and a key test, I believe, of the Senate of the United \nStates. We have a major problem and concern for families all over this \nNation; and that is, the cost of drugs and the availability of drugs. \nWe have carefully thought out solutions to these particular problems. \nThere are different solutions to it, but this institution has the \nopportunity, over the period of the next 2 weeks, to resolve a public \npolicy concern that is of real deep concern to families all over this \nNation.\n  This debate is not about technicalities, although if you listen to \nthose who have been opposed to bringing this legislation up, they would \nlist the various technicalities. They talk about jurisdictions. They \ntalk about everything but the substance of the facts.\n  The interesting point is, there has been prescription drug \nlegislation before the Senate in the committees over the last 5 years. \nThis is our first opportunity to address this issue on the floor of the \nSenate. We have a responsible measure now that is going to be voted on \nnow as to whether we are going to address this. That is how we are \ngoing to be able to deal with the problem which is called evergreening, \nwhich means that brand name companies can continue their patents on \nthis and deny legitimate generic drug companies from getting into the \nmarket to produce lower cost quality drugs. And this is how we will be \nable to get to the issues of collusion between brand name companies and \ngeneric drug companies which also work to the disadvantage of \nconsumers.\n  Our best estimate is that the savings, when this is scored, will be \ntens of billions of dollars, as much as even $60 billion. We will wait \nuntil that report is in.\n  Can you say to parents, can you say to children, can you say to \nfamilies across this country, we can save you $60 billion, and yet our \nRepublican friends refuse to let us get to this issue? We will get to \nthis issue. It is of vital importance.\n  I look forward to continuing this debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, is it not true that in the last 2 days \nwe have really failed to seize an opportunity to move this bill \nforward? Have we not been tied up on the floor of the Senate with \ntactics from those who oppose prescription drug reform, to slow down \nthe Senate debate, to try to stop us from passing this legislation \nbefore the August recess? Is it not true that we are now going to have \na vote this morning to finally bring this to an issue so we have \nMembers on the Record--Democrats and Republicans--and maybe once and \nfor all we can see who is willing to stand in the path and who is \nwilling to move forward when it comes to the issue you raised this \nmorning?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. The measure that is \nbefore us passed the committee by a 16-to-5 vote, including five \nRepublicans. It was bipartisan in nature. That is why it is difficult \nfor us to understand why our Republican friends--because the objections \nwere not from the Democratic side; the objections were all from the \nRepublican side--why they would object to this, when five of their \nmembers--and I think we have more support from other members of the \nRepublican Party who support this--why they would object to us, the \nSenate, considering this legislation, and other measures that are going \nto reduce the costs of prescription drugs for families.\n\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, I think the Senate will respond \noverwhelmingly and say: Let's get on with its business. But I regret \nthe fact it has taken us 2 days in order to move this process forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the substance of the issue, when you use the term \n``generic drugs,'' that has a lot of connotations. But is it not true \nthat a drug such as\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nClaritin, made by Schering-Plough, which is for allergies, widely \nadvertised across the United States, when the patent on that drug \nexpires, other drug companies can make the Claritin formula and sell \nit? It is exactly the same as the prescription drug that has been sold \nunder patent for years and years, and that what you are talking about \nis making certain that kind of drug, generic drug, at a lower cost, is \navailable to consumers across America so they can cut their drug bills \nand still have the same drug, which, under patent for years and years, \nwas advertised as the very best for allergies and problems such as \nthat?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct.\n  I welcome the fact that the Senator has pointed out these generic \ndrugs are effectively and actively the bioequivalence of the other \nbrand name drugs. We will deal with those issues. They are effectively \nthe same but at a very reduced cost.\n  I am glad to yield because I see my colleagues in the Chamber.\n  Madam President, we have how much time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Nineteen minutes. So why don't I yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from Michigan and do the same for the Senator from North \nCarolina. And other Senators want to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank our leader, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who is such a stalwart and passionate advocate on this \nissue.\n  I wish to respond to one of my colleagues as to one of the reasons \nwhy I think this bill is being held up. I think it is being held up \nbecause it is not supported by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  We know there are six drug company lobbyists for every Member of the \nSenate. It is clear they would prefer the House plan, which they helped \nto write. I would, once again, share with my colleagues a quote that \nwas in the Washington Post when the House plan was passed:\n\n       A senior House GOP leadership aide said that Republicans \n     are working hard behind the scenes on behalf of PhRMA [the \n     pharmaceutical lobby] to make sure that the party's \n     prescription drug plan for the elderly suits drug companies.\n\n  I believe the reason the bill is being held up is that, in fact, our \nprescription drug plan does not suit drug companies. Our prescription \ndrug plan is written for the seniors and the disabled of America.\n  Our plan for lowering prices through the generics bill and through \nother options, to increase competition, is to make sure that prices are \nlower for everybody. The small business, which has premiums \nskyrocketing, and which has difficulty affording health care coverage \nfor its employees, would see a major change as a result of our efforts \nto lower prices and create more competition. The manufacturers in my \nState would see decreases as well.\n  So, in fact, what we have are two distinct views of how to proceed. \nOne, as was indicated in the paper, is a plan for the elderly that \nsuits drug companies. We will have various versions of it on the floor. \nBut I would argue that those fighting proceeding to a real Medicare \nplan are doing so because our plan does not suit the drug companies.\n  One of my major concerns is there is so much money that is going into \nthis effort to promote the House plan--the drug company plan. What does \nthe drug company plan do in the end analysis?\n  When we look at this, they are asking the senior citizens of our \ncountry, up front, to pay a $250 out-of-pocket deductible before they \nget any help. Then, out of the first amount of money, the beneficiary \nwould pay $650 to get help with $1,100. But then the beneficiary would \ncontinue to have to pay while they have a gap in coverage. They would \npay $2,800 when they received no help in the middle here, as shown on \nthe chart, in order to get some catastrophic help at the end.\n  So what does this mean? It means, out of pocket, the average \nbeneficiary will pay $3,700 to get $4,800 worth of help.\n  I am not that great on math, but I would suggest that, in fact, the \n$3,700 out of pocket for $4,800 is not that great a deal. I would \nsuggest it is not that great a deal for the average person.\n  I have read a number of stories in this Chamber; one last night was \nof a gentleman who had an $800 a month income and his prescription \ndrugs were $700 a month. This will not help him. This will not help the \nindividual, the average individual who is struggling to pay their bills \nversus getting their medicine every day.\n  We have a better plan, a plan that will, on average, pay for 65 \npercent of the bill, which is a good start. It is a good step forward. \nIt would not have a deductible. It would be a voluntary plan that would \nmake sense and lower prices.\n  I realize my time is up, but I would like to also join with my \ncolleagues in advocating that we get on with the business of real \nMedicare coverage and lowering prices for everyone.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and 4 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, this is a very simple proposition. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who oppose this prescription \ndrug benefit largely oppose it because they say it is too expensive; we \ncan't pay for it. They propose a prescription drug benefit that leaves \nlots of senior citizens behind.\n  The problem is, when we respond with, No. 1, a more comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit that, in fact, protects all senior citizens \nand, No. 2, with a real and meaningful proposal to bring the cost of \nprescription drugs under control so that we can, in fact, afford a \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit for all senior citizens, that \nwill work for all senior citizens, then they also block us on that \nfront. This makes no sense. There is no logic to this.\n  What we are saying is we want to provide a real and meaningful \nprescription drug benefit, No. 1; No. 2, in order to afford it, we have \nto do something about the cost of prescription drugs.\n  The costs of prescription drugs have been going up anywhere from 10 \nto 20 percent a year, way above the cost of inflation. We have to do \nsomething about that.\n  One of the issues Senator Schumer and Senator McCain have worked very \nhard on is legislation to close the loopholes in the patent system that \nallow brand companies to keep a patent on a drug when the generic ought \nto be able to enter the marketplace. We know the way this works. The \nbrand name company has a patent. As soon as the generic is allowed to \nenter the marketplace, the cost of the medicine goes down so that not \nonly senior citizens but all Americans are able to afford it.\n  What we are doing and what they did in that legislation was to close \nloopholes that allowed brand name companies to keep generics out of the \nmarketplace automatically for 30 months, if, in fact, a generic tried \nto enter the market at the time that a patent was about to expire.\n  What we have done is worked to close those loopholes so we get \ngenerics into the marketplace, so we have real competition and, most \nimportantly, so we lower the cost of prescription drugs for all \nAmericans and so we have a prescription drug benefit that we can, in \nfact, afford.\n  Senators McCain and Schumer actually had a very good bill. It dealt \nwith the abuses that were occurring, situations such as a brand name \ncompany had a patent that was about to expire. They would come in and \nsay: We are entitled to a new patent because our pills have to be in \nbrown bottles; or we are entitled to a new patent because our pills \nhave two lines on them, as opposed to one, for scoring when you have to \ncut the pills--no innovation, no creativity, no new medical benefit. \nThis is not the reason the patent system was created. It is not the \nreason the original legislation, the Hatch-Waxman legislation, back in \n1984, was created.\n  What has happened is, the brand name companies have found a way to \ngame the system, to exploit the system. The problem is, the people who \npay the price of that are not the generic companies. The people who pay \nthe price are Americans who have to go buy their medicine at the \ndrugstore because when the generic can't get in the market, their cost \nstays up. And the\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\nonly people who benefit are the brand companies that keep their patent, \nand their profit, as a result, stays much higher.\n  What we have done, Senators McCain and Schumer have done, was help \nclose the loopholes. When that legislation came before our committee, \nthe Labor Committee, the HELP Committee, we worked, Senator Collins and \nI, in a bipartisan way, along with a number of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, to address some of the concerns that others had \nabout the McCain-Schumer bill. I actually think their bill was a very \ngood bill and the work they did was very good.\n\n  We dealt with it in a responsible way, found a bipartisan compromise. \nThat is the legislation that is now on the floor of the Senate. It got \nthe vote of five Republicans in committee. It is the kind of \nlegislation that could actually do something about the cost of \nprescription drugs so we can afford a real and meaningful prescription \ndrug benefit for all senior citizens in America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague \nfrom North Carolina.\n  We have all been working together on this issue, as the Senator from \nNorth Carolina has said. It has been bipartisan--Senator McCain and \nmyself and then he and Senator Collins as well. The reason we are all \ncoming together at this moment is a very simple one: These wonderful \ndrugs that make people live longer and make people live better are just \ngetting so darn expensive that most people can't afford them.\n  It is not just senior citizens, although it is certainly them. What \nabout a family who has a child with a disease and they need that drug \nand the man works for a small business, the wife maybe works at home; \nthey can't afford this drug for their child? Maybe a year from now it \nmight be affordable, 6 months, because the generic is available. Then \nthe pharmaceutical company goes and hires their lawyers and plays some \ntrick and says the price is going to stay at $250 a month instead of \n$70 a month. What does that family think?\n  We have an urgency here. This is not just a political game. This is \nnot just rhetoric. This is not just a stick to beat one party up or the \nother party. This is what we are all about--life. Our job is to make \nsure people can get these wonderful drugs.\n  I have no relish beating up on the drug companies. I think they have \ndone great things, but unfortunately, as the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid last night, they have lost their way. The generic drug proposal we \nare talking about puts them back on track. It says, instead of spending \nyour time innovating patents, spend your time innovating drugs. Instead \nof going to Harvard Law School to hire people to come up with new legal \ntricks, go to Harvard Medical School and come up with the best \nresearchers. For years this system has worked so well, but it has begun \nto get off track.\n  I make a plea to people on both sides of the aisle--I make a plea to \nthe drug industry--get back with it. Go back to your noble mission of \ncreating these wonder drugs that save people's lives, that avoid people \nhaving to go to the hospital and needing an operation.\n  The Schumer-McCain bill does that. It doesn't take away any of the \nincentives, the profits. We are a free market system. When you innovate \nthat drug, you will make some money. But then don't, 15 years later, \nsay: I have a new idea. I will make a blue pill red; I want another 15 \nyears. I have another idea, I am going to say this drug is good for \ntennis elbow as well as pancreatis; I want another 15 years, not only \nfor tennis elbow but for the pancreatis as well. That is what we are \nagainst here.\n  It is no longer that technical. When the Senator from Arizona and I \nstarted on our journey, people said: This is a very technical bill to \nwhich no one will pay attention. But now people realize what it is all \nabout. It is about lowering costs dramatically.\n  By the way, it doesn't just lower the cost to the citizen. That is \nour paramount goal, to the average citizen. It lowers the cost to \nAmerican business which has drug plans. Why is General Motors for this \nplan; why are so many corporate leaders for this plan? Why, when the \npharmaceutical industry went to them and said, stop supporting Schumer-\nMcCain, did they say: We can't for the very simple, self-interested \nreason, it means hundreds of millions of dollars to them? Why are State \ngovernments for this? Go to your counties, your State, and ask them \nwhat their biggest cost is. It is Medicaid.\n  What is the biggest cost within Medicaid? Whether it be Utah, \nMassachusetts, or New York, it is the rising cost of prescription \ndrugs. This will limit it.\n  I urge that we not try to fight the Schumer-McCain bill but we, \nrather, try to build on it with some of the other proposals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed being here this morning \nand hearing the debate. When I came to the Senate, I was interested in \nhealth care, anxious to do what I could to improve health care in this \ncountry, and recognized rather quickly that one of the major things \nthat has happened in this country is that technology has long since \noutstripped, overcome, and ignored legislation.\n  I tell town meetings, among people who talk to me about Medicare, \nMedicare is the best Blue Cross Blue Shield fee-for-service indemnity \nplan that we could devise in the 1960s, frozen in time. Legislation \ndoes not allow flexibility; legislation freezes things. And we have a \nMedicare system that, frankly, makes little or no sense in the face of \nthe way we practice medicine today.\n  In the 1960s, when Blue Cross Blue Shield laid down their fee-for-\nindemnity plan, which Congress basically embraced and froze in \nlegislation, prescription drugs didn't make much of an impact. The big \nfinancial challenge in those days was the cost of going to the \nhospital. So a plan was frozen in place that said, We will reimburse \nyou for going to the hospital and, today, 40 years later, the way \nMedicare is structured doesn't make any sense. People take pills rather \nthan having an operation, but the pills, even though they are many \ntimes cheaper than the operation, are not reimbursed, whereas the \noperation would be.\n  There is a disincentive to practice intelligent medicine under \nMedicare. So to suggest that any rational individual looking at our \npresent health care system does not support a prescription drug \nsolution to our present dilemma is to misstate the facts. Everybody who \nlooks at this, who has any understanding of the system, is in favor of \na prescription drug benefit for Medicare. All right. We are all in \nfavor. Let's do it. It is a little like someone having a medical \ncondition back in the 1700s and turning to a physician and saying: We \nare all in favor of medical assistance, let's do it. And then the \nphysician, acting on the conventional wisdom of the time, says: Bring \nin some more leeches, because that is the accepted technology.\n  Unfortunately, that point of view would cause someone who had greater \nknowledge to say: Don't seek medical assistance under this \ncircumstance. Do something different.\n  Oh, no, we have to act quickly, and the prescribed method is to bring \nin some more leeches. So let's act quickly on this. The prescribed \nmethod is to simply attach a prescription drug benefit to the existing \nMedicare system and not pay much attention to any of the side effects.\n  I was here in 1993 when we debated health care almost exclusively on \nthis floor. It was the raging issue through the end of 1993 and through \nalmost all of 1994. I was here when the effort to reform our health \ncare system died on this floor. A lot of people think it was voted \ndown. It was not voted down. It simply died of its own weight.\n\n  George Mitchell, who was the majority leader at the time, despairing \nof the committee's not being able to produce a bill that might pass, \ntook the whole process into his office and he produced, without any \ncommittee background, the Mitchell bill.\n  I was part of the effort to defeat the Mitchell bill. We met twice a \nday in Senator Dole's conference room. We met under the leadership of \nthe then-ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nPackwood from Oregon, who understood this issue about as well as \nanybody, and we laid out the traps that we were setting for Senator \nMitchell.\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\n  Quite frankly, it was not very difficult. His bill was filled with so \nmany problems and so many challenges that we didn't have to be very \nexpert or very careful to be able to shoot it down. As we would raise \none issue after another, Senator Mitchell finally withdrew the bill and \nsimply let it die. It was never voted down. It died of its own weight.\n  During that debate, Joe Califano--who served on the White House staff \nwith Lyndon Johnson and was appointed Secretary of Health, Education, \nand Welfare, and who some have called the father of Medicare--wrote an \neditorial. I would like to quote from the Washington Post of August 18, \n1994. He was urging caution based on his experience. Here is the \nrelevant paragraph:\n  History teaches two lessons about Federal health care reform: It will \ncost more than any reasonable estimate at the time of enactment, and it \nwill provoke a bevy of unintended consequences. The danger is that \nCongress may repeat history with a vengeance.\n  Picking up on Secretary Califano's two points--it will cost more than \nany reasonable estimate at the time of enactment and it will provoke a \nbevy of unintended consequences--let's talk about cost. I have heard \nthis morning that we can solve the problem of cost by--if I may quote a \ncolleague--``closing a few loopholes.'' We can solve the problem of \ncost by telling the drug companies to hire fewer lawyers. We can solve \nthe problem of cost by preventing the pharmaceutical industry from \nhaving 30 months more of control on the prices of their original drugs.\n  For just 30 months more, they are somehow raising the price to the \npoint that it is costing us so much money that we cannot afford this \nbill. And if we can just change that 30 months--just close that one \nlittle loophole--suddenly we will have enough money to pay for the \nwhole thing.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from Utah. He is always gracious in \nthe spirit of debate. I ask two questions. First, does the Senator \nrealize the generic drug is usually about a third of the cost?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I realize that. I am talking about loopholes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Second, not only is it one 30-month extension, many of \nthe pharmaceutical companies line them up--30 months, 30 months, 30 \nmonths. So after they have made their rate of return, which they \nshould, and I admire them for making these drugs, but I was asking the \nSenator if he realizes that the new practice is not just to have one \nautomatic 30-month extension when you change the color of the bottle, \nbut to pile them on and to have the patents extend long beyond the 20 \nyears that was expected.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I realize the battle between the original creators of \nthe patent and the generic drug companies has been going on ever since \ngeneric companies were formed, and that one group will always try to \nget the advantage over the other, and that a number of tactics are \ngoing on. I also realize the generic companies have been successful far \nmore than many of the original companies would like, and to step in \nthat battle and legislate that the generics will always win is fraught \nwith all kinds of possibilities and all kinds of unintended \nconsequences that Secretary Califano warned us against.\n  The Senator from New Jersey wishes to ask a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, it is New Hampshire, but we are all in the East.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am often considered the Senator from Idaho. So that is \nfair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply ask the Senator if he is aware that under the \nbill brought forward to us, as amended, the 30-day rolling exclusivity \nwould be able to continue to roll over, that under this bill it is \npotential--and in fact likely--that second and third 30-day periods \ncould be driven under this bill--and even fourth 30-day periods. There \nwas actually language that would have eliminated that opportunity \ncompletely.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was not aware of that. If I may, reclaiming my time, \nmake this comment about this whole circumstance, one of the reasons I \nwas unaware of that is because I am not a member of any of the \ncommittees that deal with this. I often thought that since I was not a \nmember of the committees, I would not have an opportunity to be \ninvolved in the details of the bills. But I have discovered in this \ncircumstance that not being a member of the committee is not a barrier \nto being involved, because the committee is not writing this \nlegislation. The committee has been dismissed. The members of the \ncommittee who have expertise, the committee staffs that have been \nworking on this for the 5 years that the Senator from Massachusetts \nreferred to, have been dismissed. Their expertise is being ignored.\n  The majority leader has taken the bill into his office, and he has \ncreated his own bill, much like Senator Mitchell did back in 1994. I \ntrust it will have the same effect. The Mitchell bill, however well-\nintentioned, hit the floor with all of the flaws in it that could have \nbeen worked had it had a proper committee process.\n  I submit that this bill is hitting the floor with this process. It is \nhitting the floor with all of the same potential so that Senators, such \nas the Senator from New Hampshire, who has expertise in this area, have \nbeen frozen out. Senators in the Finance Committee who have tremendous \nexpertise in this area have been frozen out. And the majority leader \nhas taken this all to himself.\n  That means all of us who have gaps in our knowledge are suddenly \nconfronted with the responsibility of dealing with this issue without a \ncommittee report, dealing with this issue without the guidance of \nranking minority concurrent opinions. We are just faced with this on \nthe floor, and all of us, willy-nilly, have to do our best to do our \nhomework.\n  I apologize to the Senator from New Hampshire for not knowing the \nspecific he raised, but I point out that this is to be expected under \nthe circumstances with which we are presented in this bill.\n  Mr. President, the phrase that is used over and over with respect to \nmedicine goes all the way to the Hippocratic oath, which says: Do no \nharm. That is a more specific way of summarizing what Joe Califano \nwarned us about in 1994, the unintended consequences and the cost.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts used the figure $60 billion in \nsavings. I would like to see the background for that figure. He said it \nhas not been scored yet, but I am sure he has some basis for coming up \nwith that figure, and I do not challenge it. I am being told that the \nbill he would prefer to have passed, which also has not been scored, \nwill eventually cost $1 trillion over a 10-year period--$1 trillion. \nSomehow, $60 billion does not get us to $1 trillion.\n  I cannot intuitively think that closing some loopholes in an area \nwhere there has been intense competition and litigation for years is \nsomehow going to give us such dramatic savings that we can pay for this \nbill in a way that will not end up hurting the senior citizens and \nhurting the people at the bottom of our economic ladder.\n  Let me make this one additional point because I see one of my \ncolleagues here, the Senator from Pennsylvania, who would like to speak \nfurther.\n  For those who say cost is important but health care is more \nimportant, that cost is important but compassion is the most important \nthing, and we should not let cost stand in the way of our helping our \nleast fortunate citizens, that is an emotion with which I totally \nidentify. That is a feeling that all of us can accept and agree with. \nBut the fact--the cruel fact--is that if the economy is in trouble, if \nthe Government is feeding inflation through tremendous deficits and \nsoaring expenditures, the people who get hurt the most in those \ndifficult economic times are the people at the bottom.\n  Conversely, in the period we have just gone through when everything \nwas soaring and doing well, someone asked Alan Greenspan: Who benefited \nthe most from this boom?--thinking he would say it was the Donald \nTrumps and the Bill Gates of the world who benefited the most from the \nboom.\n  He said: Without question, the evidence is overwhelming that the \npeople who benefited the most from the sound economy were the people in \nthe bottom quintile; that is, the people in the bottom fifth had the \ngreatest benefit in terms of what happened to make their lives better.\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n  When we talk about costs, we are not being cold hearted. We are not \nbeing green-eyeshade accountants. We are recognizing there is an \nelement of compassion that redounds to the benefit of the people at the \nbottom if we keep our finances under control, if we see to it that the \nGovernment is properly funded and properly financed, and we do not \nallow expenditures to run willy-nilly out of control. That is part of \ncompassion. That is part of taking care of the least fortunate, and \nthat is a debate we are having on this floor now that some would like \nto wave aside.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time and yield to Senator Gregg, as he \ntakes over the leadership spot, but yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield a second, I want to clarify. I \nwandered in in the middle of the discussion and misunderstood the \nissue. I believe the Senator from New York is correct in his assessment \nof the bill on the 30-month issue. It was the 180-day rule to which I \nwas referring.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So I was correct in saying I did not understand the \nSenator's point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct. That happens to people from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be more than happy, Mr. President, to turn the \ncontrol of the time over to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for the \nSenator from Pennsylvania; 5 minutes 40 seconds for the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does the Senator from Massachusetts want to go or have \nme finish the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make sure we understand, No. \n1, this vote did not have to occur. We saw woeful crocodile tears today \nabout how we have to have this vote today and be delayed 2 days. The \nSenator from New Hampshire yesterday afternoon agreed to vitiate this \nvote and agreed to proceed to the bill. We could be discussing \namendments right now if we wanted. We could have been discussing \namendments last night. When I was on the floor at about 5 o'clock, we \ncould have been debating amendments, but we were debating whether we \nwould allow this vote to be vitiated or not and agree to the motion to \nproceed.\n  I have to question how genuine the concern is about having this delay \nof 2 days when we could have been on the bill yesterday and we could be \namending the bill as we speak. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, let's understand, the underlying bill is the discussion, which \nhas to do with the generics versus the main line pharmaceutical \ncompanies, and how we deal with the issue of reimportation of drugs is \ngoing to be an issue--there will be other issues--related to \nprescriptions. But this is a vehicle for a much broader and I think to \nthe American public more important debate, and that is how we are going \nto provide prescription drugs for seniors. That is what the majority \nleader has said this debate is going to be all about that we are going \nto move to very quickly once this motion to proceed is agreed to, and I \nbelieve it will be unanimous.\n  Let's understand the game that has been set up. The majority leader \nhas set up a procedure on the floor of the Senate to guarantee--and I \nam underlying that word--to guarantee that no bill to provide \nprescription drugs would pass the Senate. I do not say that lightly. I \nuse the word ``guarantee.'' We have 100-percent assurance under this \nprocedure that no bill to provide prescription drug coverage will pass \nthe Senate. Why? Because in last year's budget agreement--I say last \nyear's budget agreement and you say: Senator, what about this year's \nbudget agreement? We do not have a budget agreement for this year. We \nhave no agreement of the budget that provides for money to be set aside \nfor a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  So we have to go to last year's budget agreement to see what that \nprovides for with respect to Medicare and prescription drug benefits.\n  What does that provide for? Two things. No. 1, any bill that is not \nreported from the Finance Committee to the floor of the Senate on \nMedicare prescription drugs will have a 60-vote point of order against \nit. What does that mean? That means if we had a $10 bill, a bill that \ncosts $10 to the American Treasury, on the floor of the Senate it would \nbe subject to a budget point of order. It would have to have 60 votes.\n  So what the Senator from South Dakota, the majority leader, has done, \nis he has required every single Medicare prescription drug bill to get \n60 votes. The other budget provision says it had to be under $300 \nbillion.\n  Now, what we are hearing is that there is some outrage that we have \ndelayed this all of less than a day actually, and that the majority \nwants to go forward and move their prescription drug bill. Fine. Let's \nlook at this prescription drug bill. This is a bill they could not get \nthrough committee. Had they been able to get it through committee, I am \nsure they would have allowed Senator Baucus to mark up this bill and go \nthrough committee, but they could not get it through committee. So they \nbypassed the committee, thereby assuring, as the Senator from New \nHampshire said, mutual assured destruction. This is a partisan \nexercise.\n  So the bill will come to the floor. This is a bill that I have heard \nout in the hallways is going to cost upwards of a trillion dollars. \nNobody has seen this bill. This is the largest expansion of \nentitlements in the history of this country, and no one has seen the \nbill. It is going to cost hundreds of billions, potentially a trillion \ndollars, over the next 10 years; it has not had one hearing in \ncommittee and it has not been marked up in the committee. What we are \nexpected to do in the Senate is somehow agree to pass this bill within, \naccording to the majority leader, the next 7 days. Within 7 or 8 days, \nwe are going to pass a prescription drug bill that no one has seen, \nthat nobody knows how much it costs--it could cost up to a trillion \ndollars--that no hearing has been held on, that no markup has been done \non.\n  If we are serious about getting a prescription drug benefit, this is \nnot the way to present this to the Senate. What this is, pure and \nsimple, is politics. This is about the majority leader being interested \nin setting up a procedure that will assure that no bill passes so they \nhave the issue of saying, see, we wanted to give you all these \nwonderful things, we wanted to give you all these benefits, give you \nCadillac this and Cadillac that, and these lousy Republicans do not \nwant to let you have it.\n  I suggest that we have three proposals on this side of the aisle on \nwhich we would love to get votes. Senator Smith from New Hampshire has \none; Senators Hagel and Ensign have one; and then there is the \ntripartisan bill, all of which will move the ball down the field \nsubstantially when it comes to providing prescription drug benefits for \nseniors, all of which I believe could pass the test of the budget, \nwhich is getting through the Finance Committee and being under $300 \nbillion in expenditures.\n  That is what we should be doing. We should be trying to pass a bill \nthat gets through the Senate so we can get it to conference, work with \nthe House, and get a drug benefit by November, not get a political \nissue by November.\n  This process has been set up to fail. This process has been set up to \nfail so some believe they will get political advantage by doing so. I \nwant everybody to understand that when next Friday rolls around and we \nare at loggerheads because nobody can get 60 votes on a budget point of \norder and everybody is now gnashing their teeth and wringing their \nhands and saying, oh, woe is us, we could not get a bill done, we \nfailed the American public, the Republicans would not let us pass our \nbill, or whatever the case may be, understand the template has been set \nfor that today. The template has been set for that today by bringing a \nbill to the floor which requires 60 votes as a budget point of order. \nOnce that template was set, once the majority leader decided to bypass \nthe Finance Committee, a Finance Committee that, without question, \ncould pass a bill--there is no question they could pass a bill, but \nagain the majority leader, as he did with trade, as he has done with a \nwhole\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nlot of issues with respect to the Finance Committee, has basically \npushed the Finance Committee aside.\n  I do not know whether he does not trust the committee, whether he \ndoes not trust the leadership. I do not know what it is, but the \nFinance Committee has pretty much been made irrelevant over the past \nseveral months by the majority leader. What we have as a result of that \nis a procedure that is doomed to failure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we have 5 minutes 40 seconds left. Is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What I would like to do is give 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \nSenator from New York and 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield my remaining time. Senator Gregg corrected the \ntime. I would be happy to yield my remaining time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the unspeakable, as \nfar as I am concerned. I picked up the paper this morning and I read \nHouse GOP leaders fight audit plan, an audit plan that passed this body \n97 to 0.\n  There are rumors circulating out among those on the Hill that a \nprocedural process called blue-slipping has been applied to the Senate-\npassed corporate responsibility act, more formally known as the \nAccounting Reform and Investor Protection Act, which our Nation is \ncrying out for, in response to corporate malfeasance and the \ndeterioration of the quality of financial reporting corporate \ngovernance in this Nation.\n  If we have ever seen a situation where politics is an overwhelming \nnecessity, where the politics of a given issue is undermining the needs \nof the American people, investors across this country, retirees, people \nwho are dependent on our financial system having integrity and how it \nresponds to information presented from companies, it is demonstrated by \nthese actions with regard to trying to stop or hold back something that \nis absolutely essential for making sure that our economy and our \nmarkets function properly.\n  In case people had not noticed, we have lost over $2.5 trillion in \nour financial markets this year alone with respect to what is going on \nin corporate governance, corporate malfeasance. Yesterday we heard a \npositive statement out of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \nabout the underlying fundamentals of the economy. Productivity is up; \ninflation is down. There is plenty of reason for why our market should \nbe moving forward, why the marketplace should feel comfortable with \nitself, but what is standing in its way is the integrity of corporate \nresponsibility, the integrity of our financial statements, the \nintegrity of how our marketplace works. We are refusing to deal with \nthis on a straightforward and expeditious manner.\n  The President has asked for it to be placed on his desk in less than \n3 weeks, and now we are being stopped cold dead by the House \nleadership.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I could not agree more with what my colleague from New \nJersey has said. We passed a 31(e) bill, which reduced taxes on \ncorporate transactions but was supposed to fund the SEC. We could not \neven get an authorization to have pay parity for the SEC to hire new \npeople. That is one of the reasons we are in the pickle we are in.\n  So I ask my colleague from New Jersey: Is this not the same type of \nthing where they say, oh, yes, we are for enforcement, but they do not \nput any money in to either get enforcers or the quality of enforcers \nthat we need?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The reason we have had responses like we have had in the \nmarketplace in the last 2 weeks is that people are hot on rhetoric and \nlow, low, low with regard to results and doing anything that is proper \naction to deal with the problem.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will continue to yield, the best place we \ncan have action is in the bowels of the agencies where they find the \nwrongdoing; capable people, Government workers, they find it, nail \nthem, so it does not happen again. Am I wrong about that?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator is certainly right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I hope we take real action soon to stop this crisis of \nconfidence from continuing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Vote for cloture and get on with debate. This is an \nimportant first step that can take us on the road to lower prices and \nbetter availability of drug coverage for people who need it in our \ncountry.\n  I understand under the procedure the yeas and nays are automatic; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand all time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion \n     to proceed to Calendar No. 491; S. 812, the Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001:\n         Senators Harry Reid, Jon Corzine, Byron L. Dorgan, Ron \n           Wyden, Maria Cantwell, Paul Sarbanes, Debbie Stabenow, \n           Dick Durbin, Thomas Carper, Tom Daschle, Jack Reed, \n           Daniel K. Akaka, Kent Conrad, Zell Miller, Charles \n           Schumer, Ernest Hollings, Hillary Clinton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall under the rule is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 812, a bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act to provide greater access to affordable \npharmaceuticals, shall be brought to a close?

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Greater Access to Affordable \n     Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drug costs are increasing at an alarming \n     rate and are a major worry of American families and senior \n     citizens;\n       (2) enhancing competition between generic drug \n     manufacturers and brand-name manufacturers can significantly \n     reduce prescription drug costs for American families;\n       (3) the pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals, \n     but competition must be further stimulated and strengthened;\n       (4) the Federal Trade Commission has discovered that there \n     are increasing opportunities for drug companies owning \n     patents on brand-name drugs and generic drug companies to \n     enter into private financial deals in a manner that could \n     restrain trade and greatly reduce competition and increase \n     prescription drug costs for consumers;\n       (5) generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of scientific testing and \n     other information establishing that pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the use of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals could save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n       (B) generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent and 60 \n     percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, resulting in an \n     estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on each prescription;\n       (7) generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office;\n       (8) expanding access to generic pharmaceuticals can help \n     consumers, especially senior citizens and the uninsured, have \n     access to more affordable prescription drugs;\n       (9) Congress should ensure that measures are taken to \n     effectuate the amendments made by the Drug Price Competition \n     and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 1585) \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Hatch-Waxman Act'') to \n     make generic drugs more accessible, and thus reduce health \n     care costs; and\n       (10) it would be in the public interest if patents on drugs \n     for which applications are approved under section 505(c) of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(c)) \n     were extended only through the patent extension procedure \n     provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act rather than through the \n     attachment of riders to bills in Congress.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase competition, thereby helping all Americans, \n     especially seniors and the uninsured, to have access to more \n     affordable medication; and\n       (2) to ensure fair marketplace practices and deter \n     pharmaceutical companies (including generic companies) from \n     engaging in anticompetitive action or actions that tend to \n     unfairly restrain trade.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I think we are just about there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the bill, as thus amended, be considered as original text \nfor the purpose of further amendment; that no points of order be \nconsidered waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nArizona be recognized for up to 15 minutes and that I get the floor \nfollowing the completion of his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona has indicated this is for debate \nonly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  It is time to talk about the bill that is before us which, as we all \nknow, is going to be used as a vehicle to attempt to address the very \ncontroversial issue of prescription drug benefits for Medicare.\n  I also thank the Senator from Massachusetts for passing this bill \nthrough his committee and reporting it to the floor.\n  I thank especially Senator Schumer who really is the person \nresponsible for this legislation. All of us like to take credit for \nthings in this body. The fact is, the reality is, Senator Schumer \nbrought this issue, certainly the idea for this legislation, to my \nattention. He is the one who really worked on it. I am grateful he \nincluded me in this very important issue.\n  It is important to the people of my State and to all Americans. As we \nall know, there are large numbers of retirees who have been intelligent \nenough to move from New York to Arizona, and they are deeply affected \nby the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend. I want to thank him. We have been in \nthis together from the beginning--almost 2 years ago, when we realized \nthat something had to be done. His steadfastness, his courage, and his \nconstant efforts to refine the legislation and make it better and make \nsure we bring it to the floor has been a large part of why we are here. \nI thank the Senator for being a great colleague with whom to work. I \nwanted to repay the accolades and compliment of the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from New York. Again, I reiterate that \nhe really is the one who has been the leader in this issue and in this \nlegislation. He is also well known for his tenacity.\n  Madam President, first of all, I think we also ought to understand \nthat this issue alone--that of getting affordable drugs to all \nAmericans--obviously, as I spoke of before, particularly seniors and \nthose on fixed retirement incomes are the ones most dramatically \naffected. That is a critical issue in America today. I don't claim that \nthis bill before us solves the problem of providing prescription drugs \nfor all Americans, particularly seniors, but I do argue that this is a \nvery important step in the right direction in lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs to all Americans.\n  Now, the drug companies have mounted a massive attack on this \nlegislation. They were the major contributors in recent fundraisers on \nboth sides of the aisle. It is not complicated. The bill is not \ncomplicated. It only has three or four provisions. Basically, what it \nachieves is an ability to do what the Hatch-Waxman bill was intended to \ndo, and that is to make available generic drugs as early as possible, \nwith respect for the rights of those who invested massive amounts of \nmoney, in many cases, in research and development and testing, and for \nthem to have an adequate return on their investment. There is no intent \nhere to harm the drug companies. What it is intended to do is to get \ndrugs to the market in the generic fashion so people would only have to \npay less.\n  Madam President, Allen Feezor, CalPERS' Assistant Executive Officer \nfor Health Benefits, said:\n\n       In two of the past three years, pharmaceutical costs have \n     increased more than any other component in our CalPERS health \n     rate.\n\n  CalPERS is the retirement plan for California employees, which are \nvery large in number.\n\n       In our Medicare Choice/Supplemental plans, pharmacy trend \n     can account for over 50 percent of the increase in premium \n     rates that we see in our retiree plans one year to the next.\n\n  The obvious result is very clear. Every year, prescription drugs \nbecome less and less affordable to all Americans but especially \nretirees. It should be noted. He goes on to say:\n\n       It should be noted that in both our hospital and \n     [prescription drug] trends, a measurable portion of the trend \n     is due to increased utilization by our enrollees, but this \n     cannot take away from the extraordinarily high trends in both \n     pharmacy and hospital pricing.\n\n  The rising cost of prescription drugs is also playing a significant \nrole in the growing financial burden companies experience as they \nstruggle to provide employees with health care coverage. For example, \nGeneral Motors, the largest provider of private sector health care \ncoverage, spends over $4 billion a year to insure over 1.2 million \nworkers, retirees and their dependents, $1.3 billion of which is on \nprescription drugs alone. Even with aggressive cost-saving mechanisms \nin place, GM's prescription drug costs continue to rise between 15 \npercent and 20 percent per year.\n\n  Given the crises in both corporate America and our Nation's health \ncare\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\nsystem, anticompetitive behavior in the marketplace is particularly \nonerous. That is what we are trying to get at, the anticompetitive \nbehavior. This legislation is intended not to weaken patent laws to the \ndetriment of the pharmaceutical industry, nor is it to impede the \ntremendous investments they make in the research and development of new \ndrugs. The purpose of the underlying legislation is to close loopholes \nin the Hatch-Waxman act, and to ensure more timely access to generic \nmedications. This is an important distinction which must be made clear.\n  However, to believe that patent laws are not being abused is to \nignore the mountain of testimony from consumers, industry analysts, and \nthe Federal Trade Commission. The Commerce Committee heard testimony \nregarding the extent by which pharmaceutical companies, including \ngeneric manufacturers, engage in anticompetitive activities and impede \naccess to affordable medications. During that hearing, Chairman Muris, \nof the FTC, testified:\n\n       In spite of this remarkable record of success, the Hatch-\n     Waxman amendments have also been subject to abuse. Although \n     many drug manufacturers, including both branded companies and \n     generics, have acted in good faith, some have attempted to \n     ``game'' the system, securing greater profits for themselves \n     without providing a corresponding benefit to consumers.\n\n  The intent of the Hatch-Waxman act was to address the escalating \ncosts of prescription drugs by encouraging generic competition, while \nat the same time providing incentives for brand name drug companies to \ncontinue research and development into new and more advanced drugs. To \na large extent, Hatch-Waxman has succeeded in striking that difficult \nbalance between bringing new lower cost alternatives to consumers, \nwhile encouraging more investment in U.S. pharmaceutical research and \ndevelopment.\n  In the 15 years since the enactment of Hatch-Waxman, research and \ndevelopment has increased from $3 billion to $21 billion. However, some \nbad actors have manipulated the law in a manner that delays and, at \ntimes, prohibits generics from entering the marketplace.\n  I believe this legislation will improve the current system while \npreserving the intent of Hatch-Waxman. This legislation is not an \nattempt to jeopardize the patent rights of innovative companies, nor \ndoes it seek to provide unfair advantage to generic manufacturers. \nRather, the intent of this legislation is to strike a balance between \nthese two interests so that we can close the loopholes that allow some \ncompanies to engage in anticompetitive actions by unfairly prolonging \npatents or eliminating fair competition. In doing so, we offer \nconsumers more choice in the marketplace.\n  It is imperative that Congress build upon the strengths of our \ncurrent health care system while addressing its weaknesses. This should \nnot be done by imposing price controls or creating a universal, \nGovernment-run health care system. Rather, a balance must be found that \nprotects consumers with market-based, competitive solutions without \nallowing those protections to be manipulated at the consumers' expense, \nparticularly senior citizens and working families without health care \ninsurance.\n  Madam President, today, there are probably buses leaving places in \nthe Northeast and in the Southwest, loaded with seniors who are going \neither to Mexico or Canada to purchase drugs, which will probably cost \nthem around half of what they would at their local pharmacy. There are \npeople today, as we speak, who are making a choice between their health \nand their income. That is wrong. It is wrong. It is wrong when patent \ndrug companies game the system by doing things like bringing suits, \nwhich then delays the implementation. It is wrong when the patent drug \ncompanies actually pay generic drug companies not to produce a \nparticular prescription drug while they continue their profits, and it \nis wrong to game this system.\n  So here we are with a bill that with proper debate and perhaps \namendments, could be passed by this body and is supported by an \noverwhelming number of consumer organizations. Even the patent drug \ncompanies and the generic drug companies themselves will admit that we \nneed to make reforms.\n  Unfortunately, this statement that I have made and those made by \nSenator Schumer may be the only debate we have on this legislation \nwhich could be passed between now and September. So what are we going \nto do? What we are really going to do is have a debate over the \nprescription drug issue, Medicare, and that will bog us down with \ncompeting proposals, all of which will require 60 votes, and none of \nwhich has the 60 votes. At the end of 2 weeks, rather than passing this \nbill, which we should, we are going to say, oops, we really cannot come \nto an agreement, and if we did have an agreement, the House bill is \nvery different, and we would have to go to a conference, from which \nbills would never emerge.\n  I think the American people deserve better. Why do we not pass this \nunderlying bill, or at least make a commitment to pass this underlying \nbill, if the competing proposals that will be before us on Medicare \nprescription drugs do not receive 60 votes?\n  What I am afraid is going to happen is that none of the three will \nreceive 60 votes. Then we will drop the bill and move on to other \nissues, and I think that is wrong. I think we know that with this \napproach, this underlying legislation, with some changes, absent, of \ncourse, the huge campaign contributions of the drug companies, we could \nreach an agreement which would be fair to the prescription drug \ncompanies, fair to the generics, and fair to the American public, and, \nindeed, in the view of anyone, including a recent study by the Federal \nTrade Commission that shows that these abuses are having a direct \nimpact on the increasing costs of prescription drugs to all Americans \nparticularly.\n  I remind my colleagues that we may be doing an injustice and a \ndisservice to Americans for this year by not addressing this particular \naspect of it and having it encumbered and bogged down by competing \nproposals.\n  I believe this legislation is fairly simple. It passed through the \ncommittee of jurisdiction with half of the Republican members voting \nfor it. I know Senator Gregg, the ranking member, has some problems \nwith it. I think with debate, amendment, and discussion, we could \nresolve those concerns that we might have and move forward.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator characterizes my views accurately, and I agree \nwith the Senator that this bill should be moved independent of the drug \nbill. Unfortunately, the greater issue, or game, of the drug fight has \nbeen set up to lose so that nothing will happen, as the Senator from \nArizona so appropriately pointed out. I do think this is important \nlegislation. I hope we will pass it somehow.\n  My concerns go to the expansion of lawsuits under the new cause of \naction. Much of the rest of the bill--in fact the vast majority of the \nrest of the bill--I think is excellent. I appreciate the work of the \nSenator from Arizona in bringing it forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes, for \ndebate purposes only.\n  Mr. REID. Under the same conditions we put forward earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no objection under the same \nconditions: When the Senator has completed, the Senator from Nevada \nwill be recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for getting this bill \nthrough the committee. I thank Senator Gregg from New Hampshire for his \nwillingness to work with us, even though he has a couple of concerns \nthat I think we could work out.\n  I urge my colleagues again, if the Medicare prescription drug issue \nis not resolved, to go back to the underlying bill, pass it, and \nperhaps we can give the American people at least some relief between \nnow and next year.\n  This issue is not going away. Maybe after this year's elections we \ncould try to address it in a more nonpartisan fashion.\n  On another issue, very briefly, in this morning's Washington Post \nthere is an article by Mr. Andrew Grove, who is the chairman of the \nIntel Corporation.\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nI believe he is one of the most respected men in America. He makes a \ncase that is very important. He outlines some of the changes he thinks \nneed to be made in the area of increasing corporate responsibility. I \nthink it is worthwhile to be included in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article appearing in the Washington \nPost by Andrew S. Grove called ``Stigmatizing Business'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Stigmatizing Business\n\n                          (By Andrew S. Grove)\n\n       I grew up in Communist Hungary. Even though I graduated \n     from high school with excellent grades, I had no chance of \n     being admitted to college because I was labeled a ``class \n     alien.'' What earned me this classification was the mere fact \n     that my father had been a businessman. It's hard to describe \n     the feelings of an 18-year-old as he grasps the nature of a \n     social stigma directed at him. But never did I think that, \n     nearly 50 years later and in a different country, I would \n     feel some of the same emotions and face a similar stigma.\n       Over the past few weeks, in reaction to a series of \n     corporate scandals, the pendulum of public feeling has swung \n     from celebrating business executives as the architects of \n     economic growth to condemning them as a group of \n     untrustworthy, venal individuals.\n       I have been with Intel since its inception 34 years ago. \n     During that time we have become the world's largest chip \n     manufacturer and have grown to employ 50,000 workers in the \n     United States, whose average pay is around $70,000 a year. \n     Thousands of our employees have bought houses and put their \n     children through college using money from stock options. A \n     thousand dollars invested in the company when it went public \n     in 1971 would be worth about $1 million today, so we have \n     made many investors rich as well.\n       I am proud of what our company has achieved. I should also \n     feel energized to deal with the challenges of today since we \n     are in one of the deepest technology recessions ever. \n     Instead, I'm having a hard time keeping my mind on our \n     business. I feel hunted, suspect--a ``class alien'' again.\n       I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Other honest, \n     hard-working and capable business leaders feel similarly \n     demoralized by a political climate that has declared open \n     season on corporate executives and has let the faults, \n     however egregious, of a few taint the public perception of \n     all. This just at a time when their combined energy and \n     concentration are what's needed to reinvigorate our economy. \n     Moreover, I wonder if the reflexive reaction of focusing all \n     energies on punishing executives will address the problems \n     that have emerged over the past year.\n       Today's situation reminds me of an equally serious attack \n     on American business, one that required an equally serious \n     response. In the 1980s American manufacturers in industries \n     ranging from automobiles to semiconductors to photocopiers \n     were threatened by a flood of high-quality Japanese goods \n     produced at lower cost. Competing with these products exposed \n     the inherent weakness in the quality of our own products. It \n     was a serious threat. At first, American manufacturers \n     responded by inspecting their products more rigorously, \n     putting ever-increasing pressure on their quality assurance \n     organizations. I know this firsthand because this is what we \n     did at Intel.\n       Eventually, however, we and other manufacturers realized \n     that if the products were of inherently poor quality, no \n     amount of inspection would turn them into high-quality goods. \n     After much struggle--hand-wringing, finger-pointing, \n     rationalizing and attempts at damage control--we finally \n     concluded that the entire system of designing and \n     manufacturing goods, as well as monitoring the production \n     process, had to be changed. Quality could only be fixed by \n     addressing the entire cycle, from design to shipment to the \n     customer. This rebuilding from top to bottom led to the \n     resurgence of U.S. manufacturing\n       Corporate misdeeds, like poor quality, are a result of a \n     systemic problem, and a systemic problem requires a systemic \n     solution. I believe the solutions that are needed all fit \n     under the banner of ``separation of powers.''\n       Let's start with the position of chairman of the board of \n     directors. I think it is universally agreed that the \n     principal function of the board is to supervise and, if need \n     be, replace the CEO. Yet, in most American corporations, the \n     board chairman is the CEO. This poses a built-in conflict. \n     Reform should start with separating these two functions. (At \n     various times in Intel's history we have combined the \n     functions, but no longer). Furthermore stock exchanges should \n     require that boards of directors be predominantly made up of \n     independent members having no financial relationship with the \n     company. Separation of the offices of chairman and CEO, and a \n     board with something like a two-thirds majority of \n     independent directors, should be a condition for listing on \n     stock exchanges.\n       In addition, auditors should provide only one service: \n     auditing. Many auditing firms rely on auxiliary services to \n     make money, but if the major stock exchanges made auditing by \n     ``pure'' firms a condition for listing, auditing would go \n     from being a loss leader for these companies to a profitable \n     undertaking. Would this drive the cost of auditing up? Beyond \n     a doubt. That's a cost of reform.\n       Taking the principle a step further, financial analysts \n     should be independent of the investment banks that do \n     business with corporations, a condition that could do \n     business with corporations, a condition that could and should \n     be required and monitored by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission.\n       The point is this: The chairman, board of directors, CEO, \n     CFO, accountants and analysts could each stop a debacle from \n     developing. A systemic approach to ensuring the separation of \n     powers would put them in a position where they would be free \n     and motivated to take action.\n       I am not against prosecuting individuals responsible for \n     financial chicanery and other bad behavior. In fact, this \n     must be done. But tarring and feathering CEOs and CFOs as a \n     class will not solve the underlying problem. Restructuring \n     and strengthening the entire system of checks and balances of \n     the institutions that make up and monitor the U.S. capital \n     markets would serve us far better.\n       Reworking design, engineering and manufacturing processes \n     to meet the quality challenge from the Japanese in the 1980s \n     took five to 10 years. It was motivated by tremendous losses \n     in market share and employment. Similarly, the tremendous \n     loss of market value from the recent scandals provides a \n     strong motivation for reform. But let us not kid ourselves. \n     Effective reform will take years of painstaking \n     reconstruction.\n       Our society faces huge problems. Many of our citizens have \n     no access to health care; some of our essential \n     infrastructure is deteriorating; the war on terror and our \n     domestic security require additional resources. Attacking \n     these problems requires a vital economy. Shouldn't we take \n     time to think through how we can address the very real \n     problems in our corporations without demonizing and \n     demoralizing the managers whose entrepreneurial energy is \n     needed to drive our economy?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will read the last paragraph of Mr. Grove's column. He \nsaid:\n\n       Our society faces huge problems. Many of our citizens have \n     no access to health care; some of our essential \n     infrastructure is deteriorating; the war on terror and our \n     domestic security require additional resources. Attacking \n     these problems requires a vital economy. Shouldn't we take \n     time to think through how we can address the very real \n     problems in our corporations without demonizing and \n     demoralizing the managers whose entrepreneurial energy is \n     needed to drive our economy?\n\n  I might point out that a number of the proposals Mr. Grove has made \nare not incorporated in the Sarbanes bill, and if we have to go back \nand revisit this issue, which I am afraid we might, I hope everyone \nwill pay attention to some of his proposals.\n  As is well known to most of us, Mr. Grove grew up in Communist \nHungary, escaped at a very early age. He wrote a marvelous book about \nit. It is a great American success story. I think he is one of the most \nrespected men in America. He has been at Intel since its inception 34 \nyears ago, and it has become the world's largest chip manufacturer and \ngrown to employ 50,000 workers in the United States, whose average pay \nis around $70,000 a year.\n  So I hope we will pay attention to Mr. Grove's recommendations, as \nwell as his statements of principle.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to debate the bill, and I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4299\n\n (Purpose: To permit commercial importation of prescription drugs from \n                                Canada)\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Dorgan, Wellstone, and Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Miller, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Feingold, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4299.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4300 to Amendment No. 4299\n\n          (Purpose: To provide a substitute for the amendment)\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4300 to amendment No. 4299.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we appreciate the cooperation of the \nmanagers of this bill. At this point, we are now going to be in a \nposture to debate drug reimportation. We would hope we could have time \nagreements on this on whatever the minority wishes to offer.\n  Prior to that, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nSnowe, be recognized for 20 minutes to speak on the bill, or whatever \nshe chooses to speak on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to begin a discussion on the \nprescription drug benefit and specifically the one that has been \nintroduced by the tripartisan group including Senator Grassley, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Jeffords, Senator Hatch, and myself.\n  Before I proceed, I express my support for the amendment offered by \nSenator Dorgan regarding reimportation. I have long supported that \ninitiative. Many of my seniors in the State of Maine have to travel \nacross the border into Canada in order to get prescription drugs that \nare offered lower there than in the United States. It is a tragedy that \ncompels seniors to be put in a situation where they have to cross the \nborder in order to do that. I hope we can support that amendment so \nthey can have the benefit of those lower priced prescription drugs in \nthe United States. It is the only fair approach. It is one way of \naddressing the issue of controlling costs and making costs competitive \nso they can have the benefit of lower prices.\n  I am very pleased to talk about the tripartisan proposal. I regret we \nhave not had the opportunity in the Senate Finance Committee to be able \nto consider competing proposals, certainly the one that has been \nintroduced by the ranking member, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Jeffords, and Senator Hatch and myself, along with other \nproposals, that obviously has the support of other members of the \ncommittee.\n  We should do everything we can to have the opportunity to explore, to \ndebate, to consider the various proposals. Obviously, that starts \nwithin the committee process. It is unfortunate at this point as we \nbegin to debate the other issues in the underlying bill, which is an \nimportant piece of legislation, that we are not in a position of being \nable to consider a prescription drug benefit plan. That is not the way \nthe process ought to work. If you look at what happened on the tax bill \nlast year, no one knew what the vote would be in the committee, let \nalone on the floor, but we had the opportunity to address the issue \nwithin the Senate Finance Committee. It ultimately passed 14 to 6.\n  When it came to the floor, it had 53 votes and ultimately yielded a \nvote of 62 to 38. That is the way the process works. We did not write \nthe ending first. The prologue begins in the committee.\n  In this case, one of the most significant social domestic issues \nfacing this country today, prescription drug benefits, Medicare \nauthorization, and we have not been able to have a markup in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Senate Finance Committee, we are told, \nbecause it does not have 60 votes. How many bills that are marked up in \nthe committee have 60 votes before they hit the floor of the Senate? \nHow do we know? How do we know until we begin the process of debating, \nanalyzing, considering various issues? That is what this process is all \nabout.\n  I truly regret we have not had the chance to be able to consider this \nbill in the manner it deserves and in the manner it deserves for the \nseniors of this country who are dealing with the overwhelming burden of \nthe high costs of prescriptions. Why are we allowing this to be \npoliticized? Why are we allowing this to be a matter of partisanship?\n  We have come a long way just on the funding issue alone. I have been \nworking on this issue in the Senate Budget Committee with then-Chairman \nDomenici, Senator Wyden, Senator Smith, and others, and we were able to \ndevelop a reserve fund. We started with $40 billion, which was more \nthan then-President Clinton had proposed. We are up to $300 billion, \nand our tripartisan proposal is $370 billion, recognizing that as every \nyear passes, the price goes up and up. We have come a long way in even \nunderstanding that we are going to have to spend more to provide a \nstrong benefit to seniors, and we must start now.\n  Some people might just want the issue for the next election. Maybe \nthat is what it is all about. Maybe some people want to see a headline \nthat says: Senate fails to muster the 60 votes; the issue is put off \nfor another year. I do not want to see that kind of headline. I do not \nthink it is fair to the seniors in this country because I know this \ninstitution can do better, and that is why we put forward this \ntripartisan proposal because we did not want partisan differences, \npolitical differences, philosophical differences to impede our ability \nto address this most important issue to the seniors in this country.\n  That is why we undertook this effort more than a year ago in our \ntripartisan group to see what we could agree to that would provide a \nmost substantial benefit to the seniors in this country. Seniors cannot \nput off their illnesses. We should not be putting off a solution, and \nwe crossed the political divide to develop our tripartisan proposal.\n  We worked closely with the Congressional Budget Office to ascertain \nthe precise cost of our proposal so we do not jeopardize the solvency \nof the Medicare Program for future generations. We developed a \ncompetitive, efficient model to yield the best results for seniors as \nwell as for the Government.\n  I do not want partisanship to jeopardize our ability to send a bill \nto the President, Madam President. I want to break the logjam here and \nnow. Seniors have heard the excuses. How can we do anything less than \ngive this our full effort here and now, particularly for the one-third \nof the Medicare beneficiaries who have no coverage whatsoever?\n  The Medicare Program is outdated, given the fact that it does not \ninclude a prescription drug benefit first and foremost, and we need to \nbring Medicare into the 21st century. The best way we can do it is by \nadding a prescription drug benefit.\n  It is simply unconscionable in a country of our means and wealth that \nolder Americans should ever have to choose between filling their \ncupboards and filling their prescriptions. That is not hyperbole; that \nis not exaggeration; that is the truth. It certainly is the truth in my \nState. People are forced to make those tragic choices, and we have \nwithin our means right here and now, Madam President, to make the \ndifference so seniors are no longer forced to make that terrible \nchoice.\n  That is why we have offered the plan that we have. That is why I do \nnot want to bypass the committee, because I know that is our best \nopportunity to pass a prescription drug benefit when we complete the \nprocess that begins in the committee.\n  We should not have any political motivations or maneuvers to bypass \nthe process. I have been told: We cannot consider a bill in the \ncommittee that does not have 60 votes. Since when has that been a \nprecondition for any markup in the committee? Then I am told: We cannot \nhave a bill that is not supported by the Democratic leadership. I never \nthought that prevented us from doing our job; that eventually we could \nreach results.\n\n  We are not saying our bill is written in concrete. We are saying this \nis a beginning. It is a basis for action. Henry Ford used to tell his \nModel T customers that they could have any color they wanted for a car \nas long as it was black. It sort of reminds me of the situation we are \nin today: We will consider a prescription drug bill as long as it is \nours.\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\n  We are saying let's bring out the proposals in the committee, let's \ngo through the committee process, and then let's report out a bill to \nthe floor. The tripartisan bill has the support of 12 members of the \ncommittee as we speak--12 members of the 21. We have the support in the \ncommittee, but let's go through the committee process. Let's do what we \nneed to do.\n  Refusing to have a markup in the Senate Finance Committee is hiding \nbehind false pretenses that we should only act if we have 60 votes.\n  Madam President, I want to discuss the tripartisan proposal and what \nit is.\n  First and foremost, it is a plan that offers an affordable, \ncomprehensive, and available prescription drug benefit to seniors. It \nmaximizes the benefits for the low-income seniors, and finally, it is a \nfully funded, permanent part of the Medicare process. There will be no \nsunsets. Providing a sunset in legislation, as has been recommended by \nthe other competing plan offered by the Senator from Florida, is really \nproviding a false hope to seniors. How can we tell them: Oh, by the \nway, in 7 years your benefit will expire? I think that is doing a \ntremendous disservice to seniors in this country, saying we are only \nwilling to give this benefit for 7 years, so you had better not have an \nillness because we are not going to be able to give you a benefit in 7 \nyears.\n  Our plan is fully funded and a permanent part of Medicare. It has \nbeen scored and estimated for cost by the Congressional Budget Office. \nThey have vetted every aspect of our proposal. It is right here in a \nmajor legislative initiative. It is right here for everybody to review \nand to evaluate.\n  The plan is universal. It is offered to every Medicare beneficiary. \nThat was a major priority for us, and it was a major priority for the \nseniors in this country in all the discussions we had with seniors and \nAARP. They wanted a universal, at the lowest possible monthly premium, \nand that is exactly what our benefit provides. It is lower than any \nother proposal that has been offered: A monthly premium of $24.\n  It will be offered to seniors whether they live in urban areas or \nrural areas. They will have a choice of a minimum of two plans, no \nmatter where they live in America. The plan is targeted for seniors \nbetween 135 percent and 150 percent of the poverty level. That is about \n$18,000 for an elderly couple. They will receive coverage for about $12 \na month at 150 percent of the poverty level. Below 135 percent they \nwill pay no premium, no deductible whatsoever.\n  The plan is comprehensive. They will have access to every drug, \nwhether it is a generic drug or the most advanced innovative therapies. \nIt also will provide relief from catastrophic costs from high annual \nprescription drug costs.\n  Most of all, the plan will save the seniors real money, anywhere from \n33 percent to 98 percent in out-of-pocket expenses, with the average \nsenior saving more than $1,600 every year, as my colleagues can see on \nthis chart. The average spending for seniors without any drug benefit \nin 2005 will be $3,059 per year; more than a quarter of Medicare \nbeneficiaries spend more than $4,000.\n  The average savings under our proposal for seniors above 150 percent \nof the poverty level will be more than 53 percent. For those below 135 \npercent, they will save 98 percent--98 percent--in their costs of \nprescription drugs. But no matter, the average savings to seniors will \nbe at least one-half, more than $1,600.\n  Our plan eliminates the so-called donut for lower income seniors, the \nseniors hardest hit by high drug costs. There are 11.7 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level, \nand they are exempt from the $3,450 benefit limit. The enrollees \nbetween 135 percent and 150 percent of the poverty level will have a \nmonthly premium based on a sliding scale that ranges from anywhere from \nzero to 24 percent.\n  The 10 million Medicare beneficiaries who have incomes below 135 \npercent of the poverty level will see, as I said, 98 percent of their \nprescription drug costs covered by this plan with no monthly premium. \nThese seniors are exempt from the deductible and will pay an average \ncoinsurance of anywhere from $1 to $2 for prescription drugs.\n  They also have the protection of catastrophic limits, which will be \n$3,700 under our legislation. That is where the catastrophic benefit \nlimit will begin, at $3,700. And they will have full protection against \nall drug costs with no coinsurance.\n  All enrollees will have access to discounted prescription drugs after \nreaching the $3,450 benefit limit and before the $3,700 catastrophic \nbenefit limit.\n  They will all still have access to discounted drugs between the \n$3,450 and the $3,700 catastrophic benefit. In fact, 80 percent--let me \nrepeat, 80 percent--of the enrollees will never be affected by the \nbenefit limit of $3,450.\n  As you can see from this chart, I want to repeat, it has the lowest \npremium of any of the comprehensive proposals that have been \nintroduced, at $24. Ninety-nine percent of Medicare beneficiaries, \naccording to CBO, will be participating under this program--99 percent. \nLet me repeat, 99 percent.\n  The coinsurance paid for the top 50 drugs is $21. I want to compare \nthat to the proposal offered by the Senator from Florida, because under \nthe nonpreferred drug plan, of the top 50 drugs, we provide a lower \ncoinsurance on all but one. And for the top 50 drugs in the preferred \ndrug list, we provide a lower coinsurance than the proposal offered by \nSenator Graham of Florida on all but 11 of the 50 drugs on the top 50 \nlist.\n  So we are not only more substantial when it comes to providing the \ncoinsurance on all of these preferred and nonpreferred drugs--as you \nsee listed on the chart are the preferred drugs. For all but 11 out of \nthe 50 drugs, we are lower in our copays than the proposal offered by \nSenator Graham of Florida. And for the nonpreferred drug list, we are \nlower for all but 1 out of the 50 drugs. In other words, for 49 out of \nthe 50 we are lower. We provide a lower copay for these prescription \ndrugs, not to mention the fact that we provide a lower monthly premium \nof $24 a month for those who are 150 percent above the poverty level. \nFor those that are below 135 percent of the poverty level, they pay \nzero. And more importantly, our proposal is not sunsetted.\n  CBO estimated, as I said, that 99 percent of seniors will have \ncoverage under this proposal--99 percent of seniors. I think it is \nimportant for everybody to understand that if we are going to offer a \nprescription drug benefit, and if we are serious about making sure it \nis part of the Medicare Program, then, clearly, it is important that we \nmake sure that it never expires, that we do not resort to budget \ngimmicks or artificial sunset requirements that provide a false hope to \nseniors.\n  Seniors deserve better than a false hope of a drug benefit that \nexpires after 7 years with no guarantee of further coverage. I think \nthat would be regretable if we decided to take that approach.\n  That is why we initiated this effort more than a year ago, to provide \na benefit that was generous, that would help the low incomes first and \nforemost, that was universal, that was affordable, that did not \njeopardize the future financial stability of the Medicare Program--\nbecause, obviously, that has to be the foremost concern to all of us as \nwell as to seniors--and that we had the maximum benefits possible for \nseniors against high annual drug costs.\n  So I hope we will have the opportunity to have an honest, thorough \ndebate on a prescription drug benefit that can be included as a \npermanent part of the Medicare Program.\n  Seniors are struggling under the burden of high prescription drug \ncosts. We cannot allow election year politics to overwhelm any chances, \nany possibilities of getting a Medicare drug benefit through the Senate \nthis year. We must allow a full debate to occur on this issue both in \nthe committee and on the floor.\n\n  The Finance Committee should be a part of this process. Each of us \nhas a stake--individually and collectively--about the kind of process \nwe are willing to embrace in the Senate.\n  It does make a difference as to whether or not we are going to choose \nto bypass the committees repeatedly and bring up significant \nlegislation on the floor without having the benefit of the committee \nprocess and for those Members who serve on those respective committees \nto be part of that process.\n  So each of us has a responsibility to that process, and, most \ncritically, when it comes to such an important issue to millions of \nAmericans: Those who are struggling under the weight of\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\nhigh prescription drug costs and those who can expect to face the same \nproblem in the future.\n  I think each of us here knows that without a markup in the committee \nwe are creating a predetermined train wreck. We are heading for a train \nwreck because we are creating a process designed for failure. It is \ndesigned for politics. It is not designed for creating a solution to a \nserious problem.\n  I think if we continue to resort to these ill-advised procedures and \npolitical maneuvers and charades, and if we continue to allow this \npolitical choreographing which sort of superficially addresses the \nissue but does not really because we do not really want to create a \nconsensus and a compromise because we want the issue for this year's \nelections, then we have failed and this Senate has abrogated its \nresponsibility to do what is right.\n  That is what it is all about. It is whether or not we choose to do \nwhat is right. I think we all know what is right. Those of us in our \ntripartisan group--I am not saying that our proposal, as I said \nearlier, is written in stone. It is not a finite product, but it is a \nserious product. It is one that has evolved for more than a year. It is \none that has been evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office. And it \nis the only proposal that has been introduced that has bipartisan, \ntripartisan support, and the only one that has been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  It is the only one that has the lowest monthly premium. And it is the \none that is not sunsetted. It is a permanent part of Medicare.\n  Getting back to this chart, seniors pay less for the top 50 \nprescriptions under the tripartisan plan versus the Graham-Kennedy-\nMiller proposal. They pay less. So they pay less on their monthly \npremium, and they pay less in their copays for the top 50 \nprescriptions, either on the preferred drug list or on the nonpreferred \ndrug list.\n  Those are the facts.\n  I just hope that we will have the opportunity to consider this \nlegislation and other competing proposals--such as the one offered by \nthe Senator from Florida, Senator Graham--in committee; utilizing the \ncommittee process to amend, to debate and to vote on a final measure. \nMy proposal, as it stands, has the votes in the committee.\n  But let us go through the committee process. We would be more than \nhappy to evaluate other issues and other amendments of the members of \nthe committee.\n  I just do not understand why we can't have a markup in the Senate \nFinance Committee. We are here to do our job. That is our \nresponsibility. That is why we have the committee process. I want to be \nable to legislate the best solution to the problem. We have come up \nwith a proposal. Others have other proposals. But let us have a \ncompetition of ideas and debate in the committee that allows for the \nbest hope for getting a bill through on the floor of the Senate that \nwill yield the 60 votes, that will go to conference, and the \ndifferences worked out with the House.\n  As others have said, let us get a bill to the President for his \nsignature this year. I don't want another year to go by. That is what I \nhave been hearing every year. I have been hearing it every year now. \nFour years ago, they said next year. Next year turns into 2 years, 4 \nyears, 6 years. How long do we think seniors can wait for this \nprescription drug benefit? How long? How long is it going to take? Why \nis it that we have to have these political machinations? Our group--\nSenator Grassley, Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, Senator Hatch--has \nworked long and hard for more than a year. Why can't we have a markup \nin the committee on this issue?\n  I would like to have a reasonable answer to that question. But I \ndon't think I am going to get a reasonable answer. There is nothing to \njustify precluding us from doing our jobs in the committee. There is \nnothing acceptable by what is happening here.\n  I am here to legislate. I don't expect everybody to agree with my \nthoughts or my ideas or my proposals. But I do expect that we will \nhonor the process by which we have the ability to do our job. \nOtherwise, we have all failed.\n  I don't care if it is a day before the election. I don't care. The \ntime is now. To be frank with all of you, I think that we should reach \nthe limits of our frustration with this process. Why do we continue to \nsay it is acceptable? The same machinations existed with the health \ncare proposal back in 1994. It is exactly the process it took. It \nbypassed the committee process and came to the floor. Guess what. \nNothing happened.\n  Here we are in the year 2002--2002. We don't have a bill. The same is \ngoing to happen with prescription drugs. People will say next year: We \ncan't do it.\n  We are getting paid to do our jobs now--not next year. We were \nelected to do our job now. Senator Grassley has worked long and hard.\n  Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nhas gone the extra mile to reach out to both sides, to the chairman, to \nother members of the committee, and to others here on the Senate floor \nacross the aisle, and as he did in this tripartisan proposal. Senator \nBreaux and Senator Jeffords have also worked with us. We have been \nworking together because we know this is the only way we can accomplish \nthis most important issue for the seniors of this country.\n  I hope we will do the right thing. Let's begin this process in the \nFinance Committee so that we can consider the proposals on the floor \nwhich will ultimately yield the best results, not only in terms of \npolicy but for the seniors of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed of Rhode Island). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to speak for a very few moments, \nand then hopefully we will be on the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  First of all, I thank my good friend, the Senator from Maine, for her \nvery eloquent and passionate speech and statement in favor of the \nstrong prescription drug program. It was eloquent, indeed. There were \nparts of it that I agree with very much. There were some parts to which \nI take exception. But I welcome the opportunity to have the kind of \ndiscussion and debate that she eagerly awaits here in the Senate.\n  I agree with her that it is long overdue. I agree with her that the \ntime is now. I agree certainly with her that we are going to have to \nfind common ground. I hope very much that we can.\n  I respect those who have gone forward and supported the tripartisan \nproposal.\n  Let me offer a few quick facts. Virtually none of the senior groups \nare supporting the tripartisan program. That doesn't have to be the \nbottom-line test. But they believe it doesn't provide the kind of \nprotections that are in the Graham-Miller legislation--I think that \nthey believe this for a very good reason. The tripartisan proposal has \nan assets test that will exclude many of the neediest of our senior \ncitizens. The assets test says that if you have assets worth more than \n$1,500, or a car worth more than $400, or personal property worth more \nthan $4,000, you are not eligible. That would affect a great many of \nthe people in my State.\n  I think it is also demeaning to seniors to have to go in and try to \ngive an assessment of what these personal items really are. I think we \nwill have a chance to debate that.\n  One of the very important aspects of the Graham bill is that it \ndoesn't have that test.\n  Second, there has been a good deal of talk about the estimated \npremium of $24. That is just an estimate because this program is turned \nover to the insurance companies. There is virtually no guarantee that \nthe premium is going to remain $24. It may be $34 or $44.\n  I find that senior citizens in my State want certainty, they want \npredictability, they want to know exactly what that premium is going to \nbe now. That is something that we will have to debate.\n  Third, as the Congressional Budget Office indicated, it will mean \nthat 3.5 million seniors who are covered by their employer will be \ndropped for a less adequate program because there is no reimbursement \nfor the employers.\n  That is not a finding that I make. It is a finding that the \nCongressional Budget Office makes.\n  Finally, I want to make this point. The issue of prescription drugs \nhas been before the Finance Committee for 5 years. For 4 of the last 5 \nyears, the Finance Committee has been under Republican control, and we \nhave had Republican leaders on the committee.\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nThis is the first chance we have had to debate it.\n  I listened to the Senator talk about wanting an answer to why we are \nnot having a markup. I question why we didn't have one over the last 4 \nyears. Now, under a Democratic leader, we are going to debate and \nhopefully take action on the floor.\n  I don't think people in my State are wondering about the committee \nprocess and how we are going to give adequate time for the committees \nto work. They want the Senate to act. That is the commitment of our \nleader. That is what they want.\n  I look forward to having the opportunity to act.\n  As the leader has pointed out, we want to try to deal with some of \nthe issues of accessibility and also cost containment. In that cost \ncontainment debate, we have had strong bipartisan support in our \ncommittee--now 16 to 5. We had five Republicans who worked very closely \non this issue.\n  We are going to find that there will be substantial savings for \nseniors as a result. We are going to hopefully have the opportunity to \nconsider other amendments on this that are going to help deal with the \nproblems of the cost of prescription drugs. Then we will have an \nopportunity to debate the other provisions.\n  But, as always, the Senator from Maine is eloquent, she is \npassionate, and she is knowledgeable about these issues.\n  I am very hopeful that before the end of this debate we will be on \nthe same side in terms of supporting a program that will be worthy of \nthe people of Maine as well as Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is appropriate to address again the \nissue of why this bill should have been vetted--not this bill we are \nhearing about, the big bills that are coming at us, the drug bills for \ndrug benefits under Medicare--why they should have been vetted by the \nFinance Committee.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts represents that it didn't happen the \nlast 5 years. There was no bill reported out of the committee. So why \nshould the committee have to take it up this year? Why not just write \nit in the office of the majority leader, which is what has happened \nhere? We haven't seen the bill. It is ironic. We have had all the \nrepresentations as to what the Democratic bill is. We haven't even seen \nthe bill. It hasn't been scored. It doesn't exist, as far as we know. \nYet there are people out here puffing its strengths.\n  The reason you have to take this to committee is that if you don't \ntake it to committee, you guarantee, almost, that you will not pass a \nbill. You are certainly not going to pass a bill that was drafted in \nsome back office around here. If the bill does not go through the \nFinance Committee, it requires 60 votes to pass this body. It is \nsubject to a point of order under the Budget Act.\n  It appears that the reason Senator Grassley, being ranking member on \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, being members of \nthe Finance Committee, and Senator Hatch is supportive of this bill and \nis a member of the committee--it appears within the Finance Committee \nthere is a working majority to pass a bill out, specifically the \ntripartite bill. Senator Jeffords is a member of the committee who is \non this bill. There is a working majority to pass the bill out of the \ncommittee right now. If that happens, when the bill comes to the floor, \nit only needs 51 votes to pass and you actually get a drug benefit for \nsenior citizens.\n  The way this process has been set up by the Democratic leadership is \nto create a hurdle that makes it virtually impossible to get a bill off \nthe floor of the Senate. That is the difference. That is why you need \nto go through committee. The difference is that simple.\n  If you want to pass a bill, you go through the committee so you only \nneed 51 votes to pass it. If you don't want to pass a bill, don't take \nit through the committee, because then you create a hurdle of 60 votes, \nand it makes it virtually impossible to pass the bill.\n  This is a process which has been set up to fail, as has been \nmentioned by innumerable speakers. It has been set up to fail. It has \nbeen set up to create a political issue as we go into the August recess \nbefore the November elections.\n  That is unfortunate. It is cynical. The Senator from Maine has, in \nterms of considerable outrage, expressed her frustration with that type \nof process. She has worked conscientiously with the Senators from Iowa \nand Louisiana, and other Senators in this body, to develop what is a \nconsensus piece of legislation which will give seniors who are in dire \nneed of it a very significant benefit in the area of drugs, for \npurchasing the drugs they need to live a decent life. It is a bill \nwhich is fairly expensive. We are talking, I believe, about $400 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. Maybe it is $350 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Whatever it is, it is a very expensive bill. We are talking about \ntaking a large amount of money from working Americans out of their \npaycheck through taxes and using it to support a seniors drug benefit, \na very reasonable approach. Because it is such a large amount of money, \nit is outside the budget which we presently have in place. We have a \n$300 billion number which we put in place as a Congress last year to \ntry to address the drug issue to help seniors. The plan, bipartisanly \nreached, tripartisanly reached, exceeds that number, as does every \nother plan being proposed, except for the Hagel-Ensign plan which is \nbelow that number.\n\n  All the other plans, with the exception of Hagel-Ensign, are subject \nto a point of order and, thus, subject to 60 votes. And it is extremely \nunlikely, considering the nature of the Senate, that you will get 60 \nvotes for a final package. There are three different competing packages \non our side, and there is this phantom package on the other side being \nwritten in an office, or a cloakroom, or a closet somewhere, and which \nwe will see someday.\n  In any event, we know it has not been adequately vetted and we know \nthe number is very high, over $600 billion minimum, maybe as high as $1 \ntrillion if it is honestly scored.\n  That is why you have to go through committee. The committee has the \nexpertise on it. That is important. More importantly than that, the \ncommittee gives the imprimatur of budgetary action, and if a bill is \nreported out of the committee, it meets the budgetary guidelines; it is \nnot subject to a point of order.\n  So the misrepresentation that if it didn't happen the last 4 years \nthat the committee reported out a bill on this issue, why should the \ncommittee have to report now, is a bit of a red herring. The issue \nisn't that you didn't do it 4 years ago. The issue is, do you want to \npass a drug benefit package today or do you want a political issue? If \nyou want a political issue, don't run it through the committee, bring \nit out on the floor and guarantee it fails because it can't get 60 \nvotes. If you want a drug benefit package, put it through committee, \nand the committee comes out with a package, which would probably be the \npackage outlined by Senator Snowe, and it gets 51 votes at least. I \nsuspect it will get more than 51--in the midfifties, probably.\n  Then you have a package with which you can turn to your senior \ncitizens and say: This will be a significant benefit to you as you deal \nwith the issue of prescription drugs. That is the difference. That is \nwhy you need committee action on this bill. As long as there is no \ncommittee action, I suspect you are guaranteeing failure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will move on from here, but the fact \nis, as the Senator stated correctly, if it were less than $300 billion, \nthen it would need 51 votes. But the Senator from Maine's proposal is \n$370 billion. So they are going to need 60 votes, too. Do we \nunderstand? I don't understand what the Senator from New Hampshire was \ntalking about. They are going to need 60 votes for their proposal \nbecause they are going to violate the point of order.\n  When we are talking about the fact that the seniors are going to \nspend, over 10 years, $1.8 trillion. With $300 billion you are going to \ndo very little to offset the kinds of challenges they are facing.\n  Finally, I have listened to our Republican leader, to my good friend \nfrom New Hampshire about following the committees and how important it \nis to follow the procedures. I am so thankful that we have a leader who \nis bringing this to the floor of the Senate at last.\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\nNow we hear this is circumventing procedure.\n  In May of 2000, Republicans brought S. 2557 to the floor, an energy \nbill sponsored by Senator Lott, without committee approval; that was \nthe big energy bill. In March 2000, Republicans brought legislation to \nthe floor to eliminate the earnings test for individuals without \ncommittee approval. I voted for that. I am glad they did it. In June of \n1999, Republicans brought the Social Security lockbox to the floor \nwithout committee approval. In July 1996, Republicans brought the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.\n  It seems they were prepared to bring a lot of other things, but they \ndidn't bring a prescription drug bill to the floor. This leader has \nsaid this is the priority and that is why we are having this debate \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment we are now considering, a \nfirst- and second-degree amendment, I have offered for myself, Mr. \nWellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Collins, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Miller, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Snowe. It is a \nbipartisan amendment. It is a very important amendment--one that \naddresses a part of that which we are here to consider on the floor of \nthe Senate on the issue of prescription drugs.\n  Let me describe what the problems are. One, we don't have a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program, and we need to \nchange that. We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nProgram. Why do we need to do that? Because when Medicare was created, \nmany of the lifesaving miracle drugs that exist now that allow senior \ncitizens to live a longer and healthier life did not exist. So Medicare \nwas basically an opportunity to provide health insurance coverage for \ndoctors and hospitals but no prescription drug coverage. That was back \nin the 1960s. Things have changed.\n  Were we to write a Medicare Program today, we would clearly include \nprescription drug coverage in that Medicare Program. I mentioned senior \ncitizens especially because that is who benefits from the Medicare \nProgram. They represent about 12 percent of the population of our \ncountry, and they consume one-third of all prescription drugs. It is \nnot unusual at all to talk to a senior citizen who has a series of \nhealth issues, as they have reached the later stages of their lives, \nand they have to take 4, 5, 10, and in some cases 12 different \nprescription medicines every day in order to deal with their health \nissues.\n  The problem is, when senior citizens reach that time of their lives \nwhere they have retired and have a lower income, they have less ability \nto be able to afford those prescription drugs. With the cost and \nspending increasing substantially, senior citizens are finding all too \noften that the prescription drugs they need to take are simply out of \nreach.\n  Let me describe some of the consequences that result. I talked \nyesterday about the woman who came up to me--and all of us have had \nthis experience--she grabbed me by the elbow and said: Senator Dorgan, \ncan you help me?\n  I said: What is wrong?\n  She said: Well, I have very serious health problems and my doctor \nprescribed prescription drugs that I must take, but they are too \nexpensive. I don't have the money to be able to afford them.\n  Her eyes welled up with tears and her chin began to quiver and she \nbegan to cry.\n  She said: Can you help me, please?\n  This happens all across the country every day. Let me just read some \nletters. This is from a North Dakotan who wrote me some while ago, \nabout 2 months ago:\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I just returned from a drug store, \n     where I happened to witness a very pathetic situation that \n     brought tears to my eyes. Standing in front of me at the \n     counter was an elderly gentleman about 80 years of age. He \n     handed 2 prescriptions to the pharmacist. He said, ``Before \n     you fill these, can you tell me what the price is?'' The \n     pharmacist checked the price through her computer and told \n     the elderly man, ``The first prescription is $94.76. The next \n     prescription is $49.88. Do you want me to fill them for \n     you?'' The old man looked around and was deep in thought and \n     said, ``No, I guess not. I haven't bought Christmas \n     presents for my wife and grandchildren. I will just put up \n     with the pain.'' Using his cane, he walked away.\n\n  ``God bless America,'' she writes. ``I just thought,'' she said, \n``you and your Senate colleagues who have reservations about the need \nfor lower priced prescription drugs ought to understand that this is \ngoing on in our country.''\n  A North Dakotan wrote to me and said:\n\n       I am 86 years old, so I cannot work.\n\n  Her first thought, of course, would be to work.\n\n       I am 86 years old, so I cannot work. I am writing in regard \n     to the medication I take. I get $303 in Social Security every \n     month. I have never worked out of my home. I pay $400 a month \n     for my medication. I have had heart surgery and have \n     osteoporosis of the bones. The medicines are very high \n     priced. We need help. We are using all of our savings. I am \n     86 years old, so I cannot work.\n\n  Another woman from my State says:\n\n       I am a person with scleroderma, diagnosed at the Mayo 24 \n     years ago. While this disease attacks different parts of my \n     body, it's mainly my lungs. I have been on oxygen for 2 years \n     now. A new medication is out named Tracleer. One pill a day \n     is $3,600 a year. I called Medicare to see if there was an \n     insurance I can buy for medications. I was told I could not \n     do that. I am a farm wife, 74 years old, who drove a tractor \n     until 2 years ago when I lost my husband and then my lungs \n     got worse.\n\n  She goes on at some great length.\n  I recall a snowy North Dakota day in January, in a small van going to \nCanada with some senior citizens from my State. Among the people who \ntraveled to a little one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada, that snowy \nday was Silvia Miller, a 70-year-old Medicare beneficiary from Fargo, \nND, with no prescription drug coverage. She has diabetes, heart \nproblems, and emphysema. She takes 10 to 12 medications every day. In \n1999, she spent more than $4,900 for her medications. Well, Silvia \nMiller, like a lot of others, struggles to try to make do and deal with \nvery serious health problems and tries to catch an increased price \nevery year--increased costs of prescription drugs. Of course, she \ncannot catch that. It is moving out of sight.\n  Last year, there was a 17- to 18-percent cost increase for \nprescription drugs. The year before that, it was about 16 percent. The \nyear behalf that, it was about 17 percent. So year after year after \nyear, there are relentless increases in the cost of prescription drugs. \nThis trend continues. What can we do about it?\n  Well, the point we make with this amendment is this: We support fully \nputting a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. That ought \nto be done. I hope it will be done. But if that is all we do--if we do \nnothing to try to dampen down prices, put some downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices, we will have done nothing but hook up a hose \nto the Federal trough and we will suck it dry.\n  The American taxpayer beware. If we don't do something to try to put \nsome downward pressure on prescription drug prices, we cannot afford \nputting a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. We must do \nboth, in my judgment. Let's put the benefit in the Medicare Program, \nmake it optional, make it good, and at the same time let's do some \nthings that put downward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n  I mentioned that I went to Canada with a group of North Dakota senior \ncitizens. More recently, the Alliance For Retired Americans arranged 16 \nbus trips to Canada between May and June of this year to highlight the \nenormous price differences that exist for the identical prescription \ndrugs between the United States and Canada. Participants in those 16 \ntrips saved $506,000, or $1,340 per person.\n\n  I think it is important that we talk about policy in theory in the \nU.S. Senate, but let me do something a bit more than that, if I can.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show some prescription drug bottles that \ndescribe the real problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might go through a few of these, it \nwill be useful for people to understand what senior citizens are \ndiscovering with respect to pricing.\n  This prescription drug is Celebrex, quite a remarkable drug for pain. \nIt is sold both in the United States and Canada bottles that are \nessentially identical. The U.S. consumer is charged\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\n$2.22 per tablet. The Canadian consumer is charged 79 cents per tablet. \nSame drug, same bottle, made by the same company; the difference is the \nAmerican consumer is charged dramatically more for the same \nprescription drug.\n  Mr. President, Paxil is a prescription drug used to treat depression. \nAs you can see, these two pill bottles are identical. The cost is $2.22 \nper tablet to the U.S. consumer; for the Canadians, for the same drug, \nit is 97 cents. Again, it is $2.22 for the American purchaser and 97 \ncents for the Canadian purchaser.\n  One might ask, as you go through this--and I have a couple more \nexamples--why the difference in pricing? Well, that is a good question. \nWe have had hearings on this and it is not that there is a difference \nin the tablets in the bottles.\n  This is Zocor. A famous football coach talks about Zocor on \ntelevision every day. He says he takes this prescription drug and \nrecommends it to others who need it. Zocor is sold in the United States \nin this bottle. It is $3.33 cents per tablet in the United States, and \nit is $1.12 per tablet in Canada.\n\n  Finally, this is a prescription drug called Prevacid. As one can see, \nthis prescription drug, like the others, is marketed in an identical \nbottle in the U.S. and Canada. This is used for ulcers. It has a label \nthat is of a slightly different color, but the bottle is identical--\nsame pill, same bottle, made by the same company. In the United States, \na purchaser pays $3.58 per tablet; in Canada, it is $1.26 per tablet. I \nhave more.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What was the last drug?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Prevacid. It is used for ulcers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I add to the Senator's list two drugs? So much of \nthis is personal. I am sure he hears from people in North Dakota what I \nhear from people in Minnesota, that this drives them crazy.\n  Permax is a drug to manage Parkinson's disease. The same bottle in \nthe United States is $398.24, and the Canadian price is $189. I mention \nthis because I ran into a teacher a couple months ago in my hometown \nwho, when I met him--I have not seen him for a while--I said: How are \nyou doing? We shook hands. I know Parkinson's. Both my parents had it. \nI know it in the palm of my hand. I felt the shake. I said: Are you \ntaking Sinemet?\n  He said: Yes, but there is a better drug.\n  I said: Are you taking the other one?\n  He said: I cannot afford it.\n  This is by way of an example.\n  Did the Senator from North Dakota mention tamoxifen? It is a breast \ncancer drug. The United States price, same bottle, is $287; Canadian \nprice, $24. I wanted to add two more examples to what my colleague \nmentioned.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Tamoxifen is a good example because it is priced at 10 \ntimes the Canadian price for those in this country who need it to deal \nwith breast cancer. It is a good example.\n  This is a chart that shows other drugs, which I have not listed. It \nshows the substantial changes in prices between the United States and \nCanada.\n  Let me make a couple additional points.\n  I do not come here suggesting that the pharmaceutical manufacturing \nindustry or the manufacturers themselves are bad. I do not suggest they \nare bad companies. In many cases, they do good work. They produce \nlifesaving miracle drugs. I might say, they could from time to time \ngive more credit to the American taxpayer for some of that because a \nsubstantial amount of research also goes on through the National \nInstitutes of Health that is federally funded, the benefits of which \nthen are used by the pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n  It is not my intention to tarnish those manufacturers as somehow \nunworthy companies. It is my point to say that the pricing strategy \nemployed by those manufacturers is wrong and it penalizes the American \nconsumer.\n  They say: We must have this kind of pricing practice and pricing \nstrategy by which the American consumer pays the highest prices by far \nbecause that is the way we get the money to do research and \ndevelopment.\n  It is interesting that a report I read says they do slightly more \nresearch and development in Europe than they do in the United States: \n37 percent in Europe; 36 percent in the United States. And still in \nvirtually every country in Europe, they charge a much lower price for \nthe identical prescription drug they sell in the United States.\n\n  It is not the case that this is all about research and development. \nThe legislation we have introduced, the Prescription Drug Price Parity \nfor Americans Act, would allow U.S. consumers to benefit from the \ninternational price competition for prescription medicines.\n  We have changed this approach from the previous legislation that was \nenacted by the Congress because we make this apply only to the country \nof Canada. We would like licensed and registered pharmacists and \ndistributors to be able to reimport into this country prescription \ndrugs that are approved by the FDA. We are limiting that to Canada \nonly. We will allow in this legislation pharmacists and distributors to \naccess FDA-approved drugs from Canada and bring them into this country \nand pass the savings along to the American consumer.\n  This bill would become effective immediately. We have, as I said, \npassed this legislation before. It has not been implemented by two \nadministrations because some have raised the question that this would \npose risks for the consumer. However, we have included provisions in \nthis legislation on page 9 addressing suspension of importation which \nwill minimize those risks.\n  While I talk about that for a moment, let me describe why I think \nthose risks are very minimal. Of course, we now have risks with respect \nto the shipment of prescription drugs across borders. We ship a \nsubstantial amount of United States manufactured drugs to Canada. In \nfact, the Congressional Research Service has a report quoting an \ninformation officer from Canada who says that most of the \npharmaceuticals marketed and distributed in Canada originate from U.S. \nmanufacturers.\n  The question we should ask, it seems to me, as policymakers, is, Why \nshould an American citizen have to go to Canada to get a fair price on \na prescription drug made in the United States? It is a rhetorical \nquestion but I suspect one without an answer in this Chamber.\n  In any event, a substantial amount of the prescription drugs sold in \nCanada are prescription drugs originating in the United States, and \nthere is now a law on the books that says the United States consumer, \nthrough their pharmacists or through their licensed distributors, may \nnot access those drugs even if they are less costly in Canada. In my \njudgment, that makes no sense at all.\n  Included in the legislation we have introduced is a provision that \nwould allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to suspend \nreimportation. Let me read the language we are including in the second-\ndegree amendment:\n\n       The Secretary shall require that importations of a specific \n     prescription drug or importations by a specific importer \n     under subsection (b) be immediately suspended on discovery of \n     a pattern of importation of the prescription drugs or by the \n     importer that is counterfeit or in violation of any \n     requirement under this section or poses an additional risk to \n     the public health until an investigation is completed and the \n     Secretary determines that the public is adequately protected \n     from counterfeit and violative prescription drugs being \n     imported under subsection (b).\n\n  David Kessler, former head of the FDA, had this to say in a letter to \nus:\n\n       The Senate bill which allows only the importation of FDA-\n     approved drugs, manufactured in approved FDA facilities, for \n     which the chain of custody has been maintained, addresses my \n     fundamental concerns.\n\n  This is a larger description of his letter:\n\n       Let me address your specific questions. I believe U.S. \n     licensed pharmacists and wholesalers who know how drugs need \n     to be stored and handled and would be importing them under \n     the strict oversight of the FDA are well positioned to safely \n     import quality products rather than having American consumers \n     do this on their own.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service report I referred to a few moments \nago is a report that I had asked they complete in which they should \nevaluate the chain of custody in Canada so we would understand whether \nthere is a chain of custody issue.\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\n  If we manufacture a prescription drug, for example, in the United \nStates and send it to end up on the shelf of a drugstore in Winnipeg, \nCanada, is there a chain of custody problem that would allow someone to \nsay: You cannot have a pharmacist go to Winnipeg and buy that drug \nbecause that is inherently unsafe?\n  The answer is no, that is just sheer nonsense that there is any kind \nof a problem with that.\n  The CRS report says both countries have similar requirements and \nprocesses for reviewing and approving pharmaceuticals, including \ncompliance with good manufacturing practices. We have similar rules for \nrequiring labeling. The Canadian Federal Government inspects drug \nmanufacturing facilities. Pharmacists and drug wholesalers have to be \nlicensed. There is no chain of custody question.\n  I understand one thing about this. If I were a pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer, I would want to kill this legislation. Why? Because the \npharmaceutical industry confronts price controls in some other \ncountries, and they do not like them. Those price controls allow them \nto charge their costs and add a profit to it, and that is the price \nthey are able to exact.\n  There are no price controls in this country. So the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers make the point that, if you can reimport prescription \ndrugs from somewhere else such as Canada, you are reimporting price \ncontrols from Canada.\n  We have price controls in this country really. It is just that the \nprescription drug manufacturers control the price, and they control the \nprice by charging the U.S. consumer the highest prices in the world. \nMedicine after medicine, we find the U.S. consumers paying the highest \nprices in the world.\n  Lifesaving prescription drugs save no lives if you cannot afford to \npurchase them. Show me something else in the daily lives of the \nAmerican people, or especially of senior citizens, that they need--that \nthey don't have a choice on--that is increasing at 16, 17, 18 percent a \nyear. Can anyone come up with anything that relates to those kinds of \nrelentless increases? I do not think anyone can.\n  I want us to continue an aggressive search for miracle drugs and \nlifesaving medicines. That is why many of us in this Chamber have \nagreed to double the amount of funding at the National Institutes of \nHealth. This is the fifth and final year to do that. We have gone from \n$12 billion to $24 billion. That was bipartisan. We did it. I want the \ndrug manufacturers as well to also engage in robust research and \ndevelopment. I support research and development tax credits for that \npurpose, from which they benefit. But I do not want the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers to say to the American people: We have a scheme by which \nwe will impose upon you the highest prices of any group of people in \nthe world for our prescription drugs. We will have multitiered price \npolicies, and you, American citizens, shall pay the highest. We want \nyou to pay 10 times the cost for tamoxifen that our friends in \nWinnipeg, Canada, are charged. We want you to pay substantially higher \nprices for Zocor, Lipitor, Premarin, and Celebrex. It is simply not \nfair.\n  The point of this amendment is not to try to force anyone to go to \nCanada to buy prescription drugs. It is to try to force a repricing of \nprescription drugs in this country, for if our registered pharmacists \nand licensed distributors can access an FDA-approved drug in Canada and \nbring it back and pass the savings along, it will certainly force a \nrepricing of prescription drugs in this country. That is my goal. That \nis our goal.\n  So what we have today is an amendment that will allow the \nreimportation, under very strict circumstances, of FDA approved \nprescription drugs from Canada to the United States only by \nlicensed distributors and licensed pharmacists, and that will put \ndownward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n\n  What we also have in this Chamber, I think, are those who want to \nkill this because the pharmaceutical industry does not like it. I \nunderstand that. If I were the pharmaceutical industry, I would not \nlike it either. They have the best deal in the world in the United \nStates, but it is unfair to American consumers. It is unfair to those \nin this country who need prescription drugs, who need lifesaving drugs, \nwho need these miracle drugs, and cannot afford them.\n  So even while we put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nplan, which I fully support, we must pass the underlying generic \namendment, which also has the effect of putting downward pressure on \nprices.\n  We must pass this amendment, the reimportation amendment, which gives \nvery careful consideration to the safety issues that others have \nraised, and we should not fear, and we should not shrink from, the \npharmaceutical manufacturers' attacks that somehow this is bad public \npolicy.\n  It is good public policy. They just do not like it. It is good public \npolicy for the American consumer, and it is safe for the American \nconsumer as well. My hope is that my colleagues will support this \namendment and I strongly urge them to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the fine presentation of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, which is standard for the Senator from North Dakota, \nI have been speaking with the managers of the bill. The other side \nwould accept his amendment by voice vote. I have not had a chance to \nspeak to the Senator from North Dakota, but it is my understanding that \nhe does want a recorded vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask the manager of the bill and Senator Cochran, who \nis heavily involved in this, if we could set a time--we would draw \nsomething up on paper--for a vote on this amendment at 2:30? I do not, \nfrankly, know if all the time would be taken up on this amendment. This \nwould give the Senator from Mississippi time, if he were so inclined, \nto talk about his amendment. Part of the deal would be that the next \namendment in order would be the amendment of the Senator from \nMississippi, which will, of course, occur if this passes, and it \nobviously is going to.\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as the position of the Senator from Mississippi is \nprotected as being the next amendment offered, I certainly have no \nobjection, but it is the call of the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to \nrecommend that to our side of the aisle. The only Senators I know of \nwho want to be heard on this amendment I will offer after the amendment \nof Senator from North Dakota are Senator Breaux and Senator Roberts, \nboth of whom have expressed an interest in this amendment. I would like \nthe opportunity to see, though, if there are others who want to speak \nand make sure we can accommodate everybody. But I personally do \nnot have any objection to a 2:30 vote.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Mississippi, I am sure his \namendment will take a little bit of time because he has people who want \nto speak on it; the majority and others want to speak on it. We will \nnot set a time for dealing with his amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Good.\n  Mr. REID. If it gets out of hand, we can always move to table, but I \nam sure the Senator from Mississippi, being one of the most experienced \nlegislators we have, understands the rules. We will try to be fair and \nmove this along as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. We will be glad to try to work with \nhim to accommodate that suggestion.\n  Mr. REID. What we will do is have the staffs prepare something on \npaper, but generally we all understand what it would be; there would be \na vote on the Dorgan amendment at 2:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. With no intervening action?\n  Mr. REID. No intervening action. The person next to be recognized to \noffer an amendment would be the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. GREGG. With the time equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could say to the Senator from \nNevada, and I will relinquish the floor in a second, one of the things \nwe need to do on our side--I know Senator Stabenow wants to speak on \nthis. There are other Senators who also want to speak.\n  Mr. REID. That is why I set the time. We have until 2:30, and even \nthough\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\nthere is a conference, people can step out of that and speak. So we \nwill prepare something, and we should have it in the next few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before there is any unanimous consent agreement \npropounded, I do want to make sure I state to my colleague from North \nDakota we have quite a few Senators who have worked on this for some \ntime and we want to make sure they do have a chance to come down.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota and my colleague from \nMichigan, and all the other Senators on both sides of the aisle, who \nsupport this legislation. I think this has been like about 5 years of \nwork, as I think back to when some of us first started this journey.\n  One of the things I want to do right away is deal with one of the \narguments that are made against this legislation. It is an argument by \nthe pharmaceutical companies that, look, we have to charge American \ncitizens a lot more because we need that money for the research. \nSenator Stabenow was there, Senator Graham was there, as well as \nSenator Miller.\n  One of the arguments we hear over and over again from the \npharmaceutical companies, the drug companies, is they need to make this \nexcessive amount of money, they need to have the very high priced drugs \nbecause this goes to research for the miracle drugs that help everyone.\n  When the President was in Minneapolis in my State last week, he \nadopted the pharmaceutical or the drug lobby's position and said that \nthe high prices everyone sees are necessary to sustain the research and \ndevelopment.\n  One of the arguments made against this reimportation bill is, if you \nbegin to do that and people start getting discounts and we cannot \ncharge as much, we cannot put the money into the research. Families USA \ncame out with a report they called ``Profiting From Pain.'' They looked \nat the drug company's recent submissions before the Securities and \nExchange Commission about their activities in 2001. They looked at the \nnine publicly traded companies that market the top 50 drugs to seniors. \nI will go over their key findings.\n  The first finding is these large pharmaceutical companies spent $45.4 \nbillion on marketing and advertising and administration--this is from \ntheir own SEC report--and $19 billion for research and development--\n2\\1/2\\ times more for marketing, advertising, and administration as for \nresearch and development.\n  The second finding for profits over the last 10 years, profits last \nyear as percentage of revenue, was 18.5 percent, 5.5 times the median \nprofit for the Fortune 500 companies.\n  The third key finding is these companies lavish huge compensation \npackages and even larger stock options--does this sound familiar to \nanyone--to the top drug executives. Mr. C.A. Heimbold, the former \nchairman at Bristol-Myers, had the following compensation package, not \nincluding unexercised stock options: Ready? $74.9 million; John R. \nStafford, chairman of Wyeth, $44.5 million. The five highest paid \nexecutives received over $183 million last year.\n  Looking at the unexercised stock options, Mr. Raymond Gilmartin, \npresident and CEO of Merck, $93.3 million; Mr. C.A. Heimbold, $76.1 \nmillion; two Pfizer executives, $60.2 million and 56.5 million.\n  I make the plea in the Senate because pharmaceutical companies do not \nwant this bill. By the way, I said to my colleague from Michigan, who \nhas worked so hard on this, one of the reasons I love this legislation, \nthis helps all of our citizens, all our families. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies and wholesalers can meet every strict FDA safety rule, \nreimport back the prescription drugs and pass on the savings. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  The drug industry should stop scaring citizens in our country, \nseniors and others, with the false claim that if there is a discount \nand people are charged a reasonable price, this will prevent research \nin medicine. I thank Families USA for their excellent study. I make the \npoint which they made today, in light of the huge industry profits, \nenormous executive compensation and big marketing budgets, these claims \nthat we need to rip people off with the obsessive, obscene profits in \norder to do the research, are irresponsible and wrong.\n  The next point, by way of context of this amendment, it seems to me \nthe drug companies in this country are making Viagra-like profits--you \nget the meaning of what I am saying--on the backs of American \nconsumers, on the backs of Minnesota consumers. The thought that these \ncompanies, acting as a cartel, can make Viagra-like profits based on \nthe misery and illness and sickness of people is obscene.\n\n  We are going to do something about it and we are going to make sure \npeople in Minnesota and people around the country get a discount and \nthey get the same fair price that people in Canada get so people can \nafford these prescriptions that are so important.\n  What does our amendment do? It allows for the reimportation of the \ndrugs from Canada. Believe me, many citizens from Michigan and \nMinnesota and North Dakota know all too well what the differences are. \nPeople can save as much as 40 percent, if not more, for their \nprescription drugs. The amendment of Senator Dorgan, myself, Senator \nStabenow, and others would allow pharmacists, drug wholesalers, and \nindividuals to reimport safe and effective FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs from Canada. These drugs, developed in the United States, are \navailable in Canada for a fraction of the price of what we get charged. \nThis would help not only senior citizens but other Minnesotans and \nother Americans as well.\n  Some examples to add to what my colleague from North Dakota \nmentioned: Coumadin, blood thinner, same bottle, $20.99 in the United \nStates; Canadian price is $6.23. Zocor, a cholesterol drug, is $116.69 \nin the United States and $53.51 in Canada--same bottle, same \nprescription. Permax, for Parkinson's disease, which so important to \npeople with that neurological disease, is $398.24 in the United States, \n$189 in Canada. Tamoxifen, a breast cancer drug, is $287 in the United \nStates, $24.78 in Canada.\n  When I am traveling around Minnesota, people are asking me, more than \nanything else, can't we get a discount? Isn't there something to do to \nmake the drugs affordable? A lot of Minnesotans ask why we can't have \nthe same price as our neighbors to the north. This is the best of free \ntrade and fair trade. Let our pharmacists and wholesalers meeting FDA \nguidelines reimport these drugs back and pass on the savings to the \ncitizens we represent.\n  We have a provision for a suspension. If there is a problem with the \ndrug, the Secretary can stop the batch of drugs coming into the United \nStates until the investigation is completed.\n  Now we made it stronger, saying if there is any risk to public \nhealth, any kind of risk at all to people in this country who deals \nwith public health where we have to worry about a batch of drugs that \nshould not be in here, that violates safety standard, then the \nSecretary can stop the importation immediately. It is important to \nprotect the health of people. We do that. This language assures that \nbad drugs are not going to reach patients in the United States and the \nSecretary at that point in time can suspend those drugs.\n  What we cannot do, and what I want every Senator to be aware of, we \ncannot let the pharmaceutical industry gut this amendment. We cannot \nsay that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, be it Democrat or \nRepublican, can set out conditions and certify those conditions have to \nbe met before we have the reimportation. If that is the case, we will \nallow any Secretary of Health and Human Services in any administration \nto kill this.\n  Our citizens are tired of being ripped off. They are tired of the \npharmaceutical companies running the show. Our people want a discount. \nWe move forward with this. If, God forbid, there is any tampering with \nany drugs or any violation of public safety, then the Secretary of \nState can immediately suspend. But we do not want to have any kind of \nprovision or any kind of amendment that passes that creates a huge \nloophole that enables the pharmaceutical industry to do all their \nbehind the scenes lobbying and kill this legislation so that, in fact, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services never ends\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nup implementing it. That is not what the people in Minnesota are \nasking. That is not what people in the country are asking.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n2:30 today be for debate on the pending amendments, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Dorgan and Gregg or \ntheir designees; that no intervening amendment be in order prior to the \ndisposition of amendment No. 4300; that a vote on or in relation to \namendment No. 4300 occur at 2:30 this afternoon, without further \nintervening action or debate; provided further, upon disposition of \nthat amendment, Senator Cochran be recognized to offer an amendment on \nthe issue of drug reimportation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I will take 1 more minute. Other \nSenators want to speak. Senator Stabenow has been a leader on this \nlegislation for a long time and has been coordinating the effort of all \nDemocrats.\n  Let me just conclude this way: I know Senators do not want to be seen \nas opposing an amendment that would enable all of our seniors and all \nof our citizens to be able to get a reasonable price for prescription \ndrugs. My fear is that we will have an amendment out here with fine-\nsounding language which will create a huge loophole and will basically \nkill this amendment by giving any Secretary of Health and Human \nServices the ability to stop this legislation before it is ever \nimplemented. That is unacceptable. That is unacceptable. We cannot let \nthe pharmaceutical industry kill this bill and kill this amendment.\n  I believe that people in Minnesota, people in Michigan, and people \naround the country look at this as simple. I have said it before. I \nwill conclude it this way. I think this is a test case of whether we \nhave a system of democracy for the few or a democracy for the many. If \nit is a democracy for the many, we will support this provision. If is \ndemocracy for a few of the pharmaceutical companies, the devil is in \nthe details. They will be able to create a huge loophole, which will \nmean this will never be implemented and they will be able to kill it.\n  I urge all colleagues to support this Dorgan, Wellstone, Stabenow, et \nal, amendment and to resist any amendment to essentially gut this \namendment and stop this piece of legislation from being implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 3763\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mrs. STABENOW. I thank the Chair, I yield myself up to 15 minutes \nunder the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, this is a very important second-degree \namendment that not only will help our seniors be able to lower the \nprices they pay for prescription drugs, as my colleagues have said. I \nthank the Senator from Minnesota for his ongoing leadership on this \nissue and, of course, the Senator from North Dakota for his sponsorship \nand ongoing leadership and advocacy, as well as my other colleagues who \nare cosponsoring this amendment.\n  This not only affects our seniors, this affects everyone. It affects \nthe president of Michigan State University, who called me about his \nhealth clinics and his college of medicine looking for ways to be able \nto lower prices so that he does not have to deal with possibly laying \noff more staff, which he had to do this year as a result of the \ndramatic increases in the health care costs at the university.\n  It addresses the big three automakers, small businesses, families, \nand everyone who is paying exorbitant prices for prescription drugs.\n  I want to start by quoting our President, President Bush, when he was \na candidate for President. He indicated that he thought this idea was a \ngood idea. He said:\n\n       Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made \n     sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas \n     to come back and other countries to come back into the United \n     States.\n  That was what then-candidate George W. Bush and now President Bush \nsaid makes sense. It does make sense. It made sense before. The problem \nbefore was that there was an amendment added which basically killed our \nability to be able to do this. We know that same amendment which is \nsupported by the pharmaceutical industry will be offered later. There \nwill be an attempt to kill it again.\n  But we are hopeful that our colleagues will join with us in what is a \nvery reasonable proposal that addresses any legitimate issues regarding \nsafety and health and allow us to open the border to Canada and be able \nto provide the kind of competition we need to lower prices.\n  I think it is important also to reiterate that at a September 5, \n2001, hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nConsumer Affairs, William Hubbard, FDA Senior Associate Commissioner, \ntestified:\n\n       I think as a potential patient, were I to be ill and \n     purchase a drug from Canada, I would have a relatively high \n     degree of confidence in Canadian drugs.\n\n  We know the Canadian system is similar to ours as it relates to the \nregulatory and safety system.\n  We feel very confident that this modest proposal of simply opening \nthe border to Canada--and we know that Canada right now exchanges goods \nand services with us every single day. We have the largest port of \nentry in Detroit, MI, which I am proud to represent, with over $1 \nbillion in goods going across. We trade every day with them.\n  We believe this proposal will allow one thing to be traded which is \ndesperately needed by our citizens and is not now allowed to go back \nand forth across that port of entry. It makes sense. This is a \nreasonable, modest proposal.\n  Instead of opening all of our borders, some would argue that this \ndoes not go far enough; that we should open to Mexico, Europe, or other \nplaces around the world. But we are taking a modest step to begin to \nshow that this kind of approach can work.\n  We want to simply start with Canada with a very modest approach that \nwill allow us to be able to share with our neighbors to the north the \nability to bring back to our citizens American-made prescription drugs \nwhich are sold in Canada.\n  I think this is an issue of fairness as well because we are talking \nabout prescription drugs on which we helped to underwrite research. As \nI have said so many times, $23.5 billion this year alone was given by \nthe taxpayers of this country. And I support that strongly. I support \nhaving that be a higher number. I think basic research into new \npotential treatments is absolutely critical and is a good investment. \nBut we are making those investments. We are then giving that \ninformation to the drug companies, that pick up the information and \nthen proceed to do their own research and development.\n  We allow tax writeoffs for that research and development, tax \ncredits, and tax reductions. We subsidize them further. We allow up to \n20-year patents so they can recover their costs because we know it \ncosts a lot to research and develop new drugs. So we let them be able \nto recover those costs without competition for their name brand. So we \nhighly subsidize--highly subsidize--this area; the most profitable \nindustry in the world, highly subsidized by American taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n  Then what do we get at the end of that process? The highest prices in \nthe world. One of the reasons is we close the borders to competition. \nAnd we are subsidizing heavily all of the research and development of \nnew medications that the Canadians enjoy, that people around the world \nenjoy, while we in fact pay the highest prices in the world.\n  I have had an opportunity to take a number of bus trips to Canada; \nthe latest was on June 10 of this year. I will just share with you some \nof the differences. My colleagues have talked about that as well. But \nit is shocking to take a mere 5-minute bus trip across a bridge or \nthrough a tunnel and see the dramatic differences in prices.\n  I might add, I am not interested in continuing to put people on buses \nor in cars to have to go over to Canada to get those lower priced \nmedications. What we want is the ability to bring them back, so that \nthe neighborhood pharmacy can offer these same kinds of prices. That is \nwhat this is all about, to bring them back and place them in the local \npharmacy.\n  But it is shocking when we look at the differences. Zoloft is an \nantidepressant drug. In Michigan, it costs $220.65 for a monthly \nsupply; in Canada, $129.05. So it is $220 versus $129. That difference \ncan buy food, pay the electric bill, pay the rent, it can be the \ndifference between someone having a quality of life that makes sense \nand one that involves struggling every day to pay for their \nmedications.\n  We also know one of the most dramatic differences is tamoxifen, which \nI have spoken about here before. Tamoxifen is a breast cancer treatment \ndrug. When we went to Canada, we were able to get it for $15. And back \nin Michigan it is $136.50.\n  If you have breast cancer and you are struggling to pay for your \nmedications to get the treatments you need to deal with all of the \nother issues in your life as well, the difference between $15 and $136 \na month is a big deal. That is why this amendment is a big deal. I hope \nour colleagues will join overwhelmingly in our amendment--which is, in \nfact, a bipartisan amendment, a tripartisan amendment--to say: Yes, it \nis time to be fair to Americans.\n  This is about fairness for Americans. It is about competition. It is \nabout opening the border in a way that maintains safety for our \ncitizens.\n  I would like to speak to a couple of the arguments that I know we \nwill hear from colleagues who are opposing this amendment and what the \ndrug companies have said.\n  The drug companies have said that bringing those prescription drugs \nback from Canada is not safe. For the record, drugs are already \nfrequently imported into this country, but predominantly by the \ncompanies themselves, by manufacturers.\n  I also note that individual consumers now are allowed to bring back \nup to a 90-day supply. Because of the concerns that have been raised, \nthey have looked the other way at the FDA and allow people, for \npersonal use, to bring back up to a 90-day supply.\n  In fact, according to the International Trade Commission, $14.7 \nbillion in drugs were imported into the United States in the year 2000, \nand $2.2 billion in drugs sold in Canada were originally made in the \nUnited States.\n  So it is ironic that the drug makers are saying that drugs cannot \nsafely move between the borders of the two countries. They do already. \nThe issue is price. The issue is who controls them moving back and \nforth. When the companies want to move them back and forth, they think \nit is fine. When the pharmacists want to move them back and forth or \nindividuals want to move them back and forth and get a lower price, it \nis not fine. They are the same medications. It is a question of who \ncontrols them.\n  In fact, in recent years the FDA has allowed thousands of American \nconsumers to import from Canada medications for their personal use \nevery year. The FDA Senior Associate Commissioner, as I said before, \nindicated that as a consumer he would have a relatively high degree of \nconfidence in drugs purchased from Canada. So these arguments do not \nmake sense. The arguments we will hear about safety do not make sense.\n  We will hear that safety standards in Canada are more lax than here \nin the United States. There was a September 2001 report by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service--which we all use--which \nconfirms that the United States and Canadian systems for drug approval, \nmanufacturing, labeling, and distribution are similarly strong in all \nrespects. Both countries have similar requirements and processing for \nreviewing and improving pharmaceuticals, including ensuring compliance \nwith good manufacturing practices.\n  Both countries also maintain ``closed drug distribution systems'' \nunder which wholesalers and pharmacists are licensed and inspected by \nFederal and/or local governments. All prescription drugs shipped in \nCanada must, by law, include the name and address of each company \ninvolved along with the chain of distribution.\n  Let me finally address one of the other myths I am sure we will hear \nmore about today, and that is that somehow our bill will allow Canada \nto become a conduit for counterfeit or contaminated drugs into the \nUnited States.\n  On the contrary, this bill provides for safe protections, many of \nwhich are not in current law. We go beyond current law, which we all \nknow needs to be done now as we look at so many areas of homeland \nsecurity.\n  We have gone beyond what is currently in place. If implemented, this \nbill would have the potential to decrease, more than today, the \npossibility of allowing counterfeit drugs into the United States.\n  We would provide there be strict FDA oversight, proof of FDA approval \nof imported medicines. There must be a paper chain of custody, which is \nimportant. Only licensed pharmacists and wholesalers would be able to \nimport medications for resale. They would have to meet requirements for \nhandling as strict as those in place by the manufacturers--equally \nstrict as what the manufacturers do today.\n  There will be lab testing to screen out counterfeits, registration \nwith Canadian pharmacists and wholesalers by HHS. There will be lab \ntesting to ensure purity, potency, and safety of medications.\n  We also say that the Secretary of Health and Human Services can \nimmediately suspend this provision, immediately suspend the importation \nof prescription medicines that appear to be counterfeit or otherwise \nviolate the law.\n  We have made it very clear that they can immediately suspend ``on \ndiscovery of a pattern of importation of the prescription drugs or by \nthe importer that it is counterfeit or in violation of any requirement \nunder this section or poses an additional risk to the public health''--\nthey can immediately suspend.\n  This is a responsible provision. It is a moderate provision. It opens \nthe border to a country that we trade with every day, whose system is \nsimilar to ours. It allows actions if in fact anything is found to \ncreate a threat to Americans in terms of our health and safety. It \nallows immediate action and suspension of this new provision.\n  I believe we have put into place something that is reasonable. It is \nlogical. It is long overdue. I am hopeful that we will have a strong \nbipartisan vote.\n  If we want to lower the prices immediately, without much, if any, \nexpenditure of taxpayers' dollars--if we want to do it immediately--all \nwe have to do is drop the barrier at the border to Canada.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The Dorgan amendment before the Senate has enormous potential to make \nmore prescription drugs more affordable for more people. The amendment \nis particularly important for our seniors, most of whom live on fixed \nincomes and constantly have to decide whether they can afford to fill \nthose prescriptions.\n  We have a bizarre situation. We manufacture drugs in America, but \nthey are sold at cheaper prices in other countries. Just a few \nexamples: Brand name drugs cost an average of 31 percent less in the \nUnited Kingdom than they do in the United States; 35 percent less in \nGermany; 38 percent less in Canada; 45 percent less in France; 48 \npercent less in Italy. The General Accounting Office has studied 121 \ndrugs\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\nand found that on average prescription drugs in the United States are \npriced 34 percent higher than the exact same products in Canada.\n  I travel around Michigan, and I listen to the stories of citizens who \nare trying to pay for expensive prescriptions and wonder why their \nneighbors in Canada, just a few miles away, are able to buy the exact \nsame drug, manufactured in America, often for half the price.\n  We conducted a survey this last February of two of the most commonly \nprescribed prescription drugs. In every case, the prescription in \nCanada cost significantly less than the same drug in Michigan. For \nexample, we looked at a number of pharmacies on both sides of the \nborder. A 1-month supply of Prilosec, a gastrointestinal drug, costs \nabout $126 in Michigan but only $71 in Canada. Similarly, a 1-month \nsupply of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, costs $74 in Michigan \nbut $41 in Canada.\n  As a result of these enormous price disparities, we have the \nspectacle of American citizens, mostly seniors, going into Canada by \nthe busload to buy American-made prescription drugs at a fraction of \nwhat they have to pay here. It is absurd. It is unconscionable that we \ngive pharmaceutical manufacturers tax breaks and direct grants to bring \nnew drugs to the market, and then those drugs cost more in America, \nwhere they are made, than they do in other countries. We subsidize the \ndrug costs for the rest of the planet, and that has to change.\n  The Dorgan amendment fixes this problem in two fundamental ways: \nFirst, the amendment allows U.S. licensed pharmacists and drug \nwholesalers to import FDA-approved medications from Canada. Second, the \namendment would allow individuals to import prescription drugs from \nCanada as long as the medicine is for their own personal use, as \nevidenced by a prescription, and is a 90-day supply or less.\n  These provisions will allow American citizens, through the \nappropriate channels, to take advantage of lower prescription drug \nprices in Canada.\n  According to a Boston University School of Public Health study, drug \nreimportation, just from Canada, could have saved consumers $38 billion \nin the year 2001, an enormous sum.\n  In the year 2000, the Senate approved strikingly similar legislation \nby a strong bipartisan vote of 74 to 21. Unfortunately, a technical \namendment blocked implementation of the legislation. Now the Senate can \nact again to bring lower priced prescription drugs to people who \ndesperately need them. We can act to bring in some competition. We can \nact to bring in some free trade. American scientific know-how has led \nto the development of hundreds of lifesaving and life-enhancing \nprescription drugs.\n  Some of the newer prescription drugs are modern-day medical miracles \nwhich help millions of Americans lead healthy lives well into their \ngolden years.\n  These drugs won't do any good if people can't afford them. It is that \nsimple and that demanding.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the Dorgan amendment and allow for \nthe reimportation of prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I yield myself 20 minutes to speak in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. From whose time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The time should be charged to that under the control of \nSenator Gregg. He has asked me, as his designee, to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to address the issue introduced in \nthe last hour and a half; that is, the issue of reimportation of drugs, \nespecially as it affects the safety of the American people. They have \nbeen introduced by the proponents of this legislation as myths. By \ncalling them myths, it is as if in some way we should say they are \nmyths. They are not real, therefore, let's proceed down this path.\n  I want to give a little bit of historical perspective to these so-\ncalled myths and explain to my colleagues why I believe they are not \nmyths but reality. The potential of such reality can result in direct \nharm as we look at public health and safety.\n  I look forward to the afternoon because the debate will continue. The \ndebate ultimately will start with cost and buses running back and forth \nto Canada. Then Senators will say that this idea is appealing and \ncritically important to pass so we can lower the cost of prescription \ndrugs. We are all for lowering prescription drugs costs. Prescription \ndrugs cost too much; they are out of reach today for too many people.\n  The focus is on cost. It is motivating and a driving force because it \nis something on which we all agree. Prescription drugs costs too much \ntoday--the rate of increase is too much. But to focus on cost without \nfocusing on public health and safety is wrong and irresponsible.\n  If we look at the legislative history of the consideration of \nreimportation of drugs and pharmaceutical agents from other parts of \nthe world outside of the borders of the United States to this country, \nwe have a lot to learn. It is a rich history in terms of lessons \nlearned.\n  I will not focus on the cost issue, but let me just dismiss the cost \nissue in terms of my comments now by saying there is no evidence that \nthis amendment will guarantee price savings. For seniors, individuals \nwith disabilities, or the American people who are listening today, \nthere is no evidence to indicate this. It is pretty dramatic, holding \nup two bottles and saying one comes from another country and one from \nthe here. The assumption is that it will reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs in the United States, however, that evidence is not \nthere.\n  What I want to focus on--and I think it is even worse than not being \nable to make that assurance to the American people--is my concern with \nhealth.\n  From July 1985 to June 1987, nine hearings were held and three \ninvestigative reports issued regarding the issue of reimportation of \npharmaceuticals. These efforts, over that time, led to the enactment of \nthe Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987. That law was specifically \ndesigned to protect America's health and safety against the risks of \ndrugs that in some way may have been altered or counterfeit imported \nmedicines.\n  The act, a product of the debate at that time, found among other \nthings, ``a significant volume of pharmaceuticals are being reimported. \nThese goods present a health and safety risk to American consumers \nbecause they may become subpotent or adulterated during foreign \nhandling and shipping.''\n  The overall purpose of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 \nwas to ``to decrease the risk of counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, \nsubpotent or expired prescription drugs reaching the American public.''\n  In the Committee report which accompanied the Prescription Drug \nMarketing Act, the Commerce Committee concluded:\n\n       Reimported pharmaceuticals threaten the American public \n     health in two ways. First, foreign counterfeits, falsely \n     described as reimported U.S.-produced drugs, have entered the \n     distribution system. Second, proper storage and handling of \n     legitimate pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed by U.S. law \n     once the drugs have left the boundaries of the United States.\n\n  I mentioned the history because it is incumbent upon us--as we look \nat this legislation and change, modify, defeat, pass, improve, \nstrengthen this legislation--that we have to address the issues that \nwere so prominently raised at that time. That was from 1985 to 1987. At \nthat time, we did not have nearly as many cost concerns as we do today.\n  In 2000, as was mentioned on the floor, Congress revisited the issue \nand passed at that time the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act. This \nact allowed reimportation of prescription drugs if the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services could guarantee the safety and certify that \ncost savings would result. Safety and cost savings, again, are two \nissues that remain current today. We want to bring down the cost of \nprescription drugs, but we certainly do not want to do it if it is \ngoing to hurt the American people.\n  Since that time, two Secretaries of Health and Human Services--of two \nadministrations--have stated that the Food and Drug Administration \ncannot guarantee the safety of reimported prescription drugs.\n  In fact, then-Secretary Shalala called it ``impossible . . . to \ndemonstrate that [reimportation] is safe\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\nand cost effective.'' Let us jump to the next administration.\n  Secretary Thompson also concluded that reimportation would ``pose a \ngreater public health risk than we face today and a loss of confidence \nby Americans in the safety of our drug supply.''\n  Those were Secretaries of Health and Human Services and their overall \napproach in reimportation.\n  Let us now turn to the Commissioners of the FDA. When FDA Deputy \nCommissioner Lester Crawford was asked to comment on ``whether \nreimportation (from Canada) now raises greater challenges than it did \npreviously''--meaning prior to September 11--and ``what is your view as \nit relates to safety as it relates to drugs for the consuming \nAmericans,'' Deputy Commissioner Lester Crawford replied, ``The problem \nwould be if it becomes apparent to the rest of the world, including the \nworld of terrorists that we are not interdicting shipments of drugs \nthat come from Canada. . . . I think this is a signal to a would-be \nterrorist that this might be a way to enter the United States. . . . It \nalso would be a signal to a community that it is not as dangerous as \nterrorists obviously, but to the transshippers and these would-be \npeople in various countries that may not have a regulatory system or \nmay not have a regulatory system for exported drugs. . . .\n  I think the important issue is that we are in a new world, compared \neven to 2 years ago, and that it is incumbent upon us to address this \nwhole idea of having drugs produced or imported or reimported from \noutside our boundaries at the same time we are trying to strengthen our \nboundaries in terms of what comes into this country. How careful can we \nbe, how assured can we be that a product is not counterfeit, has not \nbeen adulterated, or is not the product of somebody who has ill intent \nagainst America. At the same time, we are working to make the borders \nless porous and tightly overseen, we want to make our borders more \nporous when it comes to chemical and pharmaceutical agents.\n  Former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Jane Henney, expressed \nsevere reservations regarding the importation of drugs. This is from a \ndifferent administration than the current one. Dr. Henney said:\n\n       The trackability of a drug is more than in question. Where \n     did the bulk product come from? How is it manufactured? \n     You're just putting yourself at increased risk when you don't \n     know all of these things.\n\n  Let us go back to another FDA Commissioner. Remember, the FDA \nCommissioners are those people who we have, as a nation, given the \nresponsibility of overseeing the public's health and safety of food and \ndrugs. Dr. David Kessler, former head of FDA, stated:\n\n       In my view, the dangers of allowing reimportation of \n     prescription drugs may be even greater today than they were \n     in 1986. For example, with the rise of Internet pharmacies, \n     the opportunities of illicit distribution of adulterated and \n     counterfeit products have grown well beyond those available \n     in prior years.\n\n  That is David Kessler, former head of FDA. He continues:\n\n       Repealing the prohibition on reimportation of drugs would \n     remove one of the principal statutory tools for dealing with \n     this growing issue.\n\n  Let us look back to an FDA Commissioner from the Carter \nadministration, Dr. Jere Goyan, who said it best. This is FDA \nCommissioner Goyan:\n\n       I respect the motivation of the Members of Congress who \n     support this legislation. They are reading, as I am, stories \n     about the high prescription drug prices and people which are \n     unable to pay for the drugs they need. But the solution to \n     this problem lies in better insurance coverage for people who \n     need prescription drugs, not in threatening the quality of \n     medicines for us all.\n\n  It is important because, again, in our urge to bring down the cost of \nprescription drugs and restrain that skyrocketing of costs, we do not \nwant to put drugs out of the reach of the American people. We do not \nwant to do that unintentionally.\n  Given the statements of the FDA Commissioners and the Secretaries of \nHealth and Human Services, we do not want to open the door and increase \nthe risk to the public health.\n  Last fall the FDA affirmed its concern about the safety of reimported \ndrugs--even those from Canada, and I understand the underlying \namendment is focusing on one country--stating they could not even \nprovide safety assurances for those drugs entering the Nation over our \nnorthern border. The FDA further noted that reimported drugs ``pose \nconsiderable risks to consumers because they may be counterfeit, \nexpired, superpotent, subpotent, simply tainted, or mislabeled.''\n  I point this out early in the debate and want to turn to other people \nand to the other side, who say: Yes, our amendments are written with \nmore safeguards in the pieces of legislation that come forward. I think \nthat needs to be debated. Ultimately, the safety issue is the key issue \nin addressing this legislation as we shape it and vote for or against \nit.\n  I fear that, in spite of the proponents' attempts in the underlying \namendment to establish a mechanism to assure safety--and it is fairly \nelaborate--a lack of success, lack of assurance of having these safety \nmechanisms, at the end of the day, puts at risk the American people. \nThis is all in the interest of bringing down the cost of prescription \ndrugs, which is something that we agree with, but there are better and \nmore direct mechanisms to deal with that issue of cost.\n  We see an elaborate set of safety mechanisms that I think are \nimpossible to implement, which wholesalers and pharmacists are not \nequipped to handle and, more importantly, mechanisms that only \nultimately add--and nobody talks about it--to the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Regardless of whether a pharmaceutical is originally \nmanufactured here in the United States, once a drug leaves this country \nand crosses borders, I believe it is impossible to ensure that it is \nproperly handled. It is out of our reach and our vision. We can sort of \npass the laws and pass regulations, but in truth, we are not going to \nsee it.\n  It is impossible to guarantee how it is handled, stored, at what \ntemperature it is stored, and whether it is safe for eventual use.\n  Most people know--we have talked about this in the Chamber of this \nbody--it is very important how drugs are stored, at what temperature, \nand their potency. In fact, certain drugs that are used in a routine \nway, if improperly handled, can become lethal if mishandled in being \nbrought back into this country.\n  Even more hazardous to the health of Americans is counterfeit \nmedicines. I mentioned terrorism, and I do not want to overstate that, \nbut again, we are currently working very hard to fight issues such as \nbioterrorism. We are working hard to make sure we are able to track and \nregulate contents of agents that can be used against us. I do not think \nwe should be moving in the direction of opening those borders broadly \nwhen I contend it is impossible, or next to impossible, to guarantee \ntheir safety.\n  There is one interesting example. Gentamicin sulfate is a \nprescription medicine to treat people with resistant infections, \nabdominal infections, and people who are very ill. Several years ago, \nFDA reported that this drug resulted in 17 deaths and 202 serious \nreactions. This drug is a very powerful drug, a very good drug, and one \nof the best antibiotics out there when used in a targeted, specific \nway.\n  Ultimately, it was no surprise to later find that the medicines \ncausing these 17 deaths were being imported from another country. It \nwas not Canada. It happened to be China. Both the current and former \nleaders of the FDA have made it ultimately clear, really crystal clear, \nthat they will have a tough time establishing mechanisms that are \nsufficiently elaborate, complex, and detailed enough to ensure \npharmaceuticals coming into this country from foreign manufacturers are \nsafe to use.\n  The underlying amendment purports to address drug safety by only \nallowing U.S.-approved drugs to be reimported and incorporating a drug \ntesting requirement. Again, it sounds very good, but let me state up-\nfront--and we can debate it as the day goes on--end product testing, \nafter a drug has traveled and handled in certain ways, simply is not \nadequate. End product testing is not adequate to demonstrate that a \ndrug was manufactured in accordance with U.S.-approved standard and \nquality requirements.\n  Also, testing at the moment of import, at the time it actually comes \ninto the country, does not ensure the integrity of the drug throughout \nits shelf\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nlife once it arrives here. Drugs are fluid agents. They are agents that \ncan be adulterated. They can be changed, and, as I mentioned, their \nstorage is critically important.\n  I will close mentioning this whole danger of counterfeiting drugs \nbecause, again, in this environment post-September 11, it is one we \nneed to look at. We need to address this issue up-front. It is the new \nenvironment in which we are working. In that regard, I am hopeful we \ncan address this amendment to make absolutely sure we have safe drugs \nfor the American people. We need to make sure that we have not opened \nthe door at the same time we are putting interest in lowering costs and \nreducing costs over time, opened the door, opened our borders, or made \nthem more porous in a way that ultimately will hurt the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 21 \nminutes; and the Senator from Mississippi controls 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I am very \nhopeful it will be accepted in the Senate in a short time. There are \nsome interesting underlying facts. What we are finding now has been \nreferenced during the course of this debate. The United States and its \ntaxpayers are subsidizing the world in terms of prescription drugs. \nThat happens to be a fact.\n  The research for brand and generic drugs is basically now conducted \nin the United States. They have moved dramatically from Europe over the \nrecent years. With the doubling of the NIH budget, much of that is \nfunding basic research which is essential for the development of drugs. \nSo the taxpayer is paying for the funding of the NIH and then paying \nthe additional costs at home. Furthermore, these drugs are a good deal \ncheaper outside the United States.\n  We are doing for the rest of the world in the area of prescription \ndrugs what we are doing for our national security. We keep the Straits \nof Malacca open, the Suez Canal open, and the Panama Canal open. The \ngreat choke points of the world are free because of the U.S. Navy and \nthat is the way it is. We wish that it could be better. There are \nthings that could be done and should be done in this area. Nonetheless, \nthat is the case. That is one issue, if we are able to have prices that \nare reasonable for the American consumer, but we do not have that. One \nof the principal efforts of what we are discussing in the Senate is \ntaking steps to assure those families who are in need of prescription \ndrugs that they are going to have access to them.\n  We have an underlying bill that will make a very important \ndifference. The Dorgan amendment, cosponsored by our Democrat and \nRepublican colleagues, can make an important contribution to that as \nwell, and we will have follow-on amendments.\n  Rightfully, it has been identified that safety is a key issue. \nHowever, we are talking about drugs that are FDA approved and produced \nin plants that have FDA inspections. Many of the safety issues raised \nin Secretary Shalala's letter some years ago in criticism of a much \nbroader amendment by the Senator from North Dakota have been addressed \nin this legislation. The safety issues that have been addressed \nincluded the counterfeiting, the proliferation of handling, and a wide \nrange of other issues. They have been addressed in a very serious and \nresponsible way.\n  We are doing this against a background where we are free, thank \ngoodness, of examples or incidents where there has been contamination \nof drugs imported from Canada. That has not been true in terms of \nMexico and other countries, but it certainly has been true with Canada.\n  This is a very modest program, but it is an important one. It is a \nvital program certainly for millions of our citizens who live in or \naround the northern tier States. It has caught on because of the \nfrustration of our fellow citizens. And it is a legitimate frustration \nbecause of the fact that we in the Congress have not taken steps to \nassure that the generic drugs or that brand-name drugs are going to be \nsold at a more reasonable cost. It is out of frustration for that.\n  I do not hear those supporting this proposal saying they are in \nstrong support of the underlying proposal that will make the \navailability of drugs less expensive for the consumer, or other means \nas well. It is a question of the cumulative effect. This is targeted to \nCanada, where we have high regard and respect for their system of \nhandling these ingredients.\n  I think the issues which have been outlined and detailed expressing \nreservations about this proposal, certainly with regard to Secretary \nShalala, and to a significant extent Secretary Thompson, have been \naddressed by the Dorgan amendment. This will be a measured but very \nconstructive and important step in assuring that some of our citizens \nget vitally needed drugs.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, the fact is that if \npeople are not able to get drugs at all because they cannot afford \nthem, they are willing to take some risks to be able to get them. That \nis what this is about. We cannot make the excellent the enemy of the \ngood.\n  The opportunity for getting good quality drugs at reasonable prices \nwill make a difference, as the Senator has pointed out with his \nexamples of individuals with cancer who otherwise would not be able to \nafford any of the higher-priced drugs. So with all the inevitable \nhealth hazards that they are facing, it is either these drugs or no \ndrugs.\n  This is a measured step. It is one that is eminently worthwhile. I \ncommend my colleague for offering it, and hopefully it will be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Do we know with respect to those who are yielding time to \nthe opponents of this legislation, or at least yielding time on behalf \nof Senator Gregg, whether they will be using their time at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we are happy to abide by the unanimous \nconsent agreement which calls for a vote at 2:30. We have an indication \nthat there are Senators who want to talk. I will speak on the subject. \nWe already have had remarks by Senator Frist on this subject.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, as the Senator who offered the \namendment, I reserve some time to close debate.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank my colleague from North \nDakota, who has worked so hard on this legislation and has done such a \nwonderful job of crafting what is a very reasonable and modest \napproach.\n  I did want to respond to comments that had been made a little while \nago to emphasize again that this is a different proposal than was \nbrought before the Congress before it was passed. It is limited to \nCanada where we know there is a very similar safety regulatory \nstructure. We are trading back and forth. Our manufacturers of \nprescription drugs go back and forth across the border all the time. \nThe only difference is they control the prices, as opposed to giving \nconsumers the ability to have lower prices. So this is a different \nsystem. This is a system that sets up a number of protections, in fact \nmore protections than we have in current law.\n  So this is actually strengthening, and given the current times that \nwe are in, that makes sense. It makes sense to limit this to Canada as \na way to begin this process and see how it works, and it makes sense to \nadd all the safety provisions that are put in. It also makes sense to \nallow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to have the power to \nimmediately stop reimportation if, in fact, there is a\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nproblem. If there is a safety problem, if there is a health problem, if \nthere is a concern at all about counterfeit drugs, then the Secretary \nhas the ability, based on the evidence, to be able to stop this \nprocess.\n  So I believe we have built in a number of provisions that are very \nimportant, that are very responsible, and I believe this plan should go \nforward.\n  My colleague from Tennessee also said that there is no evidence we \nwill see prices lowered or that we will see the lower prices passed on. \nFirst, I would absolutely say what we do know. There is great evidence \nthat in fact our seniors--in fact everyone--are going to be paying \nhigher prescription drug prices every year. We do know that. We do know \nin the last year, the brand name companies raised the prices over three \ntimes the rate of inflation. We do know that. We do know there is an \nexplosion in advertising, two and a half times more in advertising, \nthan research. We know there is in fact an explosion in prices going on \nin this country. We do know that our families are desperate, that our \nseniors are desperate, and many have drug bills that are higher than \ntheir incomes; families struggling to help mom and dad, grandma and \ngrandpa.\n  We do know our small businesses are struggling to provide health care \nfor themselves and their employees. We do know too many workers find \nthemselves in a situation where their employer says: We have to have a \npay freeze in order to be able to afford your health care benefits.\n  We know that is predominately because of the rising prices of \nprescription drugs.\n  So even if one thinks this is not the best proposal in the world, it \nis better than what is occurring today for American consumers, for \nAmerican families, American seniors. I am very confident, in talking to \npharmacists, community pharmacists, those who are on the front lines \naround this country, that they would welcome the ability to have a \nlower cost product brought into their pharmacies so they can offer it \nto American citizens.\n  They are on the front lines. They see the senior that walks up, gives \nthe prescription for a 30-day supply of a drug, and then looks at the \nbill and comes back and says: Can I get one week's supply or I cannot \nget this at all. Or they take it home and they cut the pills in half. I \nhave known couples who both needed the same heart medicine. They buy \none and share it. We all know the stories.\n  I know that pharmacists in our neighborhood pharmacies are very much \nin support of efforts to bring in lower priced prescription drugs. One \nway to do that is by opening the border to Canada.\n  So I would simply rise to, again, voice strong support and my \npleasure at being a cosponsor of this amendment, having worked on this \nissue for a number of years. I urge my colleagues to get beyond the \nscare tactics and to support us in this reasonable, moderate effort to \nadd competition and lower prices for our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as the designee of Senator Gregg, I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  To refresh the memory of Senators on this subject and the fact that \nwe have had this issue before the Senate on an earlier occasion, 2 \nyears ago during the consideration of the annual appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration \nand related agencies, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, offered a \nsimilar amendment to allow drug reimportation. These were prescription \ndrug reimportation rights.\n  Senator Kohl, who was the ranking Democrat at the time on the \nappropriations subcommittee, and I, serving as chairman, offered an \namendment to that amendment which required a finding by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services that the implementation of that amendment \nwould not increase risk to public health and safety and that it would \nresult in a reduction in the cost of products to consumers.\n  This language was modified slightly in conference with the House. The \nword ``demonstrate'' was substituted for the word ``certified,'' but in \nall other respects the amendment survived conference and was a part of \nthe law.\n  Subsequent to that, Secretary Shalala, who was serving as the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration, \nwrote a letter to President Clinton describing her views about whether \nthe Department could demonstrate, as required by the law, that the \nreimportation rights would not cause any failure of safety standards \nand that it would reduce the costs of prescription drugs to those who \nreimported them.\n  Her letter suggested that she could not make such a demonstration; \nshe could not meet the requirements of the law and certify that.\n  Then at some point Senator Kohl became chairman of the subcommittee, \nand we thought we would be confronted in the next Congress with the \nsame amendment. So we had a meeting in his office with FDA officials, \nDepartment of HHS officials, and others, to discuss the views of the \nadministration on this subject. We had a new administration come to \ntown. Secretary Thompson was in the meeting.\n  I was impressed and surprised at how much counterfeiting of drugs \ngoes on; that countries manufacture and label and package drugs all \nover the world to look exactly like the drugs, some of which are off-\nthe-shelf medications in our drugstores throughout our country; others \nare prescription drugs you can buy only if you have a prescription from \na physician. They showed us parcel after parcel, illustration after \nillustration, of how much of this is going on around the world. They \ncautioned we should be very careful about accepting any language that \nwould make it easier for the counterfeiters and for those who would \nwant to do harm and bring such drugs into the country because there is \nno guarantee of their safety or efficacy, or that the strength stated \non the package is really what is on the inside.\n  By looking at the drugs or the medical devices, one could not tell \nthe difference. I could not tell the difference. No one could tell the \ndifference to decide whether this was safe or without a chemical \nanalysis.\n  The point of the story was, we were prepared to insist upon the same \nlanguage in the appropriations bill that we had gotten the Senate to \napprove unanimously the year before, 96 to 0. They voted on the \nlanguage that would make sure we would not be doing anything that would \naffect safety and that we really would be doing something to help \nreduce the cost of prescription drugs to America. But no amendment was \noffered.\n  I say that now by way of background and also to suggest to the \nSenate, after we vote on the Dorgan amendment, which says if you are \ngoing to permit reimportation and you find there is counterfeiting \ngoing on, you can suspend it. That is what this amendment says. OK, \nthat is harmless enough. Let's approve that when we vote at 2:30 on a \nregular vote. We agreed to accept this amendment by voice vote, but \nthere will be a recorded vote. I will vote for it. Sure, they ought to \nbe able to suspend reimportation if they find it to be counterfeit. But \nguess what. There is counterfeiting and they will find it. It is no big \nsecret.\n  This amendment is meaningless. What we will need to do after we adopt \nthe Dorgan amendment at 2:30, under the agreement I will offer the same \namendment. We will say that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nmust be able to certify that this will not adversely affect safety or \nbe a threat to U.S. consumers, and it will result in cost savings. I \nwant the Senator to know we will have an opportunity at that time to \nconsider another amendment to this proposal which I hope the Senate \nwill also adopt, as it has in the past, by unanimous vote.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Almost 2 years ago today, we visited the issue of whether to allow \nimportation of prescription drugs from other countries. The Senate has \nbefore it today The Prescription Drug Price Parity for Americans Act, \ndesigned to permit the commercial importation of prescription drugs \nfrom Canada and to permit personal importation of prescription drugs \nfrom any country.\n  S. 2244 is intended to modify the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act \nof 2000, MEDSA, attempts both to address the safety concerns voiced by \nFDA, DEA, U.S. Customs, Secretary of HHS,\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\nand others and also expand the personal importation exemption contained \nin current law.\n   As I will explain, reimportation was not a good idea then, and it is \nan absolutely terrible idea today, especially after 9/11.\n  The high cost of pharmaceuticals in indeed one of the most difficult \nmatters facing our society today. We face a harsh reality: At a time \nwhen scientists are able to offer an unbelievable new array of \nmedication, diagnostics, and vaccines, many Americans are encountering \ndifficulties in affording these state-of-the-art and often cost \ntherapeutics.\n  We have all heard stories of Americans going across the borders to \nMexico and Canada to purchase cheaper drugs. This type of activity is \nalso increasing over the Internet.\n  It may appear that the solution is simply to allow the importation of \nprescription drugs into our country. While I do not question the good \nintentions of those who believe this is the correct solution, we all \nmust be aware of the disturbing, lasting unintended and negative \nconsequences this proposal would have.\n  It have not possible to assure safety of reimported pharmaceuticals 2 \nyears ago. Sadly, it is even more difficult to do so today.\n  We are facing an unprecedented time in history. I need not point out \nto my colleagues the challenges this country is already facing in our \nwar on terrorism. Allowing drug reimportation is only going to further \nthreaten our safety and inundate our law enforcement and regulatory \nagencies.\n  As always, there are many issues at play in this debate. But, the \nnumber one fundamental issue at stake here is the safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  Assuring the American public that these imported drugs are safe and \neffective and unadulterated is next to impossible, especially now, in \nthe midst of a war on terror. I worry that a day will come when either \nan under-potent or over-potent or adulterated, either intentionally or \nunintentionally, batch of imported drugs will cause injury and even \ndeath.\n  Yes, we can have certifications and regulations and foreign \ninspections and every other policing mechanism you can think of, but \nthe fact remains we cannot police everyone around the world.\n  With this bill, we are opening a door that Congress prudently closed \nin 1988 when it enacted the Prescription Drug Marketing Act.\n  Let me give you a little background regarding the history of drug \nimportation law.\n  During the 1980s, the House Energy and Commerce Committee conducted a \nlengthy investigation into the foreign drug market that ultimately led \nto enactment of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act legislation--PDMA.\n  This bill was enacted after our nation experienced a series of \nserious adverse events due to improperly stored, handled, and \ntransported imported drugs. There were serious threats to public health \nand safety. That investigation discovered, among other things, that \npermitting reimportation of American drugs ``prevents effective control \nor even routine knowledge of the true sources of merchandise in a \nsignificant number of cases.'' As a result, the House Committee found \nthat ``pharmaceuticals whic have been mislabeled, misbranded, \nimproperly stored or shipped, have exceeded their expiration dates, or \nare bald counterfeits, are injected into the national distribution \nsystem for ultimate sale to consumers''. It was determined that we \ncould not prevent the introduction of substandard, ineffective, or even \ncounterfeit pharmaceuticals.\n\n  The PDMA was necessary to eliminate health and safety problems before \nserious injury to consumers could occur. the Committee report was clear \non why the PDMA was needed:\n  ``[R]eimported pharmaceuticals threaten the public health in two \nways. First, foreign counterfeits, falsely described as reimported U.S. \nproduced drugs, have entered the distribution system. Second, proper \nstorage and handling of legitimate pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed \nby U.S. law once the drugs have left the boundaries of the United \nStates.''\n  Now we place a high premium on our citizens receiving safe and \neffective products, free from adulteration and misbranding. The Dorgan \nbill, could unravel the protection that the PDMA provides us.\n  Dating from the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, through the 1938 \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the 1962 efficacy amendments \nwritten by the Senate Judiciary committee, and the 1988 Prescription \nDrug Marketing Act, our Nation has devised a regulatory system that \npainstakingly ensures drug products will be carefully controlled and \nmonitored all the way from the manufacturer to the patient's bedside.\n  Under the current Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDCA, it is \nunlawful for anyone to introduce into interstate commerce a new drug \nthat is not covered by an approved New Drug Application, NDA, or \nAbbreviated New Drug Application, ANDA. When a product is introduced \ninto interstate commerce that does not comply with an approved \napplication, it is considered an unapproved new drug in violation of \nsection 505 of the FDCA. It is also misbranded under section 502. These \nbasic rules cover importations, since importing is a form of \nintroducing a drug into interstate commerce. Under FDCA, a drug that is \nmanufactured in the US pursuant to an approved NDA and shipped to \nanother country may not be reimported into the US by anyone other than \nthe original manufacturer.\n  The provision restricting the right to reimport US drugs to the \noriginal manufacturer was designed to ensure that only the party that \ncan truly vouch for the purity of the drug is allowed to bring that \nmedicine back into the country. The prohibition on reimportation of \nproducts previously manufactured in the US and exported abroad was \nadded to the law in 1988 to guard against the entry of counterfeit and \nadulterated products into this country.\n  On the issue of importing drugs for personal use, FDA has had a \n``personal importation'' policy since the mid 1980s, which permits the \nimportation of an unapproved new drug for personal use, meaning the \nindividual may import no more than a 90 day supply, in certain \nsituations.\n  It was intended solely to allow unapproved medications into the US \nfor compassionate use. But over the years, there has been a tremendous \nincrease in volume and FDA has recently taken the position that the \npersonal importation policy has outgrown its usefulness and now \npresents a threat to public health.\n  In a letter to Congress, FDA reported that the personal importation \npolicy ``is difficult to implement . . . due in part to the enormous \nvolume of drugs being imported for personal use and the difficulty \nfaced by FDA inspectors, or even health practitioners, in identifying a \nmedicine by its appearance''. FDA lacks the ability to adequately \nmonitory the enormous volume of mail-order pharmaceuticals.\n  The FDA has therefore proposed to the Department of Health and Human \nServices that it eliminate its personal use policy for mail imports. \nThe Dorgan bill proposes to expand personal importation at a time when \nthe FDA is telling us that it can't handle this and wants us to stop \nthis policy.\n  In 2002, Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act--MEDSA--included a \nprovision that allowed an importer or wholesaler--in addition to the \noriginal manufacturer--to reimport US-manufactured drugs into the \nUnited States. But this provision would become effective only if the \nSecretary of HHS demonstrated to Congress that its implementation would \nimpose no additional risk to the public's health and safety and that it \nwould result in a significant reduction to the cost of covered products \nto the American consumer.\n  In December 2000, HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said she could not make \nthis determination, citing flaws in the legislation that could \n``undermine the potential for cost savings associate with'' \nprescription drug reimportation and that prescription drug \nreimportation ``could pose unnecessary public health risks''.\n  In July 2001, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson also declined to make this \ndemonstration on the premise that the safety of prescription drugs \ncould not be adequately guaranteed if reimportation were permitted \nunder its provisions.\n  So we have certifications by the top health officials of both the \nClinton and\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nBush administrations that reimportation is inherently unsafe. Are we \nwilling to say, that it is safer today to import drugs by mail and \nother avenues and that we can do a better job ensuring the safety of \nthese imported drugs? Especially after the tragic events we have been \nthrough?\n  The Dorgan bill, S. 2244, is a modified version of MEDSA. A review of \nS. 2244 will show that the new language is not significantly different \nfrom the MEDSA provisions that Secretary Shalala and Secretary Thompson \nrejected. Senator Dorgan, the sponsor of the bill, has stated that it \nis very similar to MEDSA.\n  Although the modifications in S. 2244 are intended to address \noriginal concerns inherent in MEDSA, they fall short of providing these \nsafeguards--safeguards which are nearly impossible to implement. The \nnew bill suffers from the same flaws as did MEDSA.\n  For example, S. 2244 is limited ostensibly to drugs imported from \nCanada. In fact, however, a drug could be imported from anywhere in the \nworld under this bill, as long as it entered the U.S. through Canada.\n  There is no effective way under this bill to prevent the \ntransshipment of drugs--legitimate or not--from other countries into \nCanada and then into the U.S. This would permit the entry of drugs that \nhave been manufactured, stored, shipped, and handled anywhere in the \nworld--in unsanitary conditions, unregulated conditions--and drugs that \nhave become adulterated and even toxic.\n  At a September 2001 hearing before the Senate Consumer Affairs, \nForeign Commerce, and Tourism Subcommittee, FDA's Senior Associate \nCommissioner for Policy, Planning, and Legislation, Bill Hubbard, \nwarned of this very risk. Mr. Hubbard stated, ``Even if the Canadian \nsystem is every bit as good as ours, and I don't know whether it is or \nnot . . . the Canadian system is open to vulnerabilities by people who \nwill try to enter the U.S. market again because that's where the money \nis.''\n  To give another example, S. 2244 differs from MEDSA insofar as it \nwould require manufacturers to allow importers to use their FDA-\napproved U.S. labeling free of charge. This could lead to an influx of \nmisbranded products into the U.S., as importers paste FDA-approved \nlabeling onto products from other parts of the world.\n  These drugs would be seen as an FDA-approved product manufactured and \nsold by a U.S. manufacturer--but could easily be a different product--a \ndrug that could have deteriorated, or been contained, subpotent, or \ntoxic. The products would be indistinguishable to a consumer in a local \npharmacy, to a health professional, and even to the FDA. Consumers \nwould be deceived by this practice, thinking the U.S. manufacturer had \nvouched for the purity, safety, and effectiveness of the product when \nin fact the manufacturer could not and had not.\n\n  Our top health care financing official has concerns as well. In March \n2002, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--CMS--told the Senate Finance Committee that CMS opposes the \nreimportation of prescription drugs into the U.S. ``We have opposed \nit,'' he stated. ``There is no way for FDA to monitor and regulate \ndrugs coming in from Canada, Mexico, or other countries.''\n  The Dorgan bill also permits a significantly lower standard for \npersonally imported drugs than applies to domestic drugs. The Dorgan \nbill could also open up a loophole in the FDCA for unscrupulous \ncommercial importers. It permits FDA to issue regulations permitting \nindividuals to reimport prescriptions not only in their personal \nluggage but also through the mail or other delivery services.\n  We all know there is no way for FDA to limit mail order shipments to \npersonal use. A commercial importer could simply divide its shipments \ninto 90-day quantities and mail them separately, taking advantage of \nthe personal use policy to introduce counterfeit products into the \nstream of U.S. commerce. This would overwhelm the ability of FDA and \nCustoms to process the millions of incoming packages. Many of the \ncriticisms of MEDSA--voiced by FDA, DEA, and others--apply equally to \nthe new Dorgan Bill.\n  Many senior officials in various agencies, including FDA, U.S. \nCustoms Service, the DEA, the Secretary of HHS warned of the difficulty \nin ensuring the purity and safety of reimported drugs.\n  Let's hear again what the experts have to say about reimportation.\n  William Hubbard, FDA Senior Associate Commissioner for Policy, \nPlanning and Legislation, June 7, 2001:\n\n       We are very concerned that a system, if designed to be a \n     different system than the current system, poses risks and we \n     cannot be assured that we could successfully implement such a \n     system and bring in safe drugs because we do not have the \n     same level of confidence about where it was manufactured, and \n     how it was manufactured, and by whom it was manufactured, \n     that we have under the current system.\n\n  Elizabeth Durant, Executive Director, Trade Programs, U.S. Customs \nService, June 7, 2001:\n\n       You can see the kinds of drugs that come through the mail. \n     They are not even in bottles many times, just loose in paper. \n     We have counterfeit drugs. We have gray-market drugs. We have \n     prohibited drugs and we have unapproved drugs. And this is a \n     situation that is pretty much replicated around the country.\n\n  We live in a very different world now after 9/11--a more dangerous, \nless certain world. We must question the safety of reimportation of \nprescription drugs even more than ever.\n  As Secretary Thompson cautioned on June 9, 2002:\n\n       Opening our borders to reimported drugs potentially could \n     increase the flow of counterfeit drugs, cheap foreign copies \n     of FDA-approved drugs, expired and contaminated drugs, and \n     drugs stored under inappropriate and unsafe conditions. In \n     light of the anthrax attacks of last fall, that's a risk we \n     simply cannot take.\n\n  That's the Secretary of Health and Human Services warning us.\n  Here's another quote from William Hubbard, FDA Senior Associate \nCommissioner for Policy, Planning and Legislation, July 9, 2002:\n\n       The cheaper drugs are there. We just have no way to say to \n     a given consumer, ``You have gotten a product that will \n     help--will save your life,'' and we fear that many people \n     will get a bad product that will hurt them.\n\n  We invest lots of money and resources in the United States to ensure \nthat medications and other therapeutics are made and distributed at the \nhighest quality and standards. Our agencies, while not perfect, have a \nremarkable record of protecting the public from contaminated, \nineffective, and unsafe drugs.\n\n  We cannot guarantee an acceptable level of quality and safety with \nre-imported drugs. We can't sacrifice quality and safety in the hopes \nof getting cheaper medications. What's the use of cheap drugs if they \ncan potentially do a great deal of harm and threaten the public's \nsafety?\n  Reestablishing a system where wholesalers and pharmacists may import \nprescription pharmaceuticals through Canada to the U.S. would recreate \nthe public health risk of counterfeit, unsafe, and adulterated drugs \nthat Congress sought to eliminate in the late 1980s with the \nPrescription Drug Marketing Act.\n  Even if we put aside these very real safety concerns, the idea that \nthe Dorgan bill can achieve the goal of bringing cheaper drug products \nto US consumers is unlikely.\n  This bill requires drug manufacturers to disseminate their drug \nformulations to potentially thousands of pharmacies and wholesalers. \nThis information, currently protected under patent laws, could be worth \nmillions of dollars per drug, on the black market. Unscrupulous \nindividuals could obtain drug formulations and learn how to make their \nfake drugs look real and survive chemical analysis.\n  Allowing individuals to pirate the hard work and innovation of \nAmerican drug companies to produce so called ``gray market'' products, \ncounterfeit products, is no way to ensure that Americans have access to \nthe latest pharmaceuticals in the long-run because they simply will not \nexist if we do not protect the work of our private sector companies.\n  While there is a clear and obvious health danger in a contaminated, \npirated product, there is also great detriment to the American public \nif the unscrupulous are allowed to reimport America's inventions back \ninto America without compensating the inventor. Few will be willing to \ninvest the upfront capital--hundreds of millions of dollars--to develop \na drug if another\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\nparty can make and sell the drug while it is under patent protection.\n  It takes an average of 15 years and a half a billion dollars to \ncreate one of the blockbuster drugs. So we have to be careful. We must \nbe able to continue to attract the private sector investment into \ncommitting to the research and development that has made the American \ndrug development pipeline so successful. We jeopardize this with \nreimportation of drugs.\n  We can't just do what appears on the surface to be good but, in \nessence, could kill people and undermine our fundamental system of \nencouraging innovation and rewarding hard work.\n  How successful is pharmaceutical innovation in Canada? They have \nprice controls, and nobody is going to invest the money into developing \nthese lifesaving and cost-saving drugs over the long run in those \ncountries with price controls.\n  This is another step toward price controls that will weaken one of \nthe most important industries in America at a time when we just mapped \nthe human genome, and we are at the point where we can actually create \nmore lifesaving medicines.\n  When the value of American inventions is stolen, it is American \ninventors and American consumers who suffer. The United States cannot \nand should not allow free riders around the world essentially to force \nthe American public to underwrite a disproportionate amount of the \nresearch and development that results in the next breakthrough product. \nOn the surface it seems there's no harm if drugs obtained from outside \nthe United States at prices lower than U.S. prices can be resold in the \nU.S.; presumably this could lower prevailing U.S. prices. But great \nharm can come from this. I can say that where nations impose price \ncontrols, the research and development we count on to bring us miracle \ncures is jeopardized.\n  How can we guarantee that foreign government price controllers will \nnot set an artificially low price on some new badly-needed Alzheimer's \nor Parkinson's or Lupus drug? We can be sure that this will have the \nunintended, but real, effect of convincing company officials to forgo \nresearch on this new class of drugs for fear that, in conjunction with \nthe new liberal re-import policy, they will not be able to recoup their \ninvestment?\n  Let's stop the free riders and cheap riders overseas while American \ncitizens are paying the full freight of R Look, I understand the \nappeal of bringing goods sold cheaper abroad back to the United States \nat presumable savings to U.S. citizens. Yet, the amendment provides no \nguarantee that those wholesalers and pharmacists importing the products \nwould pass their savings on to the consumer. And so, at best, with this \nbill we could be trading public safety for middleman profits.\n  We would also incur far more costs policing this endeavor. The cost \nof implementing the Dorgan bill would require very substantial \nresources at a time when we are stretching our funding to HHS and other \nfederal departments to prevent future terrorist incidents.\n  We have to find a way around this drug access problem in this country \nwithout creating a public health hazard and ``gray market''.\n  We will be importing not just drugs but some other government's \nquestionable safety standards and price controls into U.S. market \ndynamics.\n  In our valid and justified quest to help make drugs more affordable \nto the American public, we would be mindful not to unwittingly impede \ninnovation.\n  Even the Dean of the House, Representative John Dingell of Michigan \ndid not support similar legislation in the past when the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee issued a report that concluded that ``the very \nexistence of a market for reimported goods provides the perfect cover \nfor foreign counterfeits.''\n  The concerns are relevant to the Dorgan bill that we are considering \ntoday.\n  In our haste to bring cheaper drugs to seniors and other needy \nAmericans--an important and laudable goal--we risk making changes to \nkey health and safety laws and changes in our innovative pharmaceutical \nindustry that no one can afford. We must bring safe, effective drugs to \nAmericans, and particularly seniors, through avenues such as the \nTripartisan Medicare Bill.\n  We need to focus our efforts on passing a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit bill. We should not pass another feel-good drug reimportation \nbill before the election that we already know today will not and cannot \nbe implemented after the election.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6906-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the designation of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nBreaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you very much.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Mississippi who I think is \npreparing an amendment which will be offered later on in the debate on \nthe whole question of importation of drugs, which in essence is the \nsame amendment that 97 Senators voted for the last time we addressed \nthis issue on the question of importation of drugs.\n  Let me mention, to start with, that I think the topic of the debate \non how we can provide prescription drugs for all of our Nation's \nseniors is really the challenge that is before the Senate. We can get \nwaylaid, or delayed, or sidetracked by saying we are going to fix the \nproblem by opening our borders to imported drugs coming from foreign \ncountries or from Canada. That is something we need to discuss. But it \nis certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, going to solve the \nproblem of prescription drugs for seniors until we come up with a \ncomprehensive, across-the-board Medicare package that can guarantee \ninsurance coverage for prescription drugs just as every Member of the \nSenate has when we buy prescription drugs. That is the type of plan we \nhave. People compete for the right to sell us those drugs. We have a \nchoice between the plans that best can serve our families' needs at the \nbest possible price.\n  That is the type of system on which I think we should be working and, \nin fact, on which we are spending a great deal of time.\n  With regard to the specific issue before this body at the current \ntime--the\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nquestion of importation of prescription drugs from our neighbors to the \nnorth in the country of Canada--the concern I have with that is \nguaranteeing, before you allow these drugs to come into this country, \nthat they are going to be just as safe and just as real as the drugs we \nbuy in this country which are certified by the FDA and tracked from the \nmanufacturer all the way to the pharmacist and to the customer.\n  We had hearings just a week ago in the Senate Aging Committee where \nwe discussed the issue of counterfeit drugs. We had U.S. Customs come \nin, we had the FDA Administrator come in, and give us information from \ntheir perspective about imported drugs coming from Canada or from other \nforeign countries. Here are some statements from the FDA about the \nissue of imported drugs.\n  It is not just a question of whether they are cheaper. Of course, \nthey could be cheaper. I can get open heart surgery in Juarez, Mexico, \na lot cheaper than I can get it at the Houston Medical Center. The \nquestion is, Is that the type of open heart surgery I want? The answer, \nfrom my perspective--and I think most Americans--is that it is not. I \nwant it to be not just the cheapest price, I also want the best \nservice.\n  The issue is not where you can get the cheapest drugs but where you \ncan get drugs that are also affordable and are also the real thing.\n  It is estimated that about 8 percent of the drugs coming into the \nUnited States right now are counterfeit, and the projection is, if you \nopen up the borders, that amount will increase greatly.\n\n  Here is what the FDA said when testifying before the Senate Aging \nCommittee:\n\n       For those who buy drugs overseas, we have been consistently \n     saying that you are really taking a great risk. You certainly \n     risk your pocketbook, but you may be risking your health, and \n     you may even be risking your life.\n\n  FDA also said:\n\n       Unapproved drugs and reimported approved medications may be \n     contaminated, subpotent, superpotent, or counterfeit.\n\n  The final thing they said, which I think is significant because the \nargument is this is from Canada, and they are our friend, they are a \ndemocracy and not a third-world country, and it is all right to do it \nfrom Canada; we are not going to let you do it from Bangladesh, they \nsaid in our hearing:\n\n       Throwing the door open to drugs purchased by individuals \n     directly from Canadian sellers will encourage unscrupulous \n     individuals to devise schemes using Canada as a transshipment \n     point for dangerous products from all points around the \n     globe.\n\n  It is not just going to be drugs manufactured in Canada that can \npenetrate our border under an importation policy but drugs manufactured \nin Colombia, manufactured in Bangladesh, and manufactured in some very \nunsettled parts of the world that can be transshipped through Canada \nand come into the United States.\n  Here is an example. I have a lot of examples. Some of our colleagues \nhave held up two bottles and said: This bottle cost $350 in America, \nand this bottle of the same stuff cost $20 in Canada. That is fine, if \nit is the same stuff. The problem is when it is not the same stuff.\n  Here is an example of a product that is supposed to be an anti-\ninflammatory drug. This is great. This is a prescription drug. In this \nparticular case, they took a white powder. They stamped the name of the \nproduct into the little bitty pills. You can't tell the difference in \nthe pills. They put it in a blister pack and sold it as the drug \nPonstan. The only problem is that it sure looks like Ponstan. The \npackage looks like Ponstan. It has every word on it that the real thing \nhas, and the dosage is the same in fine print. The pill is exactly the \nsame. It has the name Ponstan stamped into it.\n  Here is what is really in it. When you analyze it, the yellow powder \nwhich they put in it, instead of being the real thing, ended up being \nstuff that could do grave damage. This happens to be boric acid, floor \nwax, and yellow, leaded highway paint. That is a heck of a thing to be \nable to do. Is this cheaper than the real stuff? Oh, yes, it is a lot \ncheaper. But I don't want to take a pill that says it is the real thing \nbut is yellow, leaded highway paint which they pressed into these \npackages and sold.\n\n  Can they sell it a lot cheaper? Yes. I can sell it for 2 cents a \npill. I don't care what I sell it for because it does not cost much to \nmake yellow, leaded highway paint and sell it as a pill and take it \nacross the border.\n  It is my understanding, in reading the legislation and amendment \nbefore this body, that you can immediately suspend importation, but \nafter the fact, after they have exhibited a pattern of importation of \ndrugs ``that is counterfeit or in violation of [these] requirement[s] . \n. . or poses an additional risk to the public health.'' After we \ndetermine that it is being done, then you can stop it from being done.\n  Isn't it better to have to have that certification up front before we \nallow them to start bringing things over the border that may be real or \nmay not be real; may be half real and half not real? Shouldn't we \nestablish what the rules are before we let them in?\n  The Senate has discussed and debated that issue. And by a unanimous \nvote, every single one of us who voted on this issue before supported \nthe Cochran amendment, 97 to 0, that said, before we can allow it to \nstart coming in, we have to have a system in place that is guaranteed \nby our Food and Drug Administration that it is coming in and it is not \ncounterfeited; it is safe; we have tracked the manufacturer and we know \nhow they make it, what they are doing, and what is in the little \npackets of pills.\n  The legislation before the committee, I fear, now says that only \nafter our Government determines that there is a pattern of \ncounterfeiting or a pattern of bringing in drugs that pose a risk to \nthe human health--then, and only then, can we suspend their operations.\n  Don't do it after the horse is already out of the barn. You have to \nstop it before it starts. How many people are going to have to take \nyellow, leaded highway paint before they can show there is a pattern of \ndoing this in order to come in with a suspension of these importations? \nDo we have to have five people--to create a pattern--get sick from \ntaking yellow, leaded highway paint? Do we have to have 100? I would \nnot want to be 1 of the 100, if that is the establishment of what we \nhave to do before we can suspend their operations.\n  It is far superior to take the approach: Yes, we will let you bring \nin imported drugs from Canada, but only if there is established, prior \nto the time it starts, a guarantee that these drugs can be brought in \nand are not counterfeit and are not harmful to your human health and \nare, in fact, not yellow, leaded highway paint.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator tell me, in this particular instance, was \nthis drug imported from Canada?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am not sure where it was from.\n  The point I make is, Canada is our good friend, a civilized society, \nwith high-quality manufacturers. But what Food and Drug says about \nCanada is the following:\n  Throwing the door open to drugs purchased by individuals directly \nfrom Canadian sellers will encourage unscrupulous individuals to devise \nschemes using Canada as a transshipment point for dangerous products \nfrom all points around the globe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Mississippi has \nexpired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, to allow for \nthe reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada by pharmacists and \nwholesalers.\n  The United States leads the world in the discovery, development and \nmanufacture of cutting-edge pharmaceuticals. Yet too many citizens who \nlive in Maine and elsewhere must travel over the broader to Canada to \nbuy the prescription drugs that they need to stay healthy for much \nlower prices than they would pay at their neighborhood drug store.\n  It is well documented that the average price of prescription drugs is \nmuch lower in Canada than in the United States, with the price of some \ndrugs in Maine being twice that of the same drugs that are available \nonly a few miles away in a Canadian drug store.\n  It simply does not seem fair that American consumers are footing the\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nbill for the remarkable, yet costly, advancements in pharmaceutical \nresearch and development, while our neighbors across the border receive \nthese medications at substantially lower prices.\n  That is why I cosponsored legislation in the last Congress, the \nMedicine Equity and Drug Safety Act, to allow American consumers to \nbenefit from international price competition on prescription drugs by \npermitting FDA-approved medicines made in FDA-approved facilities to be \nre-imported into this country. A modified version of that bill was \nsigned into law last October, and I am extremely disappointed that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services continues to refuse to \nimplement the law.\n  I am therefore pleased to cosponsor this amendment, which will allow \nAmerican consumers to benefit from international price competition in \ntwo ways:\n  First, it allows U.S. licensed pharmacists and drug wholesalers to \nimport FDA-approved medications from Canada, which has a drug approval \nand distribution system comparable to ours.\n  Second, the amendment codifies existing U.S. Customs' practices that \nallow Americans to bring limited supplies of prescription drugs into \nthis country from Canada for their personal use. That way, consumers \nwho follow the rules won't have to worry that their medicines will be \nconfiscated at the border.\n  While this amendment is a step in the right direction, it is not the \nsolution to the prescription drug problem in the United States. I \nbelieve that our top priority should be to strengthen Medicare and \ninclude a prescription drug benefit, and I look forward to working on a \nbipartisan basis with my colleagues to give all Americans better access \nto affordable prescription drugs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains for both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is that total time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Total time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is not often I disagree with my good \nfriend from Louisiana, but when you come from a northern State such as \nVermont, and when you see what is happening, and you are buying a drug \nfrom a drugstore, which is certified under Canadian law, which is just \nas strong as ours, and you can pay half the price for it--to say you \ncannot go across the border to do that just does not make any common \nsense.\n  The real threat as far as drugs coming into this country, because of \nthe disproportionate pricing, is the utilization of the Internet. That \nis where the problems are. On the Internet there is no checking, and \nyou can order your drugs over the Internet. That is where you ought to \nlook to try to prevent sales coming into this country. And that is wide \nopen now.\n  When I was chairman of the committee that put together the \npharmaceutical bill, we worked carefully with the FDA to make sure that \nwhen this bill passed, it gave them authority for sales across the \nborder, and that they would have full authority to make sure that any \nsales are stopped that should not be allowed under the law. So I think \nthe statements that are being made now just do not fit the reality of \nthe situation.\n  To deny our people the ability to purchase these drugs, under a \nsafely designed plan, which the FDA has the authority to approve, to \nmake sure there is no counterfeiting or unlawful sales--it is just \nwithout merit to say that we need the protection there. It is there. We \ndid that before. We passed it by a large vote, I believe, and put it \ninto law. But the Secretary had authority not to let it go forward. And \nunder the previous administration, that happened.\n  So what we should do now is pass this bill to allow our people the \nopportunity to get good pharmaceuticals that are not overpriced, which \nare safe and available. I think all the comments to the contrary are \nmissing the point and missing the bill.\n  This amendment will allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import safe, \nU.S.-made, FDA-approved lower-cost prescription drugs from our neighbor \nto the north--Canada. This amendment will do nothing to undermine the \ngold standard of safety in this country because our northern friends \nhave virtually the same standards. What this amendment will do is rein \nin the platinum standard we have for prices we pay for our medicines.\n  Prescription drugs have revolutionized the treatment of certain \ndiseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the \nmedicines that their doctors prescribe. The best medicines in the world \nwill not help a person who cannot afford them.\n  Americans pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs, and for many the prices is just too high. What's worse is that \nthose Americans who can least afford it are the ones paying the highest \nprices. Americans who don't have health insurance that covers drugs are \nforced to pay the ``sticker price'' off the pharmacist's shelf.\n  It is sad that during a time when the United States is experiencing \neconomic problems and higher unemployment it is becoming more common to \nhear of patients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to \nmake prescriptions last longer, because they can't afford the refill.\n  This is not about the Medicare benefit that we will also have an \nopportunity to debate later. But this too is a tripartisan effort. And, \nit is equally important because this will effect all Americans--not \njust our Medicare seniors. The question that we must ask is, can we put \npolitics aside and work in a nonpartisan manner to deal with this \nnational crisis? I say we must. And I am hopeful that today we can.\n  This amendment is based on legislation I introduced in the last \nCongress, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act. Then, as now, we \nwere joined by my friends Senators Dorgan, Snowe, Wellstone, and \nCollins. I am also glad to see that this year our group has been joined \nby Senator Stabenow and Senator Levin. That measure passed on an \noverwhelming vote of 74 yeas to 21 nays. It is time for us to take that \nvote again, and again pass this legislation.\n  This amendment has been substantially revised to address the concerns \nover safety that have been raised.\n  Two key elements. First, the FDA approved drugs can only be brought \nin from Canada. These are the same drugs that are currently being \nbrought in under existing FDA policy. There have been no reports of \nadverse events, poisonings or counterfeit by the senior citizens taking \nbuses to Canada. In addition, it gives the Secretary the authority to \nsuspend this program should these safety issues arise.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that this amendment \nspecifically authorizes FDA to incorporate any other safeguard that it \nbelieves is necessary to ensure the protection of the public health of \npatients in the United States.\n  It is important to remember--these are exactly the same drugs that \nhave been approved by the FDA except they are sold for far less.\n  Why is it that Canada and the rest of the developed world pays less \nfor drugs than the U.S. It is because drugs are somehow exempt from the \nlaws of the open market and free trade. And for that reason we have \nbeen subsidizing the rest of the world, in spite of the fact that we \nhave U.S. citizens going without health care and without the medicines \nthey need.\n  Why should Americans pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs? All this amendment does is allow international \ncompetition to bring rational pricing practices to the prescription \ndrug industry. It introduces competition which is the hallmark of our \nsuccess in this Nation.\n  I want the record to clearly reflect that I still feel strongly that \nVermonters should not be in violation of Federal law if they go a few \nmiles across the border into Canada to get deep discounts on \nprescriptions. We do nothing in here to indicate they should not be \nallowed to do so.\n  This amendment will provide equitable treatment of Americans, \nparticularly those who do not have insurance, or access to big \ndiscounts for large purchases like HMOs. This is not the only solution. \nI strongly believe we need a good competitive prescription drug benefit \nin the Medicare program. And I\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\nlook forward to working with all of my colleagues to develop a \nbalanced, generous prescription drug benefit that can be supported by \nMembers from both sides of the aisle.\n  But right now, this is a commonsense measure that we can enact now to \nease the burden of expensive prescription drugs on our people, for \nthose on the borders, and all Americans.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President it is unusual we have a real debate on the \nfloor of the Senate. I think it is interesting to do so. It is also \ninteresting to listen to the debate and see the tactics we have heard \nabout terrorists, terrorism, heart surgery in Tijuana, everything but \npoppy seeds from Afghanistan--yellow highway paint from somewhere \naround the world. He is not sure where it comes from.\n  Well, he just won a debate no one is having. It is the easiest debate \nin the world to win. Congratulations.\n  The real subject, however, is vastly different than the presentation \nyou just heard. This is about FDA-approved drugs, only FDA-approved \ndrugs produced in FDA-approved manufacturing plants, moved across the \nborder by licensed pharmacists and licensed distributors, and only \nthose.\n  Apparently--obviously--the pharmaceutical industry does not like what \nwe are doing here. I understand that. And I understand why people stand \nup and say the pharmaceutical industry does not want this to happen.\n  But what they are saying is, it is OK for the manufacturers to move \nprescription drugs back and forth across the border--and they do; they \ndo a lot of it every day--but it is not appropriate for licensed \npharmacists or distributors to do so.\n  Why is it we trust the manufacturers so much more than the Main \nStreet pharmacists? Tell me about that, if you will. Why is one \ntrustworthy and the other untrustworthy. And is it not the case that \nthere might be a price differential, I say to my colleague from \nLouisiana, between the United States and Canada?\n  It is a fact that there is a very substantial price differential, and \nthat the American consumer is charged the highest prices in the world \nfor the identical prescription drug.\n  There is a lot of fog in this debate and very little light. We are \ntalking about something very simple. We are not talking about \ncounterfeit drugs or adulterated drugs. We are not talking about \nterrorism. We are talking about very careful circumstances under which \na licensed pharmacist or distributor goes to Canada, which has a chain \nof custody that is similar to ours, accesses the identical prescription \ndrugs that are FDA approved, brings them back across the border, and \npasses the savings along to the American consumer.\n  Why don't the pharmaceutical companies like that? Because it will \nforce them to reprice their drugs in this country. It will force down \ndrug prices to the U.S. consumer. That is why they do not like that.\n  I renew the question I have asked time and time again, for which no \none in this Chamber has an answer--no one. Why should American citizens \nhave to go to Canada to get a fair price on a prescription drug that \nwas manufactured in the United States?\n  There is no answer to that in this Chamber. No one has attempted an \nanswer. What we have seen is a discussion about----\n  Mr. SANTORUM Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for an answer?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have very limited time. I am sorry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to answer at some point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator will have ample time to answer the question. \nI will inquire when he does so.\n  In the minute or so I have remaining, let me say this: This is life \nor death for a lot of people, this issue of prescription drug pricing. \nYes, we need to put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram. I support that strongly. But if we do not do something to put \ndownward pressure on prescription drug prices, we will simply break the \nbank, in my judgment.\n  That is why we need reimportation. And we need the generic \namendment--the base bill. We need to do both of these things. I am not \ninterested in compromising safety under any condition or any \ncircumstance. This amendment is very simple. It says, in part, that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services can suspend and will suspend and \nshall suspend the implementation of this reimportation if, in fact, \nthere is a counterfeiting problem, or other problems such as terrorism.\n\n  The issue of counterfeit drugs that had been raised, the issue of \nterrorism, has nothing at all to do with this amendment. We are talking \nabout licensed pharmacists, licensed distributors, FDA-approved drugs, \nFDA-approved plants--a system in which those from the U.S. who are \nlicensed to do so can get the exact same prescription drug safely from \nCanada at much cheaper prices and pass those savings along to \ncustomers.\n  I understand we will have another amendment following the vote on \nthis amendment. That amendment will have the effect of essentially \nmaking this provision unworkable. We will have to debate that at that \ntime.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the effort to make prescription \ndrugs more affordable for all Americans. However, I am concerned that \ncreating new opportunities to bring counterfeit or dangerous drugs into \nthe United States from foreign countries is not the way to do it.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, will provide an opportunity for the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make a certification that the \nreimportation of drugs from Canada will not jeopardize human safety, \nthe consuming public who buys these drugs, and it will, in fact, lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs for Americans.\n  I have also been asked to state that other Senators who want to be \nadded as cosponsors to this bill are Senator Roberts of Kansas and \nSenator Santorum of Pennsylvania. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota could very well make it easier to avoid U.S. standards and \ninspections at a time when we are increasing border surveillance and \ntrying to prevent acts of terrorism.\n  Two years ago, a similar amendment was added to the Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. However, the Senate-approved \nlanguage that I offered at that time required the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to certify that implementation of the amendment \nwould pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety and \nwould result in a significant reduction in prescription drug costs for \nU.S. consumers.\n  Secretary of HHS Donna Shalala was not able to make such a \ndemonstration as required by that law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of her letter to President \nClinton dated December 26, 2000, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2000.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The annual appropriations bill for the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (P.L. 106-387), signed \n     into law earlier this year, included a provision to allow \n     prescription drugs to be reimported from certain countries \n     for sale in the United States. The law requires that, prior \n     to implementation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     demonstrate that this reimportation poses no additional risk \n     to the public's health and safety and that it will result in \n     a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to \n     the American consumer.\n       I am writing to advise you that I cannot make the \n     demonstration called for in the statute because of serious \n     flaws and loopholes in the design of the new drug \n     reimportation system. As such, I will not request the $23 \n     million that was conditionally appropriated for FDA \n     implementation costs for the drug reimportation system \n     included in the FY 2001 appropriations bill.\n       As you know, Administration officials worked for months \n     with members of Congress and staff to help them design safe \n     and workable drug reimportation legislation. Unfortunately, \n     our most significant concerns about this proposal were not \n     addressed. These flaws, outlined below, undermine the \n     potential for cost savings associated with prescription drug \n     reimportation and could pose unnecessary public health risks.\n       First, the provision allows drug manufacturers to deny U.S. \n     importers legal access to the FDA approved labeling that is \n     required for reimportation. In fact, the provision explicitly \n     states that any labeling information provided by \n     manufacturers may be used only for testing product \n     authenticity. This is a major loophole that Administration \n     officials discussed with congressional staff but was not \n     closed in the final legislation.\n       Second, the drug reimportation provision fails to prevent \n     drug manufacturers from discriminating against foreign \n     distributors that import drugs to the U.S. While the law \n     prevents contracts or agreements that explicitly prohibit \n     drug importation, it does not prohibit drug manufacturers \n     from requiring distributors to charge higher prices, limit \n     supply, or otherwise treat U.S. importers less favorably than \n     foreign purchasers.\n       Third, the reimportation system has both authorization and \n     funding limitations. The law requires that the system end \n     five years after it goes into effect. This ``sunset'' \n     provision will likely have a chilling effect on private-\n     sector investment in the required testing and distribution \n     systems because of the uncertainty of long-term financial \n     returns. In addition, the public benefits of the new system \n     are diminished since the significant investment of taxpayer \n     funds to establish the new safety monitoring and enforcement \n     functions will not be offset by long-term savings to \n     consumers from lower priced drugs. Finally, Congress \n     appropriated the $23 million necessary for first year \n     implementation costs of the program but did so without \n     funding core and priority activities in FDA, such as \n     enforcement of standards for internet drug purchase and post-\n     market surveillance activities. In addition, while FDA's \n     responsibilities last five years, its funding authorization \n     is only for one year. Without a stable funding base, FDA will \n     not be able implement the new program in a way that protects \n     the public health.\n       As you and I have discussed, we in the Administration and \n     the Congress have a strong obligation to communicate clearly \n     to the American people the shortcomings in policies that \n     purport to offer relief from the high cost of prescription \n     drugs. For this reason, I feel compelled to inform you that \n     the flaws and loopholes contained in the reimportation \n     provision make it impossible for me to demonstrate that it is \n     safe and cost effective. As such, I cannot sanction the \n     allocation of taxpayer dollars to implement such a system.\n       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation \n     that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the \n     Congress next year. At the same time, I know you share my \n     view that an importation provision--no matter how well \n     crafted--cannot be a substitute for a voluntary prescription \n     drug benefit provided through the Medicare program. Nor is \n     the solution a low-income, state-based prescription drug \n     program that would exclude millions of beneficiaries and \n     takes years to implement in all states. What is needed is a \n     real Medicare prescription drug option that is affordable and \n     accessible to all beneficiaries regardless of where they \n     live. It is my strong hope that, when Congress and the next \n     Administration evaluate the policy options before them, they \n     will come together on this approach and, at long last, make \n     prescription drug coverage an integral part of Medicare.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. More recently, on July 9, 2001, a letter from the \ncurrent Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, \nindicated that based on an analysis by the Food and Drug Administration \non the safety issues and analysis by his planning office on the cost \nissues, he could not make the required determinations, and he stated \nhis view that we should not sacrifice public safety for uncertain \nspeculative cost savings.\n  Secretary Thompson also indicated that prescription drug safety could \nnot be adequately guaranteed if drug reimportation were allowed and \nthat costs associated with documentation, sampling, and testing of \nimported drugs would make it difficult for consumers to get any \nsignificant price savings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Thompson's letter be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                      Washington, DC July 9, 2001.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: I am writing to follow up on my \n     earlier response to your letter of January 31, 2001, co-\n     signed by fifteen of your colleagues, regarding the Medicine \n     Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 (MEDS Act).\n       You and other Senators and Representatives asked that I \n     reconsider former Secretary Shalala's decision and make the \n     determination necessary to implement the MEDS Act. As I \n     mentioned in my prior communication, I asked the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA) to carefully reexamine the law to \n     evaluate whether this new system poses additional health \n     risks to U.S. consumers, and the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE) to examine \n     whether the new law will result in a significant cost savings \n     to the American public.\n       I believe very strongly that seniors should have access to \n     affordable prescription drugs. I applaud your leadership in \n     this area, and agree that helping seniors obtain affordable \n     medicines should be a priority. However, as my earlier \n     response stated, I do not believe we should sacrifice public \n     safety for uncertain and speculative cost savings.\n\n\n                            safety concerns\n\n       After a thorough review of the law, FDA has concluded that \n     it would be impossible to ensure that the MEDS Act would \n     result in no loss of protection for the drugs supplied to the \n     American people. As you know, the drug system as it exists \n     today is a closed system. Most retail stores, hospitals, and \n     other outlets obtain drugs either directly from the drug \n     manufacturer or from a small number\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\n     of large wholesalers. FDA and the states exercise oversight \n     of every step within the chain of commercial distribution, \n     generating a high degree of product potency, purity, and \n     quality. In order to ensure safety and compliance with \n     current law, only the original drug manufacturer is allowed \n     to reimport FDA-approved drugs.\n       Under the MEDS Act, this system of distribution would be \n     opened to allow any pharmacist or wholesaler to reimport \n     drugs from abroad; this could result in significant growth in \n     imported commercial drug shipments. As you know, the FDA and \n     the states do not have oversight of the drug distribution \n     chain outside the U.S. Yet, opening our borders as required \n     under this program would increase the likelihood that the \n     shelves of pharmacies in towns and communities across the \n     nation would include counterfeit drugs, cheap foreign copies \n     of FDA-approved drugs, expired drugs, contaminated drugs, and \n     drugs stored under inappropriate and unsafe conditions.\n       While the MEDS Act requires chain of custody documentation \n     and sampling and testing of imported drugs, these \n     requirements cannot substitute for the strong protections of \n     the current distribution system. Counterfeit or adulterated \n     and misbranded drugs will be difficult to detect, and the \n     sampling and testing proposed under this program can not \n     possibly identify these unsafe products entering our country \n     in large commercial shipments.\n       I can only conclude that the provisions in the MEDS Act \n     will pose a greater public health risk than we face today and \n     a loss of confidence by Americans in the safety of our drug \n     supply. Although I support the goal of reducing the cost of \n     prescription drugs in this country, no one in this country \n     should be exposed to the potential public health threat \n     identified by the FDA in their analysis. Further, the \n     expenditure of time and resources in maintaining such a \n     complex regulatory system as proposed by the MEDS Act would \n     be of questionable public health value and could drain \n     resources from other beneficial public health program.\n\n\n                              cost savings\n\n       The clear intent of the MEDS Act is to reduce the price \n     differentials between the U.S. and foreign countries. The \n     review of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning \n     and Evaluation (OASPE) concludes there are significant \n     disincentives for reimportation under the MEDS Act, including \n     the costs associated with documenting, sampling and testing, \n     the potential relabeling requirements and related costs and \n     risk associated with such requirements, the overall risk of \n     increased legal liability, the costs associated with the \n     management of inventories by wholesalers and pharmacists, and \n     the risk to existing and future contractual relationships \n     between all parties involved. Moreover, there are a number of \n     reasons (including potential responses by foreign \n     governments) why lower foreign prices may not translate into \n     lower prices for U.S. consumers. Insufficient information \n     exists for me to demonstrate that implementation of the law \n     will result in significant reduction in the cost of drug \n     products to the American consumer.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Since I am unable to make the determination on the safety \n     and cost savings in the affirmative, as required under the \n     law, I cannot implement the MEDS Act. Please find attached to \n     this letter a more detailed analysis of the factors \n     influencing the public-safety and cost-savings questions. If \n     you need further clarification of my position on these \n     issues, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n       Thank you for your leadership in health care. I look \n     forward to working with you on new initiatives for making \n     medicine more affordable to our citizens, and on other health \n     issues of importance to our Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Even though the amendment being offered by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, would apply under its terms only to \ndrugs exported to and reimported from Canada, it would seem prudent \nthat the safeguards we adopted 2 years ago by a vote of 96 to 0 should \nalso be applied to this reimportation proposal. That is why I am \noffering this amendment.\n  We should be certain that any change we make results in no less \nprotection in terms of the safety of the drugs supplied to the American \npeople and will indeed make prescription drugs more affordable. \nLiberalization of protections that are designed to keep unsafe drugs \nout of this country, especially following the terrorist threats we face \nnow, should occur only if the necessary safeguards are in place. This \namendment will ensure that the concerns of the last two administrations \nregarding the safety and cost-effectiveness are addressed prior to the \nimplementation of this proposal.\n  Currently, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it is \nunlawful for anyone to introduce into interstate commerce a new drug \nthat is not covered by an approved new drug application or an \nabbreviated new drug application. Approval must be sought on a \nmanufacturer and product-by-product basis. A product that does not \ncomply with an approved application, including an imported drug not \napproved by FDA for marketing in the United States, may not be \nimported, even if approved for sale by that country.\n  A product introduced into interstate commerce that does not comply \nwith an approved application is considered an unapproved new drug in \nviolation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as \n``misbranded'' under the section of that act.\n  Under section 801 of the act, a drug that is manufactured in the \nUnited States pursuant to an approved new drug application and shipped \nto another country may not be reimported into the United States by \nanyone other than the original manufacturer. This prohibition on \nreimportation of products previously manufactured in the United States \nand then exported was added in 1988 to prevent the entry into this \ncountry of counterfeit and adulterated products.\n  Section 801 was enacted not to protect the corporate interests of \npharmaceutical companies but to protect the safety of American \nconsumers. Counterfeit drugs are a very real threat and can be deadly. \nAny liberalization of drug reimportation laws must assure safety from \nthis threat. Limiting reimportation of drugs from Canada does not \nnecessarily solve that problem.\n  During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on March 7 of \nthis year, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, Tom Scully, was asked whether the administration opposes or \nsupports the importation of prescription drugs into the United States. \nHe said, and I quote:\n\n       We have opposed it . . . there is no way for FDA to monitor \n     and regulate drugs coming in from Canada, Mexico or other \n     countries.\n\n  Others have told us there is no effective way to prevent \ntransshipment of drugs from other countries into Canada and then into \nthe United States. Limiting reimportation to Canada will only make \nCanada a port of entry for counterfeit and substandard drugs into the \nUnited States.\n  William Hubbard, who is FDA's Senior Associate Commissioner for \nPolicy Planning and Legislation, told us at a September 5, 2001, \nhearing, before the Senate Consumer Affairs Foreign Commerce and \nTourism Subcommittee, the following:\n\n       Even if the Canadian system is every bit as good as ours, \n     the Canadian system is open to vulnerabilities by people who \n     will try to enter the U.S. market because, again, that is \n     where the money is.\n\n  Last year, U.S. Customs and Drug Enforcement Administration officials \ntestified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that thousands \nof counterfeit and illegal drugs are already coming across our borders \nand through the mail from other countries. Far from supporting the \nreimportation proposals before Congress, these agencies recommended \ntightening our current regulations on reimportation of pharmaceuticals.\n  In a July 11, 2001, letter to the Energy and Commerce chairman and \nranking member, William Simpkins, Acting Administrator of the \nDepartment of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration, who was \nreferring to reimportation amendments, said the following:\n\n       (W)e oppose . . . these amendments because they would \n     hinder the ability of law enforcement officials to ensure \n     that drugs are imported into the United States in compliance \n     with long-standing Federal laws designed to protect the \n     public health and safety.\n\n  On March 5 of this year, the New York Times in some articles \nexplained that the illegal production in the United States of popular \nstimulants such as methamphetamine reflects lax regulation in Canada \nfor the chemical ingredients. As a result, Canada has become the \nleading supply route for the raw ingredient into the United States \nwhere the substances are more tightly controlled. In the last 11 \nmonths, the U.S. Customs Service has seized more than 110 million \ntablets of decongestants that contain the primary ingredient for making \nmethamphetamines, or speed, as smugglers attempt to bring shipments \nacross the border in everything from furniture to glassware.\n  The article notes:\n\n       An alliance of diverse organized crime groups, stretching \n     from Mexico to Iraq to Jordan, have found Canada an easy \n     entry point into a growing American market for synthetic \n     drugs.\n\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n\n  The Canadian Government concedes that they have relatively loose \ncontrol on the powder used to make methamphetamine, which criminal \nelements have easily circumvented. According to an intelligence report \nby DEA and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in January:\n\n       The diversion of pseudoephedrine from Canadian suppliers to \n     the illicit market is reaching a critical level.\n\n  The FBI and DEA officials have tracked the profit trail to the Middle \nEast where they are probing to see if it is being used to fund \nterrorist networks.\n  This amendment would also permit personal importation of drugs from \nany country. It is illegal to import unapproved drugs into the United \nStates, but the FDA has for years, in the exercise of its enforcement \ndiscretion, allowed U.S. citizens to bring a 90-day supply of \nprescription drugs for their personal use. The reason for this policy \nis one of compassionate use. It was to allow patients with life-\nthreatening or serious diseases to have access to non-FDA-approved \ntherapies that are available in other countries. Under this policy, the \npatient affirms it is for his or her own use and provides the name and \naddress of the U.S.-licensed doctor responsible for treatment.\n  The FDA has not officially permitted the importation of foreign \nversions of U.S.-approved medications because it has been unable to \nassure these products are safe or effective. In testimony before the \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigation in the House Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce, in June 2001, William Hubbard of FDA indicated:\n\n       Under the FD Act, unapproved, misbranded, and adulterated \n     drugs are prohibited from importation into the U.S., \n     including foreign versions of U.S.-approved medications, as \n     is reimportation of approved drugs made in the U.S. In \n     general, all drugs imported by individuals fall into one of \n     these prohibited categories. From a public health standpoint, \n     importing prescription drugs for personal use is a \n     potentially dangerous practice. FDA and the public do not \n     have any assurance that unapproved products are effective or \n     safe, or have been produced under U.S. good manufacturing \n     practices. U.S.-made drugs that are reimported may not have \n     been stored under proper conditions, or may not be the real \n     product, because the U.S. does not regulate foreign \n     distributors or pharmacies. Therefore, unapproved drugs and \n     reimported approved medications may be contaminated, \n     subpotent, superpotent, or counterfeit. In addition, some \n     foreign web site offer to prescribe medicines without a \n     physical examination, bypassing the traditional doctor-\n     patient relationship. As a result, patients may receive \n     inappropriate medications because of misdiagnosis, or fail or \n     receive appropriate medications or other medical care, or \n     take a product that could be harmful or fatal, if taken in \n     combination with other medicines they might be taking.\n\n  The importation of personal use amounts by mail continues to increase \naccording to FDA. A 5-week survey of mail in Carson City, California, \nconducted by Customs and the FDA in 2001 found serious public health \nrisks associated with drugs intercepted. These included drugs that \ncould not be identified because they had no labeling, drugs once \napproved by the FDA but withdrawn from the market due to safety \nconcerns, and drugs that should only be used under the supervision of a \ndoctor licensed to administer the drug.\n  In a letter to Congress last July, Mr. Hubbard indicated that the \npersonal importation policy ``is difficult to implement'' partly ``due \nto the enormous volume of drugs being imported for personal use and the \ndifficulty faced by FDA inspectors, or even health care practitioners, \nin identifying a medicine by its appearance.''\n  When I was discussing the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Dorgan, which we just approved, I told the story of how Senator \nKohl and I had a meeting in Senator Kohl's office. We were anticipating \na second amendment to the appropriations bill last year to find out \nmore about the dangers and the difficulties our inspectors have at the \nborder when dealing with imported prescription drugs. The Internet and \nmail resources, buying drugs here and there by mail, were another \nexample of bypassing the inspections and bypassing the enforcement of a \nlot of U.S. regulations.\n  It is amazing the number of drugs that are now on the shelves in \ndrugstores in America that are counterfeit and no one knows about it. \nThese are difficulties that we now face. The proposal of this amendment \nby the Senator from North Dakota will further relax our capability to \nfind illegal drugs, to find those drugs that are dangerous that are \nbeing brought into this country. It will create a new opportunity for \ntransshipping drugs all over the world into our country which will be a \ngreat danger to the citizens of our country.\n  The conditions contained in my amendment, which would be added to the \nlegislative proposal before the body, are the same as those previously \nadopted by this Senate and included in the 2001 Agriculture \nappropriations bill. They were adopted at that time by a unanimous vote \nof the Senate during our consideration of that appropriations bill. I \nask my colleagues to again support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment Senator Cochran for his amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Senator Cochran alluded to 2 years ago when we passed \nthis amendment unanimously. He said if we are going to do it, let's \nmake sure it does not impose significant additional risk on consumers, \nthereby saving money. I don't know why anyone would vote against that \namendment. I hope no one will vote against this amendment. It is a very \nimportant amendment.\n  Let me make a couple of comments. Someone will ask, didn't we already \ndo that in the Dorgan amendment which passed by a nice vote? The Dorgan \namendment is full of loopholes. It says it would be suspended upon the \ndiscovery of a pattern of importation of prescriptions by the importer \nthat is counterfeit or in violation of any requirement in this section. \nIf this is the case, how many people will have to die before we realize \nthere is a pattern? How many will realize those yellow tablets that \nSenator Breaux was holding up are actually paint instead of maybe a \nlifesaving drug? How many patterns have to exist before we realize this \nreally didn't work?\n  We have the FDA where we spend millions and millions of dollars \ninspecting, trying to make sure we have quality drugs for our citizens. \nWe are just going to open up a gigantic loophole for unscrupulous \nmanufacturers. I wish that were not the case, but if anyone travels \nanywhere in the world, they know it happens often. When you talk with \nour State Department about counterfeit drugs or copyright violations on \nsoftware, they will tell you that it happens lots of time. \nUnfortunately, it should not happen. But we have a pretty closed system \nright now where FDA goes to great lengths to ensure the drugs coming \ninto the United States are safe.\n  Last year, Senator Dorgan said, let's have it basically open ended \ncoming from Canada and Mexico. Now we are just saying Canada. How safe \nis that?\n  My staff did some homework. Canada has a provision under the Canadian \nFood and Drug Act, section 37. It reads:\n  This Act does not apply to any packaged food, drug, cosmetic or \ndevice, not manufactured for consumption in Canada and not sold for \nconsumption in Canada, If the package is marked in distinct \noverprinting with the word ``Export'' or ``Exportation'' and a \ncertificate that the package and its contents do not contravene any \nknown requirement of the law of the country to which it is or is about \nto be consigned has been issued in respect of the package and its \ncontents in prescribed form and manner.\n  In other words, the Canadian Food and Drug Act does not apply to \ndrugs brought in strictly for export. Canada can import drugs from \nSudan and export them to the United States and they are not covered by \nCanadian Food and Drug regulations.\n  Yet Senator Dorgan's amendment says: Bring them on, bring them on. \nOur FDA people, our leaders, both past administrations as well as \npresent administration, say we cannot do that safely.\n  Here is a letter that was addressed to Senator Cochran. It is an \nextensive letter that is critical of Senator Dorgan's approach. I will \njust read one paragraph:\n\n       The bill would actually create an incentive for \n     unscrupulous individuals to find ways to sell unsafe or \n     counterfeit drugs that, while\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n     purporting to be from Canada, may actually originate from any \n     part of the world. Canada could become a transshipment point \n     for legitimate or nonlegitimate manufacturing concerns \n     throughout the world, and in many cases we would not be able \n     to determine the true country of origin. For all these \n     reasons we find this provision would greatly erode the \n     ability of the FDA to ensure the safety and efficacy of the \n     drug supply and protect public health.\n\n  I could go on.\n  If Canada says we are not going to regulate drugs that are brought \ninto Canada for export only, and we are saying wait a minute, Canada, \nwe want to be able to import your drugs.\n  I listened to a lot of the debate. Almost every example that was \ngiven was of United States-manufactured drugs sent to Canada that are a \nlot cheaper in Canada than they are in the United States. There is \nnothing in Senator Dorgan's amendment that says these drugs have to be \nmanufactured in Canada or the United States. These drugs could come \nfrom Sudan.\n  There was a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that was bombed a few years \nago. There are pharmaceutical plants all around the world. Some of them \nmay have great quality controls, some of them may not. Some of them may \nbe in terrorist states. Yet we are leaving ourselves wide open.\n  So I urge my colleagues----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to, but I tell my colleagues I hope and \npray the Cochran amendment will pass. If it does not pass, I will have \nan amendment that says the drugs that are covered should be of American \nor Canadian origin, manufacture, or control. American drugs are \ncontrolled. Even the drugs that we import, if they have FDA approval, \nwe send FDA inspectors over to those plants to certify them. We have \nwhat is called a pedigree requirement to follow those drugs, to know \nwhere they are manufactured, know where they are distributed, before \nFDA puts their approval on them.\n  So we try to and do protect safety. We do not have that for all drugs \nthat would be coming from Canada.\n  I would just mention there is a fatal flaw, in my opinion, in the \nDorgan amendment we just adopted. One of those is that there has to be \na pattern. If you look at the language of the amendment we just \nadopted, there has to be a pattern of importation from each importer.\n  That is too late when there are people who have already died, are \nalready sick, when there are people who did not get cured because we \nwaited for a pattern, we waited for evidence, we waited for unfortunate \nresults--not to mention, there is no telling how many people would have \nbeen cheated out of money, and so on.\n  So I think the amendment we just adopted is probably not worth the \npaper it was written on.\n  I also find it kind of clever to think we had the original Dorgan \namendment, then they had a second degree. They left out one paragraph, \nand then the second-degree was reinstating that one paragraph. I am \nguessing it was saying we will use this as a substitute for the Cochran \namendment. That is a false and faulty substitute. It is not a \nsatisfactory substitute.\n\n  The Cochran amendment--and I urge my colleagues to read it, and I \ncannot imagine anyone would oppose it--says:\n\n       This section shall become effective only if the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services certifies to Congress that the \n     implementation of this section (A) will pose no additional \n     risk to public health and safety.\n\n  How could anybody oppose that?\n  And, second:\n\n       . . . result in a significant reduction of cost of covered \n     products to the American consumer.\n\n  We are all in favor of that. I compliment the Senator from \nMississippi for his leadership on it this year and 2 years ago. As a \nresult of the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, we have saved \nlives and eliminated a lot of fraud and counterfeiting and abuse that \nwould have transpired had he not been so vigilant for the last couple \nof years. I compliment him and urge all my colleagues to support the \nCochran amendment, and I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have a question. Listening to your comments, are you \nsuggesting that a product made in Iraq or Yemen or Iran or some other \ncountry that may have terrorists in their country, they could actually \nsend a drug through Canada into the United States, without anybody \ninspecting it, and have it show up here not marked as from what country \nit came, and be sold here in America, under the Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Under Canadian law, which I just read--this is section \n37 of the Canadian Food and Drug Act--it said any item, whether it be \npackaged food, drug, cosmetic, or other devices--and if that item is \nimported and exported, not to be consumed or utilized in Canada, then \nit is not under their regulatory scheme.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So it would come in here under the Dorgan amendment, \nreimportation, not being reviewed by the FDA before it came here? Only \nif we found out the terrorist attack was successful through this scheme \nwould we then find out that we have a problem?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That would be too late.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That would be far too late.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That would be under the category of the pattern of \naction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy. The amendment deals with FDA \ndrugs, so the condition under which that drug from Canada would come \ninto this country would be it was purchased at a Canadian-licensed \npharmacy or distributer by a licensed facility or distributor in this \ncountry, and therefore it must be FDA approved and produced in an FDA-\napproved plant. Is that not the case?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am reading a letter from the FDA, and they said \nabsolutely. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter dated July 17, from the Department of Health and Human Services \naddressed to Senator Cochran.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                      Health & Human Services,\n\n                                     Rockville, MD, July 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran. We take this opportunity to provide \n     the views of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on S. \n     2244, the Prescription Drug Price Parity for Americans Act, \n     introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan on April 24, 2002.\n       The Administration is sympathetic to the goal of making \n     prescription drugs more affordable for American citizens, \n     including senior citizens. However, FDA is concerned about \n     the negative impact on public health of a proposal such as S. \n     2244 that aims to open the nation's drug regulation system \n     and allow drugs from outside that system into U.S. commerce \n     and our citizens' medicine cabinets. We therefore must oppose \n     enactment of this legislation.\n       S. 2244 would allow wholesales, pharmacists and individuals \n     to import drugs from Canada under certain specified \n     conditions. The bill would create a new section 804 of the \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), replacing the current \n     provisions of section 804, which are the drug re-importation \n     provisions enacted in 1999 (the MEDS Act).\n       Currently, drugs marketed in the United States must be \n     approved by FDA based on demonstrated safety and efficacy; \n     they must be produced in manufacturing plants inspected and \n     approved by FDA; and their shipment and storage must be \n     properly documented. This ``closed'' regulatory system has \n     been very successful in preventing unapproved, adulterated or \n     misbranded drug products from entering the U.S. stream of \n     commerce. Legislation that would establish other distribution \n     routes for drug products, particularly where those routes \n     routinely transverse a U.S. border, creates a wide inlet for \n     counterfeit drugs and other dangerous products that are \n     potentially injurious to the public health and a threat to \n     the security of our nation's drug supply.\n       S. 2444 would establish two new routes for introducing \n     drugs from Canada into U.S. commerce. First, new section \n     804(b) would require the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (the Secretary) to promulgate regulations to permit \n     pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from \n     Canada into the U.S. The bill purports to safeguard the \n     domestic drug supply by requiring, in new section 804(c), \n     that these drugs comply with sections 505, 501 and 502 of the \n     Act, and that importers comply with detailed recordkeeping \n     and testing requirements\n       As a practical matter, meeting these requirements would be \n     an enormous undertaking, and the testing required under the \n     bill would be costly and time consuming,\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\n     both for the government and importers. Moreover, some of the \n     testing requirements cannot even be met, as there is no \n     testing that can ensure that a shipment of drugs does not \n     contain counterfeits. Since counterfeits can easily be \n     commingled with authentic product, either by the case, by the \n     bottle, or by the pill, there is no sampling or testing \n     protocol sufficient to protect against the grave public harm \n     they pose. No random sampling plan will be able to detect and \n     protect such criminal conduct since the threat does not \n     depend upon the nature of the reimported product, but upon \n     the integrity of those handling it. Furthermore, the \n     legislation fails to require reporting of any counterfeits \n     that may be found by testing, so even if counterfeits are \n     discovered, FDA may never learn of them.\n       It is unlikely that Canadian sellers and U.S. importers \n     would be willing to endure these new requirements, but even \n     if they were, it is likely that the intended cost savings for \n     consumers would be absorbed by fees charged by exporters, \n     pharmacists, wholesalers, and testing labs. Because the bill \n     requires that the drugs comply with sections 501, 502 and 505 \n     of the Act, it may be found, in practice, that for the bill \n     to have its intended effect U.S. manufacturers would have to \n     sell drug products manufactured, labeled and intended for the \n     U.S. market to Canadian distributors specifically for re-sale \n     to the U.S. Even if they were willing to do so, these sales \n     may represent illegal shipments to the Canadian market under \n     Canadian law. All of these concerns make the proposed program \n     for importation by pharmacies and wholeasalers both \n     impractical and unworkable.\n       The second route proposed by S. 2244 for importing drugs \n     into the United States is by allowing individual consumers to \n     import drugs on their own from Canadian pharmacies. New \n     section 804(k)(2) would compel the Secretary to promulgate \n     guidance to allow consumers to directly import drugs and \n     medical devices from Canada. This represents an enormous \n     intrusion on the Department's enforcement discretion, and it \n     would over-ride existing statutory provisions that allow FDA \n     to refuse personal importation of prescription drugs from \n     Canada if they are believed to be unsafe, ineffective, \n     adulterated, radioactive, or contaminated.\n       In surveys conducted by FDA over the past several years, we \n     have found that a wide variety of dangerous drug products \n     have been imported by individuals from outside the United \n     States, both by mail and by traveling to other countries. The \n     bill would actually create an incentive for unscrupulous \n     individuals to find ways to sell unsafe or counterfeit drugs \n     that, while purported to be from Canada, may actually \n     originate in any part of the world. Canada could become a \n     transshipment point for legitimate or non-legitimate \n     manufacturing concerns throughout the world, and in many \n     cases we would not be able to determine the true country of \n     origin. For all of these reasons, we find that this provision \n     would greatly erode the ability of FDA to ensure the safety \n     and efficacy of the drug supply, and protect the public \n     health.\n       FDA has numerous other specific concerns that S. 2244 may \n     undermine current law regarding drug labeling, record \n     keeping, testing, and enforcement, and we have laid out these \n     concerns in an attachment to this letter.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                 Lester M. Crawford, D.V.M., Ph.D.\n                                              Deputy Commissioner.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This is the quote from FDA. I might say this is the \nposition that is consistent, not only with this administration but the \nprevious administration. They state:\n\n       The bill would actually create an incentive for \n     unscrupulous individuals to find ways to sell unsafe or \n     counterfeit drugs that, while purporting to be from Canada, \n     may actually originate in any part of the world. Canada could \n     become the transshipment point for legitimate or \n     nonlegitimate manufacturing concerns throughout the world, \n     and in many cases we would not be able to determine the true \n     country of origin. For all these reasons we find this \n     provision would greatly erode the ability of FDA to ensure \n     the safety and efficacy of the drug supply and protect the \n     public health.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, \nthe Senator is aware, I am sure, that today pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers reimport a substantial amount of prescription drugs from \nCanada. What is to prevent the circumstance you just described from \noccurring now, with respect to current law?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Current law requires FDA, for their certification--for \nFDA to give their certification, you have a pedigree requirement. The \npedigree requirement means we have FDA inspectors go visit the plants \nin Canada to certify that yes, these are FDA-approved drugs. They do \nthe sampling. They make sure the packages are safe. Inspections are \ndone at great expense. That is already done for FDA, for drugs that are \nmanufactured in the United States or reimported into the United States. \nIt would not be done under any drug in Canada or under the Canadian \nlaw, which basically says if these drugs are purchased strictly for \nexport purposes, they do not fall under Canadian regulation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But is it not then the case that they are not FDA-\napproved drugs and therefore our amendment deals with that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will reclaim the floor. That is not \ncorrect.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Again, I am reading to my colleague. I have a statement \nfrom the past FDA Administrator as well that says they can't guarantee \nthe safety of these drugs. They do not have the regulators. The \nSenator's amendment did not have the pedigree requirement for drugs \nthat would be imported into the country. That is a possible amendment \nthat I am considering offering.\n  If the Cochran amendment doesn't pass, we are going to be on this \nbill for a while because I am going to offer an amendment--I will tell \nmy colleague, and maybe you will accept it--I am going to offer \namendment that says all the drugs covered by this act shall be \nmanufactured in the United States or Canada, because that has been \nimplied but it is not factual under the bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me finish. I am also going to offer an amendment \nthat will replace language under the Dorgan amendment that says there \nis a pattern of importation of drugs, counterfeit and so on. That would \nbe replaced by ``any instance.'' So we are not going to wait for a \npattern if this amendment is adopted. Again, I hope my colleague from \nNorth Dakota would agree, with this amendment, that it could be \nsuspended if there were an instance of counterfeit drugs, if there is \nan intent of abuse of the system. Then they can be suspended and not \nwait for a pattern.\n  I think both of those amendments are very acceptable. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree to consider them favorably.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Oklahoma has \nmade a vitally important point. We have gone through I can't tell you \nthe number of steps to try to stop terrorism.\n  The Senator from Kansas has just come to the floor. He has been a \nleader in the area of bioterrorism and agriterrorism.\n  Under this provision that we are debating right now--the underlying \nDorgan bill--you are creating an incredible loophole for terrorist \nattacks and bioterrorist attacks in this country. We are creating a \nloophole that allows any foreign country to go through Canada to import \ndrugs into the United States. And the Canadian Government doesn't even \ninspect it and does not even open it. It can come right in here.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The trading of drugs is probably more highly regulated \nthan any kind of trade. I am wondering if my friend would also object \nto all the food that comes into the United States from Canada and other \ncountries. We have foods and vegetables coming in every day. We have \nbottled water and alcoholic beverages coming in. We have all kinds of \nthings that go back and forth across the border from a lot of countries \nthat are not regulated nearly as much as prescription drugs. I am \nwondering if the Senator is also concerned about or would object to \nthat kind of trade as well.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is why we have Customs inspectors and FDA \ninspectors, who do, in fact, monitor things coming into this country \nfor purposes that are fundamentally different. When you are talking \nabout pharmaceutical products, that is a fundamentally different area.\n  All I am suggesting is that what is being created in the Dorgan \namendment is an opportunity. As the amendment says, you have to have a \npattern of problems with these drugs before you can do anything.\n  I think that creates a loophole that is in today's world of \nterrorism, one\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nthat would be certainly filled by any number of terrorist organizations \nthat want to hit the United States with some sort of bioterrorism.\n  I want to get back to what the Senator from North Dakota said prior \nto the vote on the last amendment. He said he would like to have \nsomeone come here and explain to him why drugs in Canada are so much \nless expensive than they are here in the United States, why we pay such \npremiums for those drugs here in the United States, and why Canada can \nsell them so much less expensively than they do here. There are a lot \nof reasons. Let me give you a few.\n  No. 1, the Canadian health care system is a single-payer system. It \nis a government-run health care system. It is run through the provinces \nand the territories.\n  This government-run health care system negotiates prices. Not all \ndrugs that are made available in the United States are available in \nCanada. Why? Because the Canadian Government has a formulary. There may \nbe four arthritis drugs that may be very effective in dealing with \ndifferent forms of arthritis. The Canadian Government basically \nnegotiates with companies, plays one against the other, and gets the \ncheapest price. They make one available. That one available may be the \nright particular drug for this group of arthritis sufferers. But it may \nnot be the best drug for the whole class. That is why there is probably \nfour of them. They have different little initiatives that make their \ndrug more effective on certain people in certain circumstances. But in \nCanada, you get one. Maybe you get two in a general class. They \nnegotiate it based on the best price they can get.\n\n  That is one thing.\n  In Canada, people don't get access to the variety of different drugs \nthat may be the best therapy available. They negotiate a price because \nthey are a big purchaser. They purchase for the entire 35 million \npeople in Canada. They purchase drugs, and they compete it so they get \none company getting the entire market, in many cases. So they can get a \nmuch reduced price as a result of the volume discount which they give.\n  Again, they limit the access to a variety of different drugs to the \npeople of Canada. It is a balancing act for the drug company that wants \nto compete in Canada to get access to that market.\n  I am sure the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Michigan \nare familiar with this.\n  The second thing is there is a provision in the Canadian law called \n``compulsory licensing.'' Most Senators on the other side of the aisle \nknow what compulsory licensing is. But just in case they don't, let me \nexplain to Members what the impact of compulsory licensing has on drug \nprices.\n  Compulsory licensing is the ability for the Canadian Government, if \nthey do not get a satisfactory negotiation for a drug they believe is \nnecessary to be offered in Canada, and if they aren't happy with the \nprice the pharmaceutical company is willing to sell that drug at, they \ncan basically, in a word, steal the patent.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  If Merck, which happens to be a big pharmaceutical company in my \nState, wants to sell a particular drug that is effective for \narthritis--maybe it is a very new drug, an important drug, one on which \nthey have spent a lot of money, and it has tremendous results and they \nwant to sell it in Canada--said: We will sell it for $2 a pill here in \nthe United States. Canadian says: That is nice. We are not going to pay \n$2. We want a volume discount. Merck says: OK. We will negotiate some \nsort of volume discount. We will sell it to you for $1.50 a pill. \nCanada says: That is nice. We will pay you 50 cents. Merck says: That \nis not a fair price. So they negotiate back and forth.\n  OK. Fine. We believe this is an important drug for our people. If you \nwant to sell it to us for 50 cents, you lose your patent. We will \nlicense it to someone here in Canada. They will make the drug, and you \nget nothing.\n  Most people would say that doesn't seem particularly fair. No. It is \nnot fair. But under Canadian law, I would suggest to you that not just \nCanada but in most countries around the world, unfortunately, that is a \nfact of life for many drug companies. If you point to Brazil, to South \nAfrica, or to France, or to some other country, and ask, How can they \nget these drugs? It is because if they do not sell the drug at the \nprice the national government wants the drug sold at, they steal the \npatent, they compulsory license it.\n  You are now looking at a drug company that says: Wait a minute. We \nwant to sell this drug for $2. It cost us 25 cents extra to make the \npill. They say: Wait a minute. Why do you want to sell if for $2? It \ntook us $800 million to bring this thing to market. We have a few \nresearch costs involved in getting this drug formulated, approved, and \nall the things that are necessary to make sure it is safe and \neffective. It cost us a lot of money. Yes, but making the pill doesn't \ncost a lot. But to get to where we can make the pill, it costs an \nenormous amount of money. We would like to recoup that. Because they \nare in business, they would like to make a profit. The Canadian \nGovernment says: Look, it only cost you a quarter to make this pill, \nbut we are giving you 50 cents. You are making money. It is better than \nmaking no money. If you don't sell it to us for 50 cents, you make no \nmoney.\n\n  So the drug company has to make this decision. Do I sell the drug at \n50 cents and make some money, or do I choose not to sell the drug?\n  They may have it be made somewhere else. Even if they don't \ncompulsory license it--even if they say, no, they are not going to \ncompulsory license it, they are not going to sell it, put aside \ncompulsory licensing. They say: We want to sell the drug. It is 50 \ncents. You don't have access to our market.\n  So the drug company has to make a decision. Do I sell the drug at 50 \ncents and make a small profit to help underwrite the cost of the \nresearch that was done on this drug, or do I choose not to sell?\n  You can make the argument that they shouldn't sell. You can make the \nargument that they should try to negotiate a better deal. But there is \none negotiator, the Government of Canada, and they set the price. If \nyou do not like the price, you either don't sell, and no drug is made \navailable in Canada, which is no skin off the back of Canadian \nGovernment because in most cases, most drugs are not available in \nCanada. It is just another drug that is not available.\n  If they really want your drug, and if they really believe it is \nimportant to get your drug, they simply license it to someone in \nCanada, and they make the drug, which they buy. They can make the drug \nin such sufficient quantities that they can actually import that drug \ninto the United States. So they can steal your patent. And under this \nbill, a stolen patent can be imported.\n\n  I understand it is very, very popular to be beat up on pharmaceutical \ncompanies. They make money. We do not like anybody that makes money \naround here. So they make some money. They do some things that are \ncutting edge. For some reason this is a problem.\n  It is very popular to go out and beat up on pharmaceutical companies \nfor charging all this money for products that people need. But let me \nremind you, the Senator from Massachusetts said this bill will save $60 \nbillion. If I am wrong on that, that is what I thought I heard \nyesterday. The Senator from Massachusetts said this will save $60 \nbillion for the American consumer.\n  My question is, save it from whom? Who is it going to cost? It comes \nfrom somewhere. The obvious answer is, it is going to save it from the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  Let's look at the pharmaceutical industry in this country, the much \nmaligned pharmaceutical industry. What did this pharmaceutical industry \ndo to deserve this treatment? What it did to deserve this treatment is \ninvest more as an industry in research and development than any other \nindustry in America.\n  Let me repeat that. What have they done to incur the wrath of the \nU.S. Senate today? What they have done is invest more money in research \nand development than any other industry in America. As a result, they \nhave come up with breakthrough drugs, which cost a lot of money but, by \nthe way, save lives and improve the quality of life for millions in \nAmerica.\n  So what are we doing to thank them, to congratulate them, for being \none of\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nthe leading exporters in this country, for improving our balance of \npayments in this country, for employing people in high-priced jobs in \nthis country, for moving scientific research in this country, for \ncuring diseases in this country, for improving the quality of life in \nthis country, for extending lives in this country?\n  We say we are going to whack off $60 billion out of your bottom line, \nwhich means, of course, the research will stop or be dramatically \nreduced.\n  So understand what we are doing. We are all beating our chests \nsaying: We are going to get the big, bad pharmaceutical companies that \nare pillaging the American public with outrageous drug prices, and we \nare going to cut those prices by 30 to 50 percent.\n  Understand the consequences. Less money in research. Less money in \nresearch means fewer new drugs. Fewer new drugs mean people will die \nwho would otherwise be saved by those innovations. That is what the \nconsequences are.\n  All I am suggesting is, if that is the tradeoff, if 30 percent less \non your pharmaceutical price is a good tradeoff for not having the next \ngeneration of lifesaving drugs or quality-improving drugs, that is \nfine. That is a worthy debate in the Senate. It is one that we should \nhave, but it is not one that we are having.\n  The debate we are having is, corporate greed versus poor senior \ncitizen. That is the debate here: These horrible pharmaceutical \ncompanies that are raping and pillaging the people of America while \nmaking these enormous profits.\n  Look at their profit lines, look at the prices for their stock, and I \nwill assure you, they are not showing those enormous profits.\n  What is going to happen--if this were successful and we did take $60 \nbillion out of this industry--and that is where it is coming from. It \nis not coming from anywhere else. It is not being drawn out of whole \ncloth. It is coming out this industry, which means $60 billion less of \nresearch.\n\n  We run around this country, and we are very proud in the Senate \ntalking about how we are increasing the budget for the National \nInstitutes of Health and how we care deeply about improving the quality \nof health in this country and how we are going to put more and more \ntaxpayers' dollars into solving diseases, into fighting problems that \nperplex us, into finding out more about how our bodies work. Wonderful. \nWonderful. That is great basic research. It is important to do. It is \ngreat scientific discovery. But where does all this stuff lead? Where \ndoes this lead?\n  In many, many cases it leads to research then being handed off to a \nprivate-sector organization that goes ahead and develops that \nlifesaving cure, that pharmaceutical product that, in the end, saves \nlives.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The Senator from \nPennsylvania addresses a very important point, which forces us to look \nto the future in terms of future cures, whether it is for HIV/AIDS, \nemphysema or heart disease.\n  He hit the point very directly, in a way that I have not heard on \nthis floor, in response to one of the main reasons why drug prices are \nhigher in the United States than in Canada.\n  I would like to ask the Senator the following question. Typically, in \nthe United States an individual company will set prices in such a way \nto cover research. They will look at supply, demand, and the efficacy \nand efficiency with which the goal of cure or prevention is carried \nout.\n  In order for the prices of medicine to be sustained over time, you \nmust allow some recoupment of that investment in research. We all know \nthat, on average, only 3 out of 10 medicines that are eventually \napproved in this country actually generate enough revenue to pay for \nthat investment over time in the United States.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Not to mention all the hundreds or thousands of \ncompounds that were even tried to be researched, and they ended up \nwhere they decided: No, we are not even producing a drug that could be \nsought for approval.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. That is the United States.\n  The real question goes to the following: In Canada they have a very \ndifferent system. Everybody looks to Canada's system as if it is \nsimilar to or in some ways better than ours. In Canada, not the United \nStates--this is what you essentially said--is it not correct that each \ncompany is denied the freedom to set prices for its own innovative \nmedicines?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me explain to you exactly how that process works. \nIt is not a free market. They cannot set their prices. They have to \nnegotiate with a board, and it is called the Patented Medicines Price \nReview Board. That board sets the prices in Canada.\n  They do so in the following way. The statute mandates that the price \nof most new patented medicines may not exceed the price of the most \nexpensive drug marketed in Canada that treats the same disease.\n  So let's take HIV/AIDS. You have a regiment of drugs that are out \nthere to treat it. Someone comes on the market with a brand new AIDS \ndrug that may cure AIDS or may substantially improve the quality of \nlife for someone with AIDS.\n\n  In Canada, they cannot, under the statute, charge more than what the \nhighest priced drug already in the market is, which may have an \nimproving effect on the quality of AIDS but may not be one of those \ntransformational drugs.\n  So, No. 1, statutorily they are limited. No. 2, the price in Canada \nof a drug constituting a breakthrough drug, in therapy, may not exceed \nthe median of its price in seven countries.\n  Let me tell you, all of those specified countries, with the exception \nof the U.S.--that is one of the seven--the other six, interestingly \nenough, are all price-controlled countries where the government sets \nthe prices.\n  So it is a spiraling-down effect. One refers to the other country as \na way to set the price, and so they each keep setting lower and lower \nprices, and they rachet the price down by having all these price \ncontrol countries as the reference point for Canada.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will as soon as I finish the question from the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Just a quick followup question.\n  Based on what you have said, the only choice a manufacturer has is to \nset it at the price that Canada allows or to not sell it.\n  If a manufacturer decided not to sell a medicine at a price the \ngovernment allowed, then is it correct that the government would \nauthorize a Canadian company to copy and sell the drug, even without \nthe patent holder's permission, which, it would seem to me, throws out \nthe meaning of patents?\n  If we throw out the meaning of patents when it comes to \npharmaceuticals and drugs, what are the implications for us in this \ncountry or the person listening today who has heart disease or HIV/\nAIDS, as they look with hope for that cure?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There are enormous implications if we allow the \nCanadian Government to deny and basically say to the company: Either \ntake it at this price or we will go ahead and manufacture it ourselves.\n  By the way, once they license it in Canada, the Canadian manufacturer \ncan appeal to the government and say: Look, yes, we are manufacturing \nit here, but for us to make a profit, we have to export some because we \nhave to make it in sufficient quantities. And if that is approved, they \ncan send the drug back here to the United States.\n  Our companies could do all the research, expend all the money, and \nthen be forced not to be able to sell the drug. In that case, the \nCanadian Government will say, it is not important enough. If you don't \ngive it to us at the price we want, you lose the competition between \nthree other drugs that may be similarly situated. You just don't sell \nthe drug in Canada. Or, if we think it is important enough, if we think \nit is vital to our national health and you don't want to sell it to us \nat a price we believe is reasonable, we will have compulsory licensing. \nThey simply license it to another.\n  That is not some far off concept. Right after the anthrax scare in \nthe Senate, the Canadian health minister said that if they cannot get \nenough quantities of Cipro, they were going to\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nrevoke the patent of Bayer and produce it in Canada.\n  So just understand, this is not a theoretical concept. This is a real \nconcept. Even if it is not done routinely, which it is not, it is \ncertainly a hammer that the government uses to get prices at a level \nthat they want, not that the manufacturer believes is fair for their \nproduct.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the ability for us to debate this \nimportant issue. I am wondering, as a result of what you have \ndescribed, and I appreciate the sympathies for drug companies, if you \nthen support the fact that the average pharmaceutical drug for \nAmericans is going up three times the rate of inflation?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is important because another provision of the \nCanadian system is that the price may not increase more than the \nconsumer price index. They fix prices even after they have set them in \nplace.\n  The prices of drugs are going up. The research involved in \ndiscovering new drugs and the complications of doing so is driving up \ndrug prices. That is a problem. I think we do need to do something.\n  But the issue is not price control. It is access to insurance. That \nis the key. What we need to do is to provide, for the private-sector \nAmerican, the Medicare-eligible American, an opportunity to get \ninsurance to reduce the cost of drugs to them. That is vitally \nimportant.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am wondering if my friend might also respond then to \nthe well-known practice now that the companies are spending 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes more on advertising than they are on research and development, \nand how you might feel about that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I must respectfully disagree with my colleague's \nassertion on that point, for it is factually incorrect, although a \ncommonly cited myth. According to recent findings by NDC Health, a \nhealth care information company, the pharmaceutical industry spends \nsignificantly more on research and development than it does on \nadvertising. For 2001, $2.8 billion was spent on direct-to-consumer \nadvertising. This is less than one-tenth of the $30.3 billion America's \npharmaceutical industry spent on research and development. Moreover, I \nam someone who believes that a company is entitled to advertise and \nsell their product. Certainly, I don't know of any business that makes \na product that doesn't tell anybody what their product is. If you look \nat the research and development cost of every other industry compared \nto their advertising cost, the pharmaceutical industry would probably \nstack up better than any other industry. You could say they are \nspending a lot on advertising. I would hope they are spending money to \ntry to tell people what their products are about.\n  Are you telling me they shouldn't be able to spend money to tell \nAmerican consumers or physicians or hospitals what their product is and \nhow it can be used? Of course, they should. They have an obligation to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Would the Senator yield for another brief question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, clearly the United States does subsidize \nthe world in terms of research and development. For better or worse, \nmany other countries do have strict price controls. Those price \ncontrols ultimately translate pretty uniformly across the world into \nless investment in terms of research and development and investigation \nand experimentation for future cures of a broad range of diseases that \nwe globally suffer with today.\n  The hope out there--whether it is Parkinson's disease, emphysema, \nheart disease, or lung disease--comes in the development of new drugs.\n  My question to the Senator is to verify the data that at least has \nbeen made available to me. In the United States our pharmaceutical \nindustry--and I will phrase this as a question--spends about how much? \nThe answer is the United States spends around $30 billion for research \nand development in the private sector coming from private investment in \nthis country. In Canada, the cost for all research and development in \npharmaceutical agents is not $30 billion; it is $1 billion.\n  I mention that because people glorify the Canadian system and how \ninexpensive it is. We need to be very sensitive to the fact that the \nUnited States is doing the world's research and development in the \npharmaceutical arena which gives us the hope. Canada does not. The \nsystem described does not.\n  Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is absolutely right. The initial comment the \nSenator made is right. This is the fundamental issue we need to debate. \nShould the American public, through its pricing system, free market \npricing system of drugs, continue to subsidize the rest of the world in \npharmaceutical research? If the answer is no, we need to state that. If \nthe answer is, no, we don't want that to continue, we should come out \nin front and say: We are not going to let the United States consumer \nbear the brunt of researching new drugs. If that is what we want to do, \nwe need to be very upfront about that.\n  That may be a very legitimate position to take. I don't share that \nview. I don't believe that is the right thing for us to do. I don't \nthink that moves this country forward. I don't think that keeps us on \nthe cutting edge of an industry that is a world leader.\n  If that is what this body wants, then we are going to make the short-\nterm trade, and the underlying bill on generics is exactly in this \ndirection. We are going to make the short-term trade. We will have to \ncharge our consumers less, allow more generic drugs, allow \nreimportation of drugs, all of which will undermine and cut into the \nrevenues and intellectual property of the pharmaceutical industry, \nwhich will subsequently reduce their ability to do research on drugs \nfor the short-term gain of having cheaper prices on the drugs available \ntoday.\n  The exchange is, lower prices on the existing pot of drugs available \ntoday versus a cure for heart disease or cancer or emphysema or \nParkinson's or you name it down the road. That is the tradeoff.\n  Let's be honest. Of the drugs available today, many of them are very \ngood, but some of them are not as accessible. You could make the \nargument, it is more important to get those drugs to people today than \nit is to get that next generation of cures tomorrow. Maybe we will have \nto wait. Instead of getting them next year or 2 years from now, we will \nhave to make it 5 or 10 years. That is a tradeoff.\n\n  Let's have a debate about that. But let's understand that all this \nother talk is just glossing over the broader issue. That is the \nfundamental issue.\n  I haven't seen any polls on this issue. There may be Americans who \nbelieve that is the way to go. There may be others who feel strongly \nthe other way. We have to understand that is the debate.\n  With that, understand the bottom line: Lower prices, either on \ngeneric drugs or reimported drugs, versus cures tomorrow and the next. \nThat is the debate. We must make a choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has sought the floor.\n  In my capacity as Chair, I might say to colleagues, I will try to \nswitch back and forth on positions so I will recognize the Senator from \nNorth Dakota next.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, you should recognize who asks, not back \nand forth. Unless there is some agreement, I respectfully suggest that \nthe Chair should not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair apologizes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nminority, I have talked to Senator Cochran, and he tentatively agreed \nto this schedule. We would have a vote at approximately 5:40 today; \nthat the time between now and then would be equally divided, even \nthough that perhaps is unfair. The Senator from Pennsylvania has spoken \nfor such an extensive time, but I don't think we need to worry much \nabout that.\n  So I would like to propound a unanimous consent agreement that we \nwould have a vote on the Cochran amendment at 5:40; that following the \nvote, we would proceed to the Stabenow amendment, which would be in the \nform of a second-degree amendment to the underlying amendment; then \nfollowing that, tonight, as soon as that amendment is laid down, we \nwould go to the MILCON bill--which we got consent on earlier today, and \nI appreciate that--and we would complete that debate tonight and vote \non that in the morning.\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\n  In the morning, we will start off with the Stabenow amendment, which \nwill be debatable.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, at this time we \ncannot agree to such an understanding. As the Senator has noted, this \namendment has generated a very significant interest. Debate has been, \nobviously, substantive and there is still a fair amount of debate that \nhas to flow under the bridge before we can close the game, if I can mix \nmetaphors.\n  Mr. REID. I understand the statement of the Senator from New \nHampshire, even though I do not agree. We have agreed to accept the \namendment tentatively--unless something has changed in the interim. I \nthink there would be an agreement that we could accept this amendment.\n  All I say to my friend is, if that is the case--and I think it is--\nagain, we are legislating by virtue of slow-walking. As I say, we have \ntried--and if they would like to tango, we will play music; if they \nwant to rumba, we will do that. But we need to move this legislation. \nWe have a lot of things to do. We are constantly told by the President \nthere are things he would like done. We do our best to meet what the \nadministration wants. For example, if we are going to be able to get to \nthe bill where he is talking about consolidating different agencies, we \nare going to have to do that. We have to finish this first. Here it is \nWednesday at 4 o'clock at night. We have had one vote today--that is \nall I remember--and we are not able to go ahead with anything else. As \nI indicated, the homeland security issue is something the President \nbelieves we should do. The majority leader wants to do it. We cannot do \nit like this. Now we want to get to the military construction bill \ntonight.\n  I don't understand what we can do to be more cooperative and move \nthings along. It is not as if we are asking the impossible. I am going \nto propound this request. I will yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for \na question.\n  (Mr. Dayton assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator withhold propounding the request for a \nfew moments until we have a little more time to look at it?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to do that. I say this respectfully, and I \nknow the Senator from Pennsylvania has been talking and has not had an \nopportunity to look at this. We have been floating this for an hour or \n2. Another few minutes will not matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania was speaking about \nadvertising costs and so on. Toward the end of his speech, I know the \nSenator from Michigan wanted to be yielded to. I yield to her for a \nquestion at this point.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might share this for the Record for \nmy colleagues and ask my friend from North Dakota to respond, I did \nwant to put into the Record, as we were talking about advertising \nversus research and so on, that, in fact, today two and a half times \nmore is spent on advertising and marketing of a product than is spent \non research and development. What is more startling is the fact that \naccording to a report released today by Family USA, we have companies \nthat are having two or three times more in profits than they spend on \nresearch and development. This is no longer a research and development \ndriven industry--which it needs to be. It has become much more about \nsales, marketing, and ``me too'' drugs rather than new breakthrough \ndrugs.\n\n  Today, Family USA showed us in a report that, for instance, America, \nlast year--in 2001--had a profit, a net income, that was three times \nmore than what they spent on R Pfizerpen's was one and a half times \nmore. Bristol-Myers was two times more in profit.\n  What is also disturbing is that, while I appreciate the sympathies \nfor the drug companies, it is really quite shocking when we look at \nwhere the money goes as opposed to R This chart shows the five \nhighest-paid drug company executives. I won't say them by name, but the \nCEO of Bristol-Myers gets $74 million, not counting unexercised stock \noptions. Wyeth's gets $40 million, not counting stock options. If you \ninclude the stock options, you are looking at another $93 million for \none company, $76 million for another, $60 million, and so on.\n  So I appreciate the concern about the drug companies and the \ndifferent system in Canada. But if our concern is about research and \ndevelopment--which we should be concerned about because not enough is \nbeing done now--we have a lot of money going in a lot of other places \nthat I think would be of concern to the average senior who is trying to \nfigure out tonight at supper time whether they eat or get their \nmedication. I appreciate the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have heard a generous and interesting \npresentation for 45 minutes or so--in fact, I think it was the most \neffective discourse I have heard for some while on behalf of the \npharmaceutical industry and their pricing policies. Of course, I \ndisagree with it very strongly. Nonetheless, I think it was a good \nrepresentation of what the pharmaceutical industry believes about \npricing strategies.\n  As I listened to the back and forth, it reminded me of a small grease \nfire in a small restaurant; a lot is going on, but nothing real urgent. \nLet me react to some of the statements made recently.\n  Statement: ``Some people in the Senate don't like anybody who makes \nany money.'' That is absurd, but obviously in the Senate we can say \nthose things, I guess. I would like to see one Member stand up and say: \nAll right, here is what I stand for. I stand for a pricing strategy by \nwhich the American consumer is charged the highest prices for \nprescription drugs of anybody in the world. I want to see one Senator \nstand and say that I stand with the pharmaceutical industry and the \npricing strategy, and I want the American consumer to pay the highest \nprices in the world.\n  Nobody will stand and say that. Instead, they will use metaphors that \nmean something different. We are told, for example, the problem is \nthat, if we don't pay those high prices, we don't get the R The \ninformation that was used was, of course, incorrect. Actually, more \nmoney is spent in Europe on R than in the United States 37% versus \n36%--not a lot more, but more--and in every country in Europe their \nconsumers pay far lower prices for prescription drugs. How does that \nfigure add up?\n  We just heard our colleague say to us that if you don't pay the \nhighest prices for prescription drugs, you don't get the R Tell us \nabout the Europeans.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will let me finish my statement first--I \nlistened for 45 minutes to the great case the Senator made on behalf of \nthe pharmaceutical industry--I will be happy to yield when I finish.\n  The point is this: We are told that the pricing strategy by which \nAmericans are charged the highest prices is fair and is necessary--fair \nbecause it is the only way we will get the R, and it is necessary \nbecause nobody else will pay those prices. So we need to accumulate \nthat cash from the American consumer in order to pay for the R\n  There are a couple things wrong with that. One, we spend a \nsubstantial amount of taxpayers' money at the National Institutes of \nHealth. We have gone from $12 billion to $24 billion. I supported that. \nIt was bipartisan in the Senate. We doubled the amount of money for the \nNational Institutes of Health for health and research, and the \npharmaceutical industry benefits from that as well because they take \nthat accumulated research and use it to create new and miracle \nmedicine. Yes, they do research as well, and I commend them for that.\n  My point is, we do a lot in public policy, such as research at the \nNIH. We passed a tax credit--I assume my colleague from Pennsylvania \nsupports that, as I do--to say we will give you a tax credit for \nresearch and development. This country gives a very substantial tax \ncredit for research and development, and I support that. I voted for it \nfor two dozen years. I bet my colleague did as well.\n  This is not about research and development, it is about a pricing \npolicy, that says that we will do more research in Europe and charge \nthem lower prices then the American consumer, and, oh, by the way, when \nsomeone wants to raise questions about that, we will say: No, you \ncannot raise questions about\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nthat; this is a pricing strategy that is fair to the American people.\n  Not where I come from, and I come from a much smaller town, I am \nsure, than some others here, a town of 400 people. We had a drugstore. \nWe had a fellow who came to my town when he was just out of medical \nschool. His name was Doc Hill. He was the doctor and ran the drugstore \nin town. He knew everything about everything. There was not anything he \ncould not treat or any diagnosis he could not make. He was just a \nwonderful guy.\n  I grew up with that kind of medicine in a small town. In my small \ntown, if someone said: We have a little deal here in the county--we \nhave three towns--Mott, Regent, and New England. Regent is mine, by the \nway. We have a policy. What we would like to do is charge you folks in \nRegent 10 times as much for tamoxifen. If you women have breast cancer \nand are using tamoxifen, we are going to charge you 10 times as much as \nwe are going to charge the people in New England and Mott.\n  Do you know what the people in Regent would say about that? Are you \nnuts? Are you stark raving mad? For God's sake, what kind of a pricing \npolicy is that? It is fundamentally unfair, they would say.\n  Let's take that globally. We are told this is a global economy, after \nall, and just as it would be for my county, we are told by the \npharmaceutical manufacturers that with tamoxifen, Premarin, Zocor, \nLipitor, or dozens of other medicines, we should ask the American \nconsumer to pay much more than others.\n  I understood there are people here who represent the interests of \nthose who want higher prices. That is not the President's position, by \nthe way. This is the President's position. The third Presidential \ndebate in St. Louis, from George W. Bush, now President Bush:\n\n       Allowing the new bill passed in Congress, you know, for \n     drugs that were sold overseas to come back into the United \n     States, that makes sense.\n\n  That is President George W. Bush. That is called reimportation. That \nis President George W. Bush in 2000 saying it makes sense. Sure, it \nmakes sense. It does not make sense to the pharmaceutical industry, and \nI understand why. They have price controls. They control the price. \nPeople say we do not have price controls in America. Yes, we do; of \ncourse, we have price controls. The pharmaceutical industry controls \nthe price. With respect to this global economy, it is interesting, my \ncolleague said: In effect, you are going to import price controls from \nCanada. Canada has price controls on prescription drugs. Yes, that is \ntrue. Canada has price controls on prescription drugs. So do many other \ncountries. We reimport a lot of products from other countries. That is \none of the factors that makes the global economy interesting. If my \nfriend the Senator from Pennsylvania has a necktie that is made in \nChina today--and I do not know if he does or not, but there is a pretty \ngood likelihood many of us are wearing neckties made in China--then one \nmight make the case that the price of that necktie supports the salary \nof the leader of a Communist government.\n\n  Does that make it tighter around our necks? I do not think so. It is \nthe global economy. Do I like to buy something from a country that \nperhaps supports a Communist government? No, no, no, but a global \neconomy means we move products back and forth, and sometimes we inherit \npolicies we may not like. But inheriting the capability through \nreimportation to allow the American consumer to pay less for \nprescription drugs than they would otherwise pay is good public policy \nand makes good sense for our citizens.\n  The Capitol is full of people who care a lot about drug prices, and \nthey are very concerned about this--they are lobbying this issue on \nbehalf of the pharmaceutical industry. They have every right to do \nthat. I talked about a woman named Elizabeth earlier. I know there was \nsome chiding about that, the teary stories about individuals. But I am \nwondering if Elizabeth has anyone who is going to grab somebody by the \narm before they vote and say: You know, it is very important that you \ncast your vote the right way.\n  Remember, Elizabeth is a farm wife who is 74 years old who drove a \ntractor until 2 years ago when she lost her husband and her lungs got \nworse.\n  She has scleroderma and was diagnosed at Mayo. She talks about how \nshe has been on oxygen for 2 years. She talks about the one new pill \nthat would cost $3,600 or more a year. She cannot afford it. But I ask: \nIf there is anybody in the Capitol Building today who is representing \nElizabeth today? There are plenty who represent those who want to keep \nthe current pricing strategy.\n  Or Velma:\n\n       I am 86 years old. I can't work.\n\n  That is pretty reasonable. She is 86 years old and says: I can't \nwork.\n\n       I get $303 in Social Security each month, and I pay $400 a \n     month for medicines.\n\n  She has had heart surgery and osteoporosis.\n  Sylvia Miller, 70 years old, diabetes, heart problems, emphysema. She \nwent with me to Emerson, Canada, to buy prescription drugs. In recent \nyears, she has spent $4,900 on her medicines. It was up $1,000 from the \nprevious year.\n  The point is, this is a very important issue. This is a tripartisan \nbill that is supported by Senator Jeffords and many on both sides of \nthe aisle. There is no one advocating reimportation who wants in any \nway ever to diminish the safety standards that exist that allow the \nAmerican people to access a safe supply of prescription drugs.\n  An important point is this: Prescription drugs are lifesaving and \nmiracle drugs only to those who can afford them when they need them. \nThey save no lives when those who need drugs cannot have access to \nthem. These prices are unfair, and reimportation will help put downward \npressure on prices.\n  I say to those who oppose reimportation, what approach do you have to \nput downward pressure on prescription drugs prices, or is it simply \nKatie bar the door? Is there another approach? I am willing to embrace \nalmost any approach that attempts to put downward pressure on drug \nprices.\n  The Cochran amendment is offered, I know, to try to effectively \nscuttle the issue of reimportation because it was effective in doing so \nto the bill we passed 2 years ago. At the time we did not know it would \nscuttle that legislation, but it did, with two Secretaries.\n  I think those who bank on the Cochran amendment effectively killing \nthis legislation this time are wrong. We have changed the reimportation \namendment this year. Our legislation now does not permit reimportation \nof medicines from Mexico. It does not allow for the reimportation of \nmedicine from Bangladesh. It does not allow for the reimportation of \nmedicines from China or Taiwan or South Korea. It allows for the \nreimportation of medicines from one country, Canada, a country that has \na nearly identical chain of supply to this country.\n  It will be, in my judgment, nearly impossible for a secretary to \nassert that there is additional risk by allowing the reimportation of \nprescription drugs from a country that has a nearly identical chain of \nsupply, a country that is our nearest neighbor, a country that is our \nlargest trading partner.\n  I do not believe the Cochran amendment is effectively going to kill \nreimportation. I know some believe this is a great way on behalf of the \npharmaceutical industry to do that, but I do not think so. As a matter \nof fact, I think the Cochran amendment will not have the impact it had \n2 years ago because the bill 2 years ago was not country specific. This \nbill is limited and deals only with the country of Canada.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania answered a question I did not ask, so \nlet me ask the real question and then answer that. I was asked a \nquestion: Why are prices higher here than in Canada? That is not the \nquestion I asked. I asked the question I have asked a dozen times, \nwhich is: Who here believes that an American citizen ought to have to \ngo to Canada to get a fair price on prescription drugs made in the \nUnited States? That is the question I asked. That still has not been \nanswered, and I do not believe it will be answered.\n  If I were to try to answer the question the Senator has asked--why \nare prescription drugs higher priced in the United States than in \nCanada?--the answer is fairly simple on two fronts. One, it is true \nthat Canada does have price controls and we do not. Second, I have held \na couple of hearing on this subject, and the answer as to why drug\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\ncosts in the U.S. are so high for prescription drugs is because the \ncharges are set in this country at whatever the consumer will bear. \nThat was essentially what the pharmaceutical manufacturers told us.\n  My feeling is that it is not a fair pricing system, and on behalf of \na lot of Americans, not just senior citizens who have to find a way to \naccess these prescription drugs to deal with their serious medical \nproblems, I think we need to find ways to put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices.\n  I do not want people going to Canada to access prescription drugs. \nThat is not the goal of this amendment. Our goal is to allow \npharmacists and distributors to bring them back, pass the savings \nalong, and that will force the pharmaceutical industry to reprice those \nprescription drugs in this country. That is our goal.\n  I finish with this point. It is interesting to me that some on the \nother side say those of us who want reimportation are saying the \npharmaceutical industry is a big, bad industry; shame on them for \nmaking profits. I have heard none of that rhetoric today. I certainly \nhave not taken part in that myself. I have said repeatedly, the \npharmaceutical industry is a big industry, a profitable industry. It \nhas done some terrific things. I commend it. I want them to do well. I \nwish them well. Their pricing strategy is wrong, and I want them to \nchange it.\n  They will not change it voluntarily, and I fully understand that. If \nthat is the industry I worked for, I would not change it voluntarily, I \nsuppose, because their responsibility to the stockholders is to \nmaximize profits. Since they have the ability to control prices in this \ncountry and maximize profits for their stockholders, that is exactly \nwhat they do. But if we are going to put a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program and if we are going to care about the needs of all \nAmericans, not just senior citizens, who can't afford prescription \ndrugs, then we have to do more.\n  We have to employ ways to put downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices. We have to do that. Failing to do so means we will break the \nbank, and I am not prepared to allow that to happen.\n  So that is why we offer this, not to tarnish the prescription drug \nindustry and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. I trust the Main Street \npharmacists. I trust those distributors. I trust the Canadian system \nwhich is nearly identical to ours.\n  I have heard this bizarre argument about counterterrorism and \ncounterfeit drugs. In fact, one of my colleagues brought some yellow \npaint, I guess yellow cement paint, and some other devices, none of \nwhich came from Canada. Isn't that interesting? Maybe I could have \nbrought some kangaroos to the floor of the Senate and watched them \njump. Wouldn't that be interesting? Sure, it is all interesting, but it \nhas no relevance to the discussion. So we can be interesting but maybe \nwhat we should do is care a little more about pricing of \npharmaceuticals in this country in a manner that is fair to the \nAmerican people. That is all we are trying to do with this amendment.\n  We are not trying to tarnish anybody. We are saying, give the \nAmerican people a fair break. If 10 cents is going to be charged for a \nbreast cancer drug in Canada, then do not charge a dollar for it to a \nwoman with breast cancer in the United States. Do not do that. It is \nnot fair to the American consumer. That is all we are saying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Breaux-\nCochran amendment to the Dorgan amendment on this subject of \nreimportation of prescription drugs from Canada. It is not my intent to \nstand here as an expert in regards to how much money the pharmaceutical \ncompanies of the United States should spend on advertising, how much \nmoney they should spend on R or to talk about the global imports \nwhere we have price controls in various countries, or even as to where \nmy tie came from.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota indicated that we have a lot of \nimports. My tie is from Italy, by the way. It is a gift from my \ndaughter. But the thing I want to talk about is safety, and this tie \nwhich came from Italy is safe, at least to the best of my knowledge it \nis, unless somebody gets ahold of me and yanks on the tie.\n  It is not my desire to talk about the hometown druggist whether it be \nin North Dakota or in Kansas, where I grew up, or whether you trust the \ndruggist. I do want to talk about safety, and I do want to talk about \nthe fact that Senator Santorum was kind enough to mention that I serve \non the Intelligence Committee, used to be chairman of the Subcommittee \non Emerging Threats on the Armed Services Committee. I am now the \nranking member with Senator Landrieu, who is doing an excellent job as \nchairman.\n  I am a little worried about this in regards to the language--I am not \na little worried, but I am concerned about the language of the Dorgan \namendment which passed and the safety issue that is raised by the \nCochran amendment, which I think is the better approach.\n  Basically, this amendment, for which I am a cosponsor, would require \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify that prescription \ndrugs that are reimported from Canada are indeed safe before--and that \nis the keyword, ``before,'' not after. You survey and you have some \nsort of a panel discussion and determine that at some date later we \nhave a situation where some drug was imported from Canada and it indeed \nwas unsafe. I would hate to think what would happen before we would \ntake notice of that, even in terms of lives being lost. So the key word \nis ``before'' we allow my constituents in Kansas or the constituents of \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota or the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan and others throughout the United States to \nreceive them.\n  As I have indicated, as a member of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, ranking member on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, I \nsee reimportation as another way--I would not have thought of it before \n9/11, but today I see it as another way for a terrorist organization to \ncause many human lives to be put at risk without the proper security \nmeasures in place.\n  One might say: Now, Senator Roberts, come on. Prescription drugs from \nCanada--this really represents a threat?\n  Well, we asked all the experts in the Emerging Threats Subcommittee \nsome time ago, prior to 9/11, what keeps you up at night in this unsafe \nworld? Bioterrorism came in No. 1, and I won't go into the rest of \nthem. We could probably list 100 different threats and the terrorists \nin their own inimical way would say we are going to do 101. It is an \nasymmetrical approach. How easy would it be to reenact the Tylenol \nscare that happened some years ago in regard to some kind of a \nterrorist threat?\n  We have seen the situation at the Capitol of the United States in \nregards to anthrax. Dr. Frist, the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, can give us about an hour lecture on that, what we saw then \nand what we see now in regard to what we have to do in terms of \nsafeguards.\n  I remember Operation Dark Winter, which was done about 2 years ago, \nabout the possibility of using a strain of smallpox from the former \nSoviet Union in Oklahoma City. Do you know how they distributed that? \nThey did it by basically walking through shopping centers and spraying \nplants. How easy would it be to use imported drugs from Canada?\n  So this year and years past, during the reimportation debate, Members \nof both the House and Senate have received statements from people who \nought to know in regard to the fact, is there a safety issue? That is \nfrom former FDA commissioners, the current and former heads of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The statement was made about \nthis administration, past administration--their testimony was exactly \nthe same--and officials of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n  They state they cannot assure the American people that reimported \ndrugs are safe. Cheaper, yes. I understand that. I understand the \ncompassion and the caring and the difference between drugs in regard to \nborder States and Canada or, for that matter, any State and Canada. I \nhope we can bring the prices down.\n  However, are they safe? They have even recently given testimony, all \nthe people I just talked about, as of July 9,\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\nabout a week or so ago, before the Select Committee on Aging. Why the \nSelect Committee on Aging? Obviously, every letter read by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota was a senior citizen who \ndesperately needs drugs. There is a quote by the Senator from Michigan \nindicating that Mr. Hubbard said, on balance, he would say it would be \nOK for somebody who is suffering from some malady to use a Canadian \ndrug.\n  I suppose if I were not in your home State and I were in Canada and \nsick and I didn't have much of a choice, I would say: OK, Mr. Hubbard, \nI think that is OK. I think I will take my chances. He is the senior \nassociate commissioner for policy, planning, and legislation at the \nFood and Drug Administration.\n  But he also testified, as the statement demonstrated by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan:\n\n       FDA cannot assure the public that reimported drugs made in \n     the U.S. have been stored under proper conditions or that \n     they are even the real product because the agency does not \n     regulate foreign distributors or pharmacists. Therefore, \n     unapproved drugs and reimported approved medications may be \n     contaminated, subpotent, superpotent, or counterfeit.\n\n  I don't know how the supporters of the underlying amendment can read \nthese statements by these experts and possibly indicate we are trying \nto scuttle the bill. I don't want to scuttle the bill. I want to put in \nthe proper safeguards. I don't want to put lives at risk without \nassurance to the safety of the American consumer.\n  The question is, Are we, the Members of the Senate, willing to put a \nnew burden of proof on an agency or agencies having to deal with a new \nset of priorities since September 11? We know in terms of trying to put \ntogether a new Homeland Security Agency, it is like pushing a rope; \nthat we will get it done, hopefully by September 11. Here we have yet \nanother large-scale security undertaking that they, the Customs \nService, in coordination with other departments and agencies, will have \nto administer without the resources, without the manpower and training \navailable to them to stop the counterfeit drugs that will put human \nlives, or could put human lives, at risk.\n  An example from Mr. Hubbard's testimony outlines exact fears we \nshould have in allowing reimportation without the safety guarantee. On \nMay 14 of this year, the Ontario College of Pharmacists, which is a \nCanadian Government agency, filed charges under the Ontario law against \nthe Canadian Drugstore, Ink. for unlawfully operating an unlicensed \npharmacy and using an unregistered pharmacist in filling prescriptions \nfor United States residents. The college also filed charges against a \nlicensed pharmacy and physician in Ontario for helping to facilitate \nthe delivery of prescription and nonprescription drugs to U.S. \nresidents. A drug wholesaler was charged with supplying medications to \na nonlicensed pharmacy.\n\n  Here is the key of the whole debate. As noted by Elizabeth Durant, \nthe executive director of Trade Promotions for the U.S. Customs \nService, at the same hearing on the Select Committee on Aging, Customs \nis working with the Food and Drug Administration to better identify \nadulterated or misbranded drugs entering our borders. However, she \nsaid, at this time they clearly do not have the manpower nor the \ninfrastructure in place to ensure adequately and screen all of the \nprescriptions that would enter our borders.\n  As an example given in Ms. Durant's testimony, we have a program. \nNothing has been said about this program during this entire debate, or \nat least I am not aware of it, and Customs has really initiated a \nprogram called Operation Safe Guard. During a recent phase of this \nprogram that took place at two international mail branches, 31 parcels \ncontaining 52 types of questionable pharmaceuticals underwent intensive \nanalysis. The analysis shows that eight of the so-called pharmaceutical \ndrugs--and, yes, they were less expensive--or 15 percent contained no \nidentifiable active ingredient. They were phony. And 18 contained a \nsubstance that is regulated under the Federal Controlled Substances \nAct.\n  There is example after example of unscrupulous practices by \nindividuals looking to take advantage of consumers desperately trying \nto find a more affordable way to get the prescriptions they must have. \nYes, we need to provide relief to Kansas seniors, to Minnesota seniors, \nto West Virginia seniors, to Massachusetts seniors, to Michigan \nseniors, North Dakota seniors, Oklahoma seniors, and Tennessee seniors. \nBut I cannot in good conscience support a measure that is a public \nhealth safety and security risk.\n  Instead of looking to our neighbors to the north for pricing relief \nand instead of relying on unsure and unsafe practices without the \nproper personnel and training in place to roll out a plan such as this, \nwe need to focus on passing meaningful prescription drug legislation. \nUntil I can assure my constituents in Kansas that the drugs they are \nreceiving are indeed what is labeled on the package, or an FDA-approved \npackage, I do not think the underlying amendment can be supported. This \nis why I urge my colleagues to support the Cochran-Breaux amendment.\n  The key word is ``before''; before a drug gets here, it is determined \nsafe. That is what this argument is all about. That is what the debate \nis all about.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senator made the point which is \nimportant and I tried to introduce earlier today. In this environment \nwhere we do have a lower threshold for worrying about terrorism and \nworrying about what comes across our borders, he made the linkage, \nbased on his experience dealing in the field of bioterrorism and the \nagriterrorism arena and the field of intelligence, that we are moving \nin one direction of bioterrorism to close our borders to the potential \nfor counterfeit agents, potential bioterror agents coming in. I made \nthe point earlier that we need to look at it in this new environment.\n  My question is, Does he agree with a recent op-ed published on July \n16 in the Washington Times by a former FBI agent linking bioterrorism \nand prescription drugs and reimportation? The agent states:\n\n       During my 3 decades with the FBI, however, I worked with \n     other Federal agencies whose main goal was preventing illegal \n     narcotics from crossing our borders. When going after \n     prescription drug shipments it usually was large quantities, \n     mostly acting on tips. Neither we nor the 3 Federal agencies \n     we cooperated with on such efforts--the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the \n     Customs Service--had enough personnel to go after \n     prescription drug smuggling at the time. With the massive new \n     threat of terrorism, we have even less resources to devote to \n     such activities. Terrorists easily could use the cover of \n     counterfeit drug smuggling to sneak lethal prescription drugs \n     or worse, biological and nuclear weapons, into our country.\n\n  Do you agree with the thrust of the FBI's statement?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In the Emerging Threat Subcommittee we heard from the \nBremmer commission, the Gilmore commission, the Hart-Rudman commission, \nthe Center for Strategic and International Studies Group, and the \nRumsfeld commission. In virtually every one of those commissions, they \nindicated the need for greater border security with all of the threats \nyou have mentioned.\n  We just had a hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee, and \nDirector Ridge just came before the committee. Secretary Ann Veneman of \nthe Department of Agriculture came before the committee. It is another \none of those cases where, as we try to reorganize the Department of \nHomeland Security, people get a little worried about their turf. People \nget a little worried about past practices. People say: Wait a minute; \ndo we need to transfer that whole agency over to the superagency?\n\n  There is an agency within the Department of Agriculture called the \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service. As you know, in working \nwith the bioterrorism bill, I had an agriterrorism section. We tried to \nramp up the funding for our basic research universities: Athens, GA, \nfor salmonella; Ames, IA, for the livestock industry; Plum Island, \nwhere you don't want to open up any refrigerator doors under any \ncircumstance because of the pathogens that are there. We found now that \nwe can use 3,200 of these employees who have the capability to take a \ncloser look and provide the kind of security the Senator is mentioning, \nto the Department of Homeland Security, keep the rest of the employees \nso if a farmer from Kansas or, for that matter, North Dakota says, \n``Hey, I\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nhave wheat rust,'' he doesn't have to pick up the phone and call Tom \nRidge. Or if he is going to try to enforce the Animal Welfare Act, \nthere is no need to do that. But 3,200 more people are needed just to \nprevent some kind of problem with security and danger or agriterrorism \nand food security and how easy it would be for the terrorist to use the \npharmaceutical that you are talking about to come in and do great \ndamage in our country.\n  The issue is safety, and the higher bar that we must have, now, to \nguarantee it.\n  The whole thing is, we used to talk about we have to detect, we have \nto deter, and then, in the worst case scenario, we have to get into \nconsequence management. Are we ready? The answer to that is no.\n  The new paradigm is we have to detect and preempt. We have to go on \nthe offensive and then deter and then get into consequence management.\n  What the Senator from Mississippi has done is simply said to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, please guarantee the safety of \nthese products before they come in, not afterwards; not after we see \nsome evidence that something will happen. It is a before-and-after \nquestion. Sure, that senior citizen before may get a drug that is more \ninexpensive. He may die. That is a dramatic kind of statement, but it \ncould happen.\n  That is how I would answer the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded the floor. The Chair \nrecognized the Senator from West Virginia. The Chair permitted a \nquestion. The question has been answered. The floor belongs to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think the Senator already asked the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We had an interesting and important discussion this \nafternoon for quite some time. I want to add a little bit to the \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake conversations off the floor so the Senator can be heard, and \nothers will be recognized thereafter.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Presiding Officer, I would like to put \na little perspective in what I see at least as the prescription drug \naspect of all this, which permeates part of this discussion, although \nit is not immediately apparent in the debate of this afternoon.\n\n  We have this historic opportunity to do something real in \nprescription drugs. We also have the historic opportunity to fail to do \nit or we have the historic opportunity to do it in such a way that it \nwill make us feel good but will not do anything to help seniors. In \nother words, that we would pass something which we could say we passed \nwhen we went home in August but would not in fact really help seniors \nin ways that are meaningful, something that I will not have anything to \ndo with, that kind of strategy.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, who is my good friend over many \nyears, that nowhere is the problem more visible with respect to \nprescription drugs, and therefore creating a sensible plan that will \naddress the problem of prescription drugs, than in the State I \nrepresent where 30 percent of the seniors have no drug coverage at all \nand 19 percent have very little drug coverage; therefore, basically \nhalf are more or less untouched entirely or to a great degree.\n  About a third of rural seniors as opposed to about a fourth of urban \nseniors--this is a 10 percent difference, but it makes a difference--\npay more than $500 out of pocket each year. So my first overriding \nconcern is the 336,000 seniors in the State of West Virginia. I will \nyield or sit down to nobody in fighting for them and for a plan which \nworks for them in one of the poorest States in the Nation.\n  The question is, seniors know there are no easy solutions. We talk as \nif there are, but there are not. We have to be honest with our \nconstituents about that. I know there is an election coming up. So \nwhat. A prescription drug bill that passes is a prescription drug bill \nthat lasts for a substantial period of time. We have to do it right. \nThere are a variety of alternative plans. I am not going to be \nreferring to any of them individually, but some of them are a whole lot \nbetter than others and people better start thinking about some of the \nissues involved. I am going to try to raise some of those issues.\n  Providing a real drug benefit to all seniors, a benefit that covers \nall seniors all the time for all drugs at a price they can afford, that \nis what we need to do. At the end of the day, to be quite honest with \nyou, seniors are not really enormously moved and do not care \ntremendously about whether it is a Democratic bill or whether it is a \nRepublican bill, whether it is a White House bill. That may have some \nshort-term advantage, but in terms of the way it affects their lives, \nwhich is what I care about, which is why I am here in this body, it \ndoesn't make any difference to them. They don't want to be promised \nsomething we cannot actually deliver. There is a lot of talk about that \nkind of stuff.\n  As seniors consider all the competing prescription drug bills, they \nneed to ask a number of very basic questions. One of the matters which \nI think people need to focus on is that the most important issue in all \nthis is the delivery mechanism. People say: What is that? It is the \ncore of the whole argument. It needs to be explained. It is a question \nof, really, who takes the risk?\n  One of the plans we are looking at--that is the way I am going to \nrefer to it, one, then another, et cetera--says that the insurance \ncompanies will take the risk. Chip Kahn was President of the Health \nInsurance Association of America. He says that is like insuring against \nhaircuts. An insurance company is not in the business of taking risk. \nThey can't, and they particularly can't where people are older, sicker, \nand frailer and are less likely to be able to afford either to join \nthem or to pay what it is that they charge.\n\n  On the other hand, you can also have a system where you use what you \ncall a government/private partnership, PPMs. That is in another plan. I \nhappen to favor that. They don't have to make a profit. They can set \nthe price on the medicine which is best for the senior. But the \nbusiness of who takes the risk is really important in all of this.\n  You say: How can you prove that? I will prove it indirectly. Since we \ndo not have this before us, in West Virginia we have one plan on \nMedicare+Choice. We have Medicare and we have Medicare+Choice. We have \nMedicare, but we only have one plan that affects one part of the State \ninvolved with one university and some counties right around it. It \ncovers 2 percent of the people in the State of West Virginia. That \nmeans it does not cover 98 percent. That means 98 percent of the people \nin West Virginia are not covered at all. They have a cap in their plan \nof $500 on their drug benefit.\n  That means if you use up your $500, you have a catastrophic something \nor other, by February, March, April, or May that is it--there is \nnothing you can do. There is no more expended. You have to pay for it \nyourself.\n  One good thing, though, that can be said about Medicare+Choice is \nthat, if the plan pulls out, the senior, the Medicare beneficiary, has \nthe option of a fallback position. That is to go back to fee-for-\nservice medicine. That is not included in any of the other plans. I use \nthe word ``other'' in the prescription drug plans that are before us. \nIt is included in one, but it is not included in the others. It is not \nincluded in the one from the House. It is not included in one of the \nseveral that are wandering around the Senate Finance Committee.\n  If you do not have a fallback position, you can't do anything. That \nmeans you are just out of it. The plan decides to pull out and you get \nnothing. If it is Medicare+Choice, and the plan decides to pull out \nbecause they can't make money, because you are poor, you have a lot of \npeople using services, and at least, therefore, you have the fallback \nposition and that is, you can go back to fee-for-service medicine. It \nis an extremely important aspect of all of this.\n  So the question that seniors ought to ask and we ought to ask \nourselves is, first, does the final plan that we vote on cover all \nseniors? Does it cover all seniors? Medicare does; not prescription \ndrugs but in other things it does.\n  Does it cover all seniors, as prescription drugs should? All seniors \nneed to know that they won't be left out of the prescription drug bill \njust because they\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\ncome from a State that has a lot of rural area where the cost of \nproviding services is much higher. The plan I support covers all \nseniors in every State.\n  Seniors can get their drugs through their local pharmacy, just as \nthey do now. There is no difference. The government and the private \nsector would be working together to make sure all seniors are covered \njust like Medicare today. That makes sense to me. The other plans say \nthat every senior is ``eligible'' for coverage. But, in fact, many \nseniors won't get any benefit at all under these other plans. That is \nbecause those plans leave up to private insurers the decision where and \nwhen and to whom they will offer coverage.\n  The experience of rural areas--and certainly in my State--is the \nplans and insurance companies have said they want to have nothing to do \nwith ensuring prescription drug benefits. They made it very plain. The \nother plans pretend they haven't said that and go ahead and include \nthem.\n  Private insurers are focused on profits. ``Profits'' is not a dirty \nword. But it becomes an important word when you are talking about the \ndistribution and accessibility and the affordability of prescription \ndrugs.\n  We know from experience that the insurance companies will simply not \nvoluntarily ensure seniors in parts of the State of Minnesota. They \nwill in others but they won't in other parts. Or insurance companies \nwill have the ability to have certain kinds of benefits in these kinds \nof areas, and other kinds of benefits in other kinds of areas. In other \nwords, nothing is defined, and nothing is consistent that people can \nreally count on. That is really wrong in prescription drugs. If we pass \na bill that does that, that is wrong. That is the wrong thing to do to \nseniors.\n  We need to think about that. Seniors need to be on the alert for \nexactly that kind of behavior.\n  Second, does the final plan cover all seniors all the time?\n  Seniors need a benefit that is universal. They do not know when they \nare going to get sick or have a catastrophic incident. They have to \nknow that it is going to be there for them all the time. They need \nbenefits that help them 365 days a year.\n  The plan I support covers all seniors, all year, without a gap in \nbenefits, and with no gaps in coverage. Other plans stop after a \nsenior's drug costs exceed $2,000, and even if it happens to be in the \nfirst month of the year, or gives seniors no coverage at all for costs \nbetween $2,000 and $3,700. That is called a doughnut. It is a very \nserious problem, and a very real problem.\n  When you say people do not know what you are talking about \nnecessarily out there, even in here a doughnut is a bad thing to do. \nWhen you say that you are stop-loss at $2,000 through $3,700, you have \nto pay everything in between, that is a wrong policy. Some of the other \nplans have it. The House plans have that. One of the plans floating \naround in the Senate Finance Committee has that. It is wrong.\n  Third, does the final plan cover all seniors all the time for all \ndrugs?\n  That is the third question seniors need to ask us and that we need to \nbe asking ourselves as we evaluate what we are going to do, if we are \ngoing to do something.\n  Seniors want to make decisions about which drugs are taken on advice \nof their doctor. They don't want to have it done on the advice of their \ninsurance companies. We have heard about that for years--doctors having \nto dial insurance companies to get permission to do something which \nthey know they have to do. They resent it. They are denied. Nobody can \ndo anything about it. Doctors and patients should make key health \ndecisions. I think that is a moral compass for how we look at a \nprescription drug bill.\n\n  Under the plan I support, seniors have a guaranteed benefit. Seniors \nand their doctors will decide which medicines are best for them to \ntake, and they will take those medicines.\n  The other plans, as I say, talk about a standard benefit--the beauty \nof words in the Congress. But the fact is they too often leave it up to \nthe insurance companies to decide which drugs will be covered. And that \nis not a guaranteed benefit for all drugs.\n  We went through this in the Medicare Commission for a year. It was a \nquestion about do you have a defined benefit? Do you have an actuarial? \nPeople ask, What does actuarial mean? The point is that in one you get \na benefit for all seniors all across America, and in others you get a \ncertain amount of money. When the money runs out, you are on your own.\n  It is cruel. It is cruel. It is wrong. But it is in two of the three \nmain plans that we are considering on prescription drugs, and people \nneed to know about it.\n  Four, does the final plan cover all seniors all the time for all \ndrugs at a price which they can afford?\n  None of these questions strike me as unreasonable, if we are doing \nsomething as stark as this.\n  We have been talking about this for 5 years. I have sat for the last \n4 years in sometimes up to three meetings a day in Finance Committee \nmeetings and with staff trying to discuss all of these things, and here \nwe are again. That is fine, if we produce a decent product. I don't \ncare. The senior Senator from Massachusetts has a theory that sometimes \nthings take 10 or 12 years to pass. If you have to do that for \nprescription drugs, that is a bad thing because, in the meantime, a lot \nof people are dying and suffering needlessly. But the plan I support on \nthis matter of affordability is the only one with the guaranteed \naffordable premium for every senior in the country of just $25 a \nmonth--not 50 percent; for every senior, therefore, in the country, \njust $25 a month, and no large, upfront deductible.\n  Seniors would pay $10 for any generic drug up to $40 for more \nexpensive brand name drugs. That is fair. After $4,000 in total dollars \nin out-of-pocket spending, all drug costs would be covered by--guess \nwhat--the Federal Government. Yes, medicine is expensive. Seniors are \nimportant. They are growing in size and in frailty. We are involved in \ntheir lives.\n  Just as under Medicare, seniors pay the same amount regardless of \nwhere they live or how much their income is each year. Some people \ndispute that. It is the moral principle of a social contract.\n  The other plans, again, as I say, in the spirit of not being unkind, \nmostly provide what they call ``estimates,'' or ``averages,'' like the \nword ``actuarially.'' It is one of those good words that makes you \nbelieve that everything is in good hands, except when the time comes \nfor this to work it just doesn't quite work. Rather than real costs, \nseniors can compare. They talk about ``estimates,'' or ``averages.'' \nBut if you look at the details, it is clear that every one of those \nplans has a higher premium, and large, upfront deductibles and higher \ncopayments. That is a fact.\n  For example, the premium under the House-passed bill is ``estimated'' \nat $33 a month. But the insurance companies can set it higher. Why? \nBecause they are establishing the risk. They are setting the price. If \nthey don't like the risk, the price goes up. If they are out in \nWestchester County, the price goes down. If they go to West Virginia, \nthe price goes out of sight. So they don't come to West Virginia \nbecause they can't make any money.\n  We are not blaming them for it. It is a fact of the way the free \nenterprise system works. Should West Virginia seniors, if anybody is \ninterested, pay more than those in other States?\n  The House bill also has a suggested $250 upfront deductible that \nseniors have to pay every year, although that could be set higher by \nthese same insurance companies for the same reasons.\n  Again, it is the benefit of how you do the mechanism which sends \nthese benefits out. If you do it through the insurance company, they do \nnot like risk. They don't like old, frail people. For those eligible to \ndo it through the PBM, they do not have to make money, and they look at \nit differently.\n  So, again, for costs between $2,000 and $3,700, seniors get nothing. \nThat is a big gap in coverage. It means millions of seniors will pay \nthousands more under the House bill.\n  I am about to conclude.\n  Seniors have been waiting for more than a decade while we in Congress \nfight about all this. I want to repeat what I said when I started by \nsaying some of my colleagues have suggested--my colleagues on my side \nof the aisle--that if we cannot achieve a fair and comprehensive \nbenefit, then we should accept a weak and watered-down bill. And what \nis it that is getting us all worried?\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\n  We all know we are going to have to get 60 votes. We are going to \nhave to get 60 votes. None of the plans has enough votes right now, so \nwe have to get 60 votes.\n  So that is what leads you to a watered-down plan, just so we can go \nhome in August and say that we have done something.\n  We all get good benefits. Seniors all across America being left with \nthe results of a watered-down prescription drug bill is not something \nthat I am going to be a part of, I say to the Presiding Officer.\n  We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do something extraordinarily \nmeaningful for every senior and every American family. Anything else \nis, and should be, unacceptable to every single one of us.\n  In the end, I want to enact a bill that guarantees West Virginians \nthe same access to lifesaving and life-enhancing prescription drugs as \npeople in other States. But the bill has to be right, it has to be \nfair, and it has to cover the right aspects. If it does not, we should \nnot do it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now at a point where the Republican \nleader signed off on our being able to have a vote. We wanted to do \nthat at 5:40. The last vote was at 2:30. We have been on this \namendment, we have basically agreed to, now for 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  My point is, I know Senator Ensign is in the Chamber and wishes to \nspeak.\n  I ask my colleague how long he would like to speak.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. About 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK. Senator Durbin, 10 minutes; Senator Wellstone--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And 5 minutes for Senator Kennedy. So that is 40 minutes, I \nthink. Does anyone else on the Republican side wish to speak?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I understand Senator Bunning would like 15 minutes, and \nSenator Enzi would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK. If I could have someone add up that time, that is an \nhour and 5 minutes. I wonder if we could work that out to save a few \nminutes. We need to get to military construction tonight. So rather \nthan an hour and 5 minutes, let's do an hour.\n  Do you think Senator Bunning could go for 14 minutes? I bet he could. \nHe is a good guy. Senator Bunning for 14 minutes--I say to my friends \nin the minority, they have had most of the time this afternoon. I think \nif we can just cut a few minutes, and if I could stop talking, it would \nhelp a little bit, too.\n  So I am wondering if we could ask unanimous consent that the vote \nwill occur at 6 o'clock, with the time proportionately taken from every \nspeaker that has requested time--30 seconds, something like that, from \nevery speaker. I think we can work that out. The vote would be on or in \nrelation to the amendment, No. 4301, and the time is as indicated.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator would yield, I will keep mine under 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. That will take care of the problem.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, thank you very much.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 6:05, as per the \nagreement, with no intervening amendment in order prior to disposition \nof the Cochran amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I will not object. But I ask the \nSenator, you locked in time?\n  Mr. REID. Everybody has the time except Senator Ensign. He graciously \ntook 5 minutes off his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, while I support the underlying \namendment, I want to talk about a prescription drug proposal that I \nbelieve, and the other authors of this bill believe, could be the \nanswer that seniors are looking for around the country.\n  Senator Hagel and Senator Gramm and Senator Lugar and myself have \nbeen working on a proposal that I have worked on for a couple years \nalong with Senator Hagel.\n  This proposal, to keep it very brief, has two major components. The \nfirst component of our proposal allows every senior to participate on a \nvoluntary basis. They sign up for a $25 fee. This takes care of just \nthe administrative costs. This $25 fee allows them to get a \nprescription drug discount card.\n  We use the private sector. The private sector will set up what are \ncalled pharmaceutical benefit managers. These managers will offer \ncertain drug plans. Seniors can choose between those drug plans. The \nbetter the drug plan, the better chance they have of attracting \nseniors.\n  It is estimated there will be somewhere between 25 to 40 percent \nsavings for seniors using this prescription drug discount card. The \nreason they will save money is, very simply, that they are taking \nadvantage of volume buying.\n  We see volume buying all the time. HMOs buy in volume, in bulk. So \nseniors will get the advantage of this volume buying when they are on \nMedicare and they sign up for this card.\n  The second part of our plan caps out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The biggest thing that we hear from seniors these days is that they \nare afraid they are going to be bankrupt. We had an e-mail in our \noffice that came in a little after 11 o'clock Pacific Coast Time last \nweek. It was from a person who said that many seniors have to choose \nbetween rent and prescription drugs. So they were saying: Will you step \nup to the plate, the ``moral plate,'' as this person called it, and do \nsomething that seniors really need?\n  Our plan actually does something that seniors really need. It \nprovides them the prescription drug coverage by capping out-of-pocket \nexpenses.\n  Let me give a couple illustrations.\n  For a senior citizen who has now signed up for the plan, let's say \nthey make anything less than 200 percent of poverty--which is, for an \nindividual $17,700 per year; for a couple it is almost $24,000 a year--\nif they are below 200 percent of poverty, our bill caps their out-of-\npocket expenses at $1,500, so basically $120 a month.\n  So let's take, for instance, somebody who has diabetes or somebody \nwho is a cardiac patient or a cancer patient, and they have $4,000, \n$5,000, $6,000 a year in drug expenses. This is what they are going to \npay. Those are the seniors who need it the most.\n  The nice thing about our plan is--we are hearing about cost estimates \nof the, quote, ``tripartisan'' bill as being somewhere around $370 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Other plans are floating around out \nthere, and that may be $650 billion-plus.\n  Our plan looks like it is going to come in at an estimate of about \n$150 billion over 10 years. The other plans, in the next 10 years, \nreally skyrocket. Ours goes up, like every plan does, but it does not \ngo up significantly.\n  This is something for which the next generation can afford to pay; \nthe other plans that are being talked about, the next generation \ncannot.\n  The reason our bill costs so much less money is a simple fact: If you \nkeep the senior citizen, who is going to be getting these prescription \ndrugs--the Medicare recipient--in the accountability loop, that means \nwhen they are paying the first dollars out of pocket--up to, for the \nlower income seniors, $1,500 per year--they will be cost conscious. \nThat means they will go out and shop. They will make sure those plans \nhave the drugs they need at a price they can afford. So we will have \nseniors all across the country shopping for their prescription drugs.\n\n  If we just give them a plan and say we will cover everything, the \nseniors quit shopping. The market forces then don't keep the \ncompetition where it needs to be. Because about half the seniors in \nAmerica have less than $1,200 per year in prescription drug costs, that \nis where the huge savings comes to the taxpayer in our plan. We are \nlooking out for the senior with our plan, but we are also looking out \nfor the taxpayer. For the future of the next generation and the \ngeneration after that, we cannot afford to ignore the taxpayer because \nsomebody has to pay for this prescription drug benefit.\n  All of us want to take care of our parents and our grandparents, and \nwe want to be taken care of someday. Especially for those who really \ncannot afford it and are having to choose between sometimes what they \nare eating\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nand whether they are taking their medicines or whether they are able to \npay rent that month and whether they are going to be able to take their \nmedicine, it is a real problem. But we have to do it in a way that is \nfiscally responsible. We think our bill does that.\n  I have a real life example--we have received some numbers--of a \nsenior citizen who is around 68 years of age. This is a profile of a \nreal senior, but we won't release any names because of privacy. This \npatient makes around $17,000, is being treated for diabetes, has no \nprescription drug coverage today, and pays a total of about $5,700 \ncurrently per year. Under the Democrat proposal, at least the parts we \ncan tell from it, this person would pay around $2,100 a year, saving \nabout $3,900 a year. Under the tripartisan proposal, the person would \npay about $2,300, saving about $3,700 a year. Under our proposal, this \nperson would pay about $1,900 a year, saving around $3,800 a year.\n  So for the person who really needs it, who has serious disease and \nhas a lot of prescription drug costs, our bill actually saves that \nperson more, by a couple hundred dollars at least, than either the \nDemocrat proposal or the tripartisan proposal. Yet it does this in a \nway that is responsible to the taxpayer because our bill is literally \nhundreds of billions of dollars less than the competing proposals.\n  I am urging my colleagues to take a look at this plan. This plan \nwould go into effect at least a year earlier than any of the other \ncompeting plans. It can go into effect on January 1 of 2004. The other \nplans don't go into effect until January 1, 2005. Our plan is permanent \nas well. One of the other plans is sunsetted.\n  Our plan is easy to understand. If you take a look at it, it doesn't \nsound that easy to understand except when compared to the other plans \nwhich are much more complicated. It is much easier to understand for \nthe senior. It provides the benefit and most of the benefit to those \nwho truly need it.\n  I reiterate--and this must be reiterated time and time and time \nagain--it is responsible to the next generation. We cannot afford to \npay for seniors today and forget about the next generation. We all want \nto take care of the seniors today, but we must do it in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  To sum up, a $25 fee, you get into the plan. You get a prescription \ndrug discount card which saves you 25 to 40 percent. Then, depending on \nincome, we cap your out-of-pocket expenses. For those 200 percent of \npoverty and below, their cap will be $1,500. For those 200 or 400 \npercent of poverty, they are capped at $3,500 out-of-pocket expenses \nfor the year. For those at 400 to 600 percent, they are capped at \n$5,500. And for the wealthiest, they can still participate. But for the \nRoss Perots of the world, they have to pay 20 percent of their income \nin prescription drug costs before they benefit. So the Ross Perots of \nthe world, those people who do not need the coverage like that, will \nnot get the coverage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, there are other Senators on the \nfloor. I had spoken earlier. I think I can probably cover the ground in \n3 or 4 minutes.\n  I think it is best to be as concrete as possible. Coumadin is a blood \nthinner widely used in the United States. A bottle is $20.99. For the \nsame bottle, dosage, the Canadian price is $6.23. Zocor, which is a \ncholesterol drug, in the United States: $116.69; our neighbor Canada, \n$5.51; Permax, to manage Parkinson's disease, $398.24; Canadian price, \n$189.26; tamoxifen, breast cancer drug, $287.16; the Canadian price, \nU.S. dollars, 24.78.\n  That is what this amendment is about that Senator Dorgan and I, \nSenator Stabenow, and others have supported. Our amendment passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  I have heard so much said in the last couple hours. That is why it is \nhard to get started, because if you get started, it goes on and on.\n  Families USA came out with a study today that makes it pretty clear \nthat by a 2-to-1 margin, pharmaceutical companies spend the money on \nadvertising and marketing as opposed to research, with profits beyond \nbelief--what I have described as Viagra-like profits--based upon the \nmisery, sickness, and illness of elderly people.\n  The pharmaceutical industry hates this amendment that has passed. \nThey don't want to see people in Minnesota or Illinois or anywhere in \nthe country get this discount, and they don't want to see downward \npressure on prices. They don't want this to happen. The industry would \nbe happy for us to pump in as much money as possible, as long as we \ngive them a blank check and they can fill it in.\n  The amendment we have before us, the Cochran amendment, basically \nsays that this amendment we just passed, this legislation, only becomes \neffective if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies to \nthe Congress that implementation of this section will ``pose no \nadditional risk to the public health and safety and will result in a \nsignificant reduction in cost of covered products.''\n  I don't know about the ``reduction.'' I think it is pretty clear it \nis going to be a significant reduction.\n  I have two views about this. The first is, we have had two prior \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services--it creates such a loophole \nthat they have refused to provide the certification. The pharmaceutical \nindustry, which is so powerful and has always gotten its way, it gives \nthem the perfect opportunity to lobby against it and stop it--no \nquestion about that.\n  This amendment may have passed with all of our votes, although I must \nsay I will vote for it with very mixed feelings because I believe in my \nheart of hearts that this Secretary of Health and Human Services will \ndo everything to block implementation of the legislation we passed \nearlier today.\n  However, there are at least two or three things that are different, \nand now the optimist in me will conclude. One is that we are only \ntalking about Canada. Anybody who really looks at this with any kind of \nrigor will realize it is hard to argue when you don't have the same \nstringent health and safety guidelines, and all of this has to be FDA \nguidelines in any case, No. 1.\n  Second of all, expectations are up. If you don't think this isn't a \nbig deal to people--to have a dramatic reduction in the price of \nprescription drugs so they can afford it--you are wrong.\n  Therefore, I believe what has happened today--this amendment will \npass overwhelmingly, close to a 100-percent vote. It has raised \npeople's expectations. I don't mind that. I would rather have \nexpectations raised than lowered around the country. And it is not just \nsenior citizens; it is all citizens who benefit from this.\n  My final message to the Senior Federation of Minnesota and the other \ncitizens groups who have been fighting so hard is that we should have \nan overwhelming vote for prescription drug reimportation, and then a \nstrong vote for the Cochran amendment. I think we have more to deal \nwith on health and safety issues, but we have to do it this way. But if \nthis Secretary of Health and Human Services should block this in \nperpetuity--and it is clear he has no intention of certifying this--or \nany Secretary of Health and Human Services, representing either party--\nas a couple colleagues on the other side of the aisle give me that \nlook--I say to the seniors of Minnesota, and all other citizens, all \nthose buses you have been taking to Canada, take them right here to \nWashington, DC. Come right to the office of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and demand that he or she not block this in the future.\n  We are expecting Secretary Thompson to move on this. We are not \nexpecting him to use the Cochran amendment as a gigantic loophole to \nblock the legislation we passed today that would provide a serious \ndiscount and would provide many more affordable prescription drugs to \npeople.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I will join the buses if we need to go \ndown to the office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Let's \nhope we don't need to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes \nabout adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program.\n  Over the next few weeks, the Senate will debate one of the most \nimportant issues we will consider this year whether to provide a \nmedicare prescription drug benefit to seniors.\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\n  But I am afraid that if we do not get our act together and start \nreally working together it will all be a huge waste of time.\n  I think we can all agree that something needs to be done. The cost of \ndrugs is going up and up. It is the fastest rising medical expense that \nseniors and many other Americans face.\n  And it is clear that medicare now is not set up to deal with this \nproblem.\n  Medicare is still basically a 1965 program that is struggling to keep \nup with health care in the year 2002.\n  Health care has changed dramatically in the last three and a half \ndecades.\n  When Medicare was first set up, prescription drug costs were low. \nPeople were more concerned about being able to afford hospital stays.\n  Now because of medical advances and the amazing things we can do with \nthese medicines, the relative costs of hospital stays are less \nimportant. But the cost of prescriptions are rising.\n  However, the medicare fee structure is not flexible enough to adapt \nto this change.\n  It must change.\n  In a perfect world, we would be debating a broader Medicare reform \nbill now along with a prescription drug benefit.\n  It would be the most effective way to go, and it is something I hope \nwe can address before too long.\n  But for today, we are talking about a drug benefit. We are all for \nit. The question is: How do we set it up and how do we pay for it?\n  Before I get into the substance of this issue, I think we need to \nfirst talk about process.\n  The Senate is built on procedure. Here we still follow precedents and \nrules that were handed down over two centuries ago.\n  It is important, and it makes a big difference when it comes to \npassing legislation.\n  In the case of the bill before us today, that process has not worked \nvery well.\n  In fact, it hasn't worked at all.\n  I hope we have a long, thorough debate to make sure that members have \ntime to closely examine the base bill.\n  After all, it doesn't even have a committee report attached to it to \nallow Members and staff to fully examine and assess what is in the \nlegislation.\n  It was rushed through the help committee and to the floor for this \ndebate because the committee of jurisdiction--the finance committee--\ncouldn't agree on its own Medicare proposal.\n  Finance has had problems because this is a tricky, complicated issue. \nAnd the only way the majority could start today's debate was by \nbringing up the generic bill instead.\n  In my book, that is putting the cart before the horse. This is too \nimportant an issue not to get right.\n  We have to be careful.\n  Procedurally, we got off on the wrong foot, and while it might not \nseem that important on the surface, little twists and turns like this \ncan make a difference when it comes to the fine print of the \nlegislation.\n  We all know this is going to end up really being a debate about a \nprescription drug benefit. Generics are part of that, and I have no \nobjection to considering this issue in the Senate.\n  That is why we are here--to legislate and make the tough calls.\n  But when the bill before us today is brought to the floor in such a \nbackwards way it makes me nervous.\n  The fact is that we are doing the body a disservice by not letting \nthe finance committee finish its work.\n  They have the most expertise in this area.\n  They have been wrestling with this the longest. I sure hope the \nmajority does not try to rush them, and the full Senate, anymore into \nwriting a bad bill.\n  This is a pattern we have seen before, and the results have been bad.\n  Virtually the same thing happened with the energy bill.\n  In that case, the majority leadership didn't like how things were \ngoing in the energy committee, so they brought their own separate bill \nto the floor and bypassed the committee.\n  In the end we passed legislation, but I know that it was not as good \na bill as we could have passed if the committee of jurisdiction had \nbeen able to finish working its will.\n  We have seen this happen again and again--on the farm bill, the \neconomic stimulus bill, the railroad retirement bill, and the patients' \nbill of rights.\n  In each case, we passed something. But we as a body didn't do our \nbest work.\n  It is just as important to get things right than to get them done \nfast.\n  In the case of Medicare and prescription drugs, the majority is \npushing us and pushing aside the only bipartisan prescription drug \nbill.\n  That should tell you something. And it can make a big difference when \nit comes to the substance.\n  We all know that many older Americans are faced with making some \ntough choices when deciding how to pay for their prescription drugs.\n  We have all heard of the sacrifices seniors make to afford their \nprescription drugs.\n  Some cut their pills in half to make their medication last longer or \ncut back on their grocery purchases to have enough money left over for \nanother month's supply of their medication.\n  Many seniors can't get their doctor's prescriptions filled because \nthey simply cannot afford them.\n  These are decisions that no American living in the year 2002 should \nhave to make, and we in Congress have a moral obligation to pass a \nprescription drug bill this year, and get it to the President to sign.\n  I support the tripartisan plan that has been put together by several \nmembers of the Finance Committee.\n  In a nutshell, this proposal establishes a new voluntary prescription \ndrug benefit in the Medicare Program, along with making some changes to \nthe Medicare+Choice program to make it more competitive.\n  Monthly premiums are relatively low--$24. There is an affordable \ndeductible of $250 per year.\n  Those who need the most help--those seniors living 150 percent below \npoverty receive extra assistance with costs.\n  And there is extra protection when out-of-pocket costs skyrocket too \nhigh.\n  It is a sensible proposal that means real relief to all seniors.\n  It is these seniors who benefit the most from this bill, and we have \na responsibility to help them today--not tomorrow or the day after. But \nnow.\n  Because of the way this issue is being handled on the Senate floor, \nwe could very easily end up at the end of this prescription drug debate \nwith no bill at all.\n  Because it has been rushed to the floor--because the Finance \nCommittee is still working on a number of competing proposals--there is \nno real consensus about what to pass.\n  This could mean that no one bill gets a majority of the votes and \nnothing passes.\n  If that happens, we'll be back exactly where we started--with no \nrelief for American seniors.\n  Congress can pass a prescription drug bill this year, and we can \nstart helping seniors with their prescription costs in the near future.\n  We have been talking about it for years. Now we have a chance to do \nit.\n  But it is going to take real dedication by all Members of this \nChamber to actually pass a bill.\n  And it is going to take more respect for the process, for the time \nand chance to make thoughtful, deliberative decisions.\n  Personally, I hope we don't succumb to playing politics with what is \nliterally a life or death issue for many older Americans.\n  While the process we are working under looks like it has been set up \nto fail, I still think and hope we can come up with some sort of \nproposal.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, all here today have the same goal in mind, \nand that same goal is to be sure we have the lowest priced, best, and \nmost available prescription drugs in the world. We do want to make sure \nthe cost is as low as possible. How we get there we have some \ndisagreement over, and I would like to take a moment to address the \nfirst-degree amendment that is before us right now, which I hope will \nbe corrected with the second-degree amendment.\n  The first-degree amendment would allow for pharmacies and \npharmaceutical distributors to reimport drugs\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nfrom Canada. I continue to have two major concerns about the amendment.\n  First, as my colleague from Mississippi has articulated, there is no \nway to assure the safety of drugs reimported from Canada. Experts, \nincluding two Secretaries of Health and Human Services, said it cannot \nbe safely implemented for consumers. That is probably even more true \nsince September 11 and the anthrax attack. Safety is the reason we do \nnot have it right now.\n  I believe we are presently operating under the Prescription Drug \nMarketing Act of 1987, which expressly bans the reimportation of drugs \nto protect the public health and the integrity of the distribution \nmarket in the United States. It passed the Senate unanimously. That \nmeans everybody who was here on March 31, 1988, agreed for it to go \nthrough.\n  Former Senator Al Gore was a cosponsor, and on the House side it was \nimplemented and backed by such outstanding conservatives as \nRepresentative John Dingell and Representative Henry Waxman. They were \nthe key House sponsors of the legislation. The finding in the bill as \npassed did focus on the risk of reimportation to consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the findings from that bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following--\n       (1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs \n     with the certainty that the products are safe and effective.\n       (2) The integrity of the distribution system for \n     prescription drugs is insufficient to prevent the \n     introduction and eventual retail sale of substandard, \n     ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs.\n       (3) The existence and operation of a wholesale submarket, \n     commonly known as the ``diversion market'', prevents \n     effective control over or even routine knowledge of the true \n     sources of prescription drugs in a significant number of \n     cases.\n       (4) Large amounts of drugs are being reimported to the \n     United States as American goods returned. These imports are a \n     health and safety risk to American consumers because they may \n     have become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling \n     and shipping.\n       (5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has \n     been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against \n     American manufacturers and has provided the cover for the \n     importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.\n       (6) The existing system providing drug samples to \n     physicians through manufacturer's representatives has been \n     abused for decades and has resulted in the sale to consumers \n     of misbranded, expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals.\n       (7) The bulk resale of below wholesale priced prescription \n     drugs by health care entities, for ultimate sale at retail, \n     helps fuel the diversion market and is an unfair form of \n     competition to wholesalers and retailers that must pay \n     otherwise prevailing market prices.\n       (8) The effect of these several practices and conditions is \n     to create an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, \n     misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold to \n     American consumers.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I will read a couple:\n\n       (1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs \n     with the certainty that the products are safe and effective.\n       (2) The integrity of the distribution system for \n     prescription drugs is insufficient to prevent the \n     introduction and eventual retail sale of substandard, \n     ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs.\n       (5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has \n     been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against \n     American manufacturers and has provided the cover for \n     importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.\n\n  It is interesting; some of the people who debated in favor of doing \nthat--and, as I mentioned, it passed unanimously--we are having that \nsame debate right now, and the same arguments are valid for why that \nwould not provide a good solution for consumers.\n  I also mention S. 2244 would create a second route for transporting \ndrugs into the United States outside the existing regulatory system. \nThe bill would allow pharmacists and wholesalers to purchase drugs from \nCanadian sellers over which the United States authority, the FDA, and \nothers have no jurisdiction or control. It provides the threat of \ncounterfeits and does not depend on the integrity of the product itself \nbut on the integrity of those handling the product.\n  Even worse, the bill would require drug manufacturers to disseminate \ntheir drug formulations and chemical fingerprints to potentially \nthousands of pharmacies and wholesalers. This information, currently \nprotected as a trade secret, could be worth millions of dollars per \ndrug on the black market.\n  Counterfeiters could obtain drug formulations and learn how to make \ntheir fake drugs look real and survive chemical analysis. \nNotwithstanding these very real safety concerns, it is unlikely the \nbill would achieve the goal of bringing cheaper drug products to U.S. \nconsumers.\n  The cost savings we talk about might be obtained but more likely \nwould be absorbed by the fees that would be charged by the exporters, \nthe wholesalers, the pharmacists, and the testing labs.\n  The bill also requires Canadian sellers to register with the FDA. \nHowever, because the FDA has no authority to inspect foreign \nfacilities, the agency will have no way of knowing whether these \nregistered firms are legitimate, whether they handle and store drugs \nproperly, or whether the drugs were manufactured under current good \nmanufacturing practices. That is the first reason.\n  I hope our colleagues who support the amendment and have been on the \nfloor today urging us to support the amendment so seniors can have \naccess to the drug pricing structure that Canada has imposed on drug \ncompanies will look a little bit at Canada. Canada, which operates a \nsocialized national medical system, has imposed price controls on \nprescription drugs. Canada has also imposed rationing in other health \ncare services, such as dialysis for elderly patients suffering from \nkidney failure. But we probably do not want to import that policy.\n  I know a lot of people from Canada who come down to the United States \nto get their health care because they cannot get all of the choices the \nUnited States has, and even when they can get the choices, have to wait \nin line for it. I think it has already been covered a little bit by my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania that in Canada they bid for the drugs.\n  You do not get all of the drugs. You get the one drug that will \nhandle that general practice, and the country gets competition by \nbidding among the several people who try to handle that particular \nailment. By bidding on it, they are able to drive some of the prices \ndown. They also eliminate choices for doctors and for consumers, \nultimately the consumers.\n  If what we are trying to do is price controls, we can do price \ncontrols, too. We probably ought to be debating them as price controls, \nlegislate them, affirmative approval, and setting U.S. price controls. \nI hope we do not do that. I am not serious at all in suggesting that \nbecause when my wife and I first went into the shoe business, it was at \nthe time that Nixon was in office and they talked about price controls. \nAs soon as they talked about price controls, the companies that were \nsupplying us with shoes did a 30-percent increase in the price of the \nshoes. Then, as soon as price controls went into effect, they did the \n20-percent increase that they were allowed to do.\n  People were paying 50 percent more for shoes than they should have \nbeen just because the companies were worried about how they were going \nto be able to continue their profits. I can say that each and every \nyear on the date they were allowed to raise their prices, they raised \ntheir prices. It had nothing to do with what the cost of the shoes \nwere, but it affected the consumer dramatically.\n  Passing the Dorgan amendment is not only having Canada legislate for \nAmerica, it is denying Congress and the American people the opportunity \nto fairly debate the matter. I do not think we are ready to do that \nyet. We all want to have the lowest priced pharmaceuticals we possibly \ncan, but we do want to have the safety factor, and I do not think we \nwant to have price controls or the Canada method of doing health care.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if I understand the unanimous consent, I \nam entitled to 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this debate about prescription drugs \nreally comes down to a very fundamental issue. It is an issue about \nwhether or not the pharmaceutical companies will prevail and continue \nto charge the highest prices in the world to American consumers or \nwhether the consumers of America, the families and the small \nbusinesses, will prevail and finally bring to this marketplace some \ncompetition, some form of oversight, that gives them a fighting chance.\n  America believes in its drug industry. We understand the miracles \nthat have occurred because of research and hard work within that drug \nindustry. Look at the money we pump every year into the National \nInstitutes of Health, taxpayer dollars spent by this Congress at the \nNational Institutes of Health, to find new cures for diseases--last \nyear, $23.5 billion. I supported it. I will support it again this year; \nit is money well spent to find cures for diseases that plague Americans \nand the world.\n  Look at what we do as well: We say to these pharmaceutical companies \nwe will give them a tax credit for research and development. We give \nthem a tax break to continue to find new cures, and then we say we will \ngive them a tax break for advertising and other costs of business.\n  Our Government is friendly, supportive, and encouraging of the drug \nindustry, as it should be. What do we get in return? Well, American \nconsumers get the highest drug prices in the world. That is right. Our \ntaxpayers invest more money in this industry and pay more back to it \nthan any other country in the world.\n  Take a look at this chart. It was prepared by the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform. They said, if Americans pay an average of $1 for a \npharmaceutical product, how much would that same product cost in other \ncountries around the world? In other words, the American pill that we \nhave paid the research money on and the tax credits for, that cost us \n$1, well, what does it cost in the other countries around the world?\n  In France, it is 55 cents; Italy, 52 cents; Germany, 65 cents; \nEngland, 69 cents; in Canada, 62 cents.\n  What is wrong with this picture, Americans? We are the ones \nsubsidizing this industry, and we are paying the highest prices. Our \nthanks to PhRMA for giving them all of this assistance, all of this \nencouragement, and in return being asked to pay the highest prices in \nthe world. Why? Because, frankly, we as a government have never stood \nup and said we have had it.\n  The Canadians have. I heard an allusion earlier to the socialism of \nCanada. Well, I do not consider them to be lockstep Fabian Socialists. \nThis is a country which decided a long time ago that when it came to \nthe health of Canadian citizens, they were going to do everything they \ncould to make it affordable and available, and one of the first things \nthey did was to say to the American drug companies: If you want to sell \nthe same pills that you are charging so much for in America, if you \nwant to sell them in Canada, you are going to have to face price \nrestrictions. We will not let you sell them at those inflated prices \nthat you charge your own American citizens.\n  As a result, the same drugs made by the same companies, subject to \nthe same inspection, cost a fraction in Canada of what they do in the \nUnited States.\n  When you take a look at some of these drugs, for example--and you \nwill recognize these names, incidentally, because they are all over \nyour television screen, they are in every magazine you pick up now, \nnewspapers, every single day.\n  Paxil: Feel a little anxious this morning? Take your Paxil. If you \ntake it, it is $2.62 in the United States. Go to Canada, and it costs \n$1.69. It is a beautiful ad they have on television. Americans, you are \npaying for that ad. You are paying for it about a dollar more a pill.\n  Zocor, $3.75 in the United States, $2.32 in Canada; Prevacid, $3.91 \nin the United States, $2.24 in Canada, because the Canadian Government \nsaid: We are not going to let you rip off Canadians. You can rip off \nAmericans. They will pay for it, no questions asked. Do you know why? \nBecause PhRMA, this lobby, has a death grip on Congress. Congress is \nnot going to rock the boat. It is not going to pass a law to protect \nAmerican consumers as the Canadian Parliament did, no way. That is what \nthis debate is all about.\n  The Dorgan amendment basically says we are so despondent, we have \nreached the point of despair where we are going to allow people to \nbring in drugs from Canada, the cheap drugs from Canada, because we \ncannot hold the American pharmaceutical companies to a standard of \ncharging Americans a fair price. Boy, have we really reached that \npoint, where we have to rely on the Canadians' bargaining authority to \ngive American consumers a fighting chance? It appears we do. But that \namendment passed 69 to 30. It shows you the desperation of the Senate, \nthat we will not pass a law demanding fair prices for Americans; we are \ngoing to piggyback on the Canadians who have the political courage to \ndo it.\n  Now comes the Cochran amendment. Senator Cochran of Mississippi is my \nfriend. He is an honorable man. There are two ways to look at this \namendment. Let me look first at the positive side. He has said the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services has to be able to certify that \nif these drugs come in from Canada, they are going to be safe for \nAmerican consumers. Well, I hope so. Most of them are exactly the same \ndrugs we sent to pharmacies all around our country.\n  The second thing is that if we import them from Canada, there is a \nsignificant reduction in price for the consumer.\n  I think both of those tests would be met, and if that is the case, it \nis hard to vote against Senator Cochran. I am going to support him. I \nthink it is a good standard. I sincerely hope this is not part of an \nagenda by the pharmaceutical companies that believe if they cannot win \na vote on the Senate floor and they cannot win a vote on the House \nfloor, they may be able to persuade one member of the President's \nCabinet to put an end to the reimportation of drugs from Canada.\n  Think about that for a second. This one person, man or woman, serving \nas Health and Human Services Secretary, will have the power to stop the \ndiscounted drugs from coming from Canada into the United States. It is \na considerable amount of authority.\n  We have had statements from Dr. Kessler at the FDA, and from people \ncurrently at the FDA, who say the Canadian drugs are safe, there is \ngoing to be no problem. And we know they are cheaper. This should not \nbe anything other than a formal decision saying the approach of the \nDorgan amendment--which I am proud to cosponsor--is an approach which \nis good for America.\n  Step back for a minute and look at this debate. Look at the fact that \nthis Congress and this President cannot pass a law that gives the \nAmerican consumer a fighting chance when it comes to the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  We are going to rely on the political courage of the Canadians to \nstand up to the same companies and hope we can bring in discounted \nCanadian drugs into the United States. Is this upside down or what?\n  I hope we go further than this underlying bill on generic drugs, than \nthe Dorgan amendment on Canadian reimportation, and actually put in \nplace something we can be proud of, something that says to every \nAmerican, rich or poor, they are not going to die, they are not going \nto be forced into the hospital because they have to choose between food \nand medicine. Is that a radical, socialist notion? I don't think so. It \nsounds like an American notion that we believe in this land of \ncompassion, that we can find the resources and the wherewithal to help \nour people.\n  I have seen them. I have met them. Every Senator in this Chamber has \nmet them. They are men and women who have worked hard all of their \nlives, have retired in their little homes with their savings accounts, \nand want to live in happiness, follow the sports page and tend to their \ngarden and enjoy their retirement. Then comes an illness--unexpected, \nperhaps. The doctor tells that person--your mother, grandmother, father \nor grandfather--this pill will keep you out of the hospital. They go to \nthe local drugstore and realize they cannot afford to take the medicine \nthat keeps them out of the hospital.\n  That is a fact of life in America.\n  Meanwhile the drug companies--there will not be any tag days for the \ndrug companies--are making a lot of\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nmoney. They are in business for a profit and deserve a profit. Look at \nthis chart showing the profitability of Fortune 500 companies in the \nlast 10 years: The drug industry, 18.5 percent; the median for other \nFortune 500 companies, 3.3 percent.\n  Drug companies are doing extremely well. They say: We need to make a \nlot of money because we have to put the money into research for new \ndrugs.\n  But look at this chart which shows how much they are spending on \nmarketing and how much on research. The blue line is research; the \nyellow line is marketing. Look at the disparity in companies such as \nMerck, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Abbott, Wyeth, Pharmacia, Eli \nLilly, and Schering-Plough. They make Claritin. You have seen that. \nThey have switched over to the brand new drug called Clarinex. They \nused to show on television the people skipping through a field of \nwildflowers: I am taking Claritin and will never sneeze again.\n  Schering-Plough spent more advertising Claritin than PepsiCo spent on \nPepsi-Cola.\n  Let us hold them to a standard in which we believe. The drugs are \nsafe and will save the American consumer money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Illinois, half the money in \nadvertising for drug companies is for free samples, samples to \nphysicians that end up going to patients for free medication. Just \nunderstand half of that money, roughly half, is for free samples given \nout to hospitals and doctors. That is a way many people who do not have \nprescription coverage end up getting some medication.\n  I find it remarkable the Senator says that PhRMA has the Congress in \na death grip, and then says somehow the bill that passed last year over \nPhRMA's objection will pass this year both in the House and the Senate. \nHe says PhRMA has us in a death grip, but at the same time they are \npassing legislation willy-nilly. I find that inconsistent.\n  I also find it inconsistent when the Senator says somehow or another \nwe are relying on the courage of the Canadians--that is an often used \nterm--to stand up to the drug companies. What courage is he talking \nabout? He is talking about price controls. He was very forthright in \nsaying we do not have the courage in the Congress to do price controls, \nso this is the next best thing. We all know how successful price \ncontrols are in America. They are an abject failure. We tried that in \nthe 1970s. We have not tried it since because of the horrible disasters \nthat occurred in our economy because of it.\n  What we are doing here is trying to impose price controls. On whom? \nWe are trying to impose price controls on an industry that invests more \non saving lives and preserving the quality and quantity of people's \nlives than any other industry in America. How are we doing that? We are \ndoing it by reimporting drugs. And the safety issue is clear.\n  I encourage everyone to vote for the Cochran amendment. That is not \ngoing to be enough. Under this measure, the Dorgan proposal, drugs from \nall over the world--from terrorist countries--can come through Canada \ninto this country without anybody inspecting them in Canada, no one. \nThe law in Canada says they do not have to inspect it. As long as it is \nnot to be used in Canada, all they have to do is mark it Canadian and \nship it to the United States, and God knows what will be in the drugs. \nIt could be terrorists, but it could be just phony drugs. We have no \nability to check.\n\n  This is a huge safety issue. While the Cochran amendment gets at it, \nit is very important we need to do other things on this legislation to \nensure that we are not opening up another avenue for terrorism, another \navenue for people to die. The Dorgan amendment says we are not going to \ndo anything to stop the reimportation of drugs until we have a pattern \nof people dying. So if one person dies, we will keep going until we see \nthree, four, or five? This is remarkable. For what? So we can get lower \nprices on pharmaceuticals.\n  Understand what that means. The Senator from Illinois held up a \npicture of all the countries that have low prices for drugs. Every one \nof them have price controls, every one of them. They have price \ncontrols. They say to the company: Sell at the price we want you to \nsell it at or you cannot sell it.\n  In Canada, yes, you pay a lower price. If the company does not take \nthe lower price, No. 1, they cannot sell their drug in Canada. No. 2, \nif they do not take the lower price, Canada can go ahead and license \nsomeone in Canada to make it and infringe on their patent.\n  What choice does the drugmaker have? None. He is absolutely correct. \nWe in America subsidize that. He is absolutely right on that. There is \nno bone of contention. The question is, If we don't, what are the \nconsequences? The consequences are very clear. There will be a dramatic \nreduction in the amount of research that is done. There will be less \nnew drugs coming to market. There will be less cures. There will be \nless improvement of the quality of people's lives. That is a tradeoff.\n  But to sit up here and say this is somehow the big bad drug companies \nagainst poor patients who cannot get their drugs because of the expense \nof the drugs here, we have to go to Canada to get them, is a false \nchoice. The choice is, giving that drug at a lower price, yes; putting \nprice controls in it. If that is what the Senator from Illinois wants, \nhe ought to offer an amendment. The choice is less research and less \ncures in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in just a few moments we will take a \nvote on the Cochran amendment. I intend to support the Cochran \namendment.\n  I thought it might be useful to sum up where we are on the issue of \ntrying to get a handle on the costs of drugs in the United States and \nalso on the availability and the accessibility of drugs for our \npopulation.\n  There has been prescription drug legislation before the Senate for 5 \nyears. Four years of this 5 years we were under the Republican control \nof the Senate, both in terms of the Finance Committee and the floor of \nthe Senate. During that period of time, the Republican leadership found \nall kinds of ways to circumvent various committees to prioritize issues \nthey wanted to do, but they never did it with regard to the \navailability of prescription drugs.\n  And now our Republican friends have been complaining all afternoon. \nWe just heard another complaint.\n  This debate is about is how we are going to reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs, and hopefully on how we will increase the \navailability and the accessibility of prescription drugs.\n  The underlying amendment is the Dorgan amendment. It will mean many \nbillions in terms of savings for consumers.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Cochran \namendment to allow reimportation of drugs from Canada with important \nsafety protections, and in opposition to the Dorgan amendment, which \nwould allow such reimportation without these important precautions.\n  As so many of my constituents, I am very concerned about increasing \ndrug costs. Spiraling costs have a real impact on not just seniors but \nall Americans and health care costs generally.\n  That is why we need to find ways to contain costs. And Congress needs \nto enact a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will ensure that all \nseniors have access to the medicines they need.\n  Reimportation would allow American consumers to benefit from lower \npriced drugs available in Canada. It would provide much needed relief \nfor seniors, and it would also provide assistance for the 39 million \nAmericans who have no health care coverage at all.\n  Reimportation is not without risks, however. I feel strongly that \nopening our borders without ensuring that adequate protections are in \nplace puts in danger our national security and the health and safety of \nour citizens. That is why I supported the Cochran amendment, which \nwould enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fully assess \nand determine the safety of drug reimportation before allowing it to go \ninto effect.\n  I opposed the Dorgan amendment because it lacked these safety \nprecautions and could result in Canada becoming the portal for \ndangerous counterfeit drugs. In fact, this concern is only heightened \nnow that we face bioterrorist threats, which we witnessed firsthand in \nNew Jersey, where we found ourselves on the front lines of the anthrax \nattack.\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\n  The bottom line is that without a prescription drug benefit seniors \nwill continue to struggle to afford all of their drugs--be they brand \nname, generics, or reimported drugs. Before us now, we have the \nopportunity to pass a prescription drug benefit that ensures the safety \nof our pharmaceuticals and provides access to affordable medicines for \nour seniors\n  For those who are watching this debate, let me share some figures. I \nwant to tell the cancer patients who are watching this debate that, as \na result of the pharmaceutical companies abusing the Hatch-Waxman Act \nand what is called the evergreening of payments, we have seen a 19 \nmonth delay of the generic drug Taxol at a cost to consumers of $1.2 \nbillion. Families watching and those affected with breast cancer should \nknow they paid $1.2 billion, because the pharmaceutical companies \nabused the Hatch-Waxman bill.\n  For those families affected with epilepsy, the 30 month delay of \nNeurontin has cost them $1.4 billion. For patients with depression, six \nevergreened patents have delayed the generic drug Wellbutrin for 31 \nmonths, at a cost to consumers of $1.3 billion. For the many seniors \nwith high blood pressure, collusive agreements have delayed generics \nfor months, costing them hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  For Americans who are watching now, let me say that we are going to \ndo something about it. That is, the underlying bill will do something \nabout it. And we are committed to doing something about it, in spite of \nall the opposition we have heard this afternoon from those on the other \nside.\n  We have the Dorgan amendment, which will make a difference for all \nthe reasons that have been outlined by Senator Dorgan, Senator Durbin, \nand others. It will help to put pressure on the drug companies.\n  Now we are anticipating that, after this vote we will consider the \nStabenow amendment. The Stabenow amendment will permit States to \nbargain with drug companies in order to make available to low-income, \nuninsured seniors and needy people, necessary drugs at the lowest \npossible prices.\n  With all these measures we are trying to give some assurance to the \nAmerican people that we will make every possible effort to see a \ndamping down on the high costs of prescription drugs.\n  There are other amendments which we will have an opportunity to \ndebate through tomorrow and into Friday. Hopefully, next week we will \nhave the opportunity to ensure the American people that they are going \nto have access to prescription drugs that will be dependable and \naffordable.\n  I was here in the Senate when we passed the Medicare bill in 1965. I \nwas here in 1964 when it failed by 16, 18 votes, and about 8 months \nlater it passed with 4 or 5 votes to spare. There was a switch of 22 \nvotes in the Senate.\n  In 1965, the Senate went on record. What we did was to give an \nassurance to the American people that, if they played by the rules and \npaid their share, that when they turned 65 they would have health \nsecurity. We have provided that in terms of hospitalization and \nphysician care.\n  Prescription drugs are just as important as hospitalization and \nphysician care. Can anyone believe that if we had left out physician \ncare or hospitalization and instead included prescription drugs in \n1965, that we would not be debating including hospitalization or \nphysician care tonight in the Medicare system? Of course we would.\n  When we achieve it, people will say: Why did it take so long? What \nwas the big deal about it? It is absolutely essential to our senior \ncitizens.\n  Finally, I think this is also a moral issue. When we find that we \nhave prescription drugs that can be life sustaining for our fellow \ncitizens--the elderly and the sick, the men and women who fought in \nWorld War II and lifted this country out of a depression and sacrificed \nfor their children--and they can't afford them, that we must act. We \nhave the ability to help improve their quality of life and to reduce \ntheir suffering, and we are talking about sending bills to \nsubcommittees and committees? And it is out of order?\n  It is about time we address this issue. That is what the American \npeople want us to do. That is what they are challenging us to do.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, pursuant \nto the unanimous consent agreement previously entered into, and after \nhaving consulted with the Republican leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Calendar No. 486, H.R. 5011, the military construction bill, be \ncalled before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5011) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senators start discussing this \nbill, Senator McCain has asked for 5 minutes in the morning rather than \nhaving his 20 minutes now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nH.R. 5011 on Thursday, there be 15 minutes of debate time with the time \ndivided as follows: 5 minutes each for Senators Feinstein, Hutchison, \nand McCain; that upon the use of that time, without further intervening \naction or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, \nwith all other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken and the text of S. 2709 is inserted in lieu \nthereof.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my ranking \nmember, Senator Hutchison of Texas, to bring the Fiscal Year 2003 \nMilitary Construction Appropriations bill to the Senate for \nconsideration. This is a balanced, bipartisan bill intended to meet \nsome of the most pressing infrastructure requirements of our military \nforces.\n  This bill provides $10.6 billion in new budget authority. It \nrepresents an increase of less than one tenth of one percent over last \nyear's $10.5 billion military construction bill. But it is nearly 10 \npercent more than the President's 2003 budget request.\n  The 2003 budget request submitted by the President severely \nunderfunded the Guard and Reserves. The request was 52 percent below \nlast year's request. Congress is left to make up the shortfall. As all \nMembers know, the Defense Emergency Response Fund funded all projects \nidentified by the President as necessary for the war on terror. While \nit may be tempting to blame the decrease in military construction \nfunding on the costs of fighting a war on terror, the fact is that the \nwar on terror is fully funded through the Defense Emergency Response \nFund.\n  This bill was coordinated carefully with the Armed Services \nCommittee, and each project in this bill is included in the National \nDefense Authorization Act passed by the Senate. All of the projects in \nthis bill meet the stringent standards for military construction \nfunding set by the Senate. Every project we funded is in the Services' \nFuture Years Defense Plans, and every project is a top priority of the \ninstallation commanders.\n  Mr. President, the bill was unanimously reported out of the \nAppropriations Committee on June 27. The package before the Senate \ntoday includes technical and conforming changes in the bill and report, \nas authorized by the full Committee. These changes include \nclarification of report language as needed and, in one instance, a \ncorrection in the tables to delete an unauthorized project that was \ninadvertently included in the committee print.\n  The bill provides $5.6 billion--53 percent of the total--for military \nconstruction for active and reserve components. Included in this \nfunding is $1.1 billion for barracks; $26 million for child development \ncenters; $137 million for hospital and medical facilities; $159 million \nfor the Chemical Demilitarization Program; and $610 million for the \nGuard and Reserve components.\n  An additional $4.23 billion, or 40 percent of the total bill, goes to \nfamily housing. This includes $1.33 billion for new family housing \nunits and improvements to existing units; and $2.9 billion for \noperation and maintenance of existing units.\n  This bill also includes two new military construction initiatives. \nThe first is the Army and Air Force Transformation Initiative, which \nsets aside funding for the Army and the Air Force to be used for \ninfrastructure requirements.\n  For the Army, the funding is allocated for construction related to \nthe Interim Brigade Combat Teams. The Interim Brigades, which were just \nrecently renamed Stryker Brigades, are essential to the Army's effort \nto become a lighter, more mobile, more effective fighting force. Army \nofficials testified before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nearlier this year that current levels of military construction funding \nare not adequate to meet the Army's time line for these brigades.\n  Likewise, the Air Force is in need of additional funding to move \nforward quickly with the beddown of aircraft associated with its Air \nMobility Modernization Program. The Air Force is facing a serious \nshortfall in airlift capability. The Air Mobility Modernization \nProgram, which encompasses the acquisition and upgrading of C-17s, C-\n5s, and C-130s, is urgently needed.\n\n  Simply put, the timetables for Army and Air Force transformation that \nwere in place prior to September 11 are no longer adequate. The war on \nterror has placed pressing new demands, not only on personnel and \nequipment, but also on infrastructure. The large increase in defense \nfunding that has occurred since September 11 reflects those demands. \nUnder the transformation initiative, the committee has made $100 \nmillion available each for the Army and Air Force to be used for \ninfrastructure requirements of the Stryker Brigades and C-17 Air \nMobility programs, as determined by the Services.\n  The second major initiative in this bill is the BRAC Environmental \nCleanup Acceleration Initiative. This initiative provides an extra $100 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2003 budget request to accelerate the \ncleanup of dangerous contaminants at military bases that have been \nclosed or realigned as part of the BRAC process. Until the \nenvironmental cleanup process is completed, these closed bases are the \nequivalent of giant white elephants. The services no longer need them, \nbut the communities cannot complete the conversion of them to \nproductive use. In some cases, the lengthy cleanup process presents a \nproblem far worse than just an economic drain on the Services and the \ncommunities--in some cases, the contaminants polluting the soil of \nclosed military bases present a serious hazard to human health and the \nenvironment.\n  In my home state of California, for example, plutonium contamination \nat McClellan Air Force Base continues to present a hazard to the \ncommunity and to impede progress towards profitable reuse of the \nproperty. In Texas, toxic groundwater that has migrated to nearby \nneighborhoods from the former Kelly Air Force Base has raised fears \namong residents that the pollution could be causing health problems. \nThese are only two of many examples. The fact is, we have a \nresponsibility to the American people to clean up the buried ordnance \nand hazardous wastes that contaminate many of our closed or realigned \nmilitary installations. And I believe that we have a responsibility to \nact expeditiously. Although the President requested only $545 million \nfor BRAC environmental cleanup, the Services, at the request of the \nCommittee, identified another $237 million in environmental cleanup \nrequirements that could be executed in 2003 if funding were made \navailable. We could not provide the full $237 million needed, but the \nextra $100 million we recommended will help to speed the cleanup \nprocess. Simple common sense indicates that the military should finish \nthe cleanup from the first four rounds of BRAC before diverting scarce \nresources and creating additional cleanup costs in another round of \nbase closures.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n  I want to point out that all the projects added to military \nconstruction authorization and appropriations bills that are not part \nof the President's budget request are carefully screened and vetted by \nthe Services. They are the priorities of the men and women who live and \nwork on military installations throughout the country, and sometimes \nthose priorities differ from the priorities of the Pentagon. \nInstallation commanders are uniquely attuned to the needs of their \nbases, whereas the budget officers at the Pentagon and the Office of \nManagement and Budget are focused on the corporate needs of the Defense \nDepartment as a whole. In some cases, a child care center or a barracks \nmay be essential to the well-being of a base, but may not score high \nenough at the Pentagon to make it into the President's budget. In other \ncases, a worthy project may be programmed for funding down the road \nwhen it is urgently needed now.\n  Mr. President, this bill meets many military construction needs--all \nof the projects are authorized, are in the military's Future Year's \nDefense Plan, and are the base commander's priority. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. I would like to thank my ranking member for \nher support in developing this bill. It is a privilege and a pleasure \nto work with Senator Hutchison. I also thank Chairman Byrd, Senator \nStevens, and Senator Inouye for their guidance and support in \ndeveloping this package. And I thank the staff of the subcommittee for \ntheir dedication and hard work in putting this package together.\n  I thank my ranking member for her support in developing this bill. I \nalso thank Chairman Byrd, Senator Stevens, and Senator Inouye for their \nguidance and support in developing this package.\n  I also thank the staff, specifically Christina Evans, B.G. Wright, \nand Matt Miller on the Democratic side, and Sid Ashworth, Alycia \nFarrell, and Michael Ralsky on the Republican side.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the ranking member, \nSenator Hutchison from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California, the chairman of \nthe committee. We certainly have worked together on this bill, and \nSenator Feinstein outlined some of the problems we faced in trying to \nmake up for some of the shortfalls in the budget that we had before, \nparticularly in the environmental cleanup and Guard and Reserve \naccounts.\n  We have been able to address the major issues for the Department of \nDefense and also try to stay on the course that we set to improve the \nquality of life for our military personnel.\n  In 2001, when President Bush took the oath of office, he made a \npromise to America that we would see a transformation of our military. \nHe wanted to take a 25-year look at what our military needs would be, \nand he appointed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who has the most \nexperience of any Secretary of Defense, having been Secretary of \nDefense before, to do that very job.\n  After 9/11, of course, our priorities immediately changed because we \nthen became immediately involved in a crisis, a war on terrorism. Now \nwe are prosecuting a war on terrorism at the same time that we still \nare trying to look to the future needs of our national defense.\n  Our bill for military construction attempts to address the top \npriorities of the Department of Defense. It is a balanced bill and is \nquite bipartisan.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that we are going to put a large \npart of this bill, $1.17 billion, in barracks and dormitories for our \nmilitary quality of life; $4.23 billion for family housing. We are \nasking so much of our military today. Our military personnel on active \nduty know that they may well be deployed overseas and perhaps on \ndangerous missions. So we want them to have a quality of life for \nthemselves and for their families that will allow them to serve, \nknowing that their families will be taken care of in good housing and \nwith good health care. Our part is housing, and we are fully funding \nthe new barracks, dormitories, and family housing.\n  In recent years, we have made real progress in improving housing for \nsingle servicemembers and for families. We are also trying to improve \nworkplaces. We have funding in this bill for the upgrading of the work \nfacilities, the battalion headquarters, and the units where they are \nworking. It is my hope that in future budgets we will see sufficient \nresources to continue this effort to modernize, renovate, and improve \nour aging defense facilities and infrastructure.\n  The effects of sustained inattention by the Department and the \nmilitary services to basic infrastructure are certainly apparent on \nnearly every military installation in our country. This will continue \nto have long-term implications as facilities continue to age \ndisproportionately without sustained investment in maintenance and \nrepair.\n  This bill also provides $599 million for the Reserve components, \nwhich is a substantial increase over the President's budget request \nprimarily because of the increased use of the Guard and Reserve since \nSeptember 11. These are important increases that signal a renewed \ncommitment to upgrading and rebuilding the infrastructure that is truly \nthe backbone of our Nation's military, which has so long been \nneglected.\n  Guard and Reserve members have stepped up to the plate for our \ncountry, even before 9/11, but more so after. These are men and women \nwith full-time civilian jobs. They answer the call when our country \nasks, and their employers sacrifice, too. We are asking a lot, and they \nalways come through. That is why we are trying to upgrade the \nfacilities and the equipment they need to do their jobs well.\n\n  The bill also addresses several key Department of Defense \ninitiatives. First are the Army and Air Force transformation \ninitiatives. We have provided $100 million for critical infrastructure \nneeded to support the Army's interim brigade combat teams and $100 \nmillion for the Air Force's aircraft mobility programs.\n  Senator Feinstein discussed those programs earlier. These programs \nare essential to ensuring that the Army and Air Force have the \ninfrastructure in place to move forward with the transformation efforts \nover the next several years. Without this assistance, they would not be \nable to meet their established milestones.\n  The committee report also includes a $100 million increase over the \nPresident's budget request for environmental cleanup at military \ninstallations that have been closed as a part of the base realignment \nand closure effort. This additional funding is necessary to enable the \nmilitary to accelerate the cleanup of dangerous contaminants at closed \nand realigned bases throughout the Nation.\n  Senator Feinstein mentioned my home State of Texas where Kelly Air \nForce Base is one of those that were closed and where there are very \nsignificant reported health problems that many believe--and there is \nevidence to support--are caused by environmental contaminants at that \nclosed base. Certainly California is experiencing similar problems. We \nare going to try to do what we said we would do for the people in the \ncommunities where we have closed bases.\n  I support this bill. It is exactly what we need to address the \ninfrastructure problems that will support our military and Department \nof Defense budget.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Feinstein, for her \nleadership in crafting this bill. She and her staff--Christina Evans \nand B.G. Wright--have done an excellent job in putting together a \nbipartisan bill.\n  I also thank my staff--Sid Ashworth, Alycia Farrell and Michael \nRalsky--for their invaluable work on our Committee on Appropriations \nevery year. Michael Ralsky has done a wonderful job for me and will \nsoon be going over to the Pentagon where we know he will contribute his \nexpertise, gained from working in the Senate for so many years.\n  Their support has been really terrific, and we appreciate that. I \nappreciate that Senator Feinstein also thanked Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens for their work. They do the Department of Defense \nbudgets, and we certainly dovetail with them in our military \nconstruction budgets. I cannot think of any two people who are more \ncommitted to our strong military than Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye,\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\ntwo veterans who have served our country in the military and who would \nnever, ever walk away from our responsibility to take care of our \nmilitary personnel. They have been so supportive of this military \nconstruction effort that Senator Feinstein and I have put together.\n  I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it when we vote \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Again, I thank my ranking member. It was great to \nwork with her, and I think she knows that. I think we have a very good \nbill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4306\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from California [Mrs. FEINSTEIN], for herself, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nCarper, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Thompson \nproposes an amendment numbered 4306.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.    Of the amount appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``Military Construction, Army'', $8,000,000 may be \n     provided for a parking garage at Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Center, District of Columbia.\n       Sec.    Of the amount appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``Military Construction, Army'', $3,000,000 may be \n     provided for a Anechoic Chamber at White Sands Missile Range, \n     New Mexico.\n       Sec.    Of the amount appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``Military Construction, Air Force'', $7,500,000 may \n     be provided for a control tower at Dover Air Force Base, \n     Delaware.\n       Sec.    Of the amount appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``Military Construction, Army National Guard'', \n     $9,000,000 may be provided for a Joint Readiness Center at \n     Eugene, Oregon.\n       Sec.    Of the amount appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``Military Construction, Air National Guard'', \n     $8,400,000 may be provided for a Composite Maintenance \n     Complex, Phase II in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Hutchison and I authored this \namendment on behalf of Senators Thurmond, Domenici, Bingaman, Biden, \nCarper, Wyden, Gordon Smith, Frist, and Thompson. The amendment would \ninclude in the military construction bill five projects that were \nauthorized by the Senate during consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. These projects include a parking garage at Walter \nReed Medical Center in the District of Columbia; an Anechoic testing \nchamber at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico; a control tower at \nDover Air Force base in Delaware; a Joint Readiness Center at Eugene, \nOR; and a composite maintenance complex in Nashville, TN.\n  All of these projects have been authorized. They meet all the \nrequirements of the military construction program, and I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4306.\n  The amendment (No. 4306) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nSenator Feinstein for her stewardship of the Military Construction \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. Her work on this bill will \nprovide billions of dollars in funding to support our Nation's defense \nefforts, and I support those efforts wholeheartedly.\n  My colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, and I would like to take \na moment to engage our colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague for his kind words and would be \nhappy to engage in a colloquy with the Senators from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Last month, Senator Clinton and I had the special honor \nof joining in the welcome-home celebration of the men and women of the \n10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. From fighting in Afghanistan to \npeacekeeping in Kosovo, our troops help make the world safe for people \nwho cherish freedom. These soldiers were prepared for whatever \nobstacles came their way in Afghanistan precisely because of the \ntraining they received at Fort Drum. As we look to transform our \nnation's military to fit the needs of 21st century warfare, Fort Drum-\ntrained soldiers are exactly the kind of troops we need.\n  Mr. CLINTON. In April, I had the privilege of visiting the Walter \nReed Army Medical Center, where other soldiers from the 10th Mountain \nDivision were recuperating from wounds suffered in battle in \nAfghanistan. I know that all American feel the same pride for these \ndistinguished service men and women as Senator Schumer and myself. It \nis no coincidence that when the initial troops were called into \nAfghanistan, soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division were among the \nfirst ones in. As one of the most frequently deployed missions in the \nU.S. Army, these flexible, mobile forces are a powerful weapon.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is my under standing that contained in \nthe House version of the Military Construction Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2003 is an additional $18.3 million in military \nconstruction funding that will support the construction of two projects \nvital to the continued functioning of Fort Drum, located in upstate New \nYork.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The first of the two projects is a parallel taxiway at \nWheeler-Sack Army Airfield, WSAAF at Fort Drum. This project will \nconstruct a new concrete taxiway parallel to the main runway to support \noperations at the airfield. The taxiway is required to enhance the \ncapability, safety, and efficiency in the deployment of troops and \nequipment for the 10th Mountain Division, LI, and other fully \nfunctional units ready for combat from the installation. Fort Drum has \nexperienced an increase in the number of air training missions and \ndeployment operations in support of training, contingency, and NATO \nsupport missions. This construction project is necessary to keep the \nfort operating.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The second project is the one- plus-one DIVARTY barracks \nexpansion. This project consists of construction of a two-story \nbarracks building with a 100-room unaccompanied enlisted personnel \nhousing facility to include a built-in soldier community building. The \nproject will upgrade the current barracks to meet the new Department of \nDefense enlisted personnel housing standards. The project is required \nto support the DIVARTY housing facilities for personnel in grades E1 \nthrough E6 to meet the one-plus standard. My colleague and I feel that \nthis project is vital to New York as well as a number of States in the \nNortheast.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Now more than ever, we must remain resolute in our \ndefense of America's values, interests and security. Our safety at \nhome, as well as abroad rests on the strength of our military response, \nand Fort Drum is an absolutely essential component. Senator Schumer and \nI plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that Fort Drum and the 10th \nMountain Division continue to play a large role in defending our \nNation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We are aware that there are many priorities that the \nSenate is considering, but would just like to bring to our \ndistinguished colleague's attention that these projects would not be \nincluded in the Senate Bill because they were not authorized in \naccordance with Senate authorization criteria. This same criteria is \nnot applicable in the House. We trust that the chairman looks favorably \nupon these construction projects and is willing to take the steps \nnecessary to support the House's appropriation allocation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the remarks of the Senators of New York \nand assure them that we will do our best to retain these projects in \nconference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 2709, the Military Construction \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  The Senate bill provides $10.622 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority,\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nall classified as defense spending, which will result in new outlays in \n2003 of $2.771 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority \nare taken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total \n$10.12 billion in 2003.\n  Despite the bipartisan support of 59 Senators, the Senate was blocked \non procedural grounds last month from approving a 302(a) allocation for \nthe Appropriations Committee. Consequently, the Appropriations \nCommittee voted 20-0 on June 27 to adopt a set of non-binding sub-\nallocations for its 13 subcommittees totaling $768.1 billion in budget \nauthority and $793.1 billion in outlays. While the committee's \nsubcommittee's allocations are consistent with both the amendment \nsupported by 59 Senators last month and with the President's request \nfor total discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2003, they are \nnot enforceable under either Senate budget rules or the Balanced Budget \nand Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n  For the Military Construction subcommittee, the full committee \nallocated $10.622 billion in budget authority and $10.122 billion in \ntotal outlays for 2003. The bill reported by the full committee on June \n27 is fully consistent with that allocation. In addition, S. 2709 does \nnot include any emergency designations or advance appropriations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         S. 2709, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Defense   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.....................    10,622   .........    10,622\n  Outlays..............................    10,120   .........    10,120\nSenate committee allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.....................    10,622   .........    10,622\n  Outlays..............................    10,122   .........    10,122\nHouse-passed: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority.....................    10,083   .........    10,083\n  Outlays..............................    10,052   .........    10,052\nPresident's request: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority.....................     9,663   .........     9,663\n  Outlays..............................     9,996   .........     9,996\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate committee allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.....................  .........  .........  .........\n  Outlays..............................

I rise today to discuss an issue that I have been \nknown to have some thoughts about from time to time, and that is our \nNation's fiscal situation and this body's approach to its budget \nresponsibilities, something the President and I have talked about on \nmany occasions.\n  The country's finances are in dire condition. We face a sea of red \nink as far as the eye can see, and perhaps the worst thing about it is \nthat few people in this body appear to recognize or acknowledge how bad \nthat predicament is. The Federal Government is running a deficit and \nwill for the foreseeable future, when just last year we had an on-\nbudget surplus. Despite this, Congress continues to spend money like \ndrunken sailors, refusing to prioritize and make the tough choices \nnecessary to stop the bleeding and get us back on track.\n  In the rush to spend, we are not asking the basic question: Is this \nthe best use of our limited funds at this point in time?\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues how critical our budget \nsituation has become. Over the past year, the budget outlook has \nworsened dramatically. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office \npredicted a unified budget surplus of $313 billion. That is for fiscal \nyear 2002. That means the Social Security surplus and the on-budget \nsurplus together equals $313 billion. We all thought everything was \ngoing great, and I was extremely pleased because Congress believed that \nwe might be able to once again use the entire Social Security surplus \nto reduce the national debt, after all, we did it in 1999 and 2000. As \na matter of fact, during that period of time we reduced the national \ndebt $365 billion, the first time that had happened in almost 30 years. \nUnfortunately, it is not turning out that way. Instead of reducing the \ndebt, we are going to add to it. Seven months ago CBO released budget \nprojections that showed the Federal Government is in much worse fiscal \ncondition than we all thought. These new projections show that the \nFederal Government will spend the entire Social Security surplus in \nboth the current fiscal year and in fiscal year 2003.\n  Today, our fiscal condition continues to deteriorate. Figures from \nthe Senate Budget Committee show that we will likely suffer a budget \ndeficit of $152 billion this year. That means that this year we will \nborrow and spend the entire $157 billion Social Security surplus and on \ntop of that we are going to have to borrow another $152 billion through \nthe issuance of new debt. Put another way, the Federal Government will \nborrow a total of $310 billion this year. This is new debt on top of \nthe staggering $6 trillion national debt we already owe.\n  It is no wonder that our constituents have such a hard time grasping \nthe magnitude of the national debt when it is counted in unfathomable \nterms like trillions of dollars.\n  Unfortunately, next year it gets even worse. For fiscal year 2003, \nwhich begins October 1, if we maintain our current course of spending \nwe will borrow and spend the entire $176 billion Social Security \nsurplus and issue $194 billion in debt on top of that. Already, next \nyear's budget deficit totals $370 billion, and that is before any \nsupplemental spending, which we all know is inevitable.\n  If anyone believes these discouraging numbers can be turned around by \na growing economy, I think they ought to understand that these \nprojections for 2003 are based on a healthy inflation-adjusted economic \ngrowth rate of 3.4 percent.\n  I would like to draw everyone's eyes to this chart that I am talking \nabout for fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003. This year, fiscal year \n2002, we were projected to have a $313 billion surplus, but instead we \nare going to take the Social Security surplus that the President and I \ntalked about using to pay down debt and spend that to operate the \ngovernment. Then on top of that we are going to borrow another $152 \nbillion. So we are going to borrow nearly $310 billion.\n  Next year, the Social Security surplus will be $175 billion. Instead \nof using that money to pay down debt, we are going to spend it to run \nthe Government, and then we are going to add another almost $200 \nbillion of additional debt.\n  When people come to see me in my office and want something from the \nFederal Government, I ask the question of them: Is it so worthwhile \nthat we should borrow the money? Does it justify spending the Social \nSecurity surplus or causing the Treasury to issue new debt?\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\n  We are filling the gap today in the only way we know; that is, we are \nputting the Treasury back in the business of auctioning new debt to \nraise the billions of dollars needed to pay for the Government's \noperations this year.\n  What I find very telling about the Treasury auctions is the duration \nof some of the new bonds. They mature in roughly 10 years. What that \ntells me is the U.S. Treasury recognizes the Federal Government will \nneed to borrow money for a long time. This speaks volumes about our \nlong-term budget predicament. We better take notice.\n  What we really need is a fiscal reality check. We are sinking deeper \nand deeper into deficits. But most disturbing of all, I don't hear any \noutcry. No one seems to be paying any attention. What I do hear are \nconstant calls for more Government programs and for more Government \nspending.\n  The fact that our Nation faces several serious challenges right now, \nincluding a serious national security challenge, does not exempt us \nfrom the basic rules of fiscal policy. In fact, I believe the national \nsecurity crisis we now face demands of us an even more vigilant look at \nwhat we are doing with our spending to make sure the needed funds go to \nthe most pressing priorities.\n  Spending without check, wrapping every pork project in the flag and \ncalling it a national security priority, saying yes to every major \ninterest group, and playing politics with the public's purse are all \nirresponsible behaviors that will sentence us to another long term of \ndeficit spending and increased national debt.\n  We recently passed a farm bill that even leading farm legislators \ndecried as too expensive. Besides returning to the failed farm policies \nof the past, this legislation increased agricultural spending by $80 \nbillion over the next 10 years. We have also just finished a Defense \nauthorization bill that contains huge increases. The Senate-passed bill \nauthorizes $393.4 billion in spending. That is an increase of $42 \nbillion or about 12.2 percent over last year. We cannot have it all.\n  The White House is calling for a $45 billion increase in defense \nspending and a big increase in spending on homeland security. These are \nserious needs and deserve our attention. They require making some \ntradeoffs to meet them. We do need to increase defense spending, but \nlet's examine whether $45 billion is the right number. I was heartened \nto learn that the House of Representatives acted to move about $2.3 \nbillion in funding from defense allocations to other programs. The \nSenate should do the same, and then some, instead of forever increasing \nfunding by adding additional spending to the total. We need to make \nsome tough decisions to make tradeoffs and shift funding within given \nbudget totals.\n  At the same time, the record growth of domestic spending over the \npast several years has been nothing short of meteoric. Given the huge \nincreases many agencies and programs have had, do we really need to \ncontinue feeding them at these huge levels? If anything, I think \nagencies need a breather to spend the money Congress has been shoveling \ntheir way over the past several years. Anyone looking for the location \nof the recently departed surplus, need look no further than the huge \nincreases in discretionary spending for fiscal years 1998 to 2002.\n  This is the chart that shows it: Agriculture, the average growth was \n5.2 percent; total growth was 21 percent from 1998 to 2002; Commerce, \n51 percent; Defense, 24 percent; Education, 60 percent; Energy, 23 \npercent; Health and Human Services, 50 percent; HUD, 44 percent.\n\n  These are unbelievable increases in spending. That is a lot of money \nin the pipeline. The fact is, at this stage of the game, we need to \nlook at the spending we have already done during the last several years \nand scrutinize our domestic priorities to make sure our most pressing \nneeds receive our limited budget dollars. This means making tough \nchoices, telling some people no, and having the guts to stand up to \ngroups that are considered untouchables and say we cannot afford them \nright now.\n  I am talking about lots of other requests we will be getting. For \nexample, we are talking about Medicare and what we are going to do \nabout that. What we have to understand is we just cannot rack up huge \nbills today that will come due tomorrow because tomorrow's bills will \nbe even bigger than today's. I am talking about Social Security and \nMedicare. These two critical programs are headed toward serious \nfinancial trouble and will require huge infusions of cash to keep them \ngoing. On top of that, there is widespread agreement, myself included, \nthat we need to provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors. And it \nis not going to be cheap. This is the issue now before the Senate.\n  We face a situation in a couple of decades in which spending on \nSocial Security, Medicare, and other entitlements will equal what we \nspend today on the entire Federal Government. In a few short years, the \npercentage of overall spending that is left for defense and other \ndomestic needs will be very little. To their credit, David Walker, the \nComptroller General, and CBO Director, Dan Crippen, have made this \npoint over and over again, before committee after committee, but no one \nseems to be listening.\n  Make no mistake, we will meet these obligations. The trillions of \ndollars in special issue Treasury bonds held by the Social Security \ntrustees are going to be redeemed and made good by the Treasury. Some \nbeltway pundits might dispute the reality of the Social Security trust \nfund, but they are dead wrong. The liabilities in the trust fund are \nreal. The day will come, in 2015 or 2016, when the money coming into \nSocial Security will not be enough to cover all the payments, and we \nwill have to reach into that Social Security trust fund and begin \nredeeming those IOUs. To pay those IOUs we either have to borrow more \nmoney or raise taxes.\n  The fact is the day of reckoning is rapidly approaching. We need to \nstart being concerned about it. Remember the money that was supposed to \nbe kept in the lockbox to pay down the debt? I remember the lockbox. I \nwas going to bring my lockbox from my office to demonstrate my point. \nWe will not see the money in that lockbox paying down debt for probably \na decade. We won't see an on-budget surplus for at least 10 years at \nthe rate we are going.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to recognize that the surpluses \nwe refer to are on a unified basis. The public is being told we might \ngo back to that unified budget. But I hope they understand that the \nunified budget includes the Social Security surplus. When we talk about \na surplus, the surplus we are talking about includes the Social \nSecurity surplus. In my book that is not a true surplus because it \nrequires raiding the Social Security surplus. The people that know, \nunderstand we will be using that Social Security surplus for a long \ntime; not to pay down debt but to pay for the regular operation of the \nFederal Government.\n  When the day arrives in 2015 or 2016 and that Social Security surplus \ndisappears, we will have to find additional money to pay for Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Our budget process is broken and needs to be fixed. This year, the \nSenate is increasingly resigned to the fact that we will not adopt a \nbudget resolution. I say, shame on the majority. This is the first time \nsince 1974 that the Senate has not passed a budget resolution. What it \ntells us about the State of the budget process is this: It is a \ncritical document that we need to manage our money, and we did not even \nwrite one. In its current form, the budget process is weak and \nmeaningless and does nothing to control the endless congressional urge \nto splurge.\n  When the Budget Enforcement Act expires in September, Katy bar the \ndoor on the floor of the Senate when the spending rampage begins.\n  I fully support my colleagues efforts to extend the discretionary \nspending caps and extend the pay-go rules. These are important steps in \nreestablishing fiscal discipline. The problem is, these safeguards are \nnot enough. These good rules have been circumvented repeatedly in the \npast, so we know that rules to enforce fiscal discipline can be ignored \nunless there is a broad-based sense of urgency that we must address our \nbudgetary crisis. Until we change our thinking and recognize we must \nlive within our means, we will continue to face a mounting deficit \ndespite the rules.\n\n  In the absence of an enforceable budget document this year, one key\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nstep for enforcing budgetary discipline in Congress would be to adhere \nto the aggregate discretionary spending total of $759 billion proposed \nin the President's budget and in the budget resolution that passed in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Many of my colleagues say it is not possible to limit spending to \nthat amount. I disagree, and I applaud my colleagues in the House who \nunderstand that we have to make those hard choices. Drawing a line in \nthe sand at $759 billion is a way to do that.\n  A few weeks ago my friend from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, and I sent \na letter to the President with 34 signatures from Members of the Senate \npledging to back him up if he vetoes excessive spending bills. I hope \nthe President will exercise his veto authority for any bills that would \nlikely increase spending beyond $759 billion.\n  But the President has to understand that if he vetoes any spending \nover $759 billion, we cannot hold to that figure unless we shift money \nfrom the defense budget.\n  What I am suggesting is that we shift some of the money from the \ndefense budget to the domestic side, rethink some of the large \nincreases in domestic spending that are in the 2003 budget, and spread \nthat money around to meet our other domestic needs. That means taking \non things such as NIH, that we all love. That has almost increased 50 \npercent during the last several years.\n  The President knows, as a former State Governor, that when you have a \nfinancial problem, what you do is reconsider your spending plans. If \nyou have some peaks in spending, you have to reduce those so you can \nmake more money available to stay within your budget. This \nadministration has to understand if they receive every dime they want \nfor defense spending and do not do anything about the peaks they have \non the domestic side of the budget, we are going to have a catastrophe \nat the end of this year. They will get their money for defense, the \ndomestic money will be forthcoming, and we will go far beyond the $759 \nbillion.\n  We will do the same thing that happened in the 1980s when I was mayor \nof the city of Cleveland and watched what was happening here in \nWashington. The President got his defense money, others got their \ndomestic spending, and this terrible debt that we have, the $6 trillion \ndebt we are paying for today is a result of that fiscal \nirresponsibility. We have to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n  As I said, these are the kinds of hard choices I had to make as a \nmayor and Governor. I did not have the option of just borrowing the \nmoney from our pension funds. I could not do that. If I told the people \nof Ohio, for example, when I was Governor, I was going to use the \nPublic Employees Retirement Funds to run the State of Ohio, they would \nhave run me out of office. But here in the Federal government it \napparently is OK for Congress to use the Social Security money. It is \nunbelievable to me. We should be doing what cities are doing in this \ncountry today, what States are doing in this country today, and what \nfamilies are doing. There are a lot of families in this country today \nwho are reallocating their resources because the money is just not \ncoming in. They are changing their priorities, and we should do the \nsame thing. We are no better than America's families.\n\n  If people around here could not borrow the money or use pension \nfunds, I can tell you things would be different. That is why we ought \nto have a balanced budget amendment, so we have the same kind of fiscal \nrestraint we had as Governors and mayors and county officials.\n  This year is an anomaly, however, and I hope not to see it repeated. \nI hope that next year we will have in place an invigorated budget \nprocess that helps Congress resist its worst urges and control spending \nin a responsible way.\n  Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       . . . that the underlying disciplinary mechanisms that form \n     the framework for Federal budget decisions over most of the \n     past 15 years have eroded. The administration and Congress \n     can make a valuable contribution to the prospects for the \n     growth of the economy by taking measures to restore this \n     discipline and return the Federal budget over time to a \n     posture that is supportive of long-term economic growth.\n\n  If we do not get things under control, we are not going to have the \neconomic growth necessary to take care of all our needs. That is why I \nhave been developing a budget process reform bill with Senator \nFeingold. This bill will extend important aspects of the existing \nbudget process, such as the spending caps and PAYGO.\n  In addition, the bill contains several provisions aimed at providing \nmore information on the true state of the budget so people understand \nwhat is going on around here. It is not hocus-pocus.\n  The bill requires accrual accounting for Federal insurance programs. \nIt requires CBO and the Joint Tax Committee to report how legislation \nchanges interest costs. It requires the GAO to issue an annual report \non the magnitude of liabilities facing the Federal Government. And it \nconvenes another budget concepts commission, which last met in 1967, to \nassess whether the fundamental measures for the Federal budget are the \nright ones.\n  With some tough new guidelines to rework the budget process, a \nwillingness to accept the fact that future expenses are as real and as \nimportant as today's, and the guts to make the tough choices necessary \nto prioritize our spending, we might just have a shot at achieving \nsound fiscal health.\n  Today, the Federal budget deficits are not as big as those we faced \nin the 1980s compared to the economy as a whole. But we are headed \nquickly in that direction. Given the rampant spending proclivities of \nCongress, it will not be long before our situation becomes just as bad \nas it was in the 1980s. I implore my colleagues to understand that we \nare on the edge of an abyss. We must stop before we commit fiscal \nsuicide.\n  A lot of people will say that the 1980s were pretty great, but it is \nalso part of the reason, as I mentioned, that we have the enormous debt \nwe have today. I remind my colleagues that we spend 11 percent of the \nannual Federal budget to pay for our fiscal irresponsibility of the \npast; i.e., we were not willing to either pay for or do without things. \nWe borrowed the money, used the Social Security surplus, and that is \nwhy we have the debt we have today.\n  We are now engaged in the war against terrorism at home and abroad, \nand we have some very pressing domestic needs. We have to understand \nthat we cannot get the job done by practicing business as usual. We \nhave to understand that. We just cannot do that anymore.\n  The decisions we make this year are going to have enormous impact on \nthe United States of America, our ability to maintain a competitive \nposition in the world, and on the quality of life of our children and \ngrandchildren. Our country and their future are in our hands.\n  Let history record that we had the courage to prioritize our Nation's \nneeds within the framework of fiscal responsibility--to make tough \nchoices and exercise tough love today, for our children's and \ngrandchildren's tomorrows.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But before we leave the military construction \nappropriations bill, I want to make a few comments.\n  I had the good fortune of being able to chair that subcommittee for \nsome time. I was ranking member after that. It was a great experience. \nIt is a wonderful bill, to work on programs that directly affect \nmilitary personnel. It affects them all over the world.\n  Construction takes place in Nevada at Nellis Air Force Base, Fallon \nNaval Air Station. Indian Springs, that used to be a full-fledged air \nbase and now it is a base that deals principally with the drones, \nunmanned vehicles. It is not only a bill that is for Nevada, it is good \nfor every State in the Union. As I indicated, construction takes place \naround the world.\n  The reason I wanted to comment on this is, I know this bill very \nwell. I have to say Senators Feinstein and Hutchison have done a \nremarkably good job.\n  I talked to Senator Feinstein after she completed debate. I said: \nDianne, I just think you have done such a good job on this, you and \nSenator Hutchison. I don't want to say anything that is wrong, that \nwill be untoward, but I think it speaks volumes that two women are \nhandling the legislation dealing with the military personnel of our \ncountry.\n  She said to me that she recognized that.\n  And I said: Would you be offended in any way if I talk about that a \nlittle bit, the fact that here we have this multibillion-dollar bill \nthat has been handled as well as any bill could be handled, and I think \nthe American public should understand the great contribution made by \nthese two female Senators.\n  I have seen the Senate change since I came here. Twenty percent of \nthe Democratic caucus now are women. The Senate is a better place \nbecause of women serving here. Things have been accomplished that would \nnot have been accomplished but for them.\n  I go back to something that really struck home with me. I was touring \na ranch in northern Nevada. The ranch was run by the Glaser brothers. I \nknow them well. One of them I served with in the State legislature for \nmany years. He had retired at the time. He is now deceased.\n  We were out looking at this bird sanctuary he had created on his own \nwith no Federal help, no State help, in the middle of this vast, \nbeautiful ranch of his. We were talking about how much farm equipment \ncosts.\n  Farm equipment is very expensive. But he said something to me I have \nnever forgotten. He said: You know, Harry, any time that I can hire \nwomen to run these big pieces of heavy equipment, I do so.\n  I said: Norm, why is that?\n  He said: Because they take better care of it. I have found over the \nyears that they are more gentle with the equipment. They don't do \nthings to hurt the equipment. Any chance I get that I can hire women to \nrun these big pieces of equipment, I do, because they do a better job \nthan the men.\n  Well, I don't want to concede anything at this time, that these two \nSenators did a better job than has been done in the past. But I will \nhave to tell you, it wouldn't take much to convince the rest of the \nSenate that they probably did a better job than has ever been done \nbefore.\n  I say the Senate and the country are better for having these women in \nthe Senate. I hope that as the years go by there will be more women \nelected to the Senate. There are a lot of women around the country \nrunning for the Senate this year. In the years to come, there will \ncertainly be more than 20 percent of the Democratic caucus that are \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6937-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6937-S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S.-CHINA SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the U.S.-China Security Review Commission on \nMonday released its first annual report, as directed by the Congress in \nits authorizing statute, P.L. 106-398, October 30, 2000. It is a broad-\nranging analysis, with major recommendations for consideration. I will \nask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The report is extensive, thorough, and disturbing in many respects. \nIt paints a detailed portrait of a China determined to: acquire a vast \narray of high technology; broaden and deepen its industrial base; \nexpand its research and development capabilities; and attract \nsubstantial amounts of American and other foreign investment. China is \non the move. But, it is worthwhile to note that China pays for much of \nits progress through a highly imbalanced trade relationship with the \nU.S. Last year the U.S. trade deficit with China exceeded $80 billion \nU.S. dollars.\n  One could simply say that the Chinese are intent on entering the \nmodern era, and on building a strong nation state, financed by \naggressively exporting goods to the U.S. But, Mr. President, there are \nsome very troubling aspects of the U.S./Chinese relationship.\n  The Commission found that U.S. policy toward China has been and is \nalarmingly fragmented. It lacks consistency and depth. U.S. policy \ntoward China has often been driven solely by commercial interests, \nspecific human rights issues, or by a particular military crisis, \nrather than by a comprehensive examination of all the issues which \nimpact upon this relationship. Furthermore, over the last 30 years U.S. \npolicy toward China has been dominated by strong Executive branch \npersonalities and compulsive secrecy. There seems to be little \nsustainable consensus on the long-term national interests of the U.S. \nvis a vis China.\n  The Report makes numerous recommendations designed to elicit a more \ncomprehensive understanding of China by U.S. policy makers and by the \ngeneral public. These include rebuilding the Library of Congress' China \ncollection, new language and area studies programs, new efforts at open \nsource collection by the intelligence community, and an upgrading of \nthe Federal Broadcast Information Service. The fact is that we as a \nnation know far too little about China, and we need a better level of \neffort in this regard.\n  There is new information and analysis in the Commission's report \nregarding Chinese access to U.S. capital markets, and a renewed call \nfor more effective consultations and consensus-building between the \nPresident and Congress on Taiwan policy. The report also recommends new \ntools which should be employed to encourage the Chinese to comply with \ntheir commitments--in proliferation practices, prison labor agreements, \nintellectual property agreements enforcement, and most importantly, \nwith their far-reaching obligations under the WTO.\n  The report calls for increased scrutiny of corporate activities in \nChina, and a new corporate reporting system to reveal what investment, \nR and technology is being sent to China. Transparency, disclosure and \ncorporate accountability should be required of U.S. firms' operations \nin China, and are certainly of much interest to American shareholders \nand investors.\n  I am pleased that the Report is a strong bipartisan effort, a broad \nconsensus of nearly all the Commissioners, who approved it by a vote of \n11-1. It is both an educational report and an action document. Each \nchapter highlights findings and makes recommendations for action which \nflow from those findings. The executive summery gives the key 21 \nrecommendations, but additional valuable proposals are found at the end \nof each chapter.\n  Some of the Report's key findings about the U.S.-China relationship \ninclude:\n  The U.S.-China bilateral relationship is poorly coordinated and lacks \na sustainable consensus among elected officials in Congress and the \nExecutive branch;\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\n  China's leaders see the United States as a declining power with \nimportant military vulnerabilities that can be exploited;\n  There are serious differences in perceptions each country holds of \nthe other and a potential for misunderstandings that are compounded by \nthe lack of bilateral institutions for confidence-building and crisis-\nmanagement;\n  There is plausible evidence that the burgeoning trade deficit with \nChina will worsen despite China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO);\n  The U.S. may be developing a reliance on Chinese imports that could \nin time undermine the U.S. defense industrial base;\n  The U.S. lacks adequate institutional mechanisms to monitor national \nsecurity concerns involving Chinese and other foreign entities seeking \nto raise capital in the U.S. debt and equity markets;\n  China provides technology and components for weapons of mass \ndestruction and their delivery systems to terrorist sponsoring states, \npresenting an increasing threat to U.S. security interests, in the \nMiddle East and Asia in particular.\n  Radical changes in China's economic fortunes have been fueled by U.S. \ninvestors and multinational firms, and have come with severe sacrifices \nin the form of lost American manufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. President, there is much to recommend in this Report, and many \nrecommendations which may be of interest to my colleagues.\n  I congratulate the Chairman and all of the commissioners who authored \nthis fine report, as well as the staff members of the Commission who \nworked tirelessly on this important endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Relations between the United States and China during the \n     last half-century have not always been smooth. The two \n     countries have sharply contrasting worldviews, competing geo-\n     strategic interests, and opposing political systems. More \n     recently, bilateral ties have centered on rapidly growing \n     economic interactions that have muted political differences. \n     For the moment, these relations have not softened China's \n     egregious behavior on human rights nor changed its strategic \n     perceptions that the U.S. is its principal obstacle to \n     growing regional influence. No one can reliably predict \n     whether relations between the U.S. and China will remain \n     contentious or grow into a cooperative relationship molded by \n     either converging ideologies or respect for ideological \n     differences, compatible regional interests, and a mutually \n     beneficial economic relationship.\n       However the relationship develops, it will have a profound \n     impact on the course of the twenty-first century. The \n     policies pursued today by both China and the United States \n     will affect future relations. The Congress created the U.S.-\n     China Security Review Commission to assess ``the national \n     security implications and impact of the bilateral trade and \n     economic relationship between the United States and the \n     People's Republic of China'' and to report its conclusions \n     annually to the Congress. It specifically directed the \n     Commission to focus on our deepening economic, trade, and \n     financial linkages with China. The Congress wanted the \n     Commission to evaluate whether our economic policies with \n     China harm or help United States national security and, based \n     on that assessment, to make recommendations in those areas \n     that will improve our nation's interests.\n       National security has come to include military, economic \n     and political relationships. At any time, one of these \n     concerns may dominate. They interact with one another and \n     affect our overall security and well-being. Neglect of any \n     one element will diminish our overall security as a nation. \n     The United States must be attentive to the strength and \n     readiness of our military forces, the health of our economy, \n     and the vibrancy of our political relationships.\n       The Congress also asked the Commission to include in its \n     Report ``a full analysis, along with conclusions and \n     recommendations for legislative and administrative actions.'' \n     This is the Commission's first Report. In keeping with the \n     Congressional mandate, this Report provides a comprehensive \n     analysis of the Commission's year-long review of U.S.-China \n     relations, the principal findings that emerged from that \n     investigation, and the recommendations or measures the \n     Commission believes should be implemented to help safeguard \n     our national security in the years ahead. This initial Report \n     provides a baseline against which to measure and assess year-\n     to-year changes in the relationship.\n\n\n                              Main Themes\n\n       Our relationship with China is one of the most important \n     bilateral relationships for our nation. If if is not handled \n     properly, it can cause significant economic and security \n     problems for our country. China is emerging as a global \n     economic and military power, and the United States has \n     played, and continues to play a major role in China's \n     development.\n       China's foreign trade has skyrocketed over the past twenty \n     years (from approximately $20 billion in the late 1970s to \n     $475 billion in 2000). Our trade deficit with China has grown \n     at a sharp rate, from $11.5 billion in 1990 to $85 billion in \n     2000. Foreign investment--with America a leading investor--\n     grew apace. This trade and investment has helped to \n     strengthen China both economically and militarily.\n       America's policy of economic engagement with China rests on \n     a belief that the transition to a free market economy and the \n     development of the rule of law in China's business sector \n     would likely lead to more political and social openness and \n     even democracy. This belief, along with the desire to expand \n     American commercial interests, drove U.S. support for China's \n     entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Many also \n     believe that a more prosperous China will be a more peaceful \n     country, especially if it is fully integrated into the \n     Pacific and world economies.\n       But these are hypotheses, and many leading experts are \n     convinced that certain aspects of our policy of engagement \n     have been a mistake. They argue that the PRC faces enormous \n     economic and social problems, that its leaders are \n     intractably antidemocratic, that they are hostile to the U.S. \n     and its prominent role in Asia, and that we are strengthening \n     a country that could challenge us economically, politically \n     and military.\n       The Commission does not believe that anyone can confidently \n     forecast the future of China and the U.S.-China relationship, \n     and contends that while we may work and hope for the best, \n     our policymakers should prepare for all contingencies.\n       Over the past twenty years, China has created a more \n     market-based economy and allowed more social and economic \n     freedom. Chinese participation in international security and \n     economic regimes has grown. On the other hand, China has made \n     little progress toward granting its citizens political and \n     religious freedom, and protecting human and labor rights. In \n     fact, the government has notably increased its repression of \n     some religious practices, including its brutal campaign \n     against the Alum Gong.\n       Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed to their Communist \n     Party support and the Chinese people that they have no desire \n     to repeat in China the political and economic collapse that \n     took place in the former Soviet Union. They seek to maintain \n     and strengthen the Communist Party's political and social \n     control while permitting freer economic activity. They \n     consistently limit the freedom of the Chinese people to \n     obtain and exchange information, practice their religious \n     faith, to publicly express their convictions, and to join \n     freely organized labor unions. Chinese leaders frequently use \n     nationalistic themes to rally support for their actions, \n     including crack downs on dissenters.\n       China is thus embarked on a highly questionable effort--to \n     open its economy but not its political system--the outcome of \n     which will influence the destinies of many countries, \n     including our own. If the economy fails, or if the Chinese \n     people demand full freedom instead of merely a taste of it, \n     then the leaders will have to choose between reasserting \n     central control and granting greater political and social \n     freedom, with a consequent weakening of their own authority. \n     On the other hand, if China becomes rich but not free, the \n     United States may face a wealthy, powerful nation that could \n     be hostile toward our democratic values, to us, and in direct \n     competition with us for influence in Asia and beyond.\n       American policymakers must take these scenarios seriously, \n     and to that end the Commission has established benchmarks \n     against which to measure future change. There are important \n     areas in which Chinese policy runs directly counter to U.S. \n     national security interests, such as not controlling exports \n     that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, its close relations with terrorist-sponsoring \n     states like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan and North \n     Korea, its expanding long-range missile forces, its \n     threatening policies toward Taiwan, and its pursuit of \n     both asymmetric warfare capabilities and modern military \n     technology that could menace American military forces.\n       China's leaders view the United States as a partner of \n     convenience, useful for its capital technology, know-how and \n     market. They often describe the United States as China's \n     long-term competitor for regional and global military and \n     economic influence. Much rhetoric and a considerable volume \n     of official writings support this hypothesis. The recent \n     empirical study of Chinese newspapers' coverage of the U.S., \n     conducted by University of Maryland scholars for the \n     Commission, found a divided perspective: articles in these \n     newspapers, which we believe generally represent the views of \n     the leadership, are consistently positive on trade and \n     investment matters and applaud Sino-U.S. cooperation in these \n     areas. In contrast, their coverage of U.S. foreign policy is \n     largely negative and frequently depicts the U.S., as \n     hegemonic and unilateralist.\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\n       In time we will learn whether China is to become a \n     responsible world power or an aggressive, wealthy \n     dictatorship, and whether the Communist Party maintains its \n     monopoly of political power or shares it with the Chinese \n     people. We will also learn whether the Chinese economy \n     flourishes or stumbles and collapses under the burden of \n     state-owned industries, a weak banking system, enormous debt, \n     wide-scale corruption, social dislocation, and the new \n     challenges of international competition brought about by its \n     WTO entry.\n       Current U.S. policies and laws fail to adequately monitor \n     the transfers of economic resources and security-related \n     technologies to China, considering the substantial \n     uncertainties and challenges to U.S. national interests in \n     this relationship. This Report attempts to begin to address \n     these uncertainties, trends, and challenges in a systematic \n     manner. It proceeds on the premise that far more prudence \n     must be displayed and far better understanding developed on \n     the part of the Congress on the full extent of this \n     relationship and its impact on U.S. interests. In addition, \n     too little attention has been devoted to the adverse impact \n     of recent Chinese economic strength on our Asian allies and \n     friends. The Commission believes the U.S. must develop a \n     better understanding of the vulnerabilities and needs of our \n     Asian allies and friends, and must carefully construct \n     policies to protect and nurture those relationships.\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n       The Commission has identified its key findings and \n     recommendations with each chapter in this Report. The \n     Commission developed more than forty recommendations that are \n     listed with each of the ten chapters. We have prepared a \n     separate classified report providing additional details and \n     recommendations. Here, we highlight and summarize those \n     recommendations we believe are the highest priority and which \n     we recommend for immediate action. A more extended analysis \n     is contained in each of the Report's ten chapters.\n\n\n                   conflicting national perspectives\n\n       The United States Government is poorly organized to manage \n     our increasingly complex relationship with China. We are not \n     adequately informed about developments within China and about \n     their leaders' perceptions of the U.S., and we dedicate \n     insufficient resources to understand China. Because Chinese \n     strategic thinking and analysis of military planning differ \n     markedly from our own, our incomplete understanding enhances \n     the possibilities for miscalculation, misunderstanding, \n     and potential conflict.\n       Recommendation 1: The U.S. Government should expand its \n     collection, translation and analysis of open source Chinese-\n     language materials, and make them available to the larger \n     community. Despite two studies advocating an improved \n     collection of Chinese materials at the Library of Congress, \n     its collection is nearly unusable and shameful. Congress \n     should provide funds to implement recommendations already \n     submitted by the two previous studies. In addition, the \n     Commission recommends increased funding for Chinese language \n     training and area studies programs, similar to the program in \n     the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and incentives \n     for post-secondary graduates to participate in government \n     services. The relevant executive branch agencies should \n     report annually to the Congress on steps taken to rectify \n     this situation.\n       Recommendation 2: The U.S. should develop a comprehensive \n     inventory of official government-to-government and U.S. \n     Government-funded programs with China. The President should \n     designate an executive branch agency to coordinate the \n     compilation of a database of all such cooperative programs. \n     The database should include a full description of each \n     program, its achievements to date, and the benefits to the \n     U.S. and should be prepared annually in both classified and \n     unclassified forms. The Commission further recommends that \n     the executive branch prepare a biannual report, beginning in \n     2004, on the cooperative Science and Technology (S) \n     programs with China patterned on the report submitted to \n     Congress in May 2002 at the request of Senator Robert C. \n     Byrd. The President should establish a working group to set \n     standards for S transfers, monitor the programs, and \n     coordinate with the intelligence agencies.\n       Recommendation 3: The Commission recommends that Congress \n     encourage the Department of Defense to renew efforts to \n     develop military-to-military confidence building measures \n     (CBMs) within the context of a strategic dialogue with China \n     and based strictly on the principles of reciprocity, \n     transparency, consistency, and mutual benefit.\n\n\n     Managing U.S.-China Economic Relations (Trade and Investment)\n\n       The United States has played a major role in China's rise \n     as an economic power. We are China's largest export market \n     and a key investor in its economy. Fueled by China's \n     virtually inexhaustible supply of low-cost labor and large \n     inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), the U.S. trade \n     deficit with China has grown at a furious pace--from $11.5 \n     billion in 1990 to $85 billion in 2000. The U.S. trade \n     deficit with China is not only our largest deficit in \n     absolute terms but also the most unbalanced trading \n     relationship the U.S. maintains. U.S. trade with China is \n     only 5 percent of total U.S. trade with the world but our \n     trade deficit with China is 19 percent of the total U.S. \n     trade deficit. U.S. exports to China are only 2 percent of \n     total U.S. exports to the world, while we import over 40 \n     percent of China's exports.\n       Foreign direct investment has helped China leapfrog forward \n     both economically and technologically. These developments \n     have provided China with large dollar reserves, advanced \n     technologies, and greater R capacity, each of which has \n     helped make China an important world manufacturing center and \n     a growing center of R, which are contributing to its \n     military-industrial modernization. U.S. companies have \n     difficulty competing with Chinese based companies, in \n     large part, because the cost of labor in China is \n     depressed through low wages and denial of worker rights. \n     Essentially, Chinese workers do not have the ability to \n     negotiate their wages. Attracted in part by the low wages \n     in China, a growing number of U.S. manufacturers are now \n     operating in China, many of whom are utilizing China as an \n     ``export platform'' to compete in U.S. and global markets.\n       China's large trade surplus with the United States, the \n     inflow of U.S. private investment into China, and China's \n     access to U.S. capital markets each contributes, directly or \n     indirectly, to China's economic growth and military \n     modernization.\n       Recommendation 4: The Commission recommends the creation of \n     a federally mandated corporate reporting system that would \n     gather appropriate data to provide a more comprehensive \n     understanding of the U.S. trade and investment relationship \n     with China. The reporting system should include reports from \n     U.S. companies doing business in China on their initial \n     investment, any transfers of technology, offset or R \n     cooperation associated with any investment, and the impact on \n     job relocation and production capacity from the United States \n     or U.S. firms overseas resulting from any investment in \n     China.\n       Recommendation 5: The Commission recommends that the U.S. \n     make full and active use of various trade tools including \n     special safeguards provisions in the WTO to gain full \n     compliance by China with its World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     accession agreement.\n\n\n               China's WTO Membership: Conflicting Goals\n\n       The U.S. and China hold differing goals for China's \n     membership in the WTO. (The Chinese saying for this situation \n     is: ``same bed, different dreams''). China's leadership \n     sought WTO membership to further the nation's economic reform \n     and growth through export production and the accumulation of \n     foreign investment, capital, and technology in order to \n     become a world power. U.S. support for China's WTO membership \n     was intended to enhance market access for U.S. goods and \n     services, and also to promote internal economic, political \n     and civil reforms, including a more open society.\n       China has instituted legal reforms to supervise foreign \n     direct investment (FDI), financial markets and private \n     businesses in order to stimulate trade and investment and \n     fulfill the country's WTO commitments. The development of a \n     commercial rule of law in China faces numerous obstacles, \n     including the lack of an independent judiciary and trained \n     judges, local protectionism, and widespread corruption. \n     Despite some advances in commercial legal reforms, China \n     remains grossly deficient in granting its citizens civil and \n     political freedoms, and makes widespread use of prison labor.\n       Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that Congress \n     renew the Super 301 provision of U.S. trade law and request \n     the Administration to identify and report on other tools that \n     would be most effective in opening China's market to U.S. \n     exports if China fails to comply with its WTO commitments. In \n     examining these tools, priority should be given to those \n     industry sectors where China expects rapid economic growth in \n     exports to the U.S. market.\n       Recommendation 7: Congress should authorize and appropriate \n     additional funds to strengthen the Commerce Department's \n     support for commercial rule of la reform in China, including \n     intellectual property rights and WTO implementation \n     assistance, and to strengthen the Department of State's \n     promotion of capacity-building programs in the rule of \n     law, administrative reform, judicial reform and related \n     areas.\n       Recommendation 8: The U.S. should improve enforcement \n     against imports of Chinese goods made from prison labor by \n     shifting the burden of proof to U.S. importers and by more \n     stringent requirements relating to visits to Chines \n     facilities suspected of producing and exporting prison-made \n     goods to the United States. (Note: The Commission made \n     recommendations to Congress on this issue in a May 2002 \n     letter).\n       Recommendation 9: The Commission recommends that Congress \n     request the annual Trade Promotion Coordination Committee \n     (TPCC) report prepared by the Department of Commerce include \n     an assessment of China's progress in compliance with its WTO \n     commitments, recommendations on initiatives to facilitate \n     compliance, and a survey of market access attained by key \n     U.S. industry sectors in China, including agriculture. The \n     report should include comparisons of U.S. market access in \n     those key industry sectors with those gained by the European \n     union and Japan.\n       Recommendation 10: The Commission recommends that Congress \n     urge the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to request WTO \n     consultations on China's noncompliance with its obligations \n     under the Trade-related Aspects\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\n     of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, \n     particularly its inadequate enforcement, to deter China's \n     counterfeiting and piracy of motion pictures and other video \n     products. If China fails to respond, Congress should \n     encourage the USTR to request a WTO dispute settlement panel \n     be convened on the matter.\n       Recommendation 11: Congress mandated the Commission to \n     evaluate and make recommendations on invoking Article XXI of \n     the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), relating \n     to security exceptions from GATT obligations. The Commission \n     believes that the steel industry is a possible candidate for \n     using Article XXI. If the Administration's current safeguard \n     measures prove ineffective, the Commission recommends that \n     Congress consider using Article XXI to ensure the survival of \n     the U.S. steel industry.\n\n\n                     accessing u.s. capital markets\n\n       Chinese firms raising capital or trading their securities \n     in U.S. markets have almost exclusively been large state-\n     owned enterprises, some of which have ties to China's \n     military and intelligence services. There is a growing \n     concern that some of these firms may be assisting in the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction of ballistic \n     missile delivery systems. The U.S. lacks adequate \n     institutional mechanisms to monitor national security \n     concerns raised by certain Chinese and other foreign entities \n     accessing the U.S. debt and equity markets. We also lack \n     sufficient disclosure requirements to inform the investing \n     public of the potential risks associated with investing in \n     such entities.\n       Recommendation 12: The Commission recommends that foreign \n     entities seeking to raise capital or trade their securities \n     in U.S. markets be required to disclose information to \n     investors regarding their business activities in countries \n     subject to U.S. economic sanctions.\n       Recommendation 13: The Commission recommends that the \n     Treasury Department, in coordination with other relevant \n     agencies, assess whether China or any other country \n     associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction or ballistic-missile delivery systems are \n     accessing U.S. capital markets and make this information \n     available to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). state \n     public pension plans, and U.S. investors. Entities sanctioned \n     by the Department of State for such activities should be \n     denied access to U.S. markets.\n\n\n              proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\n\n       China fails to control the export of dual-use items that \n     contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and their delivery systems. China is a leading \n     international source of missile-related technologies. Its \n     proliferation activities with terrorist-sponsoring and other \n     states, despite commitments to the U.S. to ease such \n     activities, present serious problems for U.S. national \n     security interests, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.\n       Recommendation 14: The Commission recommends that the \n     President be provided an extensive range of options to \n     penalize foreign countries for violating commitments or \n     agreements on proliferation involving weapons of mass \n     destruction and technologies and delivery systems relating to \n     them. All current statutes dealing with proliferation should \n     be amended to include a separate authorization for the \n     President to implement economic and other sanctions against \n     offending countries, including quantitative and qualitative \n     export and import restrictions, restricting access to U.S. \n     capital markets, controlling technology transfers, and \n     limiting U.S. direct investment.\n       Recommendation 15: The United States should work with the \n     United Nations Security Council and other appropriate inter-\n     governmental organizations to formulate a framework for \n     effective multilateral action to counter proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. \n     Member states found in violation of the agreed framework \n     should be subject to international sanctions.\n       Recommendation 16: The United States should continue to \n     prohibit satellite launch cooperation with China until it \n     puts into place an effective export-control system consistent \n     with its November 2000 commitment to the U.S. to restrict \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated \n     technologies to other countries and entities.\n\n\n                  cross-strait and regional relations\n\n       Cross-strait relations are a major potential flashpoint in \n     U.S.-China relations. Economic and people-to-people \n     interactions between Taiwan and the Mainland have increased \n     dramatically in recent years, raising prospects that such \n     interactions could help ameliorate cross-strait political \n     tensions. At the same time, China is enhancing its capability \n     to carry out an attack across the Taiwan Strait with special \n     operations, air, navy and missile forces. It continues to \n     deploy short- and intermediate-range missiles opposite Taiwan \n     and although the threat of an immediate attack appears to be \n     low, this buildup appears designed to forestall pro-\n     independence political movements in Taiwan and help bring \n     about an eventual end to the Island's continued separate \n     status.\n       China's economic integration with its neighbors in East \n     Asia raises the prospects of an Asian economic area dominated \n     or significantly influenced by China. The U.S. has an \n     interest in China's integration in Asia if it gives all \n     parties a stake in avoiding hostilities. Nonetheless, U.S. \n     influence in the area could wane to a degree, particularly on \n     economic and trade matters.\n       Recommendation 17: The Commission recommends that the \n     Department of Defense continue its substantive military \n     dialogue with Taiwan and conduct exchanges on issues ranging \n     from threat analysis, doctrine, and force planning.\n       Recommendation 18: The Commission recommends making \n     permanent those provisions in the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations Acts providing for \n     executive branch briefings to the Congress on regular \n     discussions between the administration and the government on \n     Taiwan pertaining to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.\n       Recommendation 19: The Commission believes that the \n     Congress should encourage the Administration to initiate \n     consultations with other Asian countries to assess and make \n     recommendations on the impact of the ``hollowing out'' \n     phenomenon with respect to China on regional economies and on \n     U.S. economic relations with the region.\n\n\n                        china's military economy\n\n       China's official defense spending has expanded by more than \n     one-third in the past two years. The Commission estimates \n     that China's official defense budget represents about one-\n     third of its actual spending level. Its ability to increase \n     defense spending in the face of competing priorities is \n     supported by its rapid economic growth. China has the largest \n     standing army in the world and ranks second in actual \n     aggregate spending. The military's role in China's economy \n     has been reduced in recent years, but the military derives \n     extensive financial and technological benefits from the \n     growth and modernization of the domestic economy, which is \n     designed to serve it.\n       Recommendation 20: The Commission recommends that the \n     Secretary of Defense prepare a biannual report on critical \n     elements of the U.S. defense industrial base that are \n     becoming dependent on Chinese imports or Chinese-owned \n     companies. The Department of Defense should also update its \n     acquisition guidelines and develop information from defense \n     contractors on any dependency for critical parts of essential \n     U.S. weapons systems.\n\n\n             technology transfers and military acquisitions\n\n       China has a well-established policy and program to acquire \n     advanced technologies for its industrial development, \n     military capabilities and intelligence services. Over the \n     next ten years, China intends to acquire an industrial \n     capability to build advanced conventional and strategic \n     weapons systems. Current U.S. policies do not adequately \n     consider the impact of the transfers of commercial and \n     security-related technologies to China.\n       Recommendation 21: The Commission recommends that the \n     Department of Defense and the FBI jointly assess China's \n     targeting of sensitive U.S. weapons-related technologies, the \n     means employed to gain access to these technologies and the \n     steps that have been and should be taken to deny access and \n     acquisition. This assessment should include an annual report \n     on Chinese companies and Chinese PLA-affiliated companies \n     operating in the United States. Such reports are mandated by \n     statute but have never been provided to Congress.\n       The Commission cannot forecast with certainty the future \n     course of U.S.-China relations. Nor can we predict with any \n     confidence how China and Chinese society will develop in the \n     next ten to twenty years. We do know that China now ranks \n     among our most important and most troubling bilateral \n     relationships and believe that China's importance to the \n     United States will increase in the years ahead. As its \n     economy and military grow and its influence expands, China's \n     actions will carry increased importance for the American \n     people and for our national interests.\n       For this reason, the Commission believes that there is a \n     pressing need to fully understand the increasingly complex \n     economic, political and military challenges posed by China's \n     drive toward modernity. To gain such comprehension will \n     require the allocation of more resources and the elevation of \n     China in our foreign and national security priorities. The \n     Commission hopes that U.S.-China relations will develop in a \n     positive direction but we must urge that this outcome, though \n     preferred, may not happen. The U.S. must, therefore, be \n     prepared for all possible contingencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6940-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6940-S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE SILK ROAD: CONNECTING CULTURES, CREATING TRUSTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend the \nSmithsonian Institution and Yo-Yo Ma for this year's extraordinary \nFolklife Festival, ``The Silk Road: Connecting Cultures, Creating \nTrusts.'' The festival, which was held from June 26 through July 7 on \nThe Mall, enabled hundreds of thousands to experience the art of 375 \nmusicians, dancers, cooks and storytellers from the nations along the \nfamous Silk Road trade routes through central Asia centuries ago.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, it is more important than ever to \nexpand our understanding of those cultures. Yo-Yo Ma, with broad \nsupport from Secretary of State Colin Powell, the\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nAga Khan, and the Congressional Silk Road Caucus, and many others, \nhelped us to embark on a journey of understanding and appreciation by \nbringing an incredible diversity of products and ideas that have \nemerged from central Asia to our Nation's front lawn--the Smithsonian \nMall.\n  Yo-Yo Ma deserves special recognition for his unique ability to \nengage us all in an educational process that celebrates cultural \ndifferences. He is one of our Nation's preeminent musical artists. He \nis also an extraordinary cultural leader who has won the hearts of \nmillions throughout the world with his outreach and education programs. \nHe has used his incomparable talents to inspire us to learn about \ndiverse peoples and cultures.\n  I commend all those who worked so effectively to make this year's \nFolklife Festival such an unequivocal success. It is a privilege to pay \ntribute to their efforts. I ask unanimous consent to include remarks at \nthe opening ceremony of the Smithsonian Silk Road Project in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The Silk Road: Connecting Cultures, Creating Trust--Smithsonian \n   Folklife Festival Opening Ceremony, Washington, D.C., Remarks by \n          Smithsonian Institution Secretary, Lawrence M. Small\n\n  To all our distinguished guests, welcome to the Nation's Capital, \nwelcome to the national mall, and the opening of the 36th annual \nSmithsonian Folklife Festival, The Silk Road: Connecting Cultures, \nCreating Trust.\n  We have assembled some 400 musicians, artists, and storytellers from \nmore than 25 countries around the globe to 20 acres here on the mall, \nthe nation's front yard.\n  And I must mention Kubla and Gobi who come from Texas, the two \nBactrian camels, who have two humps. They have been specially trained \nto respond to commands in both English and Kazakh, which means you can \nnow see the only double-humped, bilingual camels in the world.\n  The Smithsonian had plenty of help this year. This was truly an \ninternational effort, with many countries cooperating across borders \nfor a common goal. As you look around, it's clear the goal has been \naccomplished. My congratulations to all involved, many are here today, \nmany are in their home countries, we thank them all wherever they are.\n  The State Department has provided valuable assistance, and we have a \nspecial guest who will be here soon to officially open the Festival, \nthe Honorable Colin Powell, Secretary of State.\n  The Smithsonian could not carry out its mission without the generous \nsupport of Congress, and we are always grateful for that. We thank \nSenator Brownback and Senator Biden, honorary co-chairs of the Folklife \nFestival. You'll hear from Senator Brownback soon.\n  We're very grateful for the help of Senator Kennedy; you'll hear from \nhim in a moment. And thanks also to Congressman Pitts from the 16th \ndistrict of Pennsylvania, and all the members of the Congressional Silk \nRoad Caucus.\n  We also are grateful for the support of His Highness the Aga Khan, a \ntrue humanitarian whose caring and concern span the globe. We welcome \nthe Honorable Fran Mainella, Director of the National Park Service.\n  A special thanks to Rajeev Sethi, the Festival scenographer, and head \nof the Asian Heritage Foundation, who collaborated closely with the \nSmithsonian in the design and the production of the Festival. And whose \nmany wonders you see here on the mall. And, we would not be here \nwithout the incredibly generous contribution of time, talent, and \nresources of Yo Yo Ma. We're honored to be working with him and the \norganization he founded, the Silk Road Project. We're very thankful for \ntheir support. You will hear from Yo Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble \nvery soon.\n  Centuries ago, had you been a traveler on the storied trade route \nfrom Japan to Italy, you would have seen traders carrying textiles, \ntea, spices, silk, and much more from the Pacific to the Mediterranean. \nPerhaps most importantly, these traders carried art, music, literature, \nideas, a way of life, a culture, from one land to the next. As a \nresult, all the cultures were changed--and the change continues to this \nday.\n  The Silk Road lives not in the past but the present--influencing our \nlives every day.\n  This Festival will make abundantly clear why it is so important to \ncontinue open cultural exchange between diverse peoples and societies. \nEspecially now.\n  I want to thank Richard Kurin, Richard Kennedy, Diana Parker, and all \nthe staff at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage \nfor all their hard work in putting this together. This year, the Freer \nand Sackler galleries, The Smithsonian Associates, the Hirshhorn Museum \nand Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of Natural History, the \nNational Museum of African Art, and the Smithsonian Magazine, have all \npicked up the Silk Road theme in their activities. Thanks to them also.\n  Later on in the program, Richard Kurin will tell you more about this \nremarkable event, including how many silk worms are needed to make one \npound of silk, when is a 5-ton truck not a painting, what ``bushkazi'' \nis, and where polo comes from and when the polo matches start on the \nmall. Yes, I said polo.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRemarks by His Highness the Aga Khan at the opening of the Smithsonian \n                   Folklife Festival--Washington D.C.\n\n       I am here to speak briefly about Central Asia. I wanted to \n     share with you some of the reasons why the theme of the \n     Smithsonian Folklife Festival this year is so important. As \n     you know, Central Asia has been an area of considerable \n     concern and instability for the world. Over the past decade, \n     Central Asian countries have come into existence in difficult \n     circumstances. Frontiers have been changed, ethnic groups \n     have been divided, old traditions have been modified by the \n     Soviet presence, and all this has caused considerable \n     difficulty in looking ahead in that part of the world.\n       The period of deep change at the national and regional \n     levels has prompted a search for new forces of stability. One \n     that seems particularly important, I think, to the United \n     States and to all of us, is the validation and vigorous \n     promotion of human and cultural pluralism. Historically the \n     Silk Route was a link that interconnected diverse aspects of \n     human society and culture from the Far East to Europe, and \n     did so on the basis of mutual interest. This suggests that \n     for the new countries of Central Asia, the inherent pluralism \n     of their societies can be regarded as an asset rather than a \n     liability. In the wider sense, it can be a means of enlarging \n     the frontiers of global pluralism. This is a goal with which \n     we all can and should associate.\n       The remarkable work of Yo-Yo Ma has enthralled audiences, \n     from all the countries of the Silk Route and beyond. By his \n     leadership and imagination he has proved that the force of \n     cultural pluralism to bind people is as necessary, powerful \n     and achievable today as was the Silk Route in history.\n       It is my privilege and honor to be associated with the \n     founder of the modern Silk Route, a cultural journey that \n     inspires people to unity and joy through art.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRemarks by Yo-Yo Ma at the opening of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival\n\n       Your Highness, thank you for your kind words. The Silk road \n     Project and I admire you for many reasons. In your cultural \n     work you have created the Aga Khan Prize for Architecture, \n     you have supported and founded Universities around the world, \n     and you are doing important restoration work in cities like \n     Cairo and now Kabul. We are honored to be working with you \n     and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture on this year's Smithsonian \n     Folklife Festival.\n       I would also like to single out someone who is both a \n     friend of mine and of the Silk Road Project, the Senator from \n     my home state of Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy, \n     thank you for your tireless work for arts organizations.\n       Secretary Powell, Senator Kennedy, Senator Brownback, \n     Secretary Small, Your Highness, distinguished guests, welcome \n     to the sights, sounds and scents familiar to over half the \n     world's population. In the past, to experience all these \n     elements you would need to travel by camel, by foot, by boat, \n     and now, by plane. Today and for the next two weeks here on \n     the National Mall we're providing the camels, the painted \n     truck from Pakistan, and the rik-shaws, so all you need are \n     your eyes, ears and imagination.\n       During twenty-five years of travel, I have been introduced \n     to some of these sights, sounds and scents, and the many \n     stories that accompany them.\n       Often the music you hear when I play the cello comes from \n     these very stories. During this year's Smithsonian Folklife \n     Festival, you can hear these stories for yourselves in \n     encounters with four hundred artists from twenty-four \n     countries.\n       Most of these artists will be strangers to you. Many of \n     these artists are strangers to each other. We all meet \n     strangers all the time. When the Silk Road Ensemble musicians \n     and I first started playing together two years ago we had to \n     find ways to trust each other onstage even though we had only \n     just\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n     met. To me, the best way to create this trust is to share \n     something precious--a personal story or belief. In music, \n     this process of sharing deepens the harmonies, but more \n     broadly this process starts a true dialogue and strengthens \n     our common world heritage. This festival is about that \n     dialogue.\n       In the end, the goal of the Smithsonian Center for Folklife \n     and Cultural Heritage, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, and \n     the Silk Road Project is the same: to draw on the wisdom of \n     all of our cultures to enrich our world one encounter at a \n     time.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Remarks of Senator Edward Kennedy Opening Ceremony--Folklife Festival\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Kurin, for that generous introduction. It is \n     an honor to be here this morning with all the exceptionally \n     talented artists and the visionary sponsors of the Silk Road \n     Project--the cornerstone of this year's Folklife Festival. \n     The Folklife Festival is one of our capital city's most \n     beloved traditions. Each year, it brings the customs and \n     cultures of a unique region or ethnic population alive with \n     music and dance, craft and culinary wonders.\n       I commend Lawrence Small, Secretary of the Smithsonian \n     Institution. He is a dynamic leader of the Smithsonian, and I \n     commend him for the success of this inspiring project.\n       It is a privilege to be here with Secretary of State, Colin \n     Powell who is an effective advocate for the United States in \n     these difficult times. He is skillful in the pursuit of peace \n     across the world and I commend him for all he continues to \n     do.\n       I also join in welcoming His Highness the Aga Khan who was \n     an early supporter of the Silk Road Project. He is an \n     impressive leader for our time and I commend all that he has \n     done, especially in the field of education and cultural \n     exchange. Now, more than ever, his voice is one that needs to \n     be acknowledged and understood. We are honored to have him \n     with us today.\n       It is especially important that the Smithsonian has \n     embarked on this remarkable celebration of the cultural \n     richness and diversity of the Silk Road countries. Centuries \n     ago, the Silk Road trade routes gave birth to an \n     unprecedented and extraordinary exchange of cultural and \n     economic traditions. Today, more than ever, it is essential \n     to remember the incredible diversity of products and ideas \n     that have emerged from Central Asia.\n       The Mall is truly the Main Street of our nation's capital \n     city. Today, it brings us exhibits and cultural performances \n     representing the Silk Road countries, from Italy to India, \n     Mongolia and Japan. There is something here for everyone to \n     enjoy. And that is, after all, what the Folklife Festival is \n     about. It is a starting point for exploration and education, \n     and it is always about entertainment.\n       The Silk Road's artistic demonstrations and musical \n     performances will bring the Mall to new life over the next \n     several weeks.\n       We are especially privileged to have with us one of our \n     nation's most preeminent artists. Yo-yo Ma is a musician who \n     has won both critical and popular acclaim for his virtuosity. \n     He has also won the hearts and minds of millions of people \n     throughout the world, with his outreach and education \n     projects.\n       From Sesame Street to Carnegie Hall, he has brought music \n     to life, and life to music. He is the tireless and seemingly \n     unstoppable energy behind youth orchestras across the \n     country, and projects as musically diverse as the memorable \n     ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and his energetic \n     Appalachian strings recordings.\n       He starred on David Letterman two nights ago, and today he \n     is with us--on America's Main Street--to celebrate the \n     beginning of the Folklife Festival. He inspires each of us to \n     do all we can to embrace and celebrate diverse peoples and \n     cultures through education and understanding.\n       After the tragic events of September 11th, it is more \n     important than ever for each of us to understand and embrace \n     new ideas and cultures. Today, we continue this journey of \n     understanding with Yo-Yo Ma.\n       He has used his magnificent genius to bring the entire \n     world closer together. He inspires people everywhere to seek \n     peace and reconciliation, and he has done it all with his \n     magical cello.\n       He is here with the performers of the Silk Road Ensemble \n     and I am honored to introduce them now.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n Remarks at the Opening of the Silk Road Festival--Secretary Colin L. \n   Powell, Smithsonian Folklife festival on the Mall, Washington, DC\n\n       Secretary Powell: Thank you very much, ladies and \n     gentlemen. Thank you so very much, Richard, for that kind \n     introduction, and my congratulations to the Smithsonian for \n     putting on this 36th Annual Folklife Festival. With each \n     year's Folklife Festival, the Mall becomes a living cultural \n     exhibition, not only for the citizens of this city, but for \n     the citizens of the world who come to Washington, D.C. In the \n     words of former Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, ``The \n     Festival brings the museum out of its glass case and into \n     real life.''\n       I want to thank you also, Yo-Yo Ma and your Silk Road \n     Project, to the Aga Khan for his Trust for Culture, to \n     Lawrence Small of the Smithsonian, for all the wonderful work \n     they have done to make this such an exciting and important \n     event. And I am very proud that the State Department had such \n     a role to play in it, and some of my leaders from the \n     Department who had a role to play are here. Under Secretary \n     of State Charlotte Beers and Assistant Secretary of State \n     Beth Jones, and I think Assistant Secretary of State Pat \n     Harrison are here, and they also are deserving of your \n     recognition.\n       In fact, we did have some diplomatic challenges in making \n     this happen. The two yurts that are here, tents that you will \n     see in due course, they had to be custom made to conform to \n     American laws for access to the handicapped. And so our \n     embassy in Kazakhstan worked closely with the Kazakh \n     Government to make sure they were up to standard--and then \n     helped ship them here in time for this Festival. So we are \n     not only culturally pure, we are OSHA-pure as well. I want \n     you to know that.\n       We have seen so many talented people this morning, and we \n     have had such wonderful speakers. And I, as always, enjoyed \n     Yo-Yo Ma. But Yo-Yo, I have to say the throat singers might \n     have had a slight edge on you. It was marvelous, and I \n     haven't heard throat singing like that since my last \n     congressional appearance. And it was before the Senate, not \n     the House.\n       But what these artists have done for you this morning so \n     far is they have painted a marvelous picture of the old Silk \n     Road and the central place that the Silk Road played in our \n     own history, our own culture, and in our own civilization.\n       Listening to this morning's speakers, you can almost see \n     Marco Polo trekking eastward toward lands unknown to \n     Europeans, or hear the sounds of a merchant caravan heading \n     west with its cargo of silks and spices.\n       The Silk Road of old was the main link between the \n     civilizations of the east, Central Asia, and Europe. From \n     Europe, the products and ideas of Central and East Asia then \n     spread to the New World of the Americas. All of our peoples \n     were enriched by the exchange of goods, the exchange of \n     ideas, and the exchange of cultures.\n       But the Silk Road is more than a subject for magazines and \n     museums. It is more than an image of past glories. The \n     nations of Central Asia are once again joining the nations at \n     either end of the Silk Road on a path to a better future for \n     all. There is far to go, and the region's security, \n     stability, and prosperity depend on critical economic and \n     political reforms. But the Silk Road is once again a living \n     reality, as the over 350 artists and craftspeople from 20 \n     nations here testify.\n       Now, in our new age of globalization, we are restoring the \n     linkages and the interchanges that once made the Silk Road so \n     rich and so vital. We have been making up for lost time. Our \n     political, economic, diplomatic, and security contacts have \n     increased with all the nations along the central part of the \n     Silk Road, boosted by our cooperation especially as we came \n     together in the campaign against terrorism following 9/11 \n     last year.\n       But even more important, our cultural and institutional \n     ties have also grown. We are once again exchanging ideas and \n     learning about cultures with all of the countries and peoples \n     along the Silk Road.\n       The links between our peoples are the most vital and \n     enduring elements of our ties. Festivals like the Smithsonian \n     Silk Road Festival play a major role in helping us get \n     reacquainted and start learning from each other once again. \n     As the theme of this exhibition reminds us, it's all about \n     ``Connecting cultures and creating trust.''\n       This Festival, like the future, stretches ahead before us. \n     So without further delay, and with sincere thanks for your \n     patience, let me now light the lamp that will allow us to \n     embark on our journey along the Silk Road. Thank you very, \n     very much.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, in this time of seemingly endless stories \nof corporate fraud and mismanagement, I would like to take the \nopportunity to salute a bold step recently taken by one of the world's \nmost respected corporations. As you know, the Coca-Cola Company's world \nheadquarters is located in Atlanta, GA.\n  The Coca-Cola Company announced on Sunday that it would expense the \ncost of all stock options the company grants, beginning with options to \nbe granted in the fourth quarter of 2002.\n  I commend CEO Douglas Daft and the leadership of the Coca-Cola \nCompany on their decision. Stock options are indeed a form of employee \ncompensation and their characterization as a balance sheet expense will \nprovide investors with a clearer picture of Coca-Cola's fiscal health.\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\n  Sunday's announcement is indicative of Coca-Cola's ongoing commitment \nto economic integrity and fairness. With this new policy, the company \nwill be able to design whatever kind of options it believes will both \nbest motivate employees and more align their interests with those of \nshare owners, without regard for the options' accounting effects.\n  While Coca-Cola is the first company of its size to take this \nimportant step, I predict it will not be the last. As other \ncorporations follow Coke's lead, investor confidence in our markets \nwill grow once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6943-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NOMINATION OF DR. RICHARD CARMONA FOR SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning the members of the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, voted to \nsupport the nomination of Dr. Richard Carmona for the position of U.S. \nSurgeon General. While the Surgeon General has played a major role on \nhealth care matters for more than one hundred years, the unique \nchallenges confronting our Nation at the beginning of the 21st century \nrequire an elevated level of leadership.\n  The threat of bioterrorism is real--a fact made clear in the last \nyear as anthrax attacks killed five people, infected 22, and exposed \nhundreds. These attacks highlighted the inadequacy of our Nation's \npublic health infrastructure to prevent, detect, and respond to an \ninfectious disease outbreak, whether such an outbreak is intentionally \nor naturally caused.\n  Since that time, much has taken place. We in Congress have passed, \nand the President has signed into law, the Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act. We have significantly \nincreased the Federal commitment to upgrading capacity in State and \nlocal health departments and we are now considering how a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security could enhance our efforts to prevent \nand respond to bioterrorism.\n  Despite these steps, we are still not fully prepared to meet the \nthreat of bioterrorism and much work remains to be done to bolster our \npublic health system. This will be one of the most important tasks \nfacing the country and facing the incoming Surgeon General. Dr. \nCarmona's experience and expertise prepares him well for this effort.\n  As we strengthen the public health system's capabilities, we are also \nchallenged by a growing epidemic of chronic disease that significantly \nimpacts our Nation's health. Take, for example, obesity. Sixty-one \npercent of American adults and 13 percent of children and adolescents \nare overweight or obese, and these rates are increasing among all age \ngroups. In my home State of Tennessee, the rate of obesity has grown \nfrom 12 percent to 22 percent over the past decade. An estimated \n300,000 deaths each year in the United States are linked to being \noverweight or obese. Those who are obese have a 50- to 100-percent \nincreased risk of premature death. This problem is now one of the most \nserious public health challenges facing the country. Next week, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Dodd, Senator Stevens, and I will be introducing the \nImproved Physical Activity and Nutrition Act to help address this \nproblem. I look forward to working with Dr. Carmona to address this \nissue.\n  Additionally, youth smoking and substance abuse are a significant \nconcern. Twenty-five percent of adults smoke--with even higher rates \namong young adults. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable \ndeath in this country, and alcohol misuse contributes to one-third of \nmotor vehicle crash related deaths. Over one-half of 10th graders have \nsmoked tobacco. Sixteen percent of 8th graders have been drunk at least \nonce in the past year. Twenty-five percent of high school seniors have \nused an illicit drug in the past 30 days.\n  There are a number of approaches we can take to these problems as \nlegislators. Last Congress, we reauthorized the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration, in which we included a special \nemphasis on youth drug abuse. But the Surgeon General bears a special \nresponsibility to help educate the Nation about the dangers of such \nbehavior, and I am pleased that this will be a priority for Dr. Carmona \nas Surgeon General.\n  During the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing \non his nomination, Dr. Carmona emphasized that his priority will be \nprevention: to prevent unnecessary illness, disability and death. Many \nof the major health problems facing the country can be improved with a \nfocus on prevention, and Dr. Carmona's focus on these issues will \nbenefit the country as he serves us as Surgeon General.\n  Before the hearing on Dr. Carmona's nomination, there were concerns \nraised regarding some aspects of his professional background. The \ncommittee appropriately inquired about these issues during the hearing. \nDr. Carmona's responses were forthright and direct, and I believe he \nhas addressed concerns about his ability to perform the duties of the \nSurgeon General. His background and experience as a trauma surgeon, as \na director of a county health system, and as an expert in emergency \nmedical systems, along with her personal drive and commitment to \nimproving the health of all Americans, will serve the country well. Mr. \nPresident, I intend to support Dr. Carmona's nomination. I urge my \ncolleagues to support him as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6943-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONFIRMATION OF LAVENSKI SMITH TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE \n                             EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this week I voted not to confirm \nLavenski Smith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \nwhich includes my State of Minnesota. While I have supported the vast \nmajority of administration appointments that have come to the floor to \ndate, I voted against this nominee because I am concerned about his \nlack of experience and qualifications, as well as about what I consider \nto be an excessively ideological approach to important issues, such as \nwomen's reproductive rights, in his legal work so far.\n  Our district needs and deserves the best judges, especially because \nthey receive lifetime appointments. I regret that the President did not \nnominate a person with a more distinguished record to this important \nposition.\n  Mr. Smith has just 7 years' experience practicing law, in which time \nhe has gained minimal Federal experience and minimal appellate \nexperience. He has no experience arguing cases before the Eighth \nCircuit, the court to which he has now been confirmed.\n  In addition to his lack of experience, Mr. Smith has advocated \nideologically tendentious legal positions that I believe may cast doubt \non his ability to adjudicate cases fairly. In the one appellate case in \nwhich Mr. Smith took a lead role, his argument in relation to \nreproductive rights was unanimously rejected by the Arkansas Supreme \nCourt. The court's decision observed that Mr. Smith disregarded both \njudicial precedent and the plain meaning of the Arkansas Constitution \nin making his case.\n  The circuit court of appeals is one step from the Supreme Court. Yet \nthe Arkansas Times wrote of this nominee: ``Lavenski Smith of Little \nRock is not the best qualified Arkansan President Bush could have \nchosen for the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, nor even close.'' \nWhatever State a nominee might come from, Minnesota and the Eighth \nCircuit deserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6943-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6943-S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 6, \n1995, in West Hollywood, CA. A gay man was punched and kicked by \nseveral youths who made anti-gay remarks. The assailants, three teens, \nwere charged with battery and interference with civil rights.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nchanging current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6944-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            AN ESSAY BY SANFORD WEILL ON ACCOUNTING REFORMS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to share with my \ncolleagues an excellent essay by the best of the best, Sandy Weill. As \nthe article points out, most corporate executives, like Sandy Weill, \nare honest and already enacting changes in their companies to provide \nbetter accounting disclosure policies.\n  As the message comes from someone who has distinguished himself as a \nbusiness leader, it is a message I hope all American business \nexecutives not only hear, but heed.\n  I ask to print the essay in the Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\n                      Core Values Start at the Top\n\n       America has long had a financial system to be proud of and \n     it is therefore critical--particularly at a time of danger \n     and uncertainty--that both industry and government enact \n     changes to address the recent corporate scandals that have \n     shaken faith in the system and its corporate executives.\n       The country will come through this period stronger than \n     ever, but only with the hard work of legislators, regulators \n     and, most important chief executive officers. George W. \n     Bush's call for a new ethic of corporate responsibility comes \n     at the right time, with its emphasis on holding corporate \n     officers more accountable, protecting small investors, moving \n     accounting out of the shadows and providing better disclosure \n     along with a stronger and more independent corporate audit \n     system.\n       The president's proposal that corporate officers lose \n     compensation they may receive by manipulating their \n     accounting statements, and efforts by Harvey Pitt, chairman \n     of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to make CEOs more \n     individually accountable for their companies' financial \n     disclosures should be welcomed.\n       Used correctly, option grants should not only reward good \n     performance but encourage a long-term perspective. Many \n     companies use them for this purpose: more should. I have long \n     been a proponent of ``buy-and-hold'' investing, and at \n     Citigroup, our senior managers and board abide by a rigorous \n     stock ownership commitment. Every one of us makes a pledge--a \n     ``blood oath''--to hold three-quarters of any stock or \n     options we receive as long as we remain with the company, \n     which reinforces our consistent focus on the long term. Also, \n     we have never repriced stock options for our senior \n     executives, and we never will. When companies do this, an \n     alarm should sound that the long-term alignment of \n     shareholde and management interests is not in place.\n       To ensure that everyone in a company is focused on \n     appropriate long-term objectives, stock ownership should go \n     as deep as possible within an organization. To encourage \n     this, and to respond to concerns regarding excess \n     compensation, I suggest that options be expended for the top \n     five officers identified in the proxy, and that tax treatment \n     be enhanced for options given to the rank and file earning \n     less than $100,000 by allowing options to be included in \n     401(k) pension plans. Proposals to change the accounting or \n     tax treatment of stock options should not hinder these \n     programs--they should encourage other companies to adopt \n     them.\n       In the wake of recent scandals, all CEOs should examine \n     their governance principles. They must push for strong, \n     independent boards and focus on full disclosure. Bullet-proof \n     audit processes, with exhaustive internal and external checks \n     and balances must be in place, reporting to an independent \n     committee of the board whose involvement goes beyond \n     quarterly meetings.\n       Audit partners should be rotated regularly and outside \n     auditors should be used for audit and tax purposes only. \n     Companies must also get back to basic accounting, based on \n     Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and be required to \n     account for all revenues and expenses rather than producing \n     pro forma or ebitda as their primary income measure.\n       One of the most distressing fall-outs of the current crisis \n     is the public's reduced confidence in audited financial \n     statements, for decades the very underpinning of America's \n     financial system. We cannot make auditors out of lawyers, \n     boards, rating agencies, research analysts or bankers. We \n     need auditors to do their jobs and be accountable to one \n     group alone: the shareholders.\n       I therefore applaud efforts by Senator Paul Sarbanes, \n     Congressman Michael Oxley and the US Congressional leadership \n     towards comprehensive accounting reform legislation. Just as \n     concern over corporate disclosure during the Great Depression \n     led to the creation of the SEC, a strong independent \n     authority must be established to set accounting standards and \n     oversee auditor conduct. In effect, we need an SEC for the \n     accounting industry.\n       Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney-general, has identified \n     serious issues in the way investment banks and research \n     analysts interact. Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney was the \n     first to adopt voluntarily the research reforms put forward \n     by Mr. Spitzer. These, along with proposals from the SEC and \n     the New York Stock Exchange, are setting higher standards for \n     the industry.\n       Even so, we must do more. I believe the entire industry \n     should be subject to additional rules that make research \n     independent from investment banking. Analysts should be \n     barred from attending any meeting with investment bankers \n     soliciting business from public companies and from \n     participating in any ``roadshow'' presentation to investors. \n     Investment bankers should be barred from having any input in \n     determining the compensation of research analysts and from \n     previewing any research reports prior to publication.\n       The current crisis is an opportunity to recapture core \n     values. But this will only be possible if CEOs accept the \n     responsibility that comes with their rank. It is up to use to \n     lead the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6944-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DR. WILLIS HAVILAND CARRIER\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \naccomplishments of a great New Yorker, Dr. Willis Haviland Carrier, who \ninvented air-conditioning 100 years ago today.\n  Dr. Carrier was a man of humble background. Born in 1876 in Angola, \nNY, he delayed his education for 2 years to work on the family farm \nduring the Depression of the mid-1890s. After finishing high school in \nBuffalo, he won a scholarship to attend Cornell University in Ithaca. \nWhile at Cornell, he founded a cooperative student laundry agency, the \nfirst of its kind. He graduated in 1901 with a degree in electrical and \nmechanical engineering, and went to work for the Buffalo Forge Company.\n  When the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company of \nBrooklyn was looking for a solution to the problem of paper expansion \ndue to heat and humidity, Carrier was assigned to the task. On July 17, \n1902, he presented his design for a system to control temperature, \nhumidity, air quality, circulation, and ventilation. The modern era of \nair conditioning was born.\n  Dr. Carrier had the business acumen to make his invention a success, \nand in 1915 he founded the Carrier Corporation in Syracuse. Movie \ntheaters were among the first adopters of the new technology, soon to \nbe followed by department stores, airplanes, and cars. Air conditioning \ncame to the House of Representatives in 1928 and here to the Senate in \n1929. After World War II, air conditioning became affordable for \nprivate homes, forever changing the American lifestyle.\n  Dr. Carrier held 80 patents at the time of his death in 1950. His \ncompany has continued his tradition of innovation, with the \nintroduction in the 1950s of rooftop systems for skyscrapers \neliminating the need for large and costly basement rooms. Today, \nCarrier Corporation is an industry leader in environmental \nresponsibility, with chlorine-free alternative refrigerants in use \nacross its entire product line.\n  Dr. Willis H. Carrier used his creativity and entrepreneurship to \nchange the way we live and the way we work. We are fortunate to benefit \nfrom the contributions of this great New Yorker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6944-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6944-S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WE THE PEOPLE . . .

The Citizen \nand the Constitution program, the most extensive educational program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud to report that the class from Green River High School from \nGreen River represented the State of Wyoming in this national event. \nThese young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals and \nthrough their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding \nof the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  The fine students from Wyoming who were chosen to participate \ninclude: Jamie Adams, Ashley Andersen, Melissa Bassett, Kimberly \nBucheit, Michelle Edwards, Christina Gipson, Aaron Hayes, Daniel \nJohnson, Christopher Legerski, Michael Merkley, Nathaniel Steinhoff, \nEric Stewart, Julia Stuble, and Katherine Tolliver. I would also like \nto recognize their teacher, Dennis Johnson, who deserves much of the \ncredit for their success.\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\n  The 3-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the \nCongress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by high school \nstudents before a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The \nstudents' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the \njudges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to apply \ntheir constitutional knowledge.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . \n. program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students \nnationwide. The program provides students with a working knowledge of \nour Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic \ngovernment. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by \ndiscussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and \nby participating in other educational activities.\n  It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental \nideals of principles of our Government in the aftermath of the tragedy \non September 11. These are ideas that identify us as a people and bind \nus together as a nation. It is important for our next generation to \nunderstand these values and principles which we hold as standards in \nour endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  I would once again like to congratulate Dennis Johnson and the fine \nstudents from Green River High School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6945-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WARD F.

As you can surely imagine, basic living \nnecessities were quite scarce at times. After graduating from high \nschool, Ward decided to hitchhike, with only $2.67 in his pockets, to \nDetroit, where he would begin what would become a memorable journey.\n  While living in Detroit, Ward Correll mowed lawns to make ends meet \nuntil he could find a more permanent and stable job opportunity. But \nbefore this could happen, our Nation went to war in Korea. Throughout \nthe war, Ward served his country in the U.S. Army as part of an \nintelligence unit. After his time in the service came to an end, Ward \npacked up his bags and headed back to his old Kentucky home. Once back \nin Kentucky, he met his future bride-to-be and soulmate, Regina Tarter.\n  After discovering the woman of his dreams, Ward decided it was time \nto begin his life as a businessman. Ward let the words from the prayer \nby GEN Douglas MacArthur be his compass-``Lord, give me a son who will \nnot let his wishbone take the place of his backbone.'' With a lot of \nhard work, a little luck, and the occasional helping hand, Ward Correll \nturned that $2.67 into a business empire.\n  Today, his many business enterprises include Cumberland Shell Oil, \nInc. and Trade and Wind and Trade Way shopping centers in Somerset and \nMonticello. He is one of the top 10 jobbers in the Nation for Shell \nOil. Furthermore, he is a major stockholder in First Southern National \nBanks, where his son Jesse is the CEO. You often hear people talk about \nliving the American dream. Ward Correll skipped the talking part and \nmoved straight to the living.\n  Besides his unwavering dedication to country and capitalism, Ward \nCorrell has exemplified what it means to be a good Christian. He tithed \nthe first penny he ever made as a child and has continued this practice \neven to this very day. He firmly believes God has blessed him \nfinancially and that he has a moral obligation to those less fortunate \nindividuals whose pockets are as shallow as his once were. Throughout \nhis lifetime, Ward Correll has assisted the needy, providing them with \nclothes, shoes, dishes and flatware--items that he and his family once \nstruggled to possess.\n  Mr. President, I ask now that my fellow colleagues join me in \npraising Mr. Ward F. Correll for all that he has accomplished with his \nlife. He is a devoted father and husband, a veteran and patriot, and a \ntruly righteous man. He has worked tirelessly to make Kentucky and the \nUnited States of America a better place for us all to live. He is a \ntribute to the American spirit.\n  Finally, I would like to share with you, Mr. President, and my fellow \nSenators Mr. Correll's recipe for success. ``Apply the wisdom of what \nwise people have taught you during childhood to all you do; seek the \nadvice of wise people, especially those who have experienced failure \nand picked themselves up to become successful again; always do more \nthan what you are paid to do; empower yourself to be positive and say \nevery day `I feel happy, healthy and terrific and I can do all things \nthrough Christ who strengthens me.'

Mr. President, on July 2, 2002, a modern \nAmerican hero was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Her name is \nRuby Bradley, and she is the most decorated woman ever to serve in the \nU.S. military.\n  Ruby was an Army nurse stationed in Manila. On September 23, 1943, \nshe was captured by the Japanese Army. During her 3-year imprisonment, \nshe was known as a member of the Angels in Fatigues. This small group \nof nurses took it upon themselves to care for those within the camp. \nRuby assisted in 230 operations and delivered 13 babies while dropping \nto a weight of just over 80 pounds. She starved herself so the \nimprisoned children could eat, trusting that she would be able to cling \nto her own life.\n  On February 3, 1945, her faith paid off in the form of what she \ndescribed as ``the best Saturday night performance I'll ever see in my \nlife.'' American troops freed those who were being held captive, and \nRuby returned to her home in Spencer, WV, to a hero's parade. But \nRuby's military journey was not over.\n  Her sacrifice, generosity, and compassion took her to the Korean war, \nwhere she again found herself in the midst of grave danger. The Army \nsent a plane to retrieve Ruby, but she was the last person to board \nthat plane. After running from her ambulance just before it was blown \nup by enemy bombs, she loaded the sick and wounded. Once again, she \nreturned to Spencer as the honoree of a hero's parade.\n  In 1963, Ruby retired from the Army, having earned 34 medals and \ncitations, including the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star, in honor \nof her tenacious devotion to this Nation and all that we stand for.\n  I had the privilege of visiting Ruby in her home 3 years ago and \npresented her with replacement medals that had been lost over the \nyears. In this short time, it was obvious to me what an inspiration she \nwas to her family and community, and it was obvious why she was honored \nwith the rank of colonel by the Army. Ruby Bradley was a woman whose \nsoul knew no limits. Her heart had room for everyone, and she was not \nreluctant to assist those around her, no matter their age, race, or \ncondition.\n  Ruby once said, ``I just want to be remembered as an Army nurse.'' \nHer family can rest assured that she will be remembered as an Army \nnurse, one of the best this Nation has seen and will ever see. Her \ncourage in the midst of conflict serves as a shining example to those \naround her and will continue to be a beacon for bravery in the future \nfor West Virginia and for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6945-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6945-S6946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLETTER DECLARING THE TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF POWER TO THE VICE PRESIDENT \n                      OF THE UNITED STATES--PM 103\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 29, 2002, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received the following message from the President of the \nUnited States, together with accompanying papers; which was ordered to \nlie on the table:\n  Pursuant to the provisions of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States, the President of the\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\nUnited States, on June 29, 2002, transmitted the following message to \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate [Mr. Byrd].\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 29, 2002.\n     Hon.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to consolidate and \nimprove the trade adjustment assistance programs, to provide community-\nbased economic development assistance for trade-affected communities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Improvement Act of 2002.\n  You may ask why I am introducing this new bill now. After all, only \nabout a month ago the Senate passed the Trade Act of 2002, a bill which \nprominently features a landmark expansion and improvement of the \ncurrent Trade Adjustment Assistance program.\n  We all know that work on that trade bill is not yet complete. And I \ncontinue working diligently to get that bill through the conference \nprocess and on to the President's desk just as soon as possible.\n  Indeed, I am frustrated that so much time has been lost on this bill. \nFive weeks in the House as they worked through a very unusual process \nof appointing conferees. More time in the Senate while Republicans \nblocked efforts to get the bill to conference.\n  The TAA provisions in the trade bill that passed the Senate back in \nMay are solid and important. They represent a huge improvement over \ncurrent law. It is critical to remember, however, that they are the \nproduct of compromise, a compromise that was reached between Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate and with the Administration.\n  In my view, the Senate-passed TAA reforms represent a good first step \ntoward making TAA work for American workers. But we could do better. \nAnd we should do better.\n  That is why I am here introducing new TAA legislation today. I think \nAmerican workers should know that my commitment to improve TAA will not \nend after we pass the current trade bill.\n  This new bill includes a number of provisions not included in H.R. \n3009, the bill that passed the Senate. I would like to summarize a few \nof the most important new provisions now.\n  First, this bill makes training a full entitlement under TAA.\n  Under current law, TAA income support is an individual entitlement, \nbut the training entitlement is subject to a funding cap. When funds \nrun out, as they frequently do, workers cannot get the training to \nwhich they are entitled. In some cases, this results in denial of \nincome support as well.\n  While H.R. 3009 raises the funding cap in an attempt to eliminate \nfunding shortfalls for TAA training, I think this bill takes an even \nbetter approach. After all, TAA is fundamentally a retraining program. \nIt just makes sense to make the same commitment to fully fund training \nthat we already do to income support.\n  Second , this bill broadens the scope of eligibility to additional \ngroups of trade-impacted workers who were dropped from TAA in the \ncompromise language passed by the Senate. This includes, most \nimportantly, a much broader definition of secondary workers.\n  In particular, this bill includes full TAA eligibility for downstream \nsecondary workers, rather than limiting that eligibility to workers \nimpacted by NAFTA.\n  It also includes coverage for workers who provide services under \ncontract to trade-impacted firms and to truckers who may be adversely \naffected by the opening of the border to Mexican trucking services. In \nsum, this bill aims to make sure that every worker who loses his job as \na result of trade gets fair and equitable access to services under TAA.\n  Third, this bill creates an easy and efficient process for providing \nTAA benefits on an industry-wide rather than firm-by-firm basis. We all \nknow that there are industries in this country, like softwood lumber, \nsteel, and textiles, just to name a few, that are experiencing \ndeclining employment on a national basis as a direct consequence of \ntrade.\n  The bill addresses the problem two ways. In cases where an industry \nhas already demonstrated adverse trade effects in a section 201 or \n``safeguard'' investigation, the President must provide industry-wide \nTAA certification as part of the remedy.\n  It also requires the Secretary of Labor to use an industry-wide \napproach to certification in other industries when there is evidence \nthat trade-related worker displacements are national in scope.\n  Finally, we restore the 75 percent health care tax credit for TAA \nparticipants that was reduced to 70 percent in the compromise trade \nbill. We also give workers additional choices for obtaining health care \ncoverage.\n  Without strong and meaningful improvements in the TAA program, I \nthink we would not have seen the wide, bipartisan support for the \noverall trade bill that allowed it to pass the Senate by a vote of 66-\n30.\n  For that reason, I view the Senate-passed TAA bill as a floor for \nwhat can reasonably be agreed to in conference. I don't think that \nsomething weaker is going to get us to a majority when the Senate \nconsiders the conference report.\n  As I mentioned before, many of the provisions included in this new \nbill were dropped from the trade bill that recently passed the Senate \nas part of a bipartisan compromise. Many, if not all, of them fall \neasily within the scope of the upcoming conference.\n  While I plan to vigorously defend the Senate bill in conference, I \nwant to remind my colleagues in the House that the Senate bill already \nrepresents a bipartisan compromise, one worked out with the \nAdministration.\n  In passing the rule to go to conference, my colleagues in the House \nhave passed a bill that would completely gut the Senate-passed \nprovisions. For example: the restrictions on coverage for secondary \nworkers are so strict as to effectively eliminate coverage; the bill \nwould not cover shifts in production to non-NAFTA countries; and the \nhealth care benefits have been significantly weakened. They would cover \nmany fewer workers, for a shorter period of time, with reduced benefits \nthat may be of little use.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues in the House that efforts to weaken \nthe Senate bill will be met with equally strong efforts to strengthen \nit. It should come as no surprise that, if my House colleagues persist \nin trying to weaken TAA, I will feel obligated to raise some of the \nprovisions that were dropped in the Senate negotiations.\n  As I have said many times, I believe an improved TAA program is \ncritical to regaining public confidence in a liberal trade policy for \nour country. In future, I intend to keep working toward the goal of \nimproving TAA in every way available. I think this new bill points us \nin the right direction and I am pleased to be introducing it today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2738. A bill to provide for the reimbursement under the Medicaid \nprogram under title XIX of the Social Security Act of nursing \nfacilities that are located on an Indian reservation in the State of \nSouth Dakota and owned or operated by an Indian tribe or tribal \norganization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, South Dakota tribes are prevented from \ndeveloping elder care on their reservations due to a State imposed \nmoratorium on the construction or acquisition of additional nursing \nhome beds. This impasse has gone on for nearly a decade, much too long.\n  Today I am introducing legislation along with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Daschle, that will facilitate the development and \noperation of nursing facilities that are owned or operated by an Indian \ntribe or tribal organization on Indian reservations that are located in \nthe State of South Dakota. Additionally, the legislation will protect \nthe right of members of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\naccess health care provided by nursing facilities in the exercise of \nthose members' entitlement to medical assistance under the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The facts and information discussed during the Senate Indian Affairs \nJuly 10, 2002, Hearing on Elder Health Issues, confirms the need for \nthis legislation. The National Resource Center on Native American Aging \nat the University of North Dakota, NRCNAA, reports that there is a \n``greater level of need for personal assistance among the Native \nAmerican elders than in the general population''. Only 6.5 percent of \nthe Native American elders over 55 receive such services. This fact is \nespecially alarming in light of the fact that Indian elders are \naffected disproportionately by disability and poor health. For example, \nthe prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among American Indians and Alaska \nNatives age 65 and over, is 21.5 percent. This is nearly double the \nrate of 11 percent for the non-Hispanic white population, age 65 and \nover. Additionally, because of their rural isolation, poverty, and \nother barriers, reservation elders have little access to existing long \nterm care delivery mechanisms that may serve mainstream or urban \nelderly populations.\n  This legislation will reduce existing barriers and give South Dakota \ntribes, their tribal elders, and their families long-term care \nalternatives. This legislation will assist tribes in their goal of \nproviding their elders with care that preserves the individuals' \ndignity and health. I will continue to work closely with tribal leaders \nin South Dakota and Senator Daschle to address this critical problem \nfacing the Native American community. I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the South Dakota Tribal Nursing Facilities Act of 2002.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Johnson, in introducing the South Dakota Tribal Nursing \nFacilities Act of 2002. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, which will address the growing need for tribally-operated \nnursing homes on South Dakota's Indian reservations.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs recently held a hearing on the \ngrowing health concerns facing Native American elders throughout Indian \nCountry. Elderly Native Americans suffer from diabetes and other \ndebilitating illnesses at rates hundreds of times higher than the \ngeneral population. As more and more people live longer, it is \nnecessary to find new ways to provide them with the health care, \nsupport, and services they need to lead productive, dignified lives.\n  American Indian elders are well respected and play a strong, central \nrole in their communities. They are the storytellers, the historians, \nthe teachers, and the link between the younger generation and the past. \nUnfortunately, Native American elderly in need of nursing home or other \nlong-term care are forced to enter off-reservation facilities, or pay \nfor private care, which many cannot afford. In rural States like South \nDakota, many off-reservation facilities are hundreds of miles from the \nreservation, which places an increased burden on family members and \nioslated the elders who are housed there. Many families cannot afford \nto visit their parents or grandparents in these distant nursing homes, \nand the elders often die forgotten and alone. While these nursing homes \nprovide for the physical well-being, their spiritual health suffers.\n  There are only eleven tribally operated nursing home nationwide, and \nonly one in South Dakota, operated by the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. The \nNational Indian Council on Aging estimates that there are approximately \n165,000 American Indians elderly nationwide, with less than 700 tribal \nnursing home beds available. Tribal nursing homes will allow tribal \nelders to remain in their communities, surrounded by friends and loved \nones in their later years. In recent years, several South Dakota tribes \nhave expressed an interest in establishing nursing homes on their \nreservations to provide for their tribal elderly. However, the South \nDakota Legislature, in response to a surplus of nursing home beds and \ndwindling Medicaid funding, enacted a moratorium prohibiting the \nconstruction and licensing of new nursing homes.\n  While the moratorium does not apply to construction on Indian \nreservations in the State, the prohibition on licensing has the \nunfortunate effect of blocking access to a key and critical source of \nfunding for any tribally-operated nursing home, Medicaid. Federal law \nrequires that nursing homes be licensed by the State in which they are \nlocated to be eligible for reimbursement under Medicaid. The South \nDakota Tribal Nursing Facilities Act of 2002 will overcome this \nobstacle by authorizing Indian tribes to construct, operate and license \ntheir own nursing homes. This will level the playing field to afford an \nopportunity to tribal governments that is afforded already to States. \nIt is my hope this proposal will serve as a starting point so we can \nbegin to address the long-term health care needs of American Indians \nacross the country. I hope you will support our joint efforts\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lott, Mr. Domenici, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. \n        Helms):\n  S. 2739. A bill to provide for post-conviction DNA testing, to \nimprove competence and performance of prosecutors, defense counsel, and \ntrial judges handling State capital criminal cases, to ensure the \nquality of defense counsel in Federal capital cases, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the issue of the death penalty in our \ncountry continues to spark significant debate. The recent Supreme Court \ndecisions addressing capital punishment underscore the importance of \nthis issue to the American people. It is an issue that engenders great \npassion, both among its supporters and among its opponents. The \nAmerican people believe in the death penalty, especially for terrorists \nwho have killed thousands of Americans. And all of us agree that the \ndeath penalty must be imposed fairly and accurately.\n  I have stated on numerous occasions my views on the death penalty. It \nis the ultimate punishment and it should be reserved only for those \ndefendants who commit the most heinous of crimes. I am firmly convinced \nthat we must be vigilant in ensuring that capital punishment is meted \nout fairly against those truly guilty criminals. We cannot and should \nnot tolerate defects in the capital punishment system. No one can \ndisagree with this ultimate and solemn responsibility.\n  In the last decade, DNA testing has evolved as the most reliable \nforensic technique for identifying criminals when biological evidence \nis recovered. While DNA testing is now standard in pre-trial \ninvestigations today, the issue of post-conviction DNA testing has \nemerged in recent years as the technology for such testing has \nimproved. The integrity of our criminal justice system and in \nparticular, our death penalty system, can be enhanced with the \nappropriate use of DNA testing. No one disagrees with the fact that \npost-conviction DNA testing should be made available to defendants when \nit serves the ends of justice.\n  In addition to post-conviction DNA testing, every defendant in our \ncriminal justice system is afforded the guarantee by the 6th Amendment \nof our Constitution of competent and effective counsel. The Supreme \nCourt has enforced this right in numerous decisions in order to ensure \nthat all defendants are afforded the constitutional protections \nguaranteed to them.\n  Death penalty opponents argue that the system is broken and blame \nineffective assistance of counsel. Their own evidence, however, \nindicates that the system is not broken. To the contrary, a recent \nJustice Department study concluded that ``[i]n both Federal and large \nState courts, conviction rates were the same for defendants represented \nby publicly financed and private attorneys.'' (Caroline Wolf Harlow, \nDefense Counsel in Criminal Cases, Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nNovember 2000). Further, 34 out of 38 States with capital punishment \nhave adopted standards or have existing practices to ensure assignment \nof competent counsel. In my view, the appellate system and our habeas \nsystem, which was reformed in 1996, remain robust and entirely capable \nof identifying and rectifying instances of deficient representation or \nsubstantial error at the trial level.\n  We have all heard the horror stories of the attorney who fell asleep \nduring\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nhis client's trial and the attorney who showed up for trial \nintoxicated. Some opponents of the death penalty seek to portray these \nstories as ``par for the course.'' This view ignores the hundreds of \ncapital cases in which no flaw was found in the quality of legal \nrepresentation. It also ignores the hundreds of capital cases in which \ndefendants were either acquitted, or sentenced to a penalty less than \ndeath, many times the result of outstanding representation by defense \ncounsel. The truth is that in many cases prosecutors handling a capital \ncase are out-manned and outgunned by defense teams funded by a \ncombination of public and private sources.\n  The legislation I introduce today will ensure the integrity of our \ndeath penalty system. The Act addresses post-conviction DNA testing for \ndefendants, provides grants to States to fund state post-conviction DNA \ntesting programs, and creates new grant programs to train State \nprosecutors, defense counsel and judges to ensure that defendants \nreceive a fair capital trial.\n  First, the Act authorizes post-conviction DNA testing where a federal \ndefendant can show that the DNA test will establish his or her ``actual \ninnocence.'' There has been considerable debate about when a convicted \ndefendant should be entitled to post-conviction DNA testing. Under my \nproposal, when a defendant demonstrates that a favorable result would \nshow that he or she is actually innocent of the crime, the defendant \nwill be given access to DNA testing. Thus, DNA testing will not be \npermitted where such a test would only muddy the waters and be used by \nthe defendant to fuel a new and frivolous series of appeals. When a DNA \ntest shows that the defendant is actually innocent, then the Act \nauthorizes the defendant to file a motion for a new trial. Under the \nAct, DNA testing in capital cases will be prioritized and conducted on \na ``fast track,'' so that these important cases are handled quickly.\n  Second, in order to discourage a flood of baseless claims, the Act \nauthorizes the prosecution of defendants who make false claims of \ninnocence in support of a DNA testing request. Each defendant will be \nrequired to assert under penalty of perjury that they are, in fact, \ninnocent of the crime. When DNA testing reveals that the defendant's \nclaim of innocence was actually false, the defendant can then be \nprosecuted for perjury, contempt or false statements. Further, the Act \nallows DNA test results to be entered into the CODIS database and \ncompared against unsolved crimes. If the test result shows that the \ndefendant committed another crime, the defendant may then be prosecuted \nfor the other crime.\n  Third, with respect to State defendants, the Act encourages States to \ncreate similar DNA testing procedures, and provides funding assistance \nto those States that implement DNA testing programs. Twenty-five of 38 \nStates which have capital punishment already have enacted post-\nconviction DNA testing programs, and 6 States have pending legislation \nto create such a program. With the new source of funding, more States \nwill enact DNA testing programs, and will provide such testing on an \nexpedited basis.\n  Fourth, in order to improve the fairness and accuracy of state \ncapital trials, the Act creates grant programs to train defense \ncounsel, prosecutors and trial judges to ensure fair capital trials. \nWhile I do not believe that the system is broken, I do believe that our \njustice system can always be improved. The grants proposed under the \nAct will enable States to send prosecutors, defense counsel and trial \njudges to training programs to ensure that capital cases are handled \nmore efficiently and effectively, and that every capital defendant will \nreceive a fair trial under our justice system.\n  Starting in 2001 and continuing through this year, the Judiciary \nCommittee, has conducted a number of hearings to examine these \ndifficult issues relating to the death penalty system in our country. A \ncompeting proposal, S. 486, is now pending before the Committee. The \nalternative proposal would open the floodgates to frivolous litigation \nby allowing convicted Federal and State defendants to obtain post-\nconviction DNA testing even when they have never previously claimed \nthey were innocent of the crime. Second, the alternative proposal \ntramples on the concept of federalism by stretching the 14th Amendment \nto mandate DNA testing and evidence preservation requirements on the \nStates. Third, the alternative proposal would strip state courts of \ntheir traditional power to appoint counsel to represent indigent \ndefendants; require states to comply with federally-mandated \nrequirements for assignment of competent counsel; and fund new private \ncapital resource litigation centers. Fourth, the alternative bill \nthreatens to reduce valuable Byrne grants to State law enforcement \nagencies which are needed to fight crime in our local communities. \nFinally, the alternative bill would authorize a flood of private suits \nto enforce a set of new federal mandates on each of the states.\n  My bill will further our nation's commitment to justice, ensure that \nour country has a fair death penalty system, and protect the \nsovereignty of states from burdensome and unnecessary federal \nassertions of power.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in promptly passing \nthis important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2741. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nprocedures for the determination of the inability of veterans to defray \nexpenses of necessary medical care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress a problem in the way the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \ndetermines a veteran's eligibility category for health care, which \nresults in an unfair misclassification of many veterans who are \nfarmers. Veterans who do not have a service-connected disability but \nwho are unable to defray the cost of necessary health care are placed \nin priority group 5 and are able to receive health care services from \nthe VA at no cost to the veteran. In order to determine whether a \nveteran falls below the means test threshold and is thus eligible to \nenroll in priority group 5, the VA looks at the net worth of a \nveteran's estate, including any real property owned by the veteran or \nthe veteran's spouse. When you add in the value of farm land, the net \nworth of many farmer-veterans can appear high on paper even though they \nmay in fact have little or no income.\n  The current means test threshold for net worth is set at $80,000. \nGiven the current average value of farm land in Iowa of $1,857, a farm \nin Iowa worth $80,000 would average a barely viable 44 acres. A more \nviable 80 acre farm would be worth $148,560 on average. In other words, \nalmost any Iowa farm large enough to be viable would exceed the current \nmeans test threshold.\n  Under the current law, when the value of a veteran's estate exceeds \nthe means test threshold, the veteran becomes ineligible to enroll in \npriority group 5 if the VA determines that ``it is reasonable that some \npart of the corpus of such estates be consumed for the veteran's \nmaintenance.'' I don't think it is ever ``reasonable'' that a veteran, \nwho has little or no income or other assets, be asked to sell a portion \nof his family farm in order to pay his medical bills. Nevertheless, \nbecause of the way the law currently reads, these land-rich but cash-\npoor veterans are often placed in priority group 7, meaning they may \nonly enroll in VA health care if they agree to pay co-payments to the \nVA and then only on a space-available and funds-available basis.\n  This problem was first brought to my attention by one of my \nconstituents, Larry Sundall, who is a county veterans service officer \nin Emmet County, IA. In response, I convened a meeting in Des Moines in \nApril of 2000, which was attended by county veterans service officers \nand State veterans affairs officers from Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and \nSouth Dakota as well as VA staff. I heard many similar stories about \nlow-income veterans who were in the same boat. In September of that \nyear, I introduced legislation to fix this problem by excluding the \nvalue of real property from the calculation of\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\nthe net worth of a veteran's estate in determining a veteran's \neligibility category for health care.\n  Unfortunately, my bill was not acted on before the end of the 106th \nCongress. In the first session of the 107th Congress, an unsuccessful \nattempt was made to address this issue in the context of legislation to \nmake improvements to various veterans' programs. I am now reintroducing \nmy legislation in hopes of fixing this problem once and for all.\n  In addition, my bill makes some adjustments to the way the VA \ndetermines the attributable income of a veteran that will make the \nprocess easier for both the VA and the veteran. The VA currently has \nthe authority to verify a veteran's income using a quick and efficient \ncomputer process that matches VA records with data from the IRS and \nother Federal agencies. However, the data for the prior year is often \nunavailable making it impossible for the VA to perform this income \nverification for the majority of veterans at the time when the data is \nneeded. My bill would allow the VA to use the data available for the \nyear preceding the previous year to determine the attributable income \nof a veteran. This would not only help the VA to more easily and more \naccurately determine a veteran's income, it would also allow a veteran \nto check a box to let the VA use this procedure to gather the veteran's \nincome data without the veteran having to dig through his financial \nrecords and fill out the information on a form. It can be frustrating \nfor a veteran to have to fill out the paperwork necessary to apply for \nbenefits and this change would make the application process easier for \nboth the veteran and the VA.\n  My bill would correct a fundamental unfairness that adversely affects \nveterans who are farmers while making the application process for \nhealth benefits simpler for veterans and more efficient for the VA. In \nfact, taken together, these important reforms would actually save \ntaxpayer dollars. According to data provided to me by the VA, over $8.7 \nmillion would be saved in fiscal year 2003 alone. This legislation is a \nwin-win proposition and I would urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the swift passage of this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. IMPROVEMENT OF PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINATION OF \n                   INABILITY TO DEFRAY EXPENSES OF NECESSARY \n                   MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Certain Assets From Attributable Income \n     and Corpus of Estates.--Subsection (f) of section 1722 of \n     title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period at the \n     end the following: ``, except that such income shall not \n     include the value of any real property of the veteran or the \n     veteran's spouse or dependent children, if any, or any income \n     of the veteran's dependent children, if any''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the estates'' and all \n     that follows and inserting ``the estate of the veteran's \n     spouse, if any, but does not include any real property of the \n     veteran, the veteran's spouse, or any dependent children of \n     the veteran, nor any income of dependent children of the \n     veteran.''.\n       (b) Alternative Year for Determination of Attributable \n     Income.--That section is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) For purposes of determining the attributable income \n     of a veteran under this section, the Secretary may determine \n     the attributable income of the veteran for the year preceding \n     the previous year, rather than for the previous year, if the \n     Secretary finds that available data do not permit a timely \n     determination of the attributable income of the veteran for \n     the previous year for such purposes.''.\n       (c) Use of Income Information From Certain Other Federal \n     Agencies.--Section 5317 of that title is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n     (g) and (h), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection (f):\n       ``(f) In addition to any other activities under this \n     section, the Secretary may utilize income information \n     obtained under this section from the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services or the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n     purpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran \n     under section 1722 of this title, in lieu of obtaining income \n     information directly from the veteran for that purpose.''.\n       (d) Permanent Authority To Obtain Information.--(1) Section \n     5317 of that title, as amended by subsection (c), is further \n     amended by striking subsection (h).\n       (2) Section 6103(l)(7)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(7)(D)) is amended in the flush matter \n     at the end by striking the second sentence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Murkowski and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2742. A bill to establish new nonimmigrant classes for border \ncommuter students; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, in introducing legislation to make part-time \ncommuter students who are nationals of either Canada or Mexico and \nattend school in the United States eligible for student visas.\n  Thousands of Canadian nationals commute to attend schools part time \nin the United States and hundreds of these part-time students commute \nto schools in Michigan. Between 35 and 40 part-time Canadian students \nattend Baker College, in Port Huron, MI, each semester. And more than \n400 Canadian students plan to attend Wayne State University in Detroit \npart time this fall alone. Other schools in Michigan, including Lake \nSuperior State University in Sault Saint Marie, also have a number of \npart-time Canadian students. Unfortunately, current law does not \nestablish an appropriate visa for these part-time commuter students.\n  Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, aliens who reside in a \nforeign country and are pursuing a full course of study from a \nrecognized vocational institution or an established college, \nuniversity, or other academic institution in the United States are \neligible for student visas. For purposes of granting student visas, the \nINS defines ``full course of study'' as 12 credits or more. Part-time \ncommuter students, those who might be only taking a class or two, are \nnot currently eligible for student visas.\n  However, some INS district offices have permitted part-time commuter \nstudents to enter the United States as visitors to pursue their \nstudies. However, the INS recently announced its intention to eliminate \nthis practice and enforce the full time, 12 credit hour requirement.\n  I agree with the INS that we need to tighten up enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. However, achieving this goal does not mean that we \nhave to prohibit all part-time commuter students from attending classes \nat schools in the United States. But absent a legislative remedy, that \nis exactly what will happen. Fortunately, the agency recently postponed \nenforcement of the policy until August 15, 2002, while administrative \nand legislative remedies are considered. The legislation we are \nintroducing today appropriately addresses the problem facing part-time \ncommuter students without opening new avenues for illegal immigration.\n  Our bill would amend 18 U.S.C. 1101 to make certain part-time \ncommuter students eligible for student visas. The bill would allow \nnationals of Canada or Mexico who both maintain a residence and a place \nof abode in their country or nationality and who commute to school to \nenroll part time in schools in the United States. Part-time commuter \nstudent visas are restricted to nationals of Canada or Mexico. Our bill \nwould not make political asylees, residents, or others who are \nnationals of third countries but simply live in Canada or Mexico \neligible for the visas.\n  The legislation also enhances national security by ensuring that \npart-time commuter students are tracked through SEVIS, the Student and \nExchange Visitor Information System. SEVIS was set up to make the \nFederal Government aware of changes in a foreign student's status that \ncould affect their eligibility to remain in the United States. The \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act passed by the Senate \nin April and signed into law by the President on May 14, 2002, paved \nthe way for full implementation of SEVIS. Certain schools began \nparticipating in a SEVIS this month and participation is mandatory by \nJanuary 30, 2003. However, SEVIS only tracks nonimmigrant students and \nexchange visitors. Aliens admitted with visitor visas are not tracked \nthrough the system. Our bill will, for the first time, ensure that \npart-time commuter students from\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\nCanada and Mexico are tracked through SEVIS.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is not only \nan improvement on current INS policy with regards to part-time commuter \nstudents but it closes an important loophole in INS's student tracking \nsystem. I am pleased to join Senator Hutchinson in introducing the bill \nand I look forward to seeing it pass the 107th Congress.\n\n\n                  Border Commuter Student Act of 2002\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am joining today with Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison to introduce the Border Commuter Student Act of 2002.\n  In my State and many other States along our borders, Canadian and \nMexican students take advantage of our excellent community colleges and \nvocational schools. For many years, this system has worked well, \nproviding economic benefits to the schools and to the surrounding \ncommunities while also helping Mexican and Canadian students to benefit \nfrom educational opportunities in this country.\n  Unfortunately, despite the fact that this is a system that has worked \nwell for both Canadian students and the local communities the \nImmigration and Naturalization, INS, recently decided to begin \nenforcing a 50-year-old law that prohibits those students from \nattending U.S. schools on a part-time basis. As of August 15, students \nwill no longer be allowed to cross the Canadian border to attend \nclasses at Bellingham Technical College. This will result in a \nsignificant loss of funds for Bellingham Technical College and the \nsurrounding community in Whatcom County which is already suffering from \nseverely reduced border traffic in the wake of September 11 and the \neconomic downturn in the State as a whole.\n  They will not be allowed to cross the border to attend El Paso \nCommunity College, D'Youville College in Buffalo, or Wayne State \nUniversity in Detroit.\n  In my home State of Washington, Bellingham Technical College \ncurrently has many part-time students who commute from Canada, the vast \nmajority of whom are enrolled in nursing, surgical technology, and \ndental assistant training programs. This action is being taken at the \nsame time we are facing a devastating shortage of nurses and other \nhealth care professionals both in the United States and in Canada.\n  This bill will address this issue by creating a new category for \nstudents who do not intend to immigrate to this country. It will be \nlimited to Canadian and Mexican commuter students residing in their \nhome country and attending school on a full- or part-time basis at \nschools in many of our border States. In order to qualify for this \nvisa, students will have to prove that they are who they say they are, \nand will be subjected to more strict requirements than Canadian \nvisitors entering the U.S. for pleasure.\n  Our educational system is the best in the world, and the INS decision \nto terminate a system that has been extending that educational \nopportunity to those who live adjacent to our borders and that has been \nproviding economic benefit to my State and many other States, is the \nwrong policy. With the introduction of this legislation today, we will \naddress this problem and allow a system that has been working to \ncontinue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Border Commuter Student \nAct of 2002.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hutchison for her leadership on the \nbill and look forward to working with her and my other colleagues to \npass this important legislation\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCAIN):\n  S. 2743. A bill to approve the settlement of the water rights claims \nof the Zuni Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \nintroducing legislation today that would codify the settlement of the \nZuni Indian Tribe's water rights for its religious lands in \nnortheastern Arizona. Congress first recognized the importance of these \nlands in 1984 when it created the Zuni Heaven Reservation, Pub. L. No. \n98-498, as amended by Pub. L. No. 101-486, 1990. The small communities \nupstream from this Reservation have been fully-appropriated, they have \nhad more would-be water users than water, for nearly a century. The \nprospect of dividing this limited water with yet another user created \ngreat uncertainty. To resolve that uncertainty and to avoid expensive \nand protracted litigation, the Zuni Tribe, the United States on behalf \nof the Zuni Tribe, the State of Arizona, including the Arizona Game and \nFish Commission, the Arizona State Land Department, and the Arizona \nState Parks Board, and the major water users in this area of Arizona \nnegotiated for many years to produce a settlement that is acceptable to \nall parties.\n  This bill would provide the Zuni Tribe with the resources and \nprotections necessary to acquire water rights from willing sellers and \nto restore and protect the wetland environment that previously existed \non the Reservation. In return, the Zuni Tribe would waive its claims in \nthe Little Colorado River Adjudication. In addition, the Zuni Tribe \nwould, among other things, grandfather existing water uses and waive \nclaims against many future water uses in the Little Colorado River \nbasin. In summary, with this bill, the Zuni Tribe can achieve its needs \nfor the Zuni Heaven Reservation while avoiding a disruption to local \nwater users and industry. Furthermore, the United States can avoid \nlitigating water rights and damage claims and satisfy its trust \nresponsibilities to the Tribe regarding water for the Reservation. The \nparties have worked many years to reach consensus and I believe this \nbill would produce a fair result to all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2744. A bill to establish the National Aviation Heritage Area, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and fellow \nOhioan, Senator Voinovich, to introduce a bill that would establish a \nNational Aviation Heritage Area within our home state of Ohio.\n  The year 2003 represents the 100th anniversary of manned flight. On \nDecember 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright, who are native Ohioans, \ninvented controlled, heavier-than-air flight. This was the first step \nin the century-long progression of flight. The Wright Brothers' \nsuccessful design and the science behind it were the forerunners to our \nmodern airplanes and space vehicles.\n  There is obvious historical and cultural significance to the birth of \naviation, and one of the unique educational aspects of aviation is the \nopportunity we can give children to interact with the subject outside \nof the classroom. This is why I am proud today to be introducing the \nNational Aviation Heritage Area Act.\n  Our bill seeks to foster strong public and private investments in \naviation landmarks. Some of these landmarks include the Wright \nBrother's Wright Cycle Company, located in Dayton, OH; the National \nAviation Hall of Fame; the Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center, where \nstudents of all ages can learn about the painstaking measures the \nWright Brothers and many of their predecessors took to fly; and the \nHuffman Prairie Flying Field, where the Brothers perfected the design \nof the world's first airplane. Listed in the bill are several other \nimportant aviation sites that may be added into the Heritage Area at a \nlater date, such as the NASA-Glenn Research Facility and the Captain \nEdward V. Rickenbacher House.\n  Mr. President, flight has become another important square in the \npatchwork of our nation's history. We are reminded of this every time \nwe look skyward and see the crisscross of jet contrails. We are \nreminded of this every time we walk through the Rotunda of our very own \nU.S. Capitol and see the last frieze square that depicts the invention \nof flight by the Wright Brothers. And, we are reminded of this by one \nof the symbols of America, the eagle, a flying bird that represents the \nfreedom of a people.\n  It is vital that we protect the sites that have played such an \nimportant role in aviation. Doing so, we can enhance the education and \nenrichment of our children and our grandchildren for many years to \ncome.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                TITLE I--NATIONAL AVIATION HERITAGE AREA\n\n     SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Aviation Heritage \n     Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Few technological advances have transformed the world \n     or our Nation's economy, society, culture, and national \n     character as the development of powered flight.\n       (2) The industrial, cultural, and natural heritage legacies \n     of the aviation and aerospace industry in the State of Ohio \n     are nationally significant.\n       (3) Dayton, Ohio, and other defined areas where the \n     development of the airplane and aerospace technology \n     established our Nation's leadership in both civil and \n     military aeronautics and astronautics set the foundation for \n     the 20th Century to be an American Century.\n       (4) Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, is the \n     birthplace, the home, and an integral part of the future of \n     aerospace.\n       (5) The economic strength of our Nation is connected \n     integrally to the vitality of the aviation and aerospace \n     industry, which is responsible for an estimated 11,200,000 \n     American jobs.\n       (6) The industrial and cultural heritage of the aviation \n     and aerospace industry in the State of Ohio includes the \n     social history and living cultural traditions of several \n     generations.\n       (7) The Department of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting and interpreting the Nation's cultural and \n     historic resources, and there are significant examples of \n     these resources within Ohio to merit the involvement of the \n     Federal Government to develop programs and projects in \n     cooperation with the Aviation Heritage Foundation, \n     Incorporated, the State of Ohio, and other local and \n     governmental entities to adequately conserve, protect, and \n     interpret this heritage for the educational and recreational \n     benefit of this and future generations of Americans, while \n     providing opportunities for education and revitalization.\n       (8) Since the enactment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage \n     Preservation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-419), partnerships \n     among the Federal, State, and local governments and the \n     private sector have greatly assisted the development and \n     preservation of the historic aviation resources in the Miami \n     Valley.\n       (9) An aviation heritage area centered in Southwest Ohio is \n     a suitable and feasible management option to increase \n     collaboration, promote heritage tourism, and build on the \n     established partnerships among Ohio's historic aviation \n     resources and related sites.\n       (10) A critical level of collaboration among the historic \n     aviation resources in Southwest Ohio cannot be achieved \n     without a congressionally established national heritage area \n     and the support of the National Park Service and other \n     Federal agencies which own significant historic aviation-\n     related sites in Ohio.\n       (11) The Aviation Heritage Foundation, Incorporated, would \n     be an appropriate management entity to oversee the \n     development of the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       (12) Five National Park Service and Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage Commission studies and planning documents ``Study of \n     Alternatives: Dayton's Aviation Heritage'', ``Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage National Historical Park Suitability/Feasibility \n     Study'', ``Dayton Aviation Heritage General Management \n     Plan'', ``Dayton Historic Resources Preservation and \n     Development Plan'', and Heritage Area Concept Study (in \n     progress) demonstrated that sufficient historical resources \n     exist to establish the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       (13) With the advent of the 100th anniversary of the first \n     powered flight in 2003, it is recognized that the \n     preservation of properties nationally significant in the \n     history of aviation is an important goal for the future \n     education of Americans.\n       (14) Local governments, the State of Ohio, and private \n     sector interests have embraced the heritage area concept and \n     desire to enter into a partnership with the Federal \n     Government to preserve, protect, and develop the Heritage \n     Area for public benefit.\n       (15) The National Aviation Heritage Area would complement \n     and enhance the aviation-related resources within the \n     National Park Service, especially the Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage National Historical Park, Ohio, and the Wright \n     Brothers National Memorial, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish the \n     Heritage Area to--\n       (1) encourage and facilitate collaboration among the \n     facilities, sites, organizations, governmental entities, and \n     educational institutions within the Heritage Area to promote \n     heritage tourism and to develop educational and cultural \n     programs for the public;\n       (2) preserve and interpret for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of present and future generations the \n     unique and significant contributions to our national heritage \n     of certain historic and cultural lands, structures, \n     facilities, and sites within the National Aviation Heritage \n     Area;\n       (3) encourage within the National Aviation Heritage Area a \n     broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality \n     of life for present and future generations;\n       (4) provide a management framework to assist the State of \n     Ohio, its political subdivisions, other areas, and private \n     organizations, or combinations thereof, in preparing and \n     implementing an integrated Management Plan to conserve their \n     aviation heritage and in developing policies and programs \n     that will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, \n     historical, natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the \n     Heritage Area; and\n       (5) authorize the Secretary to provide financial and \n     technical assistance to the State of Ohio, its political \n     subdivisions, and private organizations, or combinations \n     thereof, in preparing and implementing the private Management \n     Plan.\n\n     SEC. 103.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain lands in Utah; \nto the\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \nintroduce for the Senate's consideration legislation that will benefit \nthe school children of Utah and improve the management of the public \nlands within Utah. This legislation closely follows two previous \nlegislated land exchanges, the ``Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of \n1998'' and the ``Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000''. Each of \nthese past exchanges has enabled the Federal Government to consolidate \nlands in Utah with significant resource value while the State of Utah \nhas accumulated lands of lesser environmental significance, but with \nhigher revenue generating potential. The Federal-Utah State Trust Lands \nConsolidation Act will only add to the successes earned through the \nlast two land exchanges.\n  The Utah Enabling Act of 1894 granted to the State four sections, \neach section approximately 640 acres in size, in each 36 square-mile \ntownship. These lands were granted for the support of the public \nschools, and thus are referred to a school trust lands. Accordingly, \nthe School and Institutional trust Lands Administration, SITLA, is \nrequired by law to generate revenue in accordance with its mission from \napproximately 3.5 million acres of widely dispersed land. The location \nof these lands, as they are not contiguous to each other, has made \nmanagement by the State difficult. In addition, as school trust lands \nare interspersed with Federal lands, Federal land designations, such as \nwilderness study areas, national monuments, and national parks, have \nfurther complicated the state's ability to fully carry out its trust \nresponsibility to its public schools.\n  The legislation I propose today will ratify an agreement signed by \nthe State of Utah, the Department of the Interior, and the Department \nof Agriculture. Under the agreement the Federal Government will receive \n108, 284 acres from SITLA while the Federal government will transfer to \nSITLA approximately 133,000 acres of federal lands. SITLA will exchange \nproperty with significant resource values including inholdings in the \nManti-La Sal National Forest, the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve, and most \nimportantly 102,000 acres in the San Rafael Swell. The San Rafael Swell \nis one of the most remarkable areas in the county. It is 900 square \nmiles of rugged terrain sprinkled with amazing mesas, buttes, and \ncanyons. The San Rafael Swell also contains significant natural, \nhistorical, and cultural resources and it is home to an important \npopulation of desert bighorn sheep. Furthermore, over the yeas the San \nRafael Swell has been proposed to be designated as wilderness, a \nnational conservation area, a heritage area, and a national monument. \nIt is widely agreed that this area deserves special recognition. \nBecause of the proposed designations and the overall importance of the \nSan Rafael Swell, sizable school trust inholdings are not advisable; \nboth the State and Federal Government would be better served by \nconsolidated ownership.\n  The majority of the lands acquired by the SITLA are in the Uinta \nBasin, which will compliment current SITLA holdings. These lands are \nless environmentally sensitive but have good potential for development \nin the future, thereby allowing the State to maintain its trust \nresponsibilities. Additional properties will be acquired in Emery, \nWashington, Sevier, and Utah counties.\n  During negotiations between the State of Utah and the Federal \nGovernment great care was taken to exclude from exchange Federal lands \ndesignated as wilderness study areas, areas proposed for wilderness \ndesignations in pending Federal legislation, significant endangered \nspecies habitat, significant archaeological resources, areas of \ncritical environmental concern, or other lands known to raise \nsignificant environmental concerns of any kind. Additionally, the \nparties to this agreement expended substantial effort to ensure the \nvalue of the exchange was equal. To ensure the exchange was of \ncomparable value the parties obtained the services of a nationally \nrecognized real estate consultant who reviewed the methodologies and \nassumptions used to determine value. After completing a thorough \nreview, the consultant supported the parties' conclusion that the \nexchange was of equal value.\n  This legislation has the strong support of Utah's delegation, the \nUtah State Office of Education, and the Utah Parent Teacher \nAssociation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2746. A bill to establish a Federal Liaison on Homeland Security \nin each State, to provide coordination between the Department of \nHomeland Security and State and local first responders, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation to improve and streamline Federal \nsupport for first responders. Our proposal will also provide an avenue \nfor our first responders, our fire fighters, law enforcement, rescue, \nand emergency medical service, EMS, providers, to help Federal agencies \nand the new Department of Homeland Security improve and coordinate \nexisting programs and future initiatives.\n  The President has proposed a massive shift in the Federal Government \nby creating a new Department of Homeland Security. While Washington \nwill surely be shaken up by this restructuring, nobody will feel the \nimpact of this shift more than those on the front lines, our law \nenforcement, firefighters, rescue workers, EMS providers, and other \nfirst responders.\n  I am concerned that as the proposed Department of Homeland Security \nmoves forward, one of the most important functions has not received \nenough consideration, supporting first responders.\n  A recent editorial by Amy Smithson, the Director of the Chemical and \nBiological Nonproliferation Project at the Henry L. Stimson Center, \nwhich was published in the New York Times, illustrates that even \nwithout this massive re-organization, Washington must do a more \neffective job in targeting the resources to the training and equipment \nprograms that our communities need.\n  Ms. Smithson details how Washington has already shifted key training \nand equipment programs for firefighters, police, paramedics, and others \nfrom the Defense Department to the Justice Department and now on to the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency.\n  While these first responders are the most important people in any \nemergency, they received just $311 million of the more than $9.7 \nbillion in counter-terrorism spending in 2001.\n  While I commend the Administration for raising the funding dedicated \nto first responders for 2003 fiscal year to $5 billion, I share Ms. \nSmithson's concern that with the new layers of bureaucracy and \nreorganization, that number could shrink significantly.\n  Providing resources is not the only answer. These resources need to \nbe dedicated to those programs that meet the needs of the first \nresponders serving our communities.\n  The Federal agencies in the Department of Homeland Security must \nlisten to the priorities of our communities. After all, the needs of \nfirst responders vary between regions, as well as between rural and \nurban communities. In Wisconsin, I have heard needs ranging from \ntraining to equipment to more emergency personnel in the field, just to \nname a few.\n\n  We must listen to our law enforcement officials to identify which \nprograms most effectively help them protect our communities. We must \nlisten to our firefighters and fire chiefs to identify which programs \nmost effectively prevent and respond to disasters.\n  Once we have identified these programs and perceived needs, the \nFederal agencies under the New Department of Homeland Security must \ncoordinate their activities in an effective manner.\n  In the case of EMS providers, more than five Federal agencies \ncurrently support EMS services, but they lack coordination and the \nnecessary input from our local EMS providers. Earlier this year, \nCongress approved legislation, sponsored by the Senator from Maine and \nmyself, that would improve coordination between these services.\n  We must ensure that the agencies within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity promote this same kind of coordination and not fall into the \ntrap of five separate initiatives to address the same problem.\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\n  Our legislation, the First Responder Support Act will promote \neffective coordination among Federal agencies under the Department of \nHomeland Security and ensure that our first responders, our \nfirefighters, law enforcement, rescue, and EMS providers, can help \nFederal agencies and the new Department of Homeland Security improve \nexisting programs and future initiatives.\n  Our proposal establishes a Federal Liaison on Homeland Security in \neach State, to provide coordination between the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and State and local first responders. This office will serve \nnot only as an avenue to exchange ideas, but also as a resource to \nensure that the funding and programs are effective. For example, they \ncan help ensure that State and local priorities are matching up with \nthose set out at the new Department. They can also identify areas of \nHomeland Security in which the Federal and State or local role is \nduplicative and recommend ways to decrease or eliminate unneeded \nresources.\n  It would also direct the agencies within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to coordinate and prioritize their activities that support \nfirst responders, and at the same time, ensure effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  As part of this coordination, the First Responders Support Act \nestablishes a new advisory committee of those in the first responder \ncommunity to identify and streamline effective programs.\n  I am submitting this proposal in the hope that the Committee charged \nwith creating the new agency will consider it during their mark up of \nany legislation. I recognize, however, that this consideration does not \nprejudge which committee will be charged with oversight of this new \ndepartment.\n  We must be aggressive in seeking the advice of our first responders, \nand helping them to attain the resources that they need to provide \neffective services. They are on the front lines, and deserve our \nsupport. In almost any disaster, the local first providers and health \ncare providers play an indispensable role. If the Department of \nHomeland Security is to be effective, we need to ensure that the \nresources are delivered to the front line personnel in an effective and \ncoordinated manner. I urge my Colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis proposal and support our first responders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2748. A bill to authorize the formulation of State and regional \nemergency telehealth network testbeds and within the Department of \nDefense, a telehealth task force; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nEmergency Telemedical Communications Act of 2002 or NETCA. This bill \nwould take important steps to strengthen our Nation's ability to \nrespond to and manage biological, chemical, and nuclear terrorist \nattacks and other natural disasters.\n  Today, we live in a world forever changed by the September 11 attacks \non our country. These events exposed weaknesses in our homeland \ndefense; the anthrax attacks further showed how important it is to have \na strong public health system and what happens when such a system has \nbeen neglected.\n  My bill would help address both of these issues. It would authorize \ntwo regional telehealth test beds, linking local and state health \ndepartments with the CDC, academic, VA, and DoD medical centers, \nEmergency Medical Services, and other health entities. Additionally, \nthese efforts would be coordinated with local and State law \nenforcement, fire departments, and the National Guard. The system would \nthen be tested for its ability to gather information in real-time, send \ntimely alerts, and connect front-line responders with key support \npeople to prevent or assist in managing a crisis. For instance, in a \nsituation where there are mass casualties, an emergency room physician, \nwhile in the hospital, would be able to assist the emergency medical \ntechnician at the scene in triaging patients and directing where \npatients should be transported. They also would be able to participate \ndirectly in the treatment of patients in the field and not have to wait \nfor them to arrive at the hospital. In these situations, minutes mean \nlives; enactment of this legislation would save lives.\n  But this system would do more than allow for medical specialist-to-\npatient consultations; it would permit disaster experts hundreds or \neven thousands of miles away to view the disaster area and communicate \ndirectly with front-line responders. For example, in a ``dirty'' bomb \nexplosion, fire and rescue responders might not notice anything \ndifferent than expected based upon their training for response to \nexplosives. However, if their trucks and uniforms were equipped with \ndevices that recognized this radiation, not only would they be alerted, \nbut the information could be automatically relayed by the telehealth \nsystem to radiation experts who could then be ``brought'' to the scene \nto help direct the response and improve responder safety.\n  For such a system to work, everyone must be on the same page. This \nmeans the information being sent must be understood by all. We cannot \nhave one part of the system use medical terminology typical for one \nregion of the country, such as ``reactive airway disease'', and another \npart of the system using a different name, such as ``asthma.'' Thus, a \ncommon agreed upon language must be determined. Furthermore, each \nstatewide network must be connected in a seamless fashion so this \ninformation can pass through smoothly and without interruption. My bill \nwould create a task force of relevant experts from private and \ngovernment to solve both of these challenges and then use the test beds \nto evaluate their solutions.\n  In the end, I envision an intelligent system, capable of gathering \ninformation real-time and proactively connecting front-line responders \nwith key support people. It would provide timely alerts, crisis \nresponse, prevention, and prediction of medical and other dangers.\n  Ultimately, it is my hope that this project will lead to the \nformation of a secure National Emergency Telemedical Network. I am \nhappy to say that there is broad support for this legislation in the \ntelemedicine and information management communities, as well as in \nvarious State and Federal agencies. In particular, I am pleased that my \nbill has been endorsed by the American Telemedicine Association, the \nCenter for Telemedicine Law, the American Association of Medical \nColleges, the North Dakota Hospital Association, the North Dakota \nMedical Association, the North Dakota State Department of Health, the \nUniversity of Texas Health Sciences Center, the University of Tennessee \nHealth Sciences Center, and the Telemedicine Center of East Carolina \nUniversity. I am also pleased that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has \njoined me in this effort, and I urge my other colleagues to support \nthis important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2749. A bill to establish the Highlands Stewardshp area in the \nStates of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today along with Senator Torricelli, \nSchumer, Clinton, Dodd and Lieberman, I am introducing the Highlands \nStewardship Act of 2002. I am proud to be joining my colleagues from \nthe New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut delegations in the House of \nRepresentatives, who have introduced identical legislation in the \nHouse.\n  This legislation would help to preserve one of the last open space \ntreasures in this country, the Highlands forest region that stretches \nfrom northwestern Connecticut, across the lower Hudson River valley in \nNew York, through my State of New Jersey and into east-central \nPennsylvania. This region encompasses more than two million acres of \nforest, farms, streams, wetlands, lakes and reservoirs and historic \nsites. It includes the Green, Taconic and Notre Dame Mountains. It also \nincludes such historic sites as Morristown National Historic Park and \nWest Point.\n  The value of the ecological, recreational and scenic resources of the \nHighlands cannot be overstated. 170 million gallons are drawn from the\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\nHighlands aquifers daily, providing quality drinking water for over 11 \nmillion people. 247 threatened or endangered species live in the \nHighlands including the timber rattlesnake, wood turtle, red-shouldered \nhawk, barred owl, great blue heron and eastern wood rat. There also are \nmany fishing, hiking and boating recreation opportunities in the \nHighlands that are used by many of the one in twelve Americans who live \nwithin 2 hours of travel of the Highlands.\n  Unfortunately, much of Highlands is quickly vanishing. According to a \nstudy issued by the United States Department of Agriculture we lost \n3,400 acres of forest and 1,600 acres of farmland between 1995 and 2000 \nto development.\n  This legislation would designate a Stewardship Area amongst the four \nStates in order to protect the most important Highlands projects. It \nwould create a source of funding for conservation and preservation \nprojects in the Highlands to preserve and protect the open space that \nremains. $7 million a year for seven years would be provided for \nconservation assistance projects in the four Highlands states. This \nfunding could be used for items such as smart growth initiatives and \ncultural preservation projects. $25 million a year over ten years also \nwould be provided for open space preservation projects in the four \nHighlands states. The source of this funding would be the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation to ensure that we to protect \nthis resource, which is so critical to our quality of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord\n\n                                S. 2749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highlands Stewardship Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Con. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas on July 17, 1902, Dr. Willis H. Carrier submitted \n     designs to a printing plant in Brooklyn, New York, for \n     equipment to control temperature, humidity, ventilation, and \n     air quality, marking the birth of modern air conditioning;\n       Whereas air conditioning has become an integral technology \n     enabling the advancement of society through improvements to \n     the Nation's health and well-being, manufacturing processes, \n     building capacities, research, medical capabilities, food \n     preservation, art and historical conservation, and general \n     productivity and indoor comfort;\n       Whereas Dr. Carrier debuted air conditioning technology for \n     legislative activity in the House of Representatives Chamber \n     in 1928, and the Senate Chamber in 1929;\n       Whereas the air conditioning industry now totals \n     $36,000,000,000 on a global basis and employs more than \n     700,000 people in the United States; and\n       Whereas the year 2002 marks the 100th anniversary of modern \n     air conditioning: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress honors the invention of modern air \n     conditioning by Dr. Willis H. Carrier on the occasion of its \n     100th anniversary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 100th anniversary \nof the modern air conditioner, which was invented by Dr. Willis H. \nCarrier in 1902. I join with my colleague Senator Lieberman to submit a \nResolution honoring this achievement.\n  It was 100 years ago today that a 25 year old engineer named Willis \nCarrier, while trying to address a printing problem caused by heat and \nhumidity at the Sackett-Williams Lithographing\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nand Publishing Company of Brooklyn, developed a cooling solution which \nended up revolutionalizing the world we live in.\n  Dr. Carrier had grown up an only child, surrounded by a large \nextended family on a farm in Angola, NY. He worked three jobs during \nhis college years at Cornell to pay for his room and board, and showed \na work ethic and tirelessness that carried over into his career as a \nmechanical engineer. His first job after graduation was with the \nBuffalo Forge Company planning heating mechanisms for the drying of \ncoffee and lumber. It was soon after a promotion to head of the Forge \nCompany's department of experimental engineering that he made his \nbreakthrough with the control of heat and humidity for the Sackett-\nWilliams Company that led to modern air conditioning.\n  Several years later, he and six friends formed their own company in \nSyracuse, NY, Carrier, that now has current annual revenues of $9 \nbillion and clients in 170 countries. Indeed, not only has this company \ngrown over the past century, but the expanding role and impact of \nmodern air conditioning has been nothing short of tremendous. Air \nconditioning has afforded us such a dramatic improvement in quality of \nlife that it is difficult now to conceive of its absence. It has \nincreased our economic productivity and output, our comfort and our \nmood, and in some cases, our general health and welfare. Some have \nsuggested that air conditioning is even responsible for keeping \nWashington as our Nation's capital, when long, unbearable summer months \nnot only shortened the legislative session, but threatened to send \npoliticians looking for a more climatically hospitable city to conduct \ntheir business in. Dr. Carrier brought air-conditioning to the House \nChamber in 1928 and the Senate Chamber in 1929.\n  Indeed, on a 93 degree day such as today, I think we all see the \nspecial value of Dr. Carrier's life's work, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me remembering him today, and giving our thanks for modern air \nconditioner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/17/senate-section/article/S6960-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4299.
