Madam President, shortly, a unanimous consent request \nwill be made--and this is the third or fourth time--to pass S. 3009, \nthe Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, which I have \nintroduced with the Presiding Officer, who has done so much work on \nthis and Senator\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nKennedy and others. This is the third or fourth time, and every day we \nare going to be making this request.\n  To tell you the truth, I think it is absolutely unconscionable that \nthe Senate has not acted on this and that the Republican leadership, \neach time, has thrown up a roadblock to extending unemployment \nbenefits. Believe me, I would love nothing more than to be home \ncampaigning, but I don't think we should leave here without extending \nunemployment benefits.\n  In my State of Minnesota, there are 20,000 Minnesotans who have run \nout of unemployment benefits. Nationwide, there are about 900,000. I am \nsure many are in the State of New York, which the Chair represents. \nColleagues, these are men and women who are hard-working, who have lost \ntheir jobs. The economy is flat. We are in economic trouble as a \nnation. It would be nice if the administration would get serious about \nthe economy. How about a little bit of humanity?\n  In the early 1990s when we went through this, we didn't hesitate to \npass an extension of unemployment benefits under exactly the same \ncircumstances. I think each time we had more than 95 votes, Republicans \nand Democrats alike. These are people who are flat on their backs \nthrough no fault of their own. They have run out of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  There are two different issues here. One, if we don't extend it by \nthe end of December, some people who are receiving the current 13 weeks \nof benefits get cut off in the middle. I guess there is some discussion \nin the House with the Republican leadership about helping them. But the \nlarger question--and we must make sure they get full unemployment \nbenefits--is people who have just run out of all their unemployment \nbenefits. In Minnesota right now, twice as many people are looking for \njobs as there are jobs available.\n  I want to make the argument--and I don't have a lot of time--and it \nis a two- or threefold argument. First, I appeal to the humanity of \neverybody here. Just imagine--I don't know how many Senators have been \nout of work--when you have a family to support, unemployment benefits \nare a lifeline.\n  We have a trust fund, and we have more than enough money to support \nthis. We are not spending additional money out of general revenue.\n  How many Senators have been through this? If you are out of work and \nyou have run out of benefits, you cannot put food on the table. It is a \nterrifying situation. I think our common humanity dictates that we must \ndo this. Today, I want this unanimous consent agreement to be agreed \nto.\n  Second of all, from an economic point of view, although I think a \nhumanitarian appeal should be made, given a flat economy, you can count \non it, Senators, that people who get an extension of unemployment \nbenefits for an additional 13 weeks will be consuming because, believe \nme, they have to. They will be spending these dollars because they have \nto.\n  Right now, the problem is they don't have enough money to make ends \nmeet month by month. So, actually, you are injecting a much-needed \nstimulus into the economy. So if the first argument doesn't move your \nsoul--the humanitarian argument that this is the right thing to do for \npeople who are in real trouble through no fault of their own--how about \ndoing it for the economy?\n  My third argument is--I know we are debating the resolution on Iraq--\nbut I have said over and over, and I am sure the Chair has picked this \nup as well--I like to talk to the State legislature candidates because \ntheir methodology of campaigning for office, as opposed to when one is \ncampaigning statewide, is knocking on doors every day. They pound the \ndoors 3 or 4 hours every evening.\n  I ask them: What are you hearing? People are talking about how \nworried they are about the economy; some people are out of work; other \npeople are worried they will be. They are talking about health care, \nhealth care, health care, as though people have not heard it before. In \nour State, given all the cuts in education, they are talking about \neducation as well.\n  It is a false dichotomy. It is not as if people back home are worried \nabout the economy but are not worried about Iraq, or are not worried \nabout terrorists. They are worried about all of it, and all of us \nshould be worried about all of it.\n  I think the people I represent in Minnesota believe we are a great \nenough and a good enough country we can deal with our challenges in \ninternational affairs and, at the same time, we can deal with \nchallenges that affect people in our country and our local communities, \nour families.\n  I do not understand this false dichotomy where apparently the \nadministration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think \nwe cannot address any of these economic issues. Apparently, they think \nwe cannot focus on any domestic issues any longer; cannot even provide \nan extension of unemployment benefits to people. I believe some \ncolleagues do not want to do this because they feel it is an admission \nthe economy is not doing that well. The economy is not doing that well. \nWe should wake up and smell the coffee.\n  The people I represent are still waiting on the Federal Government to \nprovide the resources we said we were going to provide for schools, \neducation, and our kids. The House Republican leadership and the Senate \nRepublican leadership do not want to bring an appropriations bill out \nhere that deals with education. We could easily provide more funding \nfor Pell grants, making higher education not less but more accessible.\n  We certainly should provide more funding for special education which \nwould help all of our districts, and provide more funding for title I.\n  Again, the Republican leadership and the White House do not want \nanything to do with it. I am going to a press conference in a couple of \nminutes on--that sounds melodramatic, life or death; it is a bit like \nunemployment benefits--disaster relief. I have never been in the Senate \nwhen we have not provided disaster relief.\n  The people in northwest Minnesota are flooded out, they are gone, it \nis over for them, and this administration is opposed to this bill. I \nhave never voted against disaster relief in any part of the country. If \nsomething happens in New York, Madam President, I will vote for the \nmoney the people need. People do not ask for hurricanes, tornadoes, \nfire, and flooding, but if it should happen to the people in Minnesota, \nI ask you to support that.\n  Whatever happened to some sense of community? Whatever happened to \ncompassionate conservatism? Compassionate conservatism dictates, at the \nvery minimum, before we leave that the Senate pass this legislation I \nhave introduced to extend unemployment benefits. I will come out to the \nSenate Chamber and give enough speeches to deafen all the gods until \nthis is done. Frankly, I think on the other side of the aisle, \npeople should feel uneasy and uncomfortable in blocking this \nlegislation. They are putting up a roadblock to providing help to \npeople who really need the help.\n\n  This is the right thing to do. It is certainly profamily, it is \ncertainly prochildren, and it is certainly compassionate. I do not know \nwhat the delay is. Time is not neutral for a lot of people.\n  Madam President, by way of concluding--I know other colleagues are \ngoing to be out on the floor--I thank the Presiding Officer, since, as \nthe Presiding Officer, she cannot speak for herself, at least for this \nmoment--she does a good job speaking for herself, otherwise, all the \ntime. Madam President, you have been a leader in bringing this before \nthe Senate. I thank you for doing that.\n  We are not going to let up until this legislation is passed. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, we did not suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am going to be joined by Senator \nKennedy in just a moment. He will be making a request, and we will wait \nfor a response on the part of our colleague.\n  While I am waiting for Senator Kennedy, let me say again I think we \nhave a huge disconnect between some of what is going on in the Senate--\nor what is not going on in the Senate--and the people we represent.\n  In Minnesota--I do not know about other States--people in Minnesota \ncannot understand for the life of them what in the world is the delay \nin extending unemployment benefits. People in Minnesota do not know \nthat in\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\nthe early nineties we passed similar legislation and did it in a \nbipartisan way. They do not know there is plenty of precedent for it. \nAnd they do not know all about unanimous consent, and how one Senator \ncan object, and all of the rest.\n  What people do have in Minnesota is a sense of right and wrong. Let's \ntalk values for a moment. The values of people in Minnesota are when \nthe economy goes south--I know some of my colleagues do not like to \ntalk about the economy--when the economy is flat, and when so many \npeople have lost their jobs and are hurting, and their families are \nhurting, people in Minnesota believe we ought to reach out and help \nthem.\n  This legislation I have introduced, with the support of Senator \nKennedy and Senator Clinton, should pass today. I see my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, is in the Chamber. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10139-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10139-S10141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3009\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 619, S. 3009, a \nbill to provide for the extension of unemployment compensation; that \nthe bill be read the third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I had a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Minnesota when he propounded this \nrequest a couple days ago, and I asked the question if this was a \nsimple extension. I believe he said it was almost.\n  I have read the bill and have found it is not a simple extension. I \nask my colleague, has the bill changed? Is this a simple extension, a \n13-week extension of unemployment compensation for all States?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I can respond, this is not the Thomas bill which was \nextended the last time. This is the historic and the traditional \nlegislation that was passed three or four times in the early 1990s. \nThis is not the more restricted Thomas bill.\n  We are going back to the legislation that provides genuine \nprotections for unemployed workers. This legislation will affect close \nto 3 million workers who otherwise will see their unemployment \ninsurance expire by the end of this year and the early months of next \nyear.\n  The bill does not do all we believe ought to be done for part-time \nworkers who are contributing into the unemployment insurance fund, or \nlower-income workers, all of whom are participating and paying into the \ninsurance fund.\n  What we want to do with this legislation is say: We have a $27 \nbillion surplus. The workers have paid into the fund. We need $14 \nbillion of that so people can pay their mortgages, pay their health \ninsurance, and pay their bills. That is what this bill is, and that is \nwhat will happen when we pass it.\n  This bill has basically been supported by a strong editorial in the \nWashington Post.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I am trying to figure out \nwhat his bill will do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator had this request, and I hoped he would have \nhad a chance to look at and review it, because he is going to hear \nabout it every single day as long as the Senate is in.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That's fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If there is some way we can help clarify it, we are glad \nto do it. Last week when I was in the Chamber, along with the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, the Senator from New York, and the Senator from \nIllinois, who were fighting for it, we heard asked: Is this the same \nbill, or how is this different? We are glad to take the time, but the \ntime is going on. We will be glad to sit down with the Senator later on \ntoday and go over every bit of it and hopefully get the extension of \nit. We are troubled. We are troubled by the fact that even though the \nfirst President Bush effectively opposed it on two occasions, he did \nsupport it on the third, and had Republican support on the third \noccasion. We hope the good light that is shone--and the common sense \nand wisdom--on those Republicans and the President when he supported it \nthe third time will be shed on the Republican Senators and the Senator \nwill help us get this supported.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my colleague will yield for a question, I guess by \nthe length of the Senator's answer, it is not a clean extension. I am \nreading on page 4 of the Senator's bill a section entitled ``Adjusted \nInsured Unemployment Rate.''\n  Correct me if I am wrong, but this definition basically says people \nwho have exhausted unemployment compensation in the most recent 3 \ncalendar months, even if they subsequently get a job, are still counted \nas unemployed; is not that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would--only if they have been exhausted.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So the Senator's bill permits individuals who have \nexhausted their unemployment compensation, and then may have \nsubsequently found a job, to be counted in the unemployment figures, \naccording to this Adjusted Insured Unemployment Rate calculation on \npage 4?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are effectively using the trigger that had been used \nbefore, which gives the focus and attention on those who are both \nunemployed and those who have States which have a higher incidence of \nunemployment, and in those States, those figures would be added to the \nvaluation of the unemployed workers in an attempt to get a true reading \non the numbers of the unemployed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, it says:\n\n     . . . except that individuals exhausting their right to \n     regular compensation during the most recent 3 calendar months \n     for which data are available before the close of the period \n     for which such rate is being determined shall be taken into \n     account as if they were individuals filing claims for regular \n     compensation for each week during the period for which such \n     rate is being determined.\n\n  In other words, one could exhaust their unemployment compensation, \nand may or may not find another job in the following 3 months--they are \nstill going to be counted as unemployed according to this definition, \nwhich is really yielding a higher figure. I find that totally \nunacceptable. Maybe it was done in the 1990s, but that does not make it \nright. Surely we would want accurate unemployment compensation \nstatistics used in determining how many weeks would be available for \nadditional extended benefits. We want to do it right, and I am sure my \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Minnesota want to as well. This \nsection is not doing it right. This section alone does not make the \nbill a clean extension.\n\n  I will be happy to work with my colleagues, but this is not \nacceptable. So I want to point that out.\n  I want to make another point while I am considering whether I will \nobject to this. This one section is not acceptable. Also, I am finding, \nafter reading the proposal of my colleagues, instead of having a 13-\nweek extension, it is a 26-week extension for all States. That is very \nexpensive. I might ask my friend from Massachusetts, what is the \nestimated cost of this proposal?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To answer the question, this counts people who are \nunemployed and who have no benefits. Right now if someone is getting \nextended benefits, they are not counted. We count those people. That is \nthe principal difference. That was the difference in the early 1990s as \nwell, and that is what the Thomas bill did not do. That is what we do. \nWe think there is a sound reason for being able to do it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield, but first I will be glad to continue with \nmy friend if he is interested in trying to get the legislation passed. \nWe have not heard what the Senator is for. We know what he is against. \nHe is against this bill. If the Senator is saying he is for an \nextension on it, we are more than glad to try and work and see if \nsomething can be achieved, if that is what the position is. If the \nSenator's position is in opposition and continues to be in opposition, \nthen we are going to continue to press him. If his position is, yes, I \nwill support--would the Senator support the extension of the Thomas \nbill?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, and I asked a question first. \nI\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\nasked the Senator how much this would cost.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fourteen billion dollars.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Fourteen?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Now, if I could ask the Senator a question. Will he \nsupport the Thomas bill?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have not asked unanimous consent. We have an estimate \nfrom CBO, that their estimate is $17.1 billion. I realize this bill did \nnot come through committee. I realize this bill did not have a hearing. \nI realize this bill has not been vetted. I realize it was just \nintroduced last week and the Senator is trying to pass it by unanimous \nconsent. I have just had a chance to start reading the bill, and the \nmore I read it, I find out it is not 13 weeks, it is 26 weeks. I find \nout it has an Adjusted Insured Unemployment Rate provision, which says \nwe could potentially count some people under this definition who are \nworking. So this bill is not acceptable.\n  To answer my colleague, I may be willing to work with the Senator to \nfind a bill that is acceptable. Certainly, if we did something more \nalong the lines of a 13-week/6-month extension for all States, without \njimmying the figures, without using Adjusted Insured Unemployment \nRates, without establishing new triggers--since this bill uses \ndifferent triggers from current law that allows more States to qualify \nfor additional extended benefits--if we treat States the same, \nbasically do 13 weeks for 6 months, I might be willing to do that. I \nmight be willing to shop that with colleagues in the House, and the \nWhite House. I believe I heard last week or earlier this week, this is \nalmost a straight extension. The more I read, I find out this is not a \nstraight extension. This is a bill that costs--just as a comparison, \nthe straight six-month extension costs about $7.3 billion. Quickly \nestimated by CBO, this bill costs $17.1 billion. There is a big \ndifference.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I guess the time is moving on. As I understand it, the \nSenator has indicated he would not even support the Thomas proposal \nextension. Am I right?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I have not stated that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am trying to find out if we have any good faith in \nterms of trying to work something out. If the Senator is opposed to \nthat and opposed to this, he is opposed to everything. If he could say, \nI am for the Thomas proposal, but I am troubled by some of these \ntriggers--although I think they are rational--we are glad to sit down \nwith him.\n  Can the Senator think about that through the day and let us know?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There are others who want to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was on the floor last week, and the Senator from \nOklahoma came in and took a look at this bill, which is only a few \npages, and he said: I really need some time to read this.\n  I have watched the Senator from Oklahoma, and he reads very quickly. \nI cannot understand why, a week later, the Senator still needs to read \nthis.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, I suggest to the Senator from Oklahoma, I \nthink he has read it. I think he understands it. Certainly President \nBush's father understood it when three times in a recession he said we \ncannot leave these unemployed families in this terrible, perilous \nsituation. We have to extend unemployment benefits. It is a very basic \nconcept, supported by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, as \nwell as economists and business leaders in my State.\n  When I say to them, what can we do about this economy, they say give \nsome spending power to these poor people who are out of work. That is \npretty fundamental.\n  I want to give the Senator from Oklahoma all the time he needs, but a \nweek has passed. Is another week going to have to pass, or are we going \nto be able to come to a resolution and help these families, including \nover 100,000 people in my State of Illinois?\n  We have the fifth highest unemployment rate in the Nation. I think \nthis Congress can do something. It should do something. I want to give \nthe Senator from Oklahoma his opportunity, but I think a week is enough \nto read a seven-page bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, we want to work with him.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Can we have regular order in the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We have time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The regular order is a unanimous \nconsent request has been made. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The regular order is the Senator objects or does not \nobject. That is the regular order, so we are going on the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is right. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order. It either goes through or there is an \nobjection.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the regular order, the Senator may not \nreserve the right to object. He must either object or permit the \nrequest to be granted.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. He made a \nunanimous consent request. I objected. I sought recognition. He gave up \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not lose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedent, the Senator who made the \nunanimous consent request retains the floor, whether it is granted or \nnot.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am sincerely sorry we have not been \nable to work this out. Senators Wellstone and Durbin have indicated the \nsteps we are going to take to try to get the unemployment insurance. \nThis is no mystery. It is a seven-page bill. There were efforts or \nsuggestions about how we might be able to do this. We are certainly \nopen to try to do it.\n  What is unacceptable is not helping the number of Americans and \npeople who are hurting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is recognized at 10 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Oklahoma wishes to \nspeak, I have no problem, under your time, which comes later, and I \nstill maintain my 15 minutes.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to complete his remarks, I \nam happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will ask that my remaining remarks be included.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts is welcome to a few minutes \nof my time. I will use my 15 minutes when the Senator from Oklahoma \nfinishes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did my colleague from Massachusetts finish his comments?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had additional comments, but the Senator has been \nseeking recognition to explain his objection. I am happy to hear that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the gracious remarks of my \ncolleague from Nevada. On the bill presented to the Senate last week, \nit has not been marked up in the committee, has not been reported out \nof committee.\n  We have a preliminary analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, \nand the cost estimate is $17.1 billion in Fiscal Year 2003. On the \nfloor last week, it was estimated by proponents, the Senator from \nMinnesota, the cost was $10 to $12 to $13 billion. In other words, they \ndid not know. They are trying to pass it so quickly, they did not know \nhow much it would cost. It has not been studied.\n  This proposal is reportedly an extension of unemployment benefits, \nextending provisions that expire at the end of December. It was being \nportrayed as a 6 month extension. But when I looked at the details, I \nfound we are using completely different triggers, among other \ndifferences.\n  What does that mean for someone who does not follow this debate? It \nmeans more States qualify for more Federal benefits. There is currently \nan\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\nunemployment compensation program of up to 26 weeks financed by the \nState, then a Federally-funded Temporary Extended Unemployment \nCompensation of up to an additional 13 weeks, and finally up to another \n13 weeks for high unemployment states. By changing the trigger under \nthis new proposal, we are saying more stages are eligible for extended \nbenefits. We are saying benefits would be available in all states not \njust for 13 weeks but for 26 weeks, with some States even for an \nadditional 7 weeks. This is getting expensive. This new plan is $10 \nbillion more than a straight extension.\n  Someone said we did this in 1990. That may not be the right way to do \nit. I am willing to work with my colleagues to provide assistance for \nthose people in the States that really need help, but we ought to be \nvery accurate in our language and not try to push something through too \nquickly. We ought to be responsible. We have enormous deficits now. We \nshould try to do this in a fiscally responsible manner, so the bill can \nbe signed. I will work with my colleagues from Massachusetts, from \nMinnesota, and others to see if we can come up with a bill that is \naffordable and has bipartisan support.\n  At this stage, you have to have almost unanimous support. I will work \nwith my colleagues to see if we can come up with it. The bill before \nthe Senate, S. 3009, in my opinion, should not be passed. Maybe we can \ncome up with a straight 13-week extension as we have done previously in \nthe Senate. I will work with my colleagues and the Senator from Nevada \nto see if we can get something done. A straight extension would cost an \nestimated $7.3 billion instead of $17.1 billion. That is a possible.\n  This bill that would cost $17 billion and would rewrite unemployment \nfigures--I don't think that makes sense. Maybe we can work together and \nfind something that is acceptable. I appreciate the cooperation of my \ncolleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a preliminary CBO cost estimate \nprinted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to a number of requests for \n     information on the budgetary impact of S. 3009, the Emergency \n     Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, the Congressional \n     Budget Office has prepared an estimate of the cost of that \n     bill, as introduced on September 26, 2002.\n       S. 3009 would increase the number of weeks of Temporary \n     Emergency Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) available to \n     unemployed workers who exhaust their regular unemployment \n     benefits. Under current law, up to 13 weeks of TEUC benefits \n     are available in all states, with an additional 13 weeks \n     available in states with a high unemployment rate. The TEUC \n     program is scheduled to end on January 1, 2003, with no \n     benefits paid after that date. S. 3009 would increase the \n     number of weeks of TEUC benefits paid in all states to 26, \n     with an additional seven weeks available in states with high \n     unemployment. In addition, the bill would allow eligible \n     unemployed workers to begin to collect TEUC until July 1, \n     2003. Those receiving benefits by that date would be able to \n     collect benefits until October 14, 2003.\n       As shown in the following table, CBO estimates that \n     enactment of S. 3009 would increase direct spending by $17.1 \n     billion in fiscal year 2003. The effect over 10 years would \n     be smaller--$15.5 billion--because the increase in spending \n     on emergency benefits would eliminate anticipated transfers \n     over the 2009-2012 period from the federal accounts in the \n     unemployment trust fund to the state benefit accounts.\n       Revenues would increase by about $4.8 billion over the 10-\n     year period. CBO estimates that state employment tax \n     revenues, which are counted as federal receipts in the \n     unemployment trust fund, would rise both to pay for the \n     increase in regular unemployment compensation that would \n     result from enacting the bill, and to make up for the \n     reduction in revenues that states would otherwise have \n     received in the form of intergovernmental transfers. These \n     estimates assume that the bill will be enacted in October \n     2002.\n\n                                ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 3009, THE EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2002\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated Budget Authority................     17,100        400          0          0          0          0       -495       -505       -515       -525\nEstimated Outlays.........................     17,100        400          0          0          0          0       -495       -505       -515       -525\nEstiamted Revenues........................          0        230        330        330        270        230        250        560      1,080      1,540\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to discuss the very \nserious matter that is before us today and this week. This is, I trust, \ngoing to be a very somber discussion as we had approximately 11 years \nago when this body approved the actions which led to Desert Storm. \nUnfortunately, at that time we did not solve the problems confronting \nus as a result of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime in Iraq.\n  As we move toward a resolution authorizing the use of force against \nthe threat posed by Saddam Hussein, let us be clear about the intent. \nThis resolution we will send a clear message to the world community and \nto the Iraqi regime that the demands of the United Nations Security \nCouncil must be followed. Saddam Hussein must be disarmed.\n  For over a decade now we have tried every means of diplomacy, \nsanctions, and inspections to encourage Saddam to keep the promises \nthat he made after the gulf war. Nothing has worked. Saddam has made a \nmockery of the United Nations resolutions and the threat he now poses \nto the world is significant and growing.\n  President Bush stated last night that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein \nis a ``murderous tyrant'' who could attack the United States ``on any \ngiven day'' using unmanned aerial vehicles loaded with chemical or \nbiological weapons. Iraq is unique. By its past and present actions, by \nits technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, \nIraq is unique. Iraq is a true present danger to the United States. As \na former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said:\n\n       The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the \n     regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is \n     addicted to weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is \nrebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair, could launch a biological or chemical attack \nin as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has \nlong-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and we now know \nthat there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. In fact, senior members \nof the Iraqi government and members of the al Qaeda network have been \nin contact for many years. This regime is seeking a nuclear weapon and \nthe delivery capability to go with it.\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\n  There have been reports in the past from Desert Storm that rather \nthan having the acquisition of a nuclear weapon years in advance, it \ncould have been within a year that they could have developed a nuclear \nweapon. Had he waited until he had that nuclear device before he \ninvaded Kuwait, we would have been in a far different position as we \nattempted at that time to expel him from Kuwait.\n  The Iraqi dictator has answered a decade of resolutions with a decade \nof defiance. In the Southern and Northern No-fly zones over Iraq, \ncoalition aircraft continue to be fired on and coalition pilots \ncontinue to put their lives on the line to enforce these resolutions.\n  There is an ongoing war that Saddam Hussein has carried out against \nthe coalition which is seeking to enforce United Nations resolutions. \nJust this year alone, coalition aircraft have been fired on over 400 \ntimes. Since Saddam Hussein made what I believe, from past experience, \nwill be shown to be a hollow promise to cooperate with the United \nNations, they have fired on coalition aircraft more than 47 times. \nSaddam Hussein is a master at saying one thing and doing another.\n  As President Bush has stated in the past:\n\n       The Iraqi regime is led by a dangerous and brutal man. We \n     know he is actively seeking the destructive technologies to \n     match his hatred. And we know that he must be stopped. The \n     dangers we face will only worsen from month to month and year \n     to year. To ignore these threats is to encourage them--and \n     when they have fully materialized, it may be too late to \n     protect ourselves and our allies. By then, the Iraqi dictator \n     will have had the means to terrorize and dominate the region, \n     and each passing day could be the one on which the Iraqi \n     regime gives anthrax or VX nerve gas or someday a nuclear \n     weapon to a terrorist group.\n\n  The mantle of leadership requires this body to act. We have seen the \nresults of a decade of speaking loudly and carrying a soft stick.\n  We have pointed out, in past years, the danger of this regime. We \nhave called for changes. We have asked the United Nations to strengthen \nits resolutions. We have asked Saddam Hussein to readmit inspectors to \nassure us there are no deadly weapons of mass destruction being \nstockpiled. We have been rejected at all points.\n  Let us act now and pass this resolution in support of our President. \nThis resolution is needed to send an important signal to our allies and \nto the United Nations. With our leadership, I am convinced the \nPresident will build a robust coalition to say no to Saddam Hussein. It \nwill tell the world we are serious about disarmament, and it will \nreaffirm our message to Saddam Hussein.\n  Approving this resolution does not mean military action is imminent \nor unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations and all \nnations America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the \ndemands of the civilized world mean something.\n  If we do not act, then we face the terrible dangers of an attack with \nweapons of mass destruction. If the United Nations does not act, it \nfaces the prospect of joining the League of Nations on the dustbin of \nhistory: an international organization, organized with the highest \npurposes, and by its inaction shown to be ineffective.\n  I believe and I trust we will give a strong vote, a bipartisan vote, \nin support of this resolution. I believe building on that resolution we \nwill build a coalition, and our world will be a safer place, even \nthough we have to take the risks that are necessary and that come with \nthis resolution in order to secure that safety and that peace for \nourselves, our children, and our future.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I \nlook forward to working with them on this matter.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the resolution \nbefore this body concerning the use of force against Iraq.\n  For the third time in 12 years, the Senate is considering a \nresolution to address a threat posed by Saddam Hussein to America as \nwell as to the global community.\n  As I said on the floor of the House of Representatives when I was a \nMember of that body in 1991, on behalf of the authorization of what \nwould become Operation Desert Storm:\n\n       [T]he magnitude of the vote I now face is greater than any \n     other I have or likely will cast.\n\n  That is true any time we consider whether to potentially place \nAmerican men and women in harm's way. That is why I approached this \nparticular vote with the deliberation and the solemnity it demands.\n  During that 1991 debate, I concluded Saddam Hussein's invasion of \nKuwait ``threatened in infancy a new decade of hope.'' As I said at the \ntime, I voted as I did:\n\n     . . . not because the military option is inevitable, but in \n     order not to undermine the President's efforts to achieve a \n     peaceful outcome to this crisis--efforts which require that a \n     credible military threat be maintained against a brutal \n     aggressor who only understands the language of force. A \n     credible threat is necessary against a man who has raised one \n     of the world's largest armies, used chemical weapons against \n     his own people, invaded two neighbors and is developing \n     nuclear and biological capabilities. We are hardly dealing \n     with a man of peace in Saddam Hussein.\n\n  History, regrettably, has a way of repeating itself. Because 7 years \nlater, in 1998, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution which found \nIraq in ``material and unacceptable breach of its international \nobligations'' under previous U.N. resolutions--including Security \nCouncil Resolution 687 that set the terms and conditions for the 1991 \ncease-fire--and urged the President ``to take appropriate action . . . \nto bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.'' But \ncompliance, as we know, never followed.\n  Which brings us to today, to the resolution we have before us, and to \nthe two fundamental questions that are being asked here in Washington, \nin Maine, and throughout America: Why Saddam Hussein? And why now?\n  As to the first question, I have come to the conclusion--based on the \nfacts--that Saddam Hussein's continued, aggressive production of \nweapons of mass destruction presents a real and immediate global mess, \nparticularly in light of the absence of any U.N.-mandated inspectors \nover the last 4 years. Indeed, it was just 4 months after Congress \npassed the 1998 resolution that Hussein drove out the U.N. weapons \ninspectors.\n  And what were those inspectors leaving behind? A 1999 report by \nRichard Butler, the chief inspector, UNSCOM, found when they left Iraq, \nthey were unable to account for 360 tons of bulk chemical agent, \nincluding 1\\1/2\\ tons of VX nerve agent, 3,000 tons of precursor \nchemicals, enough growth media to manufacture 25,000 liters of anthrax \nspores, and 30,000 special munitions for delivering of chemical and \nbiological agents.\n  Today, there is no reason to believe Hussein has ever looked back. As \nreported in the U.S. intelligence community document made public on \nOctober 4, 2002, he has been seeking to revamp and accelerate his \nnuclear weapons program. The report concluded that if left unchecked, \nIraq would ``probably have a nuclear weapon during this decade,'' and \nthat if Hussein could acquire weapons-grade fissile material from \nabroad ``it could make a nuclear weapon within a year.''\n  This information is echoed in the September 24, 2002, intelligence \ndossier released by British Prime Minister Tony Blair--a critical voice \nand ally in our war on terrorism. That dossier outlines Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction programs past and present.\n  It finds Hussein, following the departure of U.N. inspectors in 1998, \nis aggressively pursuing development of a nuclear capability, and is \nundeniably seeking items needed to enrich uranium, such as fissile \nmaterial and gas centrifuge components like vacuum pumps and \nspecialized aluminum tubes. Tellingly, the report also documents Iraq's \nattempts to buy large quantities of uranium from Africa, even though \nIraq has no civil nuclear power program. All of this is in breach of \nU.N. Security Council Resolution 687.\n  Furthermore, the October 4 report states that Iraq is capable of \n``quickly producing and weaponizing'' a variety of both chemical and \nbiological agents, including anthrax, ``for delivery by bombs, \nmissiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives, including potentially \nagainst the U.S. homeland.'' Both reports highlight that Hussein's \nweapons are hidden in ``highly survivable'' facilities, some of them \nmobile, and, of course, in further violation of\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nResolution 687, his unrelenting effort to expand his ballistic missile \ncapabilities beyond 150 kilometers.\n  Finally, the October 4 report found that Iraq has rebuilt missile and \nbiological weapons facilities damaged during U.S. cruise missile \nstrikes in 1998. Iraq has begun renewed production of chemical warfare \nagents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX--all \nlethal chemical toxins.\n  All of this is in flagrant violation not only of the case-fire \nresolution, but also 12 other U.S. calls for disarmament over the \nensuing 11 years. So it should come as no surprise that the Security \nCouncil would have issued 30 letters of condemnation to Iraq over this \nlast decade alone.\n  Iraq was condemned for failures to cooperate fully and immediately, \nfailures to allow immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access, \nand failures to fulfill all of its obligations as set out in previous \nresolutions. The bottom line is, in every instance, he has failed to \ncomply--and the U.N. has failed to enforce.\n  Which brings us to the question of: Why now? What urgency has \ninterjected itself that would necessitate the actions we contemplate \ntoday? My answer begins not by citing a single fact or occurrence, but \nrather by illustrating a new, encroaching threat over the past decade \nthat was foreshadowed by the first attack on American soil since Pearl \nHarbor--the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.\n  I believe that was the seminal moment when our enemies of today were \nintroduced to the realm of the possible--as those who would wish our \ndestruction developed and implemented comprehensive strategies to \nsystematically assault Americans and our interests whenever, wherever, \nand however they could.\n  It also should have been an awakening for America. That is why I \nspearheaded investigations into the comings and goings of Sheikh Omar \nAbdel Rahman, the mastermind of that bombing in 1993, who entered and \nexisted this country five times totally unimpeded.\n  What I found led me to introduce legislation in 1994, requiring \ninformation sharing among critical Government agencies, to ensure those \non the front lines of securing America would have the resources to keep \ndangerous aliens from entering the U.S. But there were those who didn't \ntake the threat seriously, and those reforms were quietly altered, and \nallowed to fade out of law in 1998, and out of the national \nconsciousness.\n  Now, as we peel back the layers through further investigation, we \ndiscovered the Sheikh was closely tied to Osama bin Laden and the \nnetwork we now know as al-Qaida. The point is, over the decade of the \n1990s and into the fledgling days of the 21st century, our \nconsciousness was not attuned to the emerging pattern of attacks, and \nso the pattern continued--from Khobar Towers in 1996, to the 1998 \nembassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, to the attack on the USS Cole \nin the fall of 2000, and culminating in the horrific events of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  That terrible day would finally and forever change the way we assess \nour security and vulnerability, single-handedly adding the term \n``homeland Security'' to our national lexicon. It has changed our \nconception of what constitutes weapons and warfare--and how both may be \nused against us.\n\n  To paraphrase Governor Ridge, we are now compelled to come to grips \nwith an enemy who makes no distinction between combatants and \nnoncombatants. The battlefield itself has changed--today, asymmetrical \nthreats accost us in a theater of engagement that includes our own \nbackyard. There is no line of demarcation.\n  Before September 11, we underestimated the threat, and overestimated \nour security. That is why the Senate and House have been holding joint \nintelligence hearings, to determine how we can learn from failures of \nthe past. The lapses were so egregious that it prompted our recent vote \nto authorize an independent commission, to conduct a more far-reaching \ninquiry into how we could have done better and how we must do better in \nthe future.\n  Because there is no longer any question as to the scope of the \nthreat--and the ability and intent of terrorist groups to bring \ndevastation to our soil. As Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       We have entered a world in which terrorist movements and \n     terrorist states are developing the capacity to cause \n     unprecedented destruction. Today, our margin of error is \n     notably different. In the 20th century, we were dealing, for \n     the most part, with conventional weapons--weapons that could \n     kill hundreds of thousands of people, generally combatants. \n     In the 21st century, we are dealing with weapons of mass \n     destruction that can kill potentially tens of thousands of \n     people--innocent men, women and children.\n\n  It is through this prism of the post-September 11 world that we must \nview an ever emerging convergence of threats over the last 10 years, \nrepresented on the one hand by transnational terrorism exemplified by \nal-Qaida--with cells in more than 30 countries--and on the other by a \nregime in Iraq that has already developed and deployed horrific weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Even as far back as 1991, the United Nations was concerned enough \nabout a potential linkage between terrorists and Saddam Hussein to \ninclude in Resolution 687 a requirement that Iraq inform the Security \nCouncil:\n\n     that it will not commit or support any act of international \n     terrorism or allow any organization directed towards \n     commission of such acts to operate within its territory . . .\n\n  Today, we know from Secretary Rumsfeld that ``al-Qaida is operating \nin Iraq''. . . that we have ``accurate and not debatable'' evidence of \nreportedly the presence of senior members of Al-Qaida in Baghdad, and \nother associations.\n\n       Iraq has also reportedly provided safe haven to Abdul \n     Rahman Yasin, one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, who \n     was a key participant in the first World Trade Center \n     bombing.\n\n  We also know that Saddam Hussein continues to provide $25,000 rewards \nto the families of suicide bombers in the Middle East, continues to \nharbor the Abu Nidal Organization, and continues to harbor the \nPalestinian Liberation Front.\n  And so the question we really need to ask ourselves is, why is \nHussein so single-mindedly and at all costs amassing such huge stores \nof horrific weapons? We know he has them. We know he has used them \nbefore. The question is, will he use them again?\n  The answer is that we don't know for certain. But from all I have \nbeen able to ascertain from high-level briefings, the logical \nconclusion--based on all the evidence, all the broken promises, all the \nobfuscation. And now the nexus between Hussein and terrorist groups and \nindividuals--is that we simply can't afford the risk to humanity.\n  Some say we should wait until the threat is imminent. But how will we \nknow when the danger is clear, present and immediate? When people start \nchecking into hospitals? When the toxin shows up in the water supply? \nWhen the dirty bomb goes off?\n  Because, in the shadowy world of terrorism, as we have seen, that \nwill already be too late. For these are not weapons that can be easily \nintercepted or anticipated. They aren't detected by sonar, and they \ndon't show up on radar screens. Therefore, the standard by which we \njudge the level and immediacy of threat must be calibrated accordingly.\n  In the instance of Iraq, for a terrorist organization that shares \nHussein's disdain for America, where better to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction? And for Saddam Hussein, what better way to deliver these \nweapons than a terrorist who might smuggle a vial of smallpox in a \nsuitcase or store a canister of sarin gas in a cargo container or \nlaunch a drone aircraft or other unmanned aerial vehicle that sprays \naerosolized biological agents.\n  In fact, Richard Butler, the former chief U.N. weapons inspector, was \nasked in an interview on October 8, 2002, ``how easy it would be . . . \nfor the Iraquis to arm a terrorist group, or an individual terrorist, \nwith weapons of mass destruction.'' It would be ``extremely easy,'' \nAmbassador Butler told the interviewer. ``If they decided to do it, it \nwould be a piece of cake.''\n  It is true we cannot enter the diabolical mind of Saddam Hussein to \nknow conclusively if and when he may deliver his weapons--or share \nthose weapons with terrorists organizations. But we do have an \nobligation to make a judgment on which side of the equation we want to \nerr--knowing he has the means and opportunity to strike, and knowing we \nwill put potentially millions at risk should we misread his \ninclination, miscalculate this timing, or underestimate his capability.\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\n  And we have been wrong before. According to Secretary Rumsfeld, \nbefore Operation Desert Storm, ``these best intelligence estimates were \nthat Iraq was at least 5 to 7 years away from having nuclear weapons. \nThe experts were wrong. When the U.S. got on the ground, it found the \nIraquis were probably 6 months to a year away . . .'' Just imagine if \nwe were confronted with an Iraq that already had nuclear capability.\n  Today he is procuring his weapons with the $6.6 billion in illict \nrevenue GAO estimates he has gained over the last 4 years through oil \nsmuggling and ``surcharges.'' When you consider that al-Qaida spent \nmerely $500,000 to inflict such horror as we saw in New York, \nPennsylvania, and the Pentagon, that equation becomes even more \nominous--all the more so as September 11 raised our sense of urgency \nand illuminated a whole new range of dangerous scenarios that place \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction in a very different light.\n  As Henry Kissinger warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on \nSeptember 26, ``We are only at the beginning of global proliferation,'' \nand thus we need to ``consider not only the risk of action but the \nconsequences of inaction.'' In context of all we know--we can no longer \nassure Americans that he can be contained and confined to Iraq. \nTherefore, I believe the world must disarm Saddam Hussein now, when the \ndevelopment of his capability is imminent--not waiting until it is \nimminent he is about to strike.\n  In the absence of true strength of enforcement, Hussein will continue \nto exploit our every weakness through his methodical ``cheat and \nretreat,'' as he has done systematically and persistently in the past--\nresulting in more of the old dynamic of U.N. resolutions and economic \nsanctions, followed by the repeated inability of the U.N. to enforce \nits own mandates.\n  To change this paradigm, the President has now rightfully come to \nCongress to seek authorization and support for a resolution ensuring \nthat when he speaks, he does so with the strength of a unified, \nunequivocal American voice that leaves no ambivalence as to the \nresoluteness of our position . . . no doubt where America stands.\n  Given the gravity of the global implications of Hussein's serial \nintransigence, there is no substitute for the U.N. enforcing \ncompliance, or for the U.S. working through the U.N. Appropriately, \nthis resolution calls upon the President to use the full weight of this \noffice, first and foremost through his diplomatic means and persuasive \npower--as well as that of his foreign policy team--to convince the U.N. \nto impose and enforce unfettered, unrestricted inspections. And as \nSecretary of State Powell has noted, ``our diplomatic efforts at the \nUnited Nations would be helped by a strong Congressional resolution. . \n. .''\n  Furthermore, as many of my colleagues, as well as my constituents, \nhave expressed, the use of force should be the last resort, and under \nthis resolution it is the last resort. The President emphasized in his \nspeech to the Nation that, ``congressional authorization does not mean \nthat military action is imminent or unavoidable.''\n  I realize there are those who oppose unilateral action should the \nU.N. fail to act, and accordingly would oppose this resolution granting \nsuch Presidential authority. But for those who would ultimately \npreserve the right to authorize military action--even if we cannot \nsecure a U.N. mandate for enforcement--this resolution is preferable to \na two-tiered approach.\n  Why? In my view, by granting military authority to the President in \nadvance, it leaves no question or uncertainty as to the level of our \ncommitment, thereby strengthening the President's ability to secure \nU.N. implementation of a new and enforceable resolution and potentially \nplaces us on a course toward a peaceful disarmament. As always, \ndiplomacy must constitute our first line of defense. But in the event \nthat action becomes necessary to safeguard our national security \ninterests outside the auspices of the United Nations, let there be no \nmistake--the President must exert the last full measure of effort in \nbuilding an international coalition to join us in disarming Saddam \nHussein, because this shouldn't have to be a solo endeavor for our \nnation.\n  Iraq is not just a threat to America. It is a threat to all of \nhumanity. It is not just our interests we are protecting, it is the \ninterests of a new century that must be free from the scourge of global \nterrorism. And our goals with regard to Saddam Hussein are inseparable \nfrom our mission to eradicate terror at its roots.\n  I have come to the regrettable conclusion that if we allow the Iraqi \nregime to continue developing its horrific capabilities with impunity, \nwe are endangering mankind by sending a corrosive message that the \nstockpiling of weapons of mass destruction buys immunity from \ninternational response.\n  If the United States and its allies offer nothing but disapproving \nrhetoric or ineffective sanctions as the only price for Iraq's \nhostility and defiance, then we concede a victory to the tactics of \naggression. Rather, if the free nations of the world are to remain the \nauthors of our own destiny, history teaches us that we must never \ncountenance the tyranny of such threats.\n  As Winston Churchill wrote in 1936 of the tyrants building stocks of \nstate-of-the-art weapons of the day:\n\n       Dictators ride to and fro upon tigers which they dare not \n     dismount. And the tigers are getting hungry.\n\n  The world can no longer ignore the tiger in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a transcript of the \n``Today Show'' of October 8, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Matt Lauer (co-host): As we reported, President Bush laid \n     out his case against Saddam Hussein again in a speech on \n     Monday night in Cincinnati. He talked about Iraq's capability \n     to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. Richard Butler \n     was chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq and the last person \n     to oversee an inspection team in Baghdad. Mr. Butler, good \n     morning to you.\n       Mr. Richard Butler (Former U.N. Weapons Inspector): Good \n     morning, Matt. Good to see you.\n       Lauer: Good to see you. In his speech last night, the \n     president actually quoted you, saying that Saddam Hussein is, \n     quote, ``addicted to weapons of mass destruction.'' You were \n     last in Iraq in 1998, and before your inspection team was \n     kicked out . . .\n       Mr. Butler: Mm-hmm.\n       Lauer: . . . you said, and I'm quoting a Time magazine \n     article, quote, ``you saw some really disturbing stuff,'' end \n     quote. Be more specific. What did you see that we should be \n     afraid of now?\n       Mr. Butler: Well, in particular, Matt, one of the \n     substances that the president mentioned last night, in may I \n     say what I thought was an outstanding speech, I think the \n     best he's given, that substance is called VX. It is the most \n     toxic of the chemical warfare agents. And we saw some deeply \n     disturbing evidence that Iraq had made a very significant \n     quantity of VX. I was pleased to see the president refer to \n     that last night. We also saw evidence that they had loaded it \n     into missile warheads. That's the--the difficulty Iraq has \n     always had, is how to weaponize this hideous stuff that they \n     make and they continue to make. And in the case of VX, we saw \n     evidence that they had loaded it into missile warheads for \n     delivery.\n       Lauer: Iraq has agreed to let UN weapons inspection teams \n     back into the country with limitations. They will not be \n     allowed to inspect Saddam Hussein's personal palaces. Is that \n     worth anything, in your opinion?\n       Mr. Butler: No, it's not, Matt. I'm really slightly stunned \n     to think that we are now exactly where we were four years \n     ago. And by the way, it's not palaces, it's presidential \n     sites. The--the parts of Iraq that the Iraqis declared in the \n     past to be of presidential significance measured some 75 \n     square kilometers, you know, 50 square miles, much larger \n     than the eight palaces that Saddam has. The number of \n     buildings is what was really important in those presidential \n     sites. It . . .\n       Lauer: What's going on at . . .\n       Mr. Butler: . . . was 1,100 . . .\n       Lauer: . . . those sites . . .\n       Mr. Butler: . . . buildings.\n       Lauer: . . . in our opinion?\n       Mr. Butler: Well, no, we--we can't know without inspection. \n     But we had excellent intelligence information in the past \n     that weapons were stored there, that materials, with which to \n     make weapons were stored there. Matt, it's always been the \n     same, and it is the same today. The Iraqis say they have no \n     weapons, OK. If they don't, let the inspectors in. And what \n     they have tried to do today, as they did four years ago, is \n     say you can come in up to a point . . .\n       Lauer: Right.\n       Mr. Butler: . . . but not in the places that we say are \n     presidential. That's not good enough.\n       Lauer: And real, real quickly, how easy would it be, in \n     your opinion, Mr. Butler, for the Iraqis to arm a terrorist \n     group or an individual terrorist with weapons of mass \n     destruction?\n       Mr. Butler: Really quickly, Matt? Extremely easy. If they \n     decide to do it, piece of cake.\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\n       Lauer: Richard Butler. Mr. Butler, thanks very much for \n     your time.\n       Mr. Butler: Thank you.\n       Lauer: It's 17 after the hour. Once again, here's Katie.\n       Katie Couric (co-host): Thanks, Matt.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10145-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S.J. Res. 45, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 45) to authorize the use of \n     United States Armed Forces against Iraq.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lieberman/Warner Modified Amendment No. 4856, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Graham Amendment No. 4857 (to Amendment No. 4856), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senate now turns to the resolution, it is my \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The leadership has indicated there have been expressions \nof interest to speak this morning from Senator Feingold for \napproximately 30 minutes; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for 30 minutes; \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Leahy, for 20 minutes; and Senator \nGrassley for 20 minutes.\n  Further, we have expressions on this side by about half a dozen other \nMembers who would hope to speak during the course of the day and the \nafternoon, but we will await announcement of names and times until the \nother side indicates the expression of interest on their side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am advised it is the Graham second degree \namendment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the President for informing me of what the \npending business is before the Senate. I urge my colleagues to come and \nspeak on behalf or in opposition to the Graham amendment so we can \ndispose of that amendment. It is my intention to move to table the \nGraham amendment after a reasonable length of time for my colleagues to \ncome and speak for or against that amendment, which is my right, as is \nany Senator's right, but I want to make sure every Senator has the \ntime, if they so wish, to speak on the pending business.\n  I see my dear friend from Wisconsin in the Chamber. I know he is \ntalking about the overall issue. We need Senators to speak on the \nGraham amendment. I am sure my friend from Wisconsin and my colleague \nfrom West Virginia would be glad to speak, but we need to dispose of \nthe pending Graham amendment and move on to other amendments.\n  I understand by 1 p.m. all amendments have to be filed. So let us \nmove on and dispose of the Graham amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in debating this resolution on which we \nspent so much time and so much thought, we are making one of the most \nimportant decisions we have ever faced. The decision to send American \ntroops into battle is not one we take lightly and I don't take lightly.\n  There is much at stake for this Nation. There is much at stake for \nthe State of Nevada. Thousands of men and women in Nevada would \nundoubtedly be called to support or directly serve in a military \nconflict with Iraq. Our pilots from Fallon Naval Air Station and Nellis \nAir Force Base are considered the best aviators in the world. I know \nthey would be asked to play a leading role in eliminating the threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein.\n  I am personally very grateful for the contributions that would be \nmade by the National Guard and Reserve forces not only from Nevada but \nfrom across our country. These heroic citizen soldiers are such an \nintegral part of the American military. We simply could not succeed \nwithout them. We must be mindful that their sacrifices are great \nbecause they leave their families and civilian occupations behind and \nbecome citizen soldiers. They serve proudly on behalf of our Nation. \nWhen called upon, they do not complain. They did not question the need \nto act. They did not ask why.\n  However, we must explain that these brave men and women are the \nreason for making this life-and-death decision. Therefore, I rise today \nto explain to one man why I intend to vote and how I intend to vote. \nThat man is President George W. Bush. I say, President Bush, your \nfather may recall that a decade ago I was the first Democrat in this \nbody to publicly support his request for congressional authorization to \nmake war to free Kuwait. At that time, I compared Saddam Hussein to \nBenito Mussolini. My position has not changed, although I believe our \ncontinued efforts have degraded Hussein from a second-grade dictator to \na third-rate thug.\n  In 1991, I said I thought the constitutional role of the Chief \nExecutive is to make war. That is our role--halt or prevent an unjust \nor unwise conflict. I stated my strong belief that the President must \nbe able to use the diplomatic corps and the Marine Corps with equal \nfacility, subject only to our power to force a halt to actions taken \ncontrary to the national interests.\n  President Bush, I intend once again to vote to give you that power on \na geographically limited basis, but I do so with more reluctance \nbecause the situation has changed. We do not, as we did 10 years ago, \nface a dictator who successfully invaded a tiny and relatively \ndefenseless neighbor.\n  We have not enlisted, as your father did so magnificently, the whole \nworld to fight by our side. We have not yet convinced our people or the \nworld that international law is on our side, or that we are champions \nof the new world order envisioned by your father in which the power of \na nation is measured by the strength of its moral values and not by the \nsize of its Armed Forces.\n  President Bush, the core ideal which motivated the Founding Fathers \nwas that this would be a nation of laws not men. As such a decent \nrespect to the opinions of mankind requires that we should declare the \ncauses which impel our action. Our quarrel with Iraq is not about one \ntwo-bit tin-horn dictator. Rather, it is, and it ought to, be explained \nas a question of the rule of law.\n  I am voting you this power, Mr. President, because I know this nation \nwould be justified in making war to enforce the terms we impose on Iraq \nin 1991, if we have to. But I am also voting you this power secure in \nthe knowledge that no President of the United States of whatever \npolitical philosophy, will take this nation to war as a first resort \nalternative rather than as a last resort.\n  I found most encouraging your speech on Monday when you said war was \nnot inevitable.\n  I urge you Mr. President to continue to make the case to the American \npeople and to the world. The international coalition you have started \nto build is critical, not only for military and cost-sharing reasons, \nbut also to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  Your father chose not to carry our fight into the cities of Iraq in \n1991, and we have to live with his decision. He gave the Iraqi \nleadership a chance to reenter the community of peaceful nations. \nSaddam Hussein has squandered that opportunity.\n  We stopped the fighting based on an agreement that Iraq would take \nsteps to assure the world that it would not engage in further \naggression and that it would destroy its weapons of mass destruction. \nIt has refused to take those steps. That refusal constitutes a breach \nof the armistice which renders\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nit void and justifies resumption of the armed conflict. President Bush, \nif you believe the time has come to use force, this resolution \nauthorizes you to do so. I trust you will use this force wisely.\n  I have not doubt that is Iraq continues to refuse to abide by its \nagreement the nations united in 1991 will again support enforcement in \nthe United Nations. But Mr. President, the rule of law matters, and so \ndoes a decent respect for opinion of the rest of the world. As \nPresident of the United States you are the leader of the free world; \nyou are not its ruler.\n  I will support the Lieberman amendment. But I have said enough, \nPresident Bush, and I have said it to explain my vote to you, to the \npeople of Nevada, to the people of this Nation, and to the world. I \nhave confidence, sir, that you will do the right thing.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is for Senators to debate \nthe Graham amendment to S.J. Res. 45. Senators will be recognized as \nthey seek to speak, as they so appropriately do.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My understanding was there was an order entered whereby \nI would be recognized at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was not a unanimous consent request, but \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia had mentioned others would be \ncoming. Of course, the Senator from Wisconsin now has the floor and he \nis in control of his time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. This Senator has to go downtown and speak around noon. Does \nthe Senator intend to speak a considerable length at this point?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Not that long. I will be concluded in time for the \nSenator to speak prior to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Prior to that time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if I might ask unanimous consent to follow the \nSenator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague that Senator Reid, the assistant \nDemocrat leader, working with us, established the order. In \nconsultation with Senator Reid, if he wishes to come back and suggest \nto us an amendment to what he had in mind, certainly we will take into \nconsideration the desire of the Senator from West Virginia. But at this \ntime, I feel the leadership has established this, and I would not be at \nliberty to agree to anything else.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield further without losing the floor?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. If and when Senator Reid comes back to the floor and \nattempts to change the list----\n  Mr. REID. I am here.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was about to say, I was hoping I might be considered on \nthe list and be able to follow the statement by Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. REID. Without the Senator from Wisconsin losing his right to the \nfloor, could we answer a few questions that are pending? I was watching \nthe proceedings from my office.\n  It is my understanding there is an order that is now in effect. Could \nthe Chair announce what that is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, under the order, we have four \nSenators who are set to speak, and they have been given time. Senator \nFeingold is first. The Republican is Senator Hutchison of Texas, to \nspeak for 30 minutes, as I recall. Then Senator Leahy speaks for 30 \nminutes, and then Senator Grassley speaks. That is as far as we went \nthis morning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there a unanimous consent in effect?\n  Mr. REID. That order has already been entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was in error before. There is a \nunanimous consent that was granted this morning before the present \noccupant took the chair, giving the allocated times to Senator \nFeingold, Senator Hutchison, Senator Leahy, and Senator Grassley in the \norder as described by the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Yesterday, we tried to line up Senators and give specific \ntimes, but it did not work. So what we decided to do, with the consent \nof the two leaders, is to line up a couple on each side. We hope that \nworks better than yesterday. Yesterday we had a little bit of downtime \nbecause some people did not speak long enough, some people spoke too \nlong. So if the Senators from Arizona and West Virginia wish to get in \nthe queue, I think that is totally appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, I stated earlier \nthe pending business before the Senate is the Graham amendment. The \nGraham amendment should be dispensed with. That is why I hope any \nSenator who supports or opposes the Graham amendment would speak on it \nbecause I intend to move to table the Graham amendment, which is my \nright. So when we line up people to talk, I am all for that, but I \nwould seek recognition at some time--sooner rather than later--so we \ncould dispose of the Graham amendment. We need to move forward on this \nissue, I say to my friend from Nevada.\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona is totally correct. I have been in \ntouch with the Senator from Florida, and he needs to come and speak. \nOtherwise, his motion is going to be tabled because it is not only the \nSenator from Arizona but others have the same thing in mind. As we all \nknow, once that motion is made, it is nondebatable. From what I have \nbeen able to determine, it is likely that motion would prevail.\n  I would like to hear from the Senator from West Virginia. Does the \nSenator from West Virginia wish to speak after the four we have lined \nup?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have an engagement downtown. I had hoped to speak \nimmediately following Mr. Feingold. I would have to say to my friend \nfrom Arizona my remarks are on the general subject. They are not \nprecisely on the point with respect to the Graham amendment.\n  May I make a parliamentary inquiry? I ask if the Senator will yield \nfor that purpose?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do not want to lose my right to the floor at this \npoint. Can the Senator from West Virginia pose a question to me?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to make a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding for the \ninquiry. Is there a motion to invoke cloture before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two cloture motions were filed yesterday, on \nthe resolution itself and on the Lieberman substitute amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. If I might ask, until what time today are Senators in a \nposition to offer amendments in the first degree to the cloture motion \non the Lieberman amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under rule XXII, a 1 p.m. filing deadline is \nimposed on the first-degree amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if Senators would yield consent to allow Senators \nto file first-degree amendments until a later point today. For example, \nmy own situation is such, I have so many things going on, including a \nconference on the Defense appropriations. I also have other problems \nthat would impinge upon my ability to offer an amendment by 1 p.m.\n  Could all Senators have a little longer than that today?\n  Mr. REID. If I may, with the permission of the Senator from \nWisconsin, I will respond to the Senator from West Virginia. I will be \nhappy, while Senator Feingold is speaking, to see if we can work with \nboth sides to see if that is possible. We will do that.\n  You are scheduled to speak for how long, Senator?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And I say to my friend from Arizona, we have heard from \nSenator Graham from Florida. He was ready to come anytime today, but \nbecause we lined up the speakers, he did not come. We will make sure he \nhas an opportunity to speak on his amendment and that you are \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we can rearrange the Senators on our side \nbecause the Senator from Arizona made\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\nthe point last night, Senator Graham came in--we were here--\nunexpectedly, laid that amendment down, and indicated to this Senator \nthat he was going to pursue it early in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Virginia it is not his fault. He is \nanxious to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time to which the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin is entitled still be in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for his \nkindness and courtesy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, many have spent months reviewing the \nissue on advisability of invading Iraq in the near future, from \nhearings and meeting on the process and the very important role of \nCongress to the difficult questions of substance, including foreign \npolicy and military implications. After my own review and carefully \nlistening to hundreds of Wisconsin citizens in person, I spoke on the \nfloor on Thursday, September 26. I indicated my opposition to the \noriginal draft use of force authorization by the President. I also used \nthat opportunity to raise some very important questions to which I \nneeded answers before supporting a narrower and more responsible \nresolution.\n  Now, after many more meetings and reading articles and attending \nbriefings, listening to my colleagues' speeches, and especially \nlistening to the President's speech in Cincinnati on Monday, I still do \nnot believe the President and the administration have adequately \nanswered the critical questions. They have not yet met the important \nburden to persuade Congress and the American people we should invade \nIraq at this time.\n  Both in terms of the justifications for an invasion and in terms of \nthe mission and the plan for the invasion, the administration's \narguments do not add up. They do not add up to a coherent basis for a \nnew major war in the middle of our current challenging fight against \nthe terrorism of al-Qaida and related organizations. Therefore, I \ncannot support the resolution for the use of force before the Senate.\n  My colleagues, my focus today is on the wisdom of this specific \nresolution, vis-a-vis Iraq, as opposed to discussing the notion of an \nexpanded doctrine of preemption, which the President has articulated on \nseveral occasions. However, I associate myself with the concerns \neloquently raised by Senator Kennedy and Senator Byrd and others that \nthis could well represent a disturbing change in our overall foreign \nand military policy. This includes grave concerns about what such a \npreemption-plus policy will do to our relationship with our allies, to \nour national security, and to the cause of world peace in so many \nregions of the world where such a doctrine could trigger very dangerous \nactions with very minimal justification.\n  I want to be clear about something. None of this is to say that I \ndon't agree with the President on much of what he has said about the \nfight against terrorism and even what he has said about Iraq. I agree, \npost-9/11, we face, as the President said, a long and difficult fight \nagainst terrorism. We must be very patient and very vigilant, and we \nmust be ready to act and make some very serious sacrifices.\n  With regard to Iraq, I agree, Iraq presents a genuine threat, \nespecially in the form of weapons of mass destruction, chemical, \nbiological, and potentially nuclear weapons. I agree that Saddam \nHussein is exceptionally dangerous and brutal, if not uniquely so, as \nthe President argues. And I support the concept of regime change. \nSaddam Hussein is one of several despots whom the international \ncommunity should condemn and isolate with the hope of new leadership in \nthose nations.\n  Yes, I agree; if we do this Iraq invasion, I hope Saddam Hussein will \nactually be removed from power this time. I agree, we cannot do nothing \nwith regard to Saddam Hussein in Iraq. We must act. We must act with \nserious purpose and stop the weapons of mass destruction and stop \nSaddam Hussein. I agree, a return to the inspections regime of the past \nalone is not a serious, credible policy.\n  I also believe and agree, as important and as preferable as U.N. \naction and multilateral solutions to this problem are, we cannot give \nthe United Nations the ability to veto our ability to counter this \nthreat to our people. We retain and will always retain the right of \nself-defense, including self-defense against weapons of mass \ndestruction. When such a threat requiring self-defense would present \nitself--and I am skeptical that is exactly what we are dealing with \nhere--then we could, if necessary, act alone, including militarily.\n  These are all areas where I agree with the administration. However, I \nam increasingly troubled by the seemingly shifting justifications for \nan invasion at this time. My colleagues, I am not suggesting there has \nto be only one justification for such a dramatic action, but when the \nadministration moves back and forth from one argument to another, it \nundercuts the credibility of the case and the belief in its urgency. I \nbelieve this practice of shifting justifications has much to do with \nthe troubling phenomenon of many Americans questioning the \nadministration's motives in insisting on action at this time.\n\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about the spectacle of the \nPresident and senior administration officials citing a reported \nconnection to al-Qaida one day, weapons of mass destruction the next \nday, Saddam Hussein's treatment of his own people on another day, and \nthen on some days the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.\n  For some of these, we may well be willing to send some 250,000 \nAmericans into harm's way; for others, frankly, probably not.\n  These litanies of various justifications--whether the original draft \nresolution discussions or the new White House resolution, or, \nregrettably throughout the President's speech in Cincinnati--in my view \nset the bar for an alternative to a U.S. invasion so high I am afraid \nit almost locks in--it almost requires--a potentially extreme and \nreckless solution to these problems.\n  I am especially troubled by these shifting justifications because I \nand most Americans strongly support the President on the use of force \nin response to the attacks on September 11, 2001. I voted for S.J. Res. \n23--the use of force resolution--to go after al-Qaida and the Taliban \nand those associated with the tragedies of September 11, and I strongly \nsupported military actions pursuant to S.J. Res. 23. But the relentless \nattempt to link 9/11 and the issue of Iraq has been disappointing to me \nfor months, culminating in the President's singularly unpersuasive \nattempt in Cincinnati to intertwine 9/11 and Iraq, to make the American \npeople believe there are no important differences between the \nperpetrators of 9/11 and Iraq.\n  I believe it is dangerous for the world--and especially dangerous for \nus--to take the tragedy of 9/11 and the word ``terrorism'' in all their \npowerful emotion and then too easily apply them to many other \nsituations--situations that surely need our serious attention, but are \nnot necessarily the same as individuals and organizations who have \nshown a willingness to fly suicide planes into the World Trade Center \nand into the Pentagon.\n  Let me say the President is right, we have to view the world, the \nthreats, and our own national security in a very different light since \n9/11. There are shocking new threats. But it is not helpful to use \nvirtually any strand or extreme rhetoric to suggest the new threat is \nthe same as other preexisting threats.\n  I think common sense tells us they are not the same. They cannot so \neasily be lumped together as the President sought to do in Cincinnati.\n  I have reviewed the intermittent efforts to suggest a connection of \n9/11 and Saddam Hussein, or suggest the possibility such a connection \nhas developed since 9/11. I want to be very clear. In fact, if there \nwas a connection in planning for the 9/11 attacks by Saddam Hussein or \nhis agents and the perpetrators of 9/11 and al-Qaida, I have already \nvoted for military action. I have no objection. But if it is not, if \nthis is premised on some case that has supposedly been made with regard \nto a subsequent coalition between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government, I \nthink the President has to do better. He has to do\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\nbetter than the shoddy piecing together of flimsy evidence that \ncontradicts the very briefings we have received by various agencies. I \nam not hearing the same things at the briefings I am hearing from the \nPresident's top officials.\n  In fact, on March 11 of this year, Vice President Cheney, following a \nmeeting with Tony Blair, raised the possibility of weapons of mass \ndestruction falling into the hands of terrorists. He said:\n\n       We have to be concerned about the potential marriage, if \n     you will, between a terrorist organization like al-Qaida and \n     those who hold or are proliferating knowledge about weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n\n  In March, there was a potential marriage.\n  Then the Vice President said on September 8, without evidence--and no \nevidence has been given since that time--that there are:\n\n       ``Credible but unconfirmed'' intelligence reports that 9/11 \n     ringleader Mohammad Atta met in Prague with senior Iraqi \n     intelligence officials a few months before the 9/11 attacks.\n\n  We have seen no proof of that.\n  Finally, the Secretary of Defense follows on September 27 of this \nyear, and says:\n\n       There is ``bulletproof evidence'' of Iraqi links to al-\n     Qaida, including the recent presence of senior al-Qaida \n     members in Baghdad.\n\n  I don't know where this comes from. This so-called ``potential \nmarriage'' in March is beginning to sound like a 25th wedding \nanniversary at this point.\n  The facts just aren't there. At least they have not been presented to \nme in the situations where they should have been presented to me as an \nelected Member of this body. In other words, the administration appears \nto use 9/11 and the language of terrorism and the connection to Iraq \ntoo loosely--almost like a bootstrap.\n  For example, I heard the President say in Cincinnati that Iraq and \nal-Qaida both regard us as a common enemy. Of course they do. Who else \nare we going to attack in the near future on that basis alone?\n  Or do we see an attempt to stretch the notion of harboring \nterrorists? I agree with the President, if any country is actively \nharboring and assisting terrorists involved in 9/11, we have to act \nagainst them. But I don't think you can bring to the definition of \nharboring terrorists the simple presence of some al-Qaida members \nsomewhere in Iraq. After all, apparently we have al-Qaida agents active \nin our country as well. They are present in our Nation as well. How can \nthis be a sufficient basis on its own?\n  Therefore, without a better case for an al-Qaida connection to Saddam \nHussein, this proposed invasion must stand on its own merit--not on \nsome notion that those who question this invasion don't thoroughly \ncondemn and want to see the destruction of the perpetrators of 9/11 and \nsimilar terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  Invasion of Iraq must stand on its own--not just because it is \ndifferent than the fight against the perpetrators of 9/11, but because \nit may not be consistent with and may even be harmful to the top \nnational security issue of this country. And that is the fight against \nterrorism and the perpetrators of the crimes of 9/11.\n  In fact, I am so pleased to see one of the most eloquent spokesmen on \nthis viewpoint here in the Senate Chamber, Senator Graham, who has done \na terrific job of trying to point out our top priorities in this area. \nHe said:\n\n       Our first priority should be the successful completion of \n     the war on terrorism. Today, we Americans are more vulnerable \n     to international terrorist organizations than we are to \n     Saddam Hussein.\n\n  I ask: Is this war against terrorism going so terribly well when we \nsee the possible explosion of the French tanker in Yemen, when we see \nthe tremendous difficulties in trying to pursue stability in \nAfghanistan itself, and when we realize we are not certain at all \nwhether Mr. Osama bin Laden is alive or dead? Will the invasion of Iraq \nencourage our allies and Islamic friends to help us in the fight \nagainst terrorism, or just make them extremely nervous?\n  I met with a group of African Ambassadors the other day in my role as \nchairman of the Africa Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nThey told me various people were placing bets on what country would be \nnext after Iraq under this new doctrine the President is putting \nforward. Will this idea of invading Iraq at this time, on this case, on \nthese merits, help or hurt cooperation in our fight against terrorism, \nagainst the known murderers of Americans who are known to be plotting \nmore of the same?\n  I am especially dismayed at the weak response to the potential drain \non our military capability and resources in our fight against \nterrorism, if we go forward with this invasion at this time. The \nadministration likes to quickly say, whenever asked whether we can do \nthis and fight the war against terrorism--they just simply say we can \ndo both. There is no proof. There is no real assurance of this.\n  I find these answers glib, at best.\n  When former Secretary of State Kissinger was asked in this regard, he \nsaid:\n\n       It is not clear to me what measures that are required in \n     the war against terrorism would be interrupted or weakened by \n     the actions that may be imposed on us if it is not possible \n     to do away with the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction \n     in Iraq by other means.\n\n  That is the only explanation the former Secretary of State gave us on \nthis tough question.\n  But let's look at what the current Secretary of State, Colin Powell, \nsaid in response to a similar question. He said:\n\n       So the campaign against terrorism is going in full swing. \n     And I don't see why there is a suggestion that somehow, if we \n     had to undertake this mission, it would be at the expense of \n     the campaign against terrorism.\n\n  That is all he said. Now, that is a pretty weak reassurance, to me, \nthat such an enormous undertaking will not call into question some of \nour other military efforts and priorities.\n  What about what we are doing in Bosnia? What about what we are doing \nin Kosovo? What about all the resources stretching from the Philippines \nall the way to portions of the former Soviet Union, to the Middle East, \nto parts of Africa, that are being employed in the fight against \nterrorism? What about the fact we are using our National Guards and \nReserves, many times within our country, to protect our own citizens at \npublic events with regard to the challenge of the fight against \nterrorism?\n  All of this, and an invasion of Iraq, too? I wonder. As mighty as we \nare, I wonder if we are not very close to being overextended. Invasion \nof Iraq in the next few weeks or months could, in fact, be very \ncounterproductive. In fact, it could risk our national security.\n  In any event, I oppose this resolution because of the continuing \nunanswered questions, including the very important questions about what \nthe mission is here, what the nature of the operation will be, what \nwill happen concerning weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as the \nattack proceeds and afterward, and what the plan is after the attack is \nover.\n  In effect, we are being asked to vote on something that is unclear. \nWe do not have the answers to these questions. We are being asked to \nvote on something that is almost unknowable in terms of the information \nwe have been given.\n  In my judgment, the issue that presents the greatest potential threat \nto U.S. national security--Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction--has not been addressed in any comprehensive way by the \nadministration to date. Of course, I know we don't need to know all the \ndetails, and we don't have to be given all the details, and we \nshouldn't be given all the details, but we have to be given some kind \nof a reasonable explanation.\n  Before we vote on this resolution, we need a credible plan for \nsecuring WMD sites and not allowing materials of concern to slip away \nduring some chaotic course of action. I know that is a tall order, but \nit is a necessary demand.\n  As I said, I agree with the administration when it asserts that \nreturning to the same restricted weapons inspection regime of the \nrecent past is not a credible policy for addressing the WMD problem in \nIraq. But there is nothing credible about the ``we will figure that out \nlater'' approach we have heard to date.\n  What if actors competing for power in the post-Hussein world have \naccess to WMD? What if there is chaos in the wake of the regime's fall \nthat provides new opportunities for non-state actors, including \nterrorist organizations, to bid on the sinister items tucked away in \nIraq?\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\n  Some would say those who do not unquestionably support the \nadministration are failing to provide for our national security. But, I \nam sure of this: these issues are critical to that security, and I have \nyet to get any answers.\n  We need an honest assessment of the commitment required of America. \nIf the right way to address this threat is through internationally \nsupported military action in Iraq, and Saddam Hussein's regime falls, \nwe will need to take action to ensure stability in Iraq and to help the \ncountry on the road to reconstruction.\n  This could be very costly and time-consuming. It could involve the \noccupation--the occupation--of a Middle Eastern country. Now, this is \nnot a small matter: the American occupation of a Middle Eastern \ncountry. Consider the regional implications of that scenario: the \nunrest in moderate states, the calls for action against American \ninterests, the difficulty of bringing stability to Iraq so we can \nextricate ourselves in the midst of regional turmoil.\n\n  We need much more information about how we propose to proceed so we \ncan weigh the costs and benefits to our national security.\n  In Afghanistan, the Government of President Karzai works under \nconstant threat, and instability plagues the country outside of Kabul. \nMany Afghan people are waiting for concrete indicators that they have a \nstake in this new Taliban-free future. The task is daunting, and we \nonly have just begun that task.\n  What demands might be added in a post-Saddam Iraq?\n  I do believe the American people are willing to bear high costs to \npursue a policy that makes sense. But right now, after all of the \nbriefings, after all of the hearings, and after all of the statements, \nas far as I can tell, the administration apparently intends to wing it \nwhen it comes to the day after, or, as others have suggested, the \ndecade after. I think that makes no sense at all.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe to date the administration has failed to \nanswer the key questions to justify the invasion of Iraq at this time.\n  Yes, September 11 raises the emotional stakes and raises legitimate \nnew questions. This makes the President's request understandable, but \nit does not make it wise.\n  I am concerned the President is pushing us into a mistaken and \ncounterproductive course of action. Instead of, in his words, this \naction being ``crucial to win the war on terrorism,'' I fear it could \nhave the opposite effect.\n  So this moment--in which we are responsible for assessing the threat \nbefore us, the appropriate response, and the potential costs and \nconsequences of military action--this moment is of grave importance. \nYet there is something hollow in our efforts. In all of the \nadministration's public statements, its presentations to Congress, and \nits exhortations for action, Congress is urged to provide this \nauthority and approve the use of our awesome military power in Iraq \nwithout knowing much at all about what we intend to do with it.\n  We are about to make one of the weightiest decisions of our time \nwithin a context of confused justifications and vague proposals. We are \nurged to get on board and bring the American people with us, but we do \nnot know where the ship is sailing.\n  On Monday night, the President said in Cincinnati: ``We refuse to \nlive in fear.'' I agree. But let us not overreact or get tricked or get \ntrapped out of fear, either.\n  Mr. President, on the 11th of September, 2001, our country came under \nattack, and the world suddenly seemed shockingly small and \nunquestionably dangerous. What followed that horror continued to be \nfrightening and disorienting: anthrax attacks, color-coded threat \nlevels, report after report of terrorist cells seemingly everywhere.\n  In the weeks and months since September 11, Americans have had to \ncontend with these changes and to come to grips with the reality this \ncould happen again and there are forces planning to do us harm, and we \ncannot unconditionally guarantee our own safety.\n  In this new world, we cannot help but sense the future is uncertain, \nour world is disordered, unpredictable, up for grabs. So when our \nleaders propose taking action, Americans do not want to resist. But \nthey are resisting this vague and worrisome proposal.\n  My constituents have voiced their concerns in calls, at town \nmeetings, in letters, and through e-mails or faxes. They are not \ncalling for Congress to bury its head in the sand. They are not naively \nsuggesting Saddam Hussein is somehow misunderstood. But they are asking \nquestions that bear directly on our national security, and they are \nlooking for answers that make sense. They are setting the standard, \njust as they should do, in a great democracy.\n  Their standard is high. We should work together to develop a policy \ntoward Iraq that meets it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Texas is present in the Chamber. My \nunderstanding is, she is next to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is right. The Senator from Texas \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Virginia, \nArizona, and Connecticut for all of the efforts being made to bring a \nfull debate on this issue to the Senate.\n  Congress has no greater responsibility under the Constitution than to \nprovide for our Nation's common defense. There is no decision we make \nthat requires more careful consideration than a decision to authorize \nthe use of armed forces and, in so doing, send America's sons and \ndaughters into harm's way.\n  Shortly after I was elected to the Senate, our Nation suffered \nthrough the brutal battle in Mogadishu, Somalia. It left 18 of our \nsoldiers dead. Our mission was vague. There was no clear American \nnational security threat in Somalia. The President did not come to the \nAmerican people and explain the rationale for continued military \ninvolvement.\n  The impact of this uncertainty became very clear to me soon after the \ntragedy when I met a constituent on a flight from Washington, DC, to \nDallas.\n  He came up to me and said: Senator, my name is Larry Joyce. I am your \nconstituent.\n  I said: Hi, Larry, how are you doing? What were you doing in \nWashington?\n  He said: I was burying my son in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  His son Casey had been killed in the street ambush that was depicted \nin the book ``Black Hawk Down,'' also a movie.\n  Colonel Joyce said to me, with tears rolling down his face: Senator, \nI am a military man. I served two tours in Vietnam. And now my son \nCasey, on his first mission as an Army Ranger, is not coming home. \nSenator, I can't tell you why.\n  I vowed that day that I would never vote to send an American into \nbattle unless I could answer that question. I want to be able to face \nany parent and say: This is the national security interest of our \ncountry, and that is why your child signed up and was willing to fight \nand was sent to do so.\n\n  Since Somalia, I have come to the Senate floor to express grave \nreservations about deployments to Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo. In each \ncase, I called on the President to come to Congress, make the case to \nthe American people, and outline the U.S. security interest.\n  After the tragic events of 9/11, President Bush sought and received \nthe authorization to use force to find and destroy the terrorists who \nhad launched that heinous crime. There was no question in my mind and \nin the minds of most Members of Congress that our national security \ndemanded our support of the President.\n  Today, President Bush seeks congressional authorization to use \nmilitary force to deal with the threat Saddam Hussein poses with \nweapons of mass destruction. We must answer the major question for \nAmerica: What is the U.S. security interest? Why Saddam? Why now?\n  It is a question I thought about as I sat among the hushed crowds at \nthe Pentagon's memorial service on September 11, 2002. It was a \npoignant moment. I was surrounded by those who had suffered so much and \nmany who will ultimately bear the consequences of the decision we are \nabout to make.\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\n  I doubt there is anyone in America who doesn't feel as I do. If we \ncould have prevented 9/11, we certainly would have. We didn't have \nwarning, and we paid a heavy price.\n  It is this experience that has led President Bush to think in a \ndifferent way about protecting our homeland. I believe he doesn't want \nto wait until an enemy is finished building his deadly arsenal and \nready to attack from a position of strength. It is one thing to turn \nthree commercial airliners into weapons of mass destruction. It is \nanother to have a nuclear missile ready to deploy or to arm an unmanned \naerial vehicle with anthrax ready to ship anywhere in the world.\n  Each generation of Americans has been called to defend our freedom. \nEach time, our forefathers and mothers have answered the call. Our \ngeneration's time of national trial has come. We are being called to \nstop a new kind of enemy, different from any we have ever fought \nbefore. This enemy is not just contained in one country or two, it is \nspread throughout the world and even within our own borders. This enemy \npurposely kills itself in order to harm others.\n  This enemy is patient, building resources and striking when and where \nwe are least prepared. This enemy uses a different method each time. \nThis enemy requires a new kind of defense. That is what the President \nis attempting to build.\n  The cold war ended when the Iron Curtain and Berlin Wall came \ntumbling down. The post-cold-war era ended when the World Trade Center \ntowers came crashing down. September 11 made it abundantly clear that \nthe strategy of deterrence alone is not enough.\n  The President recently released a new national security strategy. It \narticulates a policy of preemption and dominance. Some fear that our \nnew national security strategy is too bold. A bold defense does not \ncause calamities to occur, but a lack of action will. It is not our \ndefense strategy that will provoke attacks on the United States. \nRather, it is when we fail to act or fail to lead that our enemies \nstrike. It is when they think we have become soft and complacent that \nthey will kill innocent Americans again.\n  We have learned hard and valuable lessons these past few years. The \nfirst terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred in 1993, a \nbombing that killed 6 Americans and injured more than 1,000. What did \nwe do? In 1996, Hezbollah extremists bombed the United States military \nbarracks at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American \nservicemembers and injuring 500 others. What did we do? In 1998, al-\nQaida terrorists bombed the United States Embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania, killing and injuring hundreds. What did we do? In 2000, al-\nQaida terrorists again attacked Americans, this time bombing the U.S.S. \nCole in Yemen, killing 17 American servicemembers and injuring scores \nmore. What did we do?\n  Then came the devastating attacks of 9/11. Our Nation finally was \nawakened. We put the pattern together to see the threat to the very \nfreedom that we cherish. We did do something. We took action against \nour enemy swiftly and boldly after 9/11. Now we must follow through.\n  The President has asked for authority to meet this threat. Congress \ngave him wide latitude to root out terrorism. We and our allies are \ndoing that job in Afghanistan, the home base of al-Qaida.\n  We have liberated millions and millions of innocent Afghanis from the \ncruel Taliban regime.\n  Now the President is asking for authority to go into Iraq. Why Iraq? \nWhy now? Because we have learned the lessons of complacency. We have \nlearned the lessons of not being prepared.\n  The President has solid information that with a small amount of \nhighly enriched uranium, Iraq could have a nuclear weapon in less than \na year. We know Iraq already has the means to deliver it. He has hard \nintelligence that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons and small, \nunmanned aerial vehicles to disseminate them, potentially killing \nthousands of people anywhere in the world. The President is saying: \n``Do we wait for the attack, or do we take steps to prevent it?'' Our \npost-9/11 defense strategy demands that we prevent it.\n  Saddam Hussein has fired on coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly \nzones over Iraq 2,500 times since the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein has \nrewarded the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. He has attempted \nto assassinate the former U.S. President who led the international \ncoalition that defeated him in the Gulf War. His No. 1 enemy is the \nUnited States of America.\n  So if all diplomatic efforts fail, and if the U.N. weapons inspectors \nare not allowed unfettered access to suspected sites, our President \nwants to be able to take away Saddam Hussein's means to destroy us and \nour allies.\n  It is our responsibility to give the President the authorization he \nneeds. The question of whether the security of the United States is \nthreatened has been answered. The answer is yes.\n  It is with a heavy heart and a realization of the consequences that I \nwill vote yes. But it would be a burden I could not carry to vote no \nand then, a year or 2 from now, see a preventable attack kill thousands \nmore innocent Americans or our allies.\n  Mr. President, we are going to meet this test of our generation. We \nare going to protect the freedom and the way of life that has become \nthe beacon to the world of the way life should be. We can do no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator completed her statement?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of Senator Grassley, Senator Graham of Florida be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object. Senator McCain will \naddress the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to repeat that.\n  Mr. REID. I said that following the statement of the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, Senator Graham be recognized. Based on our \nconversations, following that, the Senator from Arizona would like to \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. I add to the request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I at this juncture complete my \nstatement to express strong support for the remarks made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. She has been very much involved in \nthe planning for this resolution, and I very much appreciate her \nremarks.\n  (Mr. REID assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. I say to the Senator from Virginia that I \nappreciate that. We have worked together on this resolution to try to \nensure that the President has the authorization he needs and that \nCongress plays its constitutional role. I appreciate all the \ncooperation on both sides of the aisle to make this happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, pending the arrival of Senator Leahy, I \nask unanimous consent for a colloquy with Senator Specter and \nLieberman. I imagine Senator Leahy will be here shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had discussed briefly with the Senator \nfrom Connecticut a couple of questions, and I would like to engage him \nin a colloquy. The first relates to the difference in language between \nthe 1991 resolution authorizing then-President Bush to use force, which \nsays in pertinent part:\n\n       The President is authorized to use United States Armed \n     Forces, pursuant to resolutions of the UN, in order to \n     achieve implementation of those Security Council resolutions.\n\n  Now, that is different from the authorization in the current \nresolution, which says:\n\n       The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the \n     United States as he determines to be necessary and \n     appropriate.\n\n  The current resolution might be called a subjective standard, which \ngives substantially greater latitude to President Bush to use force \n``as he determines to be necessary and appropriate.'' This language is \nvery much\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\nsubjective as contrasted with the 1991 language, which is more \nobjective, authorizing the President to use force to achieve \nimplementation of certain Security Council resolutions.\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut if the intent here, in trying to \ndevelop some legislative history, notwithstanding the language in the \npresent resolution, is really about the same--or is the same--as the \n1991 resolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his thoughtful question. The intent is the same, although we may \nhave a different understanding of what that intent is. I will say that \nthe operative language here may be somewhat different because the \ncircumstances that engendered the resolution of Congress in 1991 are \ndifferent than now. Then, we had a specific act, which was the Iraq \ninvasion of Kuwait. Resolutions have been passed by the U.N. so that \nthere was specifically reference in the authorizing resolution that \nSenator Warner and I were privileged to cosponsor in 1991.\n  Now we have a totality of circumstances, including the repeated \nviolation of some of those same resolutions, but others calling for \ninspections, calling for the destruction of weapons of mass destruction \nthat Saddam Hussein has. In fact, in the initial suggestion of a \nresolution drafted by the White House, there was an enumeration of \nspecific U.N. resolutions, and Members of Congress negotiating--I \nbelieve from the other body--preferred to have the term that we have in \nthere now, giving the President the power to use the Armed Forces to \nenforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n  In either case, I think what is involved here is an understanding \nboth in the 1991 resolution and in this one that Congress, using its \nauthority under article I of the Constitution to declare war, authorize \nmilitary action, does so and sets the parameters, but that ultimately, \naccording to article II, it is the President who is the Commander in \nChief of the Army, Navy, United States militia of the several States, \nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. Implicit in \nthat has to be the understanding that the President will use the force \nthat he determines to be necessary and appropriate.\n  As I said yesterday, with the authority to give the President comes \naccountability. So, bottom line: There are two different circumstances \nthat engender slightly different resolutions. In each case, Congress is \nfulfilling its responsibility to authorize military action, ultimately, \nwithin the parameters set forth in both resolutions. You have to give \nthe President, as Commander in Chief, the authority to make decisions \nthat he deems to be necessary and appropriate in the defense of our \nnational security, and then be held accountable for those decisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Leahy is now recognized for up to 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, was the Senator from Pennsylvania seeking \nfurther time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask, Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont if I may \npose one more question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will come off Senator Leahy's time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will have no objection to that provided the time is not \ntaken from the time the Senator from Vermont has reserved.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, how long will it take?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Probably less than the time to inquire about it. I will \nask the question in a minute or less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor up to 1 minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The question I have for the Senator from Connecticut is \non the expansive whereas clauses. One of these clauses refers to \nrepression of the civilian population of Iraq. I ask whether the \nresolution intends to give the President the power to use force to cure \nthose kinds of matters, which are separate from the issues of weapons \nof mass destruction, and whether the issue on weapons of mass \ndestruction is satisfied, so that the UN resolutions are satisfied, and \nwhether the clause on authorization relating to defending the national \nsecurity interests of the United States will be satisfied with the \nresolution of the weapons of mass destruction without picking up the \nwhereas clause on regime change.\n  I think that is less than a minute, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I probably should let the Senator from Arizona respond \nbecause he will do it much more quickly than I.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Again, Mr. President, I ask this not be deducted from the \ntime available to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will try to do this within a minute \nand perhaps give time for Senator Specter to clarify this. The whereas \nclauses, the preamble, speak for themselves. It suggests a totality of \ncircumstances that lead the sponsors of the resolution to want to \nauthorize the President, if all else fails, to take military action \nagainst Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\n  Clearly--and what the President has said and what the sponsors of the \nresolution have said--the focus of our concern is the weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. As we said yesterday, this \nresolution is intended to send a message to Saddam: Disarm, as you \npromised to do 11 years ago at the end of the gulf war, or we will use \nforce to disarm you with our allies and the international community.\n  Nonetheless, the other conditions describing the totality of Saddam's \nbrutality--violation of international law, invasion of his neighbors, \net cetera--are stated in the preamble and consistent with what I said \nin response to the earlier question.\n  The President, as Commander in Chief, is given the authority, the \nresponsibility, and accountability to enforce all relevant U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions regarding Iraq. I do not think anyone \nexpects the President to take military action against Iraq if, \nhopefully, and in some sense miraculously, Saddam disarms, destroys his \nballistic missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, allows inspections \nwithout any restrictions. Under those circumstances, it is hard to \nimagine the President would authorize military action, for instance, in \nregard to some of the lesser U.N. resolutions as generally understood \nby this body.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for up \nto 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have enjoyed this colloquy and would \nyield further, but I know there are other Senators awaiting their turn \nto speak.\n  On September 26, I spoke at length in this Chamber about the \nimportant issue before us. I voiced my concerns and the concerns of a \ngreat many Vermonters--in fact, a great many Americans from whom I have \nheard. I spoke about the President's plan to send Americans into battle \nto overthrow Saddam Hussein.\n  Many Senators have also expressed their views on this difficult \ndecision. As I prepared to speak 2 weeks ago, I listened to Senator \nBingaman urge the administration to seriously consider a proposal for \n``coerced inspections.'' After I finished speaking, Senator Johnson \nvoiced his support for providing the President with the broad authority \nhe seeks to use military force against Iraq.\n  The opportunity and responsibility to have this debate is one of the \ncornerstones on which this institution, and indeed this country is \nbuilt. Some have suggested that expressing misgivings or asking \nquestions about the President's plan to attack Iraq is somehow \nunpatriotic. Others have tried to make it an election year issue on \nbumper stickers or in TV advertisements.\n  These attempts are misguided. They are beneath the people who make \nthese attempts and they are beneath the issue. This is an issue of war. \nAn issue of war should be openly debated. That is a great freedom of \nthis Nation. We fought a revolution to have such debates.\n  As I and others have said over and over, declaring war is the single \nmost important responsibility given to Congress. Unfortunately, at \ntimes like this, it is a responsibility Congress has often shirked. Too \noften, Congress has abdicated its responsibility and deferred to the \nexecutive branch on such matters. It should not. It should pause and \nread the Constitution.\n  In the Senate, we have a duty to the Constitution, to our \nconsciences, and\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\nto the American people, especially our men and women in uniform, to ask \nquestions, to discuss the benefits, the risks, the costs, to have a \nthorough debate and then vote to declare war or not. This body, the \nSenate, is supposed to be the conscience of the Nation. We should \nfulfill this great responsibility.\n  In my 28 years in the Senate, I can think of many instances when we \nasked questions and took the time to study the facts. It led to \nsignificant improvements in what we have done here.\n  I can also remember times when Senators in both parties wished they \nhad taken more time to carefully consider the issues before them, to \nask the hard questions, or make changes to the legislation, despite the \nsometimes overwhelming public pressure to pass the first bill that came \nalong.\n  I know following the Constitution is not always politically expedient \nor popular. The Constitution was not designed to be politically \nexpedient, but following the Constitution is the right course to take. \nIt is what we are sworn to do, and there is no question that having \nthis debate, which really began some months ago, has helped move the \nadministration in the right direction.\n  Today, we are considering a resolution offered by Senator Lieberman \nto authorize the use of force. Article I of the Constitution gives the \nCongress the sole power to declare war. But instead of exercising this \nresponsibility and voting up or down on a declaration of war, what have \nwe done? We have chosen to delegate this authority and this burden to \nthe executive branch.\n  This resolution, like others before it, does not declare anything. It \ntells the President: Why don't you decide; we are not going to.\n  This resolution, when you get through the pages of whereas clauses, \nis nothing more than a blank check. The President can decide when to \nuse military force, how to use it, and for how long. This Vermonter \ndoes not sign blank checks.\n  Mr. President, I suppose this resolution is something of an \nimprovement. Back in August the President's advisors insisted that \nthere was not even any need for authorization from Congress to go to \nwar. They said past resolutions sufficed.\n  Others in the administration argued that the United States should \nattack Iraq preemptively and unilaterally, without bothering to seek \nthe support of the United Nations, even though it is Iraq's violations \nof U.N. resolutions which is used to justify military action.\n  Eventually, the President listened to those who urged him to change \ncourse and he went to the United Nations. He has since come to the \nCongress. I commended President Bush for doing that.\n  I fully support the efforts of Secretary Powell to negotiate a \nstrong, new Security Council resolution for the return of weapons \ninspectors to Iraq, backed up with force, if necessary, to overcome \nIraqi resistance.\n  Two weeks ago, when the President sent Congress his proposed \nresolution authorizing the use of force, I said that I hoped his \nproposal was the beginning of a consultative, bipartisan process to \nproduce a sensible resolution to be acted on at the appropriate time.\n  I also said that I could envision circumstances which would cause me \nto support sending U.S. Armed Forces to Iraq. But I also made it clear \nthat I could never support the kind of blank check resolution that the \nPresident proposed. I was not elected to do that.\n  I commend Senator Daschle, Senator Hagel, and others who tried hard \nto work with the administration to craft a bipartisan resolution that \nwe could all support.\n  But while the resolution that we are considering today is an \nimprovement from the version that the President first sent to Congress, \nit is fundamentally the same. It is still a blank check. I will vote \nagainst this resolution for all the reasons I have stated before and \nthe reasons I will explain in detail now.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no dispute that Saddam Hussein is a menace to \nhis people and to Iraq's neighbors. He is a tyrant and the world would \nbe far better without him.\n  Saddam Hussein has also made no secret of his hatred of the United \nStates, and should he acquire a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver \nit, he would pose a grave threat to the lives of all Americans, as well \nas to our closest allies.\n  The question is not whether Saddam Hussein should be disarmed; it is \nhow imminent is this threat and how should we deal with it?\n  Do we go it alone, as some in the administration are eager to do \nbecause they see Iraq as their first opportunity to apply the \nPresident's strategy of preemptive military force?\n  Do we do that, potentially jeopardizing the support of those nations \nwe need to combat terrorism and further antagonizing Muslim populations \nwho already deeply resent our policies in the Middle East?\n  Or, do we work with other nations to disarm Saddam, using force if \nother options fail?\n  The resolution now before the Senate leaves the door open to act \nalone, even absent an imminent threat. It surrenders to the President \nauthority which the Constitution explicitly reserves for the Congress.\n  And As I said 2 weeks ago, it is premature. I have never believed, \nnor do I think that any Senator believes, that U.S. foreign policy \nshould be hostage to any nation, nor to the United Nations. Ultimately, \nwe must do what we believe is right and necessary to protect our \nsecurity, whenever it is called for. But going to war alone is rarely \nthe answer.\n\n  On Monday night, the President spoke about working with the United \nNations. He said:\n\n       To actually work, any new inspections, sanctions, or \n     enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. \n     America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that \n     helps keep the peace. That is why we are urging the Security \n     Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, \n     immediate requirements.\n\n  I could not agree more. The President is right. The status quo is \nunacceptable. Past U.N. resolutions have not worked. Saddam Hussein and \nother Iraqi officials have lied to the world over and over and over. As \nthe President points out, an effort is underway in the U.N. Security \nCouncil--led by the United States--to adopt a strong resolution \nrequiring unconditional, unimpeded access for U.N. weapons inspectors, \nbacked up with force if necessary.\n  That effort is making steady progress. There is wide acceptance that \na new resolution is necessary before the inspectors can return to Iraq, \nand this has put pressure on the other nations, especially Russia and \nFrance, to support our position.\n  If successful, it could achieve the goal of disarming Saddam without \nputting thousands of American and innocent Iraqi lives at risk or \nspending tens of billions, or hundreds of billions, of dollars at a \ntime when the U.S. economy is weakening, the Federal deficit is \ngrowing, and the retirement savings of America's senior citizens have \nbeen decimated.\n  Diplomacy is often tedious. It does not usually make the headlines or \nthe evening news. We certainly know about past diplomatic failures. But \nhistory has shown over and over that diplomatic pressure cannot only \nprotect our national interests, it can also enhance the effectiveness \nof military force when force becomes necessary.\n  The negotiations are at a sensitive stage. By authorizing the use of \nforce today, the Congress will be saying that irrespective of what the \nSecurity Council does, we have already decided to go our own way.\n  As Chairman and sometime Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee for over a decade, I have received countless letters from \nSecretaries of State--from both Democratic and Republican \nAdministrations--urging Congress not to adopt legislation because it \nwould upset ongoing negotiations. Why is this different?\n  Some say the President's hand will be strengthened by Congress \npassing this resolution. In 1990, when the United States successfully \nassembled a broad coalition to fight the gulf war, the Congress passed \na resolution only after the UN had acted. The world already knows that \nPresident Bush is serious about using force against Iraq, and the votes \nare there in Congress to declare war if diplomatic efforts fail and war \nbecomes unavoidable.\n  More importantly, the resolution now before the Senate goes well \nbeyond what the President said on Monday about working through the \nUnited Nations. It would permit the administration to take precipitous, \nunilateral action without following through at the U.N.\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\n  Many respected and knowledgeable people--former senior military \nofficers and diplomats among them--have expressed strong reservations \nabout this resolution. They agree that if there is credible \nevidence that Saddam Hussein is planning to use weapons of mass \ndestruction against the United States or one of our allies, the \nAmerican people and the Congress would overwhelmingly support the use \nof American military power to stop him. But they have not seen that \nevidence, and neither have I.\n\n  We have heard a lot of bellicose rhetoric, but what are the facts? I \nam not asking for 100 percent proof, but the administration is asking \nCongress to make a decision to go to war based on conflicting \nstatements, angry assertions, and assumption based on speculation. This \nis not the way a great nation goes to war.\n  The administration has also been vague, evasive and contradictory \nabout its plans. Speaking here in Washington, the President and his \nadvisors continue to say this issue is about disarming Saddam Hussein; \nthat he has made no decision to use force.\n  But the President paints a different picture when he is on the \ncampaign trail, where he often talks about regime change. The Vice \nPresident said on national television that ``The President's made it \nclear that the goal of the United States is regime change. He said that \non many occasions.''\n  Proponents of this resolution argue that it does put diplomacy first. \nThey point to section 4, which require the President to determine that \nfurther diplomatic or other peaceful means alone will not adequately \nprotect the national security, before he resorts to military force. \nThey say that this ensures that we will act only in a deliberative way, \nin concert with our allies.\n  But they fail to point out that the resolution permits the President \nto use unilateral military force if he determines that reliance on \ndiplomacy along.\n\n     . . . is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq . \n     . .''\n\n  Unfortunately, we have learned that ``not likely'' is a wide open \nphrase that can be used to justify just about anything. So let us not \npretend we are doing something we are not. This resolution permits the \nPresident to take whatever military action he wants, whenever he wants, \nfor as long as he wants. It is a blank check.\n  We have the best trained, best equipped Armed Forces in the world, \nand I know they can defeat Iraq. I hope, as we all do, that if force is \nused the Iraqi military surrenders quickly.\n  But if we have learned anything from history, it is that wars are \nunpredictable. They can trigger consequences that none of us would \nintend or expect. Is it fair to the American people, who have become \naccustomed to wars waged from 30,000 feet lasting a few weeks with few \ncasualties, that we not discuss what else could happen? We could be \ninvolved in urban warfare where large numbers of our troops are killed.\n  And what of the critical issue of rebuilding a post-Saddam Iraq, \nabout which the Administration has said virtually nothing? It is one \nthing to topple a regime, but it is equally important, and sometimes \nfar more difficult, to rebuild a country to prevent it from becoming \nengulfed by factional fighting.\n  If these nations cannot successfully rebuild, then they will once \nagain become havens for terrorists. To ensure that does not happen, do \nwe foresee basing thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq after the war, and \nif so, for how many years? How many billions of dollars will we spend?\n\n  Are the American people prepared to spend what it will take to \nrebuild Iraq even when the administration is not budgeting the money \nthat is needed to rebuild Afghanistan, having promised to do so? Do we \nspend hundreds of billions in Iraq, as the President's Economic Adviser \nsuggested, while not providing at home for homeland defense, drought \naid for farmers, education for our young people, and other domestic \npriorities?\n  Who is going to replace Saddam Hussein? The leading coalition of \nopposition groups, the Iraqi National Congress, is divided, has \nquestionable support among the Iraqi people, and has made little \nheadway in overthrowing Saddam. While Iraq has a strong civil society, \nin the chaos of a post-Saddam Iraq another dictator could rise to the \ntop or the country could splinter along ethnic or religious lines.\n  These are the questions the American people are asking and these are \nthe issues we should be debating. They are difficult issues of war and \npeace, but the administration, and the proponents of this resolution, \nwould rather leave them for another day. They say: vote now! and let \nthe President decide. Don't give the U.N. time to do its job. Don't \nworry that the resolution is a blank check.\n  I can count the votes. The Senate will pass this resolution. They \nwill give the President the authority he needs to send United States \ntroops to Iraq. But before the President takes that step, I hope he \nwill consider the questions that have been asked. I hope he considers \nthe concerns raised by former generals, senior diplomats, and \nintelligence officials in testimony before Congress. I hope he listens \nto concerns raised privately by some of our military officers. Above \nall, I hope he will listen to the American people who are urging him to \nproceed cautiously and not to act alone.\n  Notwithstanding whatever disagreements there may be on our policy \ntoward Iraq, if a decision is made to send troops into battle, there is \nno question that every Member of Congress will unite behind our \nPresident and our Armed Forces.\n  But that time has not yet come. Based on what I know today, I believe \nin order to solve this problem without potentially creating more \nterrorists and more enemies, we have to act deliberately and not \nprecipitously. The way the United States responds to the threat posed \nby Iraq is going to have consequences for our country and for the world \nfor years to come.\n  Authorizing a U.S. attack to overthrow another government while \nnegotiations at the United Nations are ongoing, and before we exhaust \nother options, could damage our standing in the world as a country that \nrecognizes the importance of international solutions. I am afraid that \nit would be what the world expects of a superpower that seems \nincreasing disdainful of international opinion or cooperation and \ncollective diplomacy, a superpower that seems more and more inclined to \n``go it alone.''\n  What a dramatic shift from a year ago, when the world was united in \nits expressions of sympathy toward the United States. A year ago, the \nworld would have welcomed the opportunity to work with us on a wide \nagenda of common problems.\n  I remember the emotion I felt when I saw ``The Star Spangled Banner'' \nsung by crowds of people outside Buckingham Palace in London. The \nleading French newspaper, Le Monde, declared, ``We are all Americans.'' \nChina's Jiang Zemin was one of the first world leaders to call \nWashington and express sympathy after September 11.\n  Why squander the goodwill we had in the world? Why squander this \nunity? If September 11 taught us anything, it is that protecting our \nsecurity involves much more than military might. It involves \ncooperation with other nations to break up terrorist rings, dry up the \nsources of funding, and address the conditions of ignorance and despair \nthat create breeding grounds for terrorists. We are far more likely to \nachieve these goals by working with other nations than by going it \nalone.\n  I am optimistic that the Administration's efforts at the U.N. will \nsucceed and that the Security Council will adopt a strong resolution. \nIf Saddam Hussein refuses to comply, then force may be justified, and \nit may be required.\n  But we are a great nation, with a wide range of resources available \nto us and with the goodwill of most of the world. Let us proceed \ndeliberately, moving as close to our goal as we can by working with our \nallies and the United Nations, rather than writing a blank check that \nis premature, and which would continue the trend of abdicating our \nconstitutional authority and our responsibility.\n  Mr. President, that trend started many years ago, and I have gone \nback and read some of the speeches the Senators have made. For example, \nand I quote:\n\n       The resolution now pending is an expression of American \n     unity in this time of crisis.\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\n       It is a vote of confidence . . . but is not a blank check \n     for policies that might in the future be carried on by the \n     executive branch of the Government without full consultation \n     by the Congress.\n\n  Do these speeches sound familiar? They were not about Iraq. They were \nspoken 38 years ago when I was still a prosecutor in Vermont. At the \nend of that debate, after statements were made that this resolution is \nnot a blank check, and that Congress will always watch what the \nExecutive Branch is doing, the Senate voted on that resolution. Do you \nknow what the vote was? 88 to 2. It passed overwhelmingly.\n  In case everyone does not know what resolution I am talking about, I \nam talking about the Tonkin Gulf resolution. As we know all too well, \nthe Tonkin Gulf resolution was used by both the Johnson and Nixon \nadministrations as carte blanche to wage war on Vietnam, ultimately \ninvolving more than half a million American troops, resulting in the \ndeaths of more than 58,000 Americans. Yet, even the Tonkin Gulf \nresolution, unlike the one that we are debating today, had a sunset \nprovision.\n  When I came to the Senate, there were a lot of Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, who had voted for the Tonkin Gulf \nresolution. Every single Senator who ever discussed it with me said \nwhat a mistake it was to write that kind of blank check on the \nassurance that we would continue to watch what went on.\n  I am not suggesting the administration is trying to mislead the \nCongress about the situation in Iraq, as Congress was misled on the \nTonkin Gulf resolution. I am not comparing a possible war in Iraq to \nthe Vietnam war. They are very different countries, with different \nhistories, and with different military capabilities. But the key words \nin the resolution we are considering today are remarkably similar to \nthe infamous resolution of 38 years ago which so many Senators and so \nmany millions of Americans came to regret.\n  Let us not make that mistake again. Let us not pass a Tonkin Gulf \nresolution. Let us not set the history of our great country this way. \nLet us not make the mistake we made once before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, late last night in a colloquy between \nmyself and the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Oregon read into \nthe Record portions of a letter addressed to Senator Graham, chairman, \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, signed by George Tenet. I ask \nunanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record today, \nfollowed by a statement issued by Mr. Tenet bearing on his \ninterpretation and intent in writing that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your letter of 4 October \n     2002, we have made unclassified material available to further \n     the Senate's forthcoming open debate on a Joint Resolution \n     concerning Iraq.\n       As always, our declassification efforts seek a balance \n     between your need for unfettered debate and our need to \n     protect sources and methods. We have also been mindful of a \n     shared interest in not providing to Saddam a blueprint of our \n     intelligence capabilities and shortcoming, or with insight \n     into our expectation of how he will and will not act. The \n     salience of such concerns is only heightened by the \n     possibility for hostilities between the U.S. and Iraq.\n       These are some of the reasons why we did not include our \n     classified judgments on Saddam's decisionmaking regarding the \n     use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in our recent \n     unclassified paper on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction. \n     Viewing your request with those concerns in mind, however, we \n     can declassify the following from the paragraphs you \n     requested.\n       Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of \n     conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against \n     the United States.\n       Should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer \n     be deterred, he probably would become much less constrained \n     in adopting terrorist actions. Such terrorism might involve \n     conventional means, as with Iraq's unsuccessful attempt at a \n     terrorist offensive in 1991, or CBW.\n       Saddam might decide that the extreme step of assisting \n     Islamist terrorists in conducting a WMD attack against the \n     United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by \n     taking a large number of victims with him.\n       Regarding the 2 October closed hearing, we can declassify \n     the following dialogue.\n       Senator Levin: . . . If (Saddam) didn't feel threatened, \n     did not feel threatened, is it likely that he would initiate \n     an attack using a weapon of mass destruction?\n       Senior Intelligence Witness: . . . My judgment would be \n     that the probability of him initiating an attack--let me put \n     a time frame on it--in the foreseeable future, given the \n     conditions we understand now, the likelihood I think would be \n     low.\n       Senator Levin: Now if he did initiate an attack you've . . \n     . indicated he would probably attempt clandestine attacks \n     against us . . . But what about his use of weapons of mass \n     destruction? If we initiate an attack and he thought he was \n     in extremis or otherwise, what's the likelihood in response \n     to our attack that he would use chemical or biological \n     weapons?\n       Senior Intelligence Witness: Pretty high, in my view.\n       In the above dialogue, the witness's qualifications--``in \n     the foreseeable future, given the conditions we understand \n     now''--were intended to underscore that the likelihood of \n     Saddam using WMD for blackmail, deterrence, or otherwise \n     grows as his arsenal builds. Moreover, if Saddam used WMD, it \n     would disprove his repeated denials that he has such weapons.\n       Regarding Senator Bayh's question of Iraqi links to al-\n     Qa'ida, Senators could draw from the following points for \n     unclassified discussions:\n       Our understanding of the relationship between Iraq and al-\n     Qa'ida is evolving and is based on sources of varying \n     reliability. Some of the information we have received comes \n     from detainees, including some of high rank.\n       We have solid reporting of senior level contacts between \n     Iraq and al-Qa'ida going back a decade.\n       Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qa'ida have \n     discussed safe haven and reciprocal non-aggression.\n       Since Operation Enduring Freedom, we have solid evidence of \n     the presence in Iraq of al-Qa'ida members, including some \n     that have been in Baghdad.\n       We have credible reporting that al-Qa'ida leaders sought \n     contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire WMD \n     capabilities. The reporting also stated that Iraq has \n     provided training to al-Qa'ida members in the areas of \n     poisons and gases and making conventional bombs.\n       Iraq's increasing support to extremist Palestinians, \n     coupled with growing indications of a relationship with al-\n     Qa'ida, suggest that Baghdad's links to terrorists will \n     increase, even absent US military action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John McLaughlin\n     (For George J. Tenet, Director).\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Statement by DCI George Tenet, October 8, 2002\n\n       There is no inconsistency between our view of Saddam's \n     growing threat and the view as expressed by the President in \n     his speech. Although we think the chances of Saddam \n     initiating a WMD attack at this moment are low--in part \n     because it would constitute an admission that he possesses \n     WMD--there is no question that the likelihood of Saddam using \n     WMD against the United States or our allies in the region for \n     blackmail, deterrence, or otherwise grows as his arsenal \n     continues to build. His past use of WMD against civilian and \n     military targets shows that he produces those weapons to use \n     not just to deter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I give my reasons for my vote \non this resolution, I would like to point out some ironies and \ninconsistencies in some positions of some of my colleagues.\n  It is not unusual for Senators to be inconsistent in positions taken, \nbut in recent weeks we have had some colleagues blaming the \nadministration for not responding to the pre-9/11 warnings of possible \nterrorist attacks on the United States. I am talking about the warnings \nof whether or not the CIA and the FBI had information about that and \nwhether or not the President had access to that information. The \ninsinuation is that maybe the President knew more than what he did and, \nwhy didn't he do something about 9/11?\n  It seems to me the same colleagues are now refusing to support the \nPresident's call to disarm Saddam Hussein. The President is trying to \npreempt Saddam Hussein from unleashing on Americans his weapons of mass \ndestruction. Yet my colleagues who are inconsistent in this way \napparently want the President to wait until we are attacked again. I \nask, if you were expecting preemption before September 11, 2001, why \nwouldn't you expect the President to preempt an attack on the United \nStates today?\n\n[[Page S10155]]\n\n  I come to the floor today to share my thoughts concerning the \nresolution before the Senate. Again we find ourselves in the midst of \nan important debate with one of the most important decisions that many \nSenators will make in our lifetime. The issue of war and peace involves \nthe threats to the lives of the men and women we send to battle. This \nissue may even involve threats to the American civilian population, as \nwell.\n  It was just a little more than a decade ago that many Members were \nhere making similar decisions in regard to the Persian Gulf war.\n  As many of my colleagues may remember, I was just one of two Senate \nRepublicans who opposed the resolution authorizing military action \nagainst Iraq in 1991. I voted against that resolution because I \nquestioned the timing of military action while diplomatic measures and \neconomic sanctions had just been started. I felt they needed a chance \nto work. Opposing the resolution was a difficult decision, but one that \nI have never regretted.\n  While today's decision is not one to be taken lightly, it stands in \nstark contrast to that of 1991. While I opposed that resolution for the \nreasons I stated, I intend to support the compromise resolution before \nus because I believe the time to hold Saddam Hussein accountable is \npast due.\n  But, this is not the first time since 1991 that Congress has approved \na resolution approving military action against Iraq.\n  In 1998, by unanimous vote by the Senate and an overwhelming 407-6 \nvote in the House, Congress approved a resolution, and subsequently \nPresident Clinton bombed Iraq in December of 1998.\n  Let us see how forthrightly the Senate spoke at that time about the \ndangers of Iraq and Saddam Hussein.\n  I speak from page 2 of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. It says in \nsection 3:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace the regime.\n\n  It is pretty clear we knew about the threat of Saddam Hussein under a \nDemocratic President--President Clinton--with a bipartisan action by \nconsensus of this body. Why should anybody be surprised if President \nClinton and the Senate, in a bipartisan way, would be expressing the \nsame concern 4 years later?\n  What was the basis of that overwhelming vote? Primarily, it was \nbecause Iraq has kicked United Nations weapons inspectors out, as they \ndid in 1998. Today we have a lot of intelligence information saying it \nis a far more dangerous situation today, and particularly for the \nUnited States.\n  Thousands of Americans were killed in that 9/11 attack by terrorists.\n  Iraq is aligned with those terrorists, and Iraq is building weapons \nof mass destruction. We must, therefore, respond appropriately.\n  One of the most pressing concerns expressed by my constituents over \nthe past few months is that of timing. The question: Why now? The \nquestion: Why can't we continue to pursue inspections and other \ndiplomatic measures? They are legitimate questions. Many of my \ncolleagues will answer this differently than I will. But the response \nfor me is quite simple. I believe the actions by Saddam Hussein over \nthe past 10 years builds a strong case why firm action is needed and \nwhy we cannot afford as a Congress delaying a decision any longer.\n  None of this precludes inspections or diplomatic missions. But these \nalternatives demand full cooperation by Iraq if a military response is \nto be withheld.\n  However, during the past 10 years, the international community has \nworked with Iraq through diplomatic efforts, various inspection \nregimes, economic sanctions, and even limited military force in an \neffort to encourage Saddam Hussein to abide by the very resolutions he \nagreed to at the end of the gulf war. He agreed to follow these within \nthe rule of law--the international rule of law. We can legitimately \nexpect any person to agree to follow those agreements.\n  Yet Saddam Hussein has consistently and convincingly evaded and \ndefied those obligations he agreed to.\n  In the spring of 1991, the United Nations Security Council agreed to \nResolution 687, which required Saddam Hussein to destroy his chemical \nand biological weapons and to unconditionally agree not to acquire or \ndevelop nuclear weapons. That same resolution also demanded Iraq not \ndevelop or acquire any weapons of mass destruction. However, the CIA \nreported Iraq is continuing to develop and acquire chemical and \nbiological weapons.\n  The report states since the United Nations weapons inspectors left in \n1998, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort and invested even \nmore heavily in biological weapons.\n  In addition, the CIA estimated Iraq could develop nuclear weapons in \nthe near term with the proper supply of material.\n  United Nations Resolution 687 also required Saddam Hussein to end his \nsupport for terrorism and to prohibit terrorist organizations from \noperating inside the borders of Iraq.\n\n  Yet there is clear evidence Iraq has provided safe haven to a number \nof prominent, international terrorists. Iraq has provided assistance to \nterrorist organizations whose sole purpose is to disrupt and prevent \npeace efforts in the Middle East.\n  Most importantly, fleeing al-Qaida members now reside in Iraq. Of \ncourse, it is only a matter of time before these two enemies of the \nUnited States join forces--and maybe they already have.\n  Altogether, Saddam has defied at least 16 United Nations resolutions \nduring the past decade. He has manipulated U.N. weapons inspectors, \ntortured and repressed Iraqi people, supported international \nterrorists, and violated United Nations economic sanctions.\n  So he continues to thumb his nose at the world, and particularly the \nrule of law under the international regimes we all respect.\n  The issue is as much about protecting people as it is about enforcing \nthe international rule of law. But enforcing international rule of law \nis one way to eliminate chaos so people can live peacefully.\n  Will the United Nations take a stand in defense of their very own \nresolutions and hold Saddam Hussein accountable? Will the United \nNations resolutions, which seek to provide peace and security in the \nregion, continue to be unenforced?\n  This resolution before the Senate then asks the United Nations: Does \nthe organization want to be relevant during the 21st century, an \ninstrument of peace in this century, or does it somehow want to fade \naway as the League of Nations did because of its failures in Abyssinia \nin the 1930s?\n  I want, and I hope all my colleagues want, the U.N. to be relevant. I \nwant the U.N. to lead. Its moral leadership is important. We have to \ndiscourage tin-horn dictators from violating the rule of law. The time \nfor accountability is right now.\n  According to former President Clinton, in a speech on December 16, \n1998:\n\n       Heavy as they are, the costs of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and \n     we fail to respond, we will face a far greater threat in the \n     future. Saddam will strike again at his neighbors. He will \n     make war on his own people. And mark my words, he will \n     develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and \n     he will use them.\n\n  That is what President Clinton said in a speech on December 16, 1998.\n  Former President Clinton's words are very applicable to the situation \nnow, even 4 years later.\n  I have also heard concerns from people who question this resolution, \nsaying that by supporting it, we are supporting preemptive military \naction against a sovereign nation. However, for the last decade, the \nUnited States and allied forces have patrolled no-fly zones in northern \nand southern Iraq to protect Kurdish and Shiite minority populations \nfrom Saddam Hussein, and all the while they have been fired upon by \nIraq's military.\n  These are American pilots. Some of them have been Iowans because over \nthe past 6 years the Iowa Air National Guard has completed five 90-day \nmissions and will likely be needed for a sixth mission before the end \nof this year. And as the President stated earlier this week, the \nAmerican and British pilots have been fired upon more than 750 times. \nIn a sense, we have been involved in military action in Iraq since the \n1991 gulf war. So what is contemplated by this resolution cannot be \ndescribed as preemptive.\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\n  Some of my constituents have also questioned the effect this will \nhave on our war on terrorism. I believe that forcing Iraq to disarm is \npart of the war against terrorism and is consistent with the war on \nterrorism. Iraq has already been labeled by previous administrations as \na state sponsor of terrorism. Iraq is one of seven nations to be \ndesignated by our own State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nAnd given Iraq's support for international terrorists and its support \nfor efforts to provide safe haven for al-Qaida, it is clear that this \neffort should not be seen as separate from the war on terrorism but \nvery much an integral part of the war on terrorism.\n  It is because of our obligations to enforce international law, and to \ndisarm this threat to our national security and to the security of the \nentire world, that I have decided to support the resolution offered by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Warner.\n  A decade ago, as I said, I opposed war with Iraq because I believed \nwe had not exhausted all alternatives available at that time. Today, I \nsupport this resolution because we have exhausted all other remedies, \nunless somehow Saddam Hussein has a change of heart. After years of \nevasion, after years of defiance, the time has come to stand firm and \nenforce the resolutions to disarm Iraq. Or, on the other hand, it is \ntime for Saddam Hussein to repent and fully cooperate. But his track \nrecord in that regard is not very promising.\n  It is important to keep in mind that this resolution before the \nSenate does not guarantee military action, nor do I think it should. \nBut it does authorize the use of United States military forces to \ndefend the national security of the United States against this \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq and to enforce all relevant U.N. \nresolutions regarding Iraq. In other words, this is as much about \nenforcing the rule of law as a policeman in Washington, DC, would \nenforce the domestic rule of law to prevent chaos and to encourage law-\nabiding citizenry, as it is about military action, at least from my \nstandpoint.\n\n  Most importantly, this resolution makes clear that if the United \nNations fails to ensure full compliance with international law, we will \nnot sit quietly and let this tinhorn dictator ignore the rule of law. \nAt the same time, we will be sending the message to other tinhorn \ndictators around the world that they had better not violate the \ninternational rules of law.\n  The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, dispelled notions of \nAmerica's invincibility, it placed greater demands on our Government to \nprotect and defend American citizens, and it put more demand on \nAmerican citizens themselves to look out for their own safety, as a \nJerusalem-type terrorist bombing could happen in New York City or \nWashington, DC, as much as it happens in Jerusalem.\n  My resolve is stronger than ever to win the war on terrorism, protect \nU.S. citizens, secure the homeland, and, most importantly, defend \nAmerican values and our way of life. By supporting this resolution, we \nwill send a strong signal to the United Nations, as well as our friends \nand allies around the world, that we will not sit idly by and allow a \nruthless dictator to violate international law and threaten the \nsecurity of that region and, in fact, impact the whole world. This \nresolution says to the world community that America stands together, \ncommitted to the rule of law and the security of all nations.\n  So, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution \noffered by our colleagues, Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I believe there is an order. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to speak for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nstrong and thoughtful statement and for his expression of intention to \nvote for this resolution--all the more significant, as he pointed out, \nbecause he was one of two Republican Members of the Senate to vote \nagainst the similar resolution prior to the gulf war. And I think his \nsupport--a respected and solid Member of the Senate, as he is--gives \nencouragement to those of us who are the sponsors of this resolution \nthat when the final roll is called, we will enjoy the broad bipartisan \nsupport that I truly believe this resolution deserves and the moment \nrequires.\n  I thank my colleague and the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I alert Members that at 1:30 or a quarter \nto 2, thereabouts, there will be a vote. Knowing that the Senator from \nArizona usually does not speak for long periods of time, it will \nprobably be closer to 1:30. There will be a vote on the Graham \namendment, the pending amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment which \nI have offered which will increase the authority of the President of \nthe United States to use force to protect the people of the United \nStates.\n  This amendment will designate a set of international terrorist \norganizations for whom the President does not now have the authority to \nuse force as within the range of his authority.\n  There has been a lot of discussion over the past several months about \nconnecting the dots, seeing a pattern out of what might appear to be \nisolated independent events. It is always easier to do that after the \ndisaster, after September 11, than it is before. I consider us today as \nstanding before the event has occurred, and I think we can begin to see \nthe pattern of the dots today. What are those dots? What is that \npattern?\n  First, a new element has been added to our assessment of national \nsecurity risk. That is the element of what is the risk to Americans in \nthe homeland. When we went to war in Korea, we did not ask the \nquestion: What will this mean to our people at home? We did not ask \nthat question in Vietnam. We did not ask that question when we voted \ntogether to authorize the President to use force in the Persian Gulf. \nThis is a new phenomenon in the paradigm of American and national \nsecurity consideration.\n  The second dot is, who poses the greatest risk inside the homeland? \nIn my judgment, it is those nations, organizations, and persons who \npossess three primary characteristics: One, access to weapons of mass \ndestruction; two, a hatred for the United States; and three, a \nsignificant presence of trained operatives within the United States. It \nis that triumvirate which makes our enemy lethal.\n  The third dot, that we have the opportunity to reduce the risk of \nthat triumvirate. We can do it by rolling up the terrorists here at \nhome, or we can do it by cutting off the support which the terrorists \nare receiving from abroad. I suggest we ought to be doing both.\n  If we are going to effectively attack over there, it requires we have \nthe resources, a strategy, and the authorization to use the force \nagainst our enemy over there.\n  The next dot is a surprising dot. It is essentially a void. Unlike \nmany Members of this Chamber--and I will cite one who just a few \nmoments ago gave a speech in which he implied the President of the \nUnited States today has the authority to take on international \nterrorists who meet these requirements: Access to weapons of mass \ndestruction, hatred of the United States, and a significant presence \ninside the United States of America. The answer is, no, the President \ntoday does not have such authority. In my judgment, the Congress should \ngrant this authority and do so concurrent with the granting to the \nPresident his power to use force in Iraq, because it is that act of \ngiving the authority to commence war in Iraq that is going to raise the \nrisk of those terrorists among us attacking.\n  Those are the dots I see. That is the sequence I think the dots lead \nus to.\n  There is one thing we agree upon, and that is that Saddam Hussein is \nan evil man. He is a tyrant. He has used\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\nchemical and biological weapons on his own people. He has disregarded \nUnited Nations resolutions calling for inspections of his capabilities \nand research and development programs. His forces regularly fire on \nAmerican and British jet pilots enforcing the no-fly zones in the north \nand south of his country. And he has the potential to develop and \ndeploy nuclear weapons, a potential that we need to monitor closely.\n  Saddam Hussein lives in a tough neighborhood. It is a neighborhood in \nwhich the United States has a number of commitments and threats. The \nunderlying resolution suggests Saddam Hussein is the ultimate bully, \nthe baddest dog in this rough neighborhood, and that taking him out now \nand for good is in the Nation's highest priority.\n  I respectfully disagree. And in so disagreeing, I am, or at least I \nwas, joined by the President of the United States and the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Less than 13 months ago, 9 days after the terrorist attack of \nSeptember 11, the President declared our top national priority to be a \nwar on terrorism. This is what he said:\n\n       Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida but it does not end \n     there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global \n     reach has been found, stopped and defeated.\n\n  In his State of the Union speech on January 29 of this year, \nPresident Bush restated our priority:\n\n       Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and \n     persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we \n     will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and \n     bring terrorists to justice. And, second, we must prevent the \n     terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the \n     world.\n\n  That is what the President said on January 29.\n  Just Monday of this week, on the anniversary of the commencement of \nthe war in Afghanistan, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \nrecommitted himself to the war on terrorism. The Secretary repeated the \nstatement he had made one year earlier:\n\n       Our objective is to defeat those who use terrorism \n     and those who house or support terrorists. The campaign \n     will be broad, sustained, and we will use every element of \n     American power.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense proceeded to say:\n\n       Today, Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for \n     terrorists, but there is no question that free nations are \n     still under threat. Thousands of terrorists remain at large \n     in dozens of countries. They're seeking weapons of mass \n     destruction that would allow them to kill not only thousands \n     but tens of thousands of innocent people. Our objective in \n     the global war on terror is to prevent another September \n     11th, or an attack that is far worse, before it happens.\n\n  The war on terrorism did not begin in Afghanistan. For us, it began \nin the United States of America on September 11th, 2001. It began and \nit continues in our homeland. As we assess the many challenges faced by \nthe United States--and Saddam Hussein is clearly among those \nchallenges--we must ask: What is our greatest responsibility? In my \nopinion, the answer is easy: Securing the peace and safety of the \nhomeland or our great Nation.\n  And what is the most urgent threat to our peace and security? In my \njudgment, it is that shadowy group of international terrorists who have \nthe capabilities, the materials, conventional and weapons of mass \ndestruction, the trained core of zealots united by their hatred for the \nUnited States, and the placement of many of those bombthrowers so they \nare sleeping among us, waiting for the order to assault.\n  For the better part of 2 years, 19 of those killers took silent \nrefuge in the sanctuary of the United States, silent refuge until they \nstruck us on September 11. Three thousand twenty-five innocent lives \nlater, we have learned the bitter lesson of the power of those who live \ndual lives in our communities. To the outside they were appearing to be \nunexceptional, while they were prepared to do the most unimaginable \nevil. Those who committed mass murder left behind a much larger number \nof terrorists, continuing their dual existence of duplicity.\n\n  How many of these are there, Mr. President? What are the skills they \npossess? What are their plans and intentions? Why are they so driven by \nhatred? The answer is we know only dimly.\n  Unfortunately, our ability to tear out these weeds from our home \ngarden is limited because the attention we have paid to understanding \nthis enemy next door has been grossly inadequate.\n  The Inspector General at the Department of Justice issued a report \njust last month, in September. That report concluded:\n\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation serves as the Federal \n     Government's principal agency for responding to and \n     investigating terrorism.\n\n  But the IG report went on:\n\n       The FBI has never performed a comprehensive, written \n     assessment of the risk of a terrorist threat facing the \n     United States.\n\n  So we arm for battle with a shield of ignorance at home. \nUnfortunately, one of the realities of the startup of the proposed \nDepartment of Homeland Security is that, for at least a transition \nperiod, Americans will be even more vulnerable in the homeland. \nAgencies such as the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, Immigration Service, \nwhich will play a key role in protecting our perimeter defenses, will \nbe distracted as organizational relationships of decades or more are \nreshuffled. And a final increased vulnerability is the likelihood that, \nif war starts and intensifies in Iraq, this very conflict thousands of \nmiles away could spark a wake-up call to action from the sanctuaries of \nthe Middle East and Central Asia to the sleepers in your hometown.\n  Mr. President, I refer you to the front-page story in today's \nWashington Post, which talks about the possibility of counterattacks in \nthe United States after a war commences in Iraq.\n  The first prong of our defense here in the homeland, which is to root \nout the terrorists among us--both because of the instability of the \ndays through which we are and will be living and our lack of \npreparation through the quality of intelligence we need--is not a \nshield that should give us great hope.\n  Thus, the importance of a second strategy for disrupting and \ndecapitating the enemy among us--attacking them at their source, just \nas we have done with such devastating effectiveness against al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan. One of the reasons the anticipated second, third, and \nfourth wave of terrorist acts have not occurred since September 11 is \nthe military assault we began on October 7, 2001, has largely \ndismantled the command-and-control operations of al-Qaida, making it \nmore difficult for them to support and provide financing and logistics \nto their large number of operatives in the United States.\n  I believe we need to adopt a similar strategy of disruption and \ndismantlement. What is it going to take to do so? First, it is going to \nrequire the President of the United States have the authority to use \nthat necessary force to dismantle, as he said in his State of the Union \nspeech, the terrorist camps, terrorist plans, and the command-and-\ncontrol centers of these organizations. Here we come to a point of \nwidespread confusion, and that is the President already has this \nauthority.\n  On Sunday afternoon, a prominent foreign policy spokesman appeared \nimmediately after Senator Shelby and myself on a talk show and, in \npassing in the hallway, she said, ``I support the position that you \nhave taken that we need to go after these international terrorists, but \ndoesn't the President already have the authority to do so?'' I quickly \nexplained that the answer was no. I think she was stunned at the \nvulnerability we have and by the limited authority the President has.\n\n  Our colleague, the Senator from Texas, today in her remarks implied \nshe thought the President of the United States had the authority to \nattack international terrorism broader than those who are directly \nlinked to the events of September 11.\n  If I might say, the very language of the resolution we are \nconsidering today carries the same inference.\n  The language of the resolution states that:\n\n       Acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with the \n     United States and other countries continuing to take the \n     necessary actions against international terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations, including those who planned, \n     authorized, committed, or aided in the terrorist attack that \n     occurred on September 11.\n\n  The fact is the only group the President has authority to use force \nagainst is those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the \nterrorist attack that occurred on September 11. The\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\nPresident specifically was denied the authority to take on the other \nterrorist groups who, in my judgment, represent the greatest threat \ninside the American homeland today.\n  Let me just give a little bit of history. On September 12, President \nBush requested robust authority to launch a full-scale war on terror. \nHe sent to the Congress a proposed resolution which stated:\n\n       The President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or \n     persons he determines planned, authorized, harbored, \n     committed, or aided in the planning or commission of the \n     attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and \n     to deter and preempt any future acts of terrorism or \n     aggression against the United States.\n\n  That is what the President asked for on September 12, 2001. But \nCongress demurred. They only granted the President the power to use \nnecessary force related to those nations or organizations and persons \nwhich were determined to be connected to the tragedy of September 11. \nAl-Qaida was not only our bull's-eye, it was the totality of the \ntarget. Two days after the Congress gave the President this limited \nauthority, President Bush, on September 20, expanded the scope of the \nwar:\n\n       In a joint session of Congress, our war on terror begins \n     with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end \n     until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, \n     stopped, and defeated.\n\n  From that point until today, Mr. President, the stated mission of the \nUnited States in the war on terror has fallen well beyond the authority \nwe have given to the President of the United States to deliver on that \nmission.\n  The President continues:\n\n       . . . to be limited to those nations, organizations, and \n     persons who can be indicted as conspirators and participants \n     in September 11.\n\n  This limited authority to use force has made it possible for America \nand our allies to crush the Taliban and severely cripple al-Qaida. The \namendment I offer would extend that power to the President to use \nnecessary force through the next still vigorous and violent band of \nterrorists.\n  Against whom would the President by this amendment be given power to \nuse force? The State Department has identified 34 international \nterrorist organizations, approximately two-thirds of which are in the \nregion of the Middle East and central Asia. They list five, in addition \nto al-Qaida, that have these characteristics: They currently receive \nsupport from a state that possesses weapons of mass destruction; they \nhave a history of hating and killing Americans; and they have the \nability today to strike within the United States of America.\n  Who are these groups? I will name them and then talk about the A \nteam: The Abu Nidal organization, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance \nMovement, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the Palestine Liberation \nFront.\n  Who is the A team? The A team is Hezbollah, ``the party of God.'' \nHezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of \nLebanon. This organization, which is based primarily in Lebanon and \nSyria and financed from Iran, is a radical Shi'a group which takes its \nideological inspiration from the Iranian revolutions and teachings of \nAyatollah Khomeni.\n  Hezbollah formally advocates the ultimate establishment of Islamic \nrule in Lebanon and liberating all occupied Arab lands, including \nJerusalem. It has expressed as a goal the elimination of Israel. \nAlthough closely allied with and closely directed by Iran, the group \nmay have conducted operations that were even beyond those approved by \nthe Government of Iran.\n  While Hezbollah does not share the Syrian regime's secular \norientation, the group has been a strong tactical ally in helping Syria \nadvance its political objectives in the region.\n  What are some of the activities of Hezbollah? It is known or suspect \nto have been involved in numerous anti-U.S. terrorist attacks, \nincluding the suicide truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in \nApril of 1983; the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983; the \nU.S. Embassy annex in Beirut in September of 1984; three members of \nHezbollah are on the FBI's list of the 22 most wanted terrorists for \nthe hijacking of TWA flight 847 during which a U.S. Navy diver was \nmurdered; elements of the group are responsible for the kidnaping and \ndetention of U.S. and Western hostages.\n  The group also attacked the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in 1992 and \nis suspect in the 1994 bombing of the Israeli Cultural Center in Buenos \nAires, and the Senator from Texas stated, in her judgment, they were \nalso responsible for Khobar Towers.\n  This group receives a substantial amount of financial, training, \nweapons, explosives, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and \nreceives diplomatic, political, and logistical support from Syria. \nHezbollah has a significant presence of its trained merchants of death \nplaced in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, you will note that several of these organizations \ngravitate around one axis of evil: Iran. And not surprisingly.\n  Yesterday, October 8, former FBI Director Louis Freeh testified \nbefore the joint inquiry on the attacks of September 11 which are being \nconducted by the House and Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Freeh \ncited the conclusions of the National Commission on Terrorism that:\n\n       Iran remains the most active state supporter of terrorism. \n     The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Ministry of \n     Intelligence and Security have continued to be involved in \n     the planning and execution of terrorist acts. They also \n     provide funding, training, weapons, logistical resources, and \n     guidance to a variety of terrorist groups, including the \n     Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, \n     and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\n  My amendment says that those five groups should also be brought \nwithin the ambit of evil that the President of the United States should \nbe entitled to use force against to protect the security of the people \nof the United States of America.\n  What strategy should be used against the designated international \nterrorist groups? The decision will be left to the President. The \nCongress invested its confidence in the judgment of the President on \nSeptember 18 of last year when it gave him the power to use force \nagainst the Taliban and al-Qaida. If the underlying resolution is \nadopted, he will have the authority to use force against Iraq.\n  This amendment will give the President the next stage of powers which \nhe will be required to have in order to wage war on terror and to do so \nto a successful conclusion. The President would have the authority and \nthe subsequent accountability to use these three authorities in \nwhatever sequence and with whatever impact he deems to be in our \nnational interest.\n  In this stage on the war on terror, the President has already \nfashioned a war plan: To take out the training camps, the incubators \nfrom which in the 1990s thousands of youth were given the skills and \nthe determination to be hardened assassins; to attack the terrorists' \nplans, to disrupt and dismantle.\n  Many of these operations, and particularly the training camps, are \nflourishing today in the orbit of Iran. We should empower the President \nto take those acts that are going to be necessary to protect the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Director Freeh, in his remarks yesterday, spoke of the need for a \nfull arsenal of weapons to triumph over terrorists. Director Freeh \nsaid:\n\n       We must recognize the limitations inherent in a law \n     enforcement response. As we see at this very moment in \n     history, others, to include Congress, must decide if our \n     national will dictates a fuller response.\n\n  I am not prepared to say the only response I want against these five \norganizations that have access to weapons of mass destruction, that \nhave a history of killing Americans and have a capability to do so here \nat home because of a significant presence of their operatives among us, \nthat we are going to tell the President of the United States that he \ndoes not have the authority to attack with force these terrorists \ngroups where they live and to disband and dismantle their capability of \ncontinuing to provide support to their agents in the United States.\n  I believe our national will and our obligation to the security of the \nAmerican people, especially their security on our native soil, demand a \nfuller response to meet this fuller challenge.\n  I conclude by saying that I am not optimistic about the prospects for \nthis amendment, but I am deeply concerned, and I am deeply saddened. I \nam concerned in part because I see us making life-and-death decisions \nwithout\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\nconsideration because we do not have access to what might be critical, \nand I would suggest determinative, information. I believe the national \nsecurity interests are being put at risk by this information not being \navailable.\n  I am saddened because I fear the action we are going to take will \nincrease the risk at home without increasing our capability to respond \nto that risk.\n  I have been described as a cautious man. I will accept that label. I \ndo not see the world as a simple set of blacks and whites. I see the \nworld as a complex of grays. That leads to caution. I believe that \ncaution today is to recognize that we are not dealing with one evil, as \nevil as Saddam Hussein might be. We are dealing with a veritable army \nof evils.\n  We must be prepared to respond to that army of evils. I believe the \nstep we can take today is to give to the President of the United States \nthe opportunity to exercise his judgment as to whether he believes it \nwould be appropriate to use U.S. force against these five international \nterrorist groups which represent, in my judgment, the most serious \nurgent threat to the interests of the United States of America, \nincluding a threat to Americans at home.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nthe thoughtful statement he has made. I agree with so much he has said, \ncertainly about the threats that are represented by the terrorist \ngroups cited in his amendment, but I want to explain why I have \nreluctance about the amendment. It is for reasons that are both \nprocedural and substantive.\n  The resolution offered by Senator McCain, Senator Warner, Senator \nBayh, myself, and others--including the occupant of the Chair, the \nSenator from Georgia--is the result of a detailed, open, and sincere \nprocess of negotiation between Members of both Chambers, both parties, \nand the White House.\n  This is not to say it is a perfect document, but in responding to the \nthreat to our national security posed by Iraq under the leadership of \nSaddam Hussein, it represents our best effort to find common ground to \ndispatch our constitutional responsibility and to provide an \nopportunity for the broadest bipartisan group of Senators to come \ntogether and express their support of action to enforce the United \nNations resolutions that Saddam Hussein has constantly violated, and in \nso doing endangered his neighbors, his people and, of course, the rest \nof the world, including us. We have a well-worked-over and finely \ncalibrated document.\n  In his amendment, the Senator from Florida has opened new territory, \nand I am reluctant to see that added to this resolution, all the more \nso since the new territory he opens up was considered in the immediate \naftermath of the attacks against us on September 11 when the initial \nresolution in which the President sought to have authority to take \naction against terrorists generally--not just those who had planned, \nauthorized, committed, or aided terrorist attacks that occurred on \nSeptember 11 of last year--was rejected or was opposed by a large \nnumber of Members of the Senate, including particularly those on the \nDemocratic side, and in that sense the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Florida may well reopen concerns expressed by many Senate \nDemocrats about granting too much authority to the President at this \npoint.\n\n  Let me get to the essence of what is said. Clearly, I agree with what \nthe Senator has said, and I agree wholeheartedly with his description \nof the terrorist groups he has cited, specifically five in number, and \nthe extent to which they represent a threat to the areas in which they \noperate, as well as the American people.\n  I respectfully disagree with him that the President of the United \nStates would not be authorized, without this action, to take action \nagainst any of these groups--the Abu Nidal organization, Hamas, \nHezbollah, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Palestinian Liberation Front--if \nthe President, as Commander in Chief, concluded that any one of those \ngroups or its members posed a threat to the security of the American \npeople or any group of Americans. It seems to me that is inherent in \nthe authority given to the President, as Commander in Chief, under \narticle II, section 2 of the Constitution, followed by other \ndescriptions of the authority that the President has in that regard, \nand not just the general constitutional authority but the specific acts \nof this Congress that have dealt with terrorism and have established a \ncounterterrorism center at the Central Intelligence Agency, \ncounterterrorism programs in the FBI, counterterrorism activities in \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of State, all of them \nfunded by Congress.\n  Implicit in that is not that the money was funded just to study or \ninvestigate but that there is a presumption that if all of those \nprograms produce evidence that any one of those groups is seeking to do \ndamage to any one of the American people or group of Americans, then \nthe President is authorized implicitly, inherently, in his authority as \nCommander in Chief to take action against them. In fact, as has been \ntestified to publicly, the Special Operations Forces of our military, \nan extraordinary group we are fortunate to have in our service, has \nbeen working on programs together with the intelligence community and \nvarious nations around the world to watch--using the term ``watch'' in \nthe broadest sense of the term--and be prepared to take specific \naction, not just court action.\n  After September 11, we have made a transition to understanding that \nterrorists are at war with the United States so there are times when \nthe best defense we can give is not to build a case in court but to \ntake military action to stop the terrorists from striking before they \never do.\n  So while I appreciate and support the concerns of the Senator from \nFlorida, my own conclusion is that they would do some damage to the \nbroad support that otherwise will come together for the resolution that \nwe have introduced that deals with the immediate problem of Saddam \nHussein, and that in the end it is not necessary because the President, \nas Commander in Chief, has the inherent authority, under the \nConstitution and the laws of the United States, to take exactly the \naction that the Senator's amendment would specifically authorize him to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of our \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut and therefore I will not \nelaborate given the shortage of time.\n  I say to my colleague from Florida, I am very impressed by his \nstatement today. I think there is merit to be found. I draw the \nSenator's attention to Public Law 107-40. As the Senator recalls, that \nis the amendment that the Congress adopted on September 14, 2001, and \nthat dealt with the authorization for use of military force against \nthose responsible for the recent attacks against the United States.\n  It seems to me that particular statute and that body of law is the \nplace where an amendment like that of the Senator from Florida should \nbe placed, and I say that with all due respect.\n  My further added observation is that our Secretary of State is now \nbusily engaged at the United Nations with regard to the possible \nframework of a possible 17th resolution. The draft amendments before \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives are indeed the subject of \nthose discussions.\n  At this time, to broaden that base could well in some respects \njeopardize the efforts on behalf of the United States and others to \ncraft a tough resolution directed clearly at the weapons of mass \ndestruction, Saddam Hussein, and those surrounding his regime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will reserve a few moments to close when others who \nwish to speak on this motion to table have completed their remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I inform my friend from Florida, under the \nnormal procedures, as soon as I made a motion to table, the vote would \nbegin. But if the Senator from Florida would like for me to ask \nunanimous consent for him to speak up to how many minutes he would like \nto before the vote, I would be pleased to propound that.\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut want to speak again?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut be permitted to speak for 2 minutes without my losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. From the text of the resolution we have submitted in \nsection 4(b) after our authorization, we require, as soon as feasible, \nbut not later than 48 hours after exercising such authority--that is, \ndirectly deploying forces of the United States--that the President has \nto make available to the Congress his determination that--and there are \ntwo sections he has to report. The material section is this: The \nPresident has to declare to Congress that pursuant to this resolution--\nwhich is to say deploying forces for the purpose of enforcing U.N. \nresolutions against Iraq in protecting the national security of the \nAmerican people against Iraq--is consistent with the United States and \nother countries continuing to take the necessary actions against \ninternational terrorist and terrorist organizations, including those \nnations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, \nor aided terrorists in the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\n  I stress that this is not limited to those terrorists who acted \nagainst us on September 11.\n  I see in this further support for the end goal, which the Senator \nfrom Florida has, which is to make sure the war against Iraq does not \ndeter our war against terrorism and not just against al-Qaida but \nagainst any terrorist group that threatens the people of the United \nStates, including the five the Senator from Florida enumerated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks and making the motion to table the Graham amendment, Senator \nGraham be recognized for up to 10 minutes, and immediately following \nthat, the vote occur on my motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Florida for his \nthoughtful statement about the threat of terrorist organizations of \nglobal reach posed to American national security. The Senator from \nFlorida has devoted much of his time and professional energies to \ninvestigating the terrorist threat in great detail as chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for the superb job he has done as chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee in probably the most trying times this \ncountry has experienced since World War II--from an intelligence \nstandpoint, perhaps the most difficult times. And I am grateful we have \na man of his caliber in a leadership role. He is an eloquent and \nthoughtful spokesman on these issues.\n  I agree that ultimately the war on terrorism will not be won until we \nhave ended these groups' murderous activities and held them accountable \nfor killing American citizens.\n  However, I must oppose the amendment because it provides our \nCommander in Chief with authority he has not requested. It is highly \nunusual for Congress to provide the President the authority to use \nmilitary force to defend American security against a particular threat \nwhen the President himself has not requested such authority.\n  For the President to determine that the terrorist organizations \nlisted in the Senator's amendment posed an imminent danger to the \nUnited States, and if the President requested congressional \nauthorization to use military force to deal with that danger, I don't \ndoubt Congress would have full consideration or debate to provide that \nauthority.\n  It does seem unusual in a time of war, and in response to the \nPresident's request for congressional authorization to confront a \nthreat he has identified as imminent, for Congress to identify and \ngrant the President the authority to use military force to confront a \ndifferent enemy.\n  The Graham amendment would increase beyond what was requested by the \nadministration the scope of authority provided to the President. \nIncluding these groups in the resolution, unfortunately, muddies the \nstrong message the United States must send to the United Nations \nSecurity Council and the world that we are intent on dealing with the \nthreat posed by Iraq.\n  The President wants a strong statement authorizing the use of force \nagainst Iraq. He understands the value of an overwhelming congressional \nvote to American diplomacy and to demonstrating American seriousness to \nthe world.\n  The pending resolution represents a carefully crafted, bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement on providing the President with the authority to \nuse force against Iraq. This amendment is the product of negotiations \nbetween the Speaker of the House, Congressman Gephardt, the Democrat \nleader, and the White House. It was carefully crafted. We intentionally \nintroduced the exact same language so that when the other body passes \nit and we pass it, it will be the exact same message. Modifying that \nagreement could reopen issues that otherwise have been resolved and \nwould unnecessarily slow down consideration of a resolution that the \nPresident has requested and made clear is an urgent priority for his \nadministration.\n  Yesterday, when asked about the amendment, Secretary Powell stated \nthat Congress should focus in on the threat posed by Iraq. The \nSecretary also made clear the administration's desire that both Houses \nof Congress pass identical resolutions to send a message to the world \nthat we are united in our resolve to confront Saddam Hussein and to \nsend a message to Iraq that we are serious about doing so.\n  The administration opposes the Graham amendment on procedural \ngrounds. The President has requested congressional authorization to use \nall means necessary to protect American national security against the \nthreat posed by Iraq. For this body to supercede the President's \nrequest by identifying other threats to American national security--I \ncould come up with a long list of such threats myself--would send a \nconfused message to the American people and the world as we come \ntogether to end the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  Some have argued that the President's determination to hold Iraq to \naccount would undermine the global war against al Qaeda. I believe this \nis a false argument, for as the president has said, Iraq and al Qaeda \nare two faces of the same evil. The Graham amendment would expand our \nglobal campaign to target not just al Qaeda but several of the most \nsophisticated terrorist organizations on earth. I would assume that \nanyone who worries about diversions from the war on terrorism would \nvote against expanding that war at this time.\n  I want to stress, however, that ultimately the war on terrorism will \nnot be won until we have dealt with the threat posed by terrorist \ngroups with global reach such as Hezbollah. Hezbollah and other \norganizations listed in the Graham amendment have killed Americans and \ndeserve no quarter. They ultimately represent a grave threat to \nAmerica--a threat that will not diminish until we have dismantled these \norganizations and held them accountable for murdering Americans.\n  The pending resolution is not the proper vehicle for this debate. I \nlook forward to working with the Senator from Florida to address the \nthreat posed by Hezbollah and the other terrorist organizations he has \nlisted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the request of our Commander in Chief \nby tabling the Graham amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe White House.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, October 9, 2002.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for asking the \n     Administration's position on the Graham amendment to the Iraq \n     Resolution. The Administration opposes it.\n       The Lieberman-Warner-Bayh-McCain amendment represents a \n     carefully crafted bipartisan, bicameral agreement on \n     providing the President with use-of-force authority against \n     Iraq. The Graham amendment would\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\n     increase--beyond what was requested by the Administration--\n     the scope of authority provided to the President, and \n     introduce additional elements to the resolution. Modifying \n     the agreement now, as the Graham amendment would, could \n     reopen issues otherwise resolved and unnecessarily slow \n     consideration of this important resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Nicholas E. Calio,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                          for Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Florida that the administration's \nmessage is very clear that they do not disagree with his assessment of \nthe threat. He is held in the highest regard by all who have observed \nhis distinguished work as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I thank my friend from Florida for his contributions. I know that in \nthe days ahead he and I will be joining together with other Members of \nthis body in addressing the serious threats to American national \nsecurity which he has so eloquently described in his statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughtful remarks of the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Arizona. The Senator from \nArizona concluded with the hope that we may soon be working together on \nexpanding our efforts to reach those who threaten us here at home. I \nonly hope we will not have another 3,025 Americans unnecessarily \nexposed to the risks that I see if we do not supplement this resolution \nwith the immediate authority of the President to use force against \nthose organizations which have access to weapons of mass destruction, \nwhich have killed Americans, and which have substantial numbers of \noperatives inside the United States of America at this hour. I invite \nanybody to say Iraq doesn't meet those standards.\n  We are not talking about a threat 90 days from now. We are not \ntalking about a threat that may come a year from now if nuclear \nmaterial is made available. I am talking about a threat that can happen \nthis afternoon.\n  Let us trace the history of what Congress did. The President asked \nfor this authority on September 12, 2001. We denied it.\n  When I was in law school, one read the legislative history to try to \narrive at legislative intent. It seems to me, just as a first-year-law \nlegislative interpretation, that probably doesn't mean giving the \nPresident authority beyond that which is specifically provided. \nTherefore, the President of the United States, in my judgment, does not \nhave the authority today to use force against Hezbollah or these other \ngroups.\n  But even beyond the legal limits, let us talk about the pragmatics. \nThe President of the United States in his State of the Union Address on \nJanuary 29 said our first priority was terrorists--our first priority. \nAnd do you know what the first priority of the first priority was? The \ntraining camps. Why did he say that? Because those who were responsible \nsaid if there was one major mistake we made in the 1990s, it was \nallowing al-Qaida training camps to be a sanctuary where every year \nthousands and thousands of young people were converted into hardened \nassassins.\n\n  If that is the criticism we are going to have, because in the 1990s \nwe allowed that to go on month after month and year after year, what is \ngoing to be our excuse today when similar training camps are in \noperation in Iran, Syria, and Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon? And \nwe are not going to give the President of the United States the \nauthority to use force against those camps? It is inconceivable to me. \nThe very fact that the President, recognizing this, has not acted \nagainst those camps is, in my judgment, the strongest verification that \nhe doesn't think he has the authority to do so.\n  I believe it is not in our national interest to leave this question \nambiguous. We want to deter groups such as Hezbollah from continuing to \naid, or to provide aid, comfort, and support to their operatives who \nare placed in the United States. Until we reach the point that we can \ndomestically, through law enforcement means and domestic intelligence, \nlocate and eradicate those operatives who are in this country, we must \npursue as aggressively as possible to cut off their support system.\n  I cannot believe we are saying we are not prepared today to make an \nunambiguous decision. We don't want to have the Hezbollah going to \ntheir lawyers and asking the question, What is the legislative \ninterpretation of what Congress did on September 18, 2001? Does it put \nus under the gun? I don't want them to have that in their mind. I want \nthem to know, with the clearest method we can write in English and that \ncan be interpreted in all the languages these people speak, that we \nmean they are under the gun, and they are under the gun now.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about urgency. Why do we need to \ndo things now? Why can't we wait for 60 days?\n  Let me tell you why we cannot afford to wait. We are taking an action \nby authorizing the President to take action against Saddam Hussein. I \nwill stand first in line to say he is an evil person. But we, by taking \nthat action, according to our own intelligence reports--and, friends, I \nencourage you to read the classified intelligence reports which are \nmuch sharper than what is available in declassified form--we are going \nto be increasing the threat level against the people of the United \nStates. I think we have a moral and legal obligation to at the same \ntime be taking what reasonable steps we can to confront that increased \nvulnerability.\n  If you do not like what I am suggesting, if you do not think we ought \nto give the President authority to use force against groups such as \nHezbollah, what do you think we ought to do? Or do you disagree with \nthe premise that we are going to be increasing the threat level inside \nthe United States?\n  If you disagree with that premise, what is the basis upon which your \ndisagreement is predicated? If you reject that, and believe that the \nAmerican people are not going to be at additional threat, then, \nfrankly, my friends--to use the term--blood is going to be on your \nhands. I think we are going to be at substantially greater threat.\n  I think there are some things we ought to be doing now. We certainly \nshould be escalating the FBI intelligence and other efforts to root out \nthe terrorists who are among us. But we also ought to be attacking the \nterrorists where they live because it is on the offensive--not the \ndefensive--in my judgment, that we are going to eventually win this war \non terror.\n\n  My friends, as I said, I am not optimistic about the adoption of \nthis. I recognize there are backroom deals made. This is what people \nhave come together on and locked down on, and say: We are locking down \non the principle that we have one evil, Saddam Hussein. He is an \nenormous, gargantuan force, and that is whom we are going to go after.\n  That, frankly, is an erroneous reading of the world. There are many \nevils out there, a number of which are substantially more competent, \nparticularly in their ability to attack Americans here at home, than \nIraq is likely to be in the foreseeable future.\n  But we are going to say we are going to ignore those and we are going \nto allow them to continue to fester among us. I do not wish to be part \nof that decision. I am concerned by those who see only one evil, who \nbelieve we must all commit ourselves to the arrangement that has been \nmade by a few who have that view of the world. I urge my colleagues to \nopen there eyes to the much larger array of lethal, more violent foes \nwho are prepared today to assault us here at home.\n  I said in my closing remarks that I was concerned and saddened. I am \nsaddened because I know my colleagues would not knowingly place U.S. \nlives in unnecessary peril. I am as sure as I have ever been of \nanything in my life, the peril here in America caused by the action we \nare about to take could be substantially reduced by giving to the \nPresident of the United States the additional powers to send the \nstrongest possible message, and, if necessary, the force to eradicate \nthose who are evil and who have placed evildoers among us, and who are \nprepared to awaken those evildoers to attack. The responsibility is \nours.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question, first?\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator \nfrom Florida, but the Senator from Arizona and I came to the Congress \ntogether. And I hope that my friend from Florida was not implying the \nSenator from Arizona was involved in any backroom deals because I have \nnever known the Senator from Arizona to be involved in any backroom \ndeals.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have been singularly unsuccessful in orchestrating any \nbackroom deals in the years I have served here, I say to my friend from \nNevada. And I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending Graham amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to table Graham \namendment No. 4857.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

So if cloture is achieved, we would go \nfor whatever length of time to accommodate Senators who wish to be \nheard under the rules of cloture.\n  We would expect, therefore, a vote on final passage on the resolution \nprior to the time we leave this week. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, shortly I will yield to my distinguished \nsenior colleague, Mr. Thurmond, for not to exceed--what time does he \nwant?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nmy senior colleague, Mr. Thurmond, for not to exceed 5 minutes, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10162-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10162-S10164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JUDGE DENNIS SHEDD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage at \nyesterday's proceedings in the Judiciary Committee. In an unprecedented \nmove, Chairman Leahy violated committee rules and removed the \nnomination of Judge Dennis Shedd from the agenda. On a procedural vote, \nthe committee refused to consider Judge Shedd's nomination.\n  I am hurt and disappointed by this egregious act of destructive \npolitics. Chairman Leahy assured me on numerous occasions that Judge \nShedd would be given a vote. I took him at his word.\n  Dennis Shedd is a fine judge who has received a rating of well \nqualified by the American Bar Association. President Bush nominated him \nto the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on May 9, 2001, but his hearing \ndid not take place until June 27 of this year. Since that time, he has \nanswered all questions asked of him.\n  For over 17 months, I have waited patiently. On July 31, Chairman \nLeahy stated publicly before the Judiciary Committee that we had \nreached a solution regarding Judge Shedd that would be satisfactory. \nThe chairman's recent actions are not only unsatisfactory, but they are \nunacceptable. In my 48 years in the Senate, I have never been treated \nin such a manner.\n  Mr. President, I hope this situation will be corrected and that Judge \nShedd will soon be confirmed as a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from West Virginia if \nhe will be kind enough to allow me to respond to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, as the name of my friend, Senator Leahy, \nwas mentioned on several occasions.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. REID. A few minutes; 6 or 7 minutes at most.\n  Mr. BYRD. Not to exceed 7 minutes. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand that Senator Thurmond is \ndisappointed that the Judiciary Committee was not able to proceed on \nJudge Dennis Shedd's nomination at its meeting this week. We all have \ngreat respect for Senator Thurmond and I know that the committee is \nworking toward a committee vote on the Shedd nomination.\n  The Judiciary Committee has continued to receive opposition from \nSouth Carolina and from African American and other civil rights \norganizations and leaders from around the country to the Shedd \nnomination. Senators are taking those concerns seriously and being \nthoughtful and deliberate in reaching their own conclusions.\n  Over the past weeks, the committee--led by Chairman Leahy who has \ndone such an outstanding job--has received hundreds of letters from \nindividuals and organizations, both in and out of South Carolina, \nexpressing concerns about elevating Judge Shedd, and these letters \nraise serious issues. Many of these letters have arrived in just the \nlast week or so. The committee has just received a letter from the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, citing the \ninterests of the many Latinos living in the Fourth Circuit, and \nexpressing opposition to Judge Shedd. A letter arrived recently from \nthe Black Leadership Forum asking for more time to consider the \nnomination. It was signed by a number of well respected African \nAmerican leaders, including the forum's chairman, Dr. Joseph Lowery, \nand over a dozen other nationally recognized figures. In recent weeks, \nState legislators from Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \nMaryland, have written with their misgivings about the elevation of \nJudge Shedd. And hundreds, probably thousands, of letters from South \nCarolina citizens have been arriving that urge a closer look at Judge \nShedd's fitness for this job.\n  Senator Leahy was correct in his judgment that beginning the debate \non the nomination of Judge Shedd on Tuesday morning would not have \nresulted in a final vote, but might well have prevented committee \naction on 17\n\n[[Page S10163]]\n\nother judicial nominees of this President. Indeed, as it was, \nRepublicans almost prevented those 17 judicial nominations and six \nexecutive branch nominations from being reported before the end of that \nbusiness session.\n  Unfortunately, this partisan procedural maneuvering obstructed the \ncommittee from reaching any items on the legislative agenda, even the \nsimplest consensus items of significant importance. Republican Senators \neven objected to granting consent to an amendment of the American \nLegion charter. I understand that today Republicans boycotted a \nbusiness meeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I understand that at Senator Thurmond's request, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing fro Judge Shedd who has a lifetime appointment \nto the District Court in south Carolina. Judge Shedd's hearing was the \nsecond for a nominee to the Fourth Circuit since the reorganization of \nthe committee in the summer of 2001.\n  In fact, no judge was confirmed to the fourth Circuit during the last \n30 months of Republican majority control even though there were \nnominees of significant qualifications. Neither Judge James Beaty, \nJudge Rich Leonard, Judge James Wynn, Judge Roger Gregory, Judge Andre \nDavis or Elizabeth Gibson received a hearing or a vote from the \nRepublican majority on their nominations to the Fourth Circuit.\n  In contrast, the first nominee on which the Judiciary Committee held \na hearing in July 2001 and the first confirmed after the change in \nmajority was a Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Gregory.\n  In addition, the Committee worked hard to consider and report the \nnomination of Judge Terry Wooten to be a Federal district court judge \nin South Carolina at the request of Senator Thurmond. Judge Wooten's \nnomination was not without controversy but with hard work and \nperseverance the committee was able to report that nomination to the \nSenate and the Senate confirmed Judge Wooten last November.\n  The committee also expedited consideration of Strom Thurmond, Jr., to \nbe the U.S. Attorney for south Carolina last fall, under tremendous \npressure to Senator Leahy.\n  During the last 15 months, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings \non over 100 judicial nominees, voted on 100 and reported 98. The Senate \nhas confirmed 80 to date with 18 more on the calendar, as we speak. \nThat is more hearings for more nominees and more votes on nominees and \nmore confirmations of more nominees than in the last 30 months in which \nRepublicans controlled the Senate.\n  The Judiciary Committee is doing a good job of helping reduce the \njudicial vacancies it inherited from the Republicans when they delayed \nand obstructed President Clinton's nominees.\n  I understand Senator Thurmond's disappointment, but he has to \nunderstand Senator Leahy is doing an outstanding job. And I and the \nrest of the Democrat conference totally support this good man, the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from West Virginia to \nallow me 5 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, for not to exceed 5 \nminutes--I hope this will be the last request--not to exceed 5 minutes, \nand that I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis courtesy. I appreciate it.\n  I listened to these remarks, and I am outraged. I know they were not \nwritten by any staffer for Senator Reid, and they are not accurate. I \nthink we have had very disdainful treatment of one of the most \nprestigious and important Senators in the history of this body.\n  Let's think about it. Yesterday, Chairman Leahy denied a vote on \nDennis Shedd, President Bush's nominee for the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, the nominee from South Carolina. This action was outrageous \nbecause yesterday may very well have been the last markup Senator \nThurmond, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who cares \nvery deeply about Judge Shedd's nomination, was able to attend.\n  The committee rules are very clear. They allow an agenda item held \nover from 1 week, which Judge Shedd was held over, to be brought up on \nthe next agenda. He was held over on September 19 on that markup agenda \nby the Democrats.\n  Yesterday, Chairman Leahy, in violation of committee rules, removed \nJudge Shedd from the agenda. This is not right. To my knowledge, that \nis the first time that has ever happened. It may have happened before, \nbut I do not remember it.\n  What makes this even more unusual and has our Members outraged is \nthat we operate in the Senate under a presumption that a Senator's word \nis as good as gold. Chairman Leahy assured several Republican \nSenators--our leader, Senator Thurmond, Senator Grassley, Senator \nBrownback, and myself--that Judge Shedd would get a vote. He promised \nthat to me, and all of these others. It is fair to say the entire \nRepublican caucus expected a vote yesterday on Judge Shedd.\n  There is no doubt about Judge Shedd's qualifications. He has strong \nbipartisan support. One of his most ardent supporters from South \nCarolina is none other than my dear friend and colleague, Senator Fritz \nHollings. The people of South Carolina support him. The ABA, long held \nto be the gold standard by the Democrats, gave him a well-qualified \nrating. So it is not Judge Shedd's qualifications that are standing in \nthe way. Simply put, there is no good reason that Judge Shedd did not \nget a vote at yesterday's markup.\n  In accordance with the rules, I moved to have a vote. The chairman \nruled it out of order. It was a 9-to-9 vote, not sustaining his \nposition but basically not allowing the vote.\n  The real reason Judge Shedd was not on the agenda was there are \nliberal special interest groups in this city that seem to have lock-\nstock control over the Judiciary Committee. When I was chairman, I \nnever ceded control to any of these outside groups. In fact, I told \nthem to get lost. I have to say I paid a big price for it, too. It is \natrocious that ceding of control is happening now.\n  With regard to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and those nominees \ncited by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, they did not have home \nState senatorial support. We cannot do much about that when there is \nnot home State senatorial support, which has always been a courtesy \nthat has been extended.\n  Think about it. Judge Shedd has been waiting for almost 18 months. \nNow all of a sudden, at the last minute, we come up with all of these \nlame excuses to not give him a vote. All we were asking for was a vote \nin accordance with the rules of the Senate--a vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee and then a vote on the floor--for a man who used to be chief \nof staff of the Judiciary Committee, who was sponsored by one of the \nmost dignified and important Senators in the history of this body. Just \none committee vote and a floor vote.\n  If they want to vote him down, they can do that, but Senator Thurmond \ndeserved the benefit of the doubt. He deserved the privilege of having \na vote on his nominee, especially since this nominee has waited for \nalmost 18 months. He was peppered with all kinds of questions. He \nanswered them. He did everything he possibly could. He has a wonderful \nreputation. He had it when he was on the committee. What is more, every \nmember of that committee who sat when he was here knows it.\n  Now this is wrong. It is wrong to treat a senior Senator like this. \nIt is wrong to treat a distinguished Federal district court judge like \nthis. It is wrong to break the rules. It is wrong to break them with \nimpunity. And I think it is wrong to treat the President's nominees \nthis way.\n  To make a long story short, virtually everything that was said \nyesterday and even today was not very accurate. I would ask that this \nbody reconsider, that my friends on the other side----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for 30 seconds more, and I will finish.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield an additional minute to the Senator, \nunder the same conditions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am grateful to my colleague.\n  I ask for simple courtesy from the other side. Give us an up-or-down \nvote on Dennis Shedd. Everybody who is on the Judiciary Committee knows \nthis man, and I think most others in the Senate know this man and know \nwhat a good person he is. But everybody knows Senator Thurmond, that he \nis an honest, decent man, and he deserves this kind of courtesy, \nespecially at the end of the longest, most distinguished career in the \nSenate.\n  I thank my dear colleague from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10164-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10164-S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AGAINST IRAQ--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take the floor at this time to urge the \njoint leadership of the Senate to delay the vote on cloture which is \nset this moment for 10:15 tomorrow morning. I urge the leadership of \nthis body to consider and to help bring about an order that will \nvitiate that vote on cloture tomorrow morning at 10:15.\n  I make my plea on behalf of the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and \ngrandfathers of this country, the fate of whose sons, daughters and \ngrandchildren hinges upon the outcome of the vote on cloture; shutting \noff the debate of this Senate, shutting it down to 30 hours, with each \nSenator to have only 1 hour unless other Senators can be prevailed upon \nto seek unanimous consent to yield that Senator additional time, with \nthe exception of the managers, the majority leader, and the minority \nleader, who have an additional 2 hours automatically.\n  What is involved is the fate of the service men and women in this \ncountry who may have to go to Iraq, the fate of the reserves, the fate \nof our National Guardsmen and Guardswomen in this country who may have \nto go to Iraq.\n  This decision is going to be made no later than 10:15 tomorrow \nmorning unless it is changed. This is a fateful decision. It involves \nthe treasure of this country. It involves the blood of our fighting men \nand women. It is too momentous and too far reaching a decision to be \nsigned, sealed, and delivered by 10:15 tomorrow morning.\n  I know it is in accordance with the rules of the Senate. Nobody knows \nthe rules of the Senate more than I do, and nobody has used the rules \nof the Senate more than I have in past years. But I say that this rule, \nwhich is perfectly within order, should be set aside because of the \nfateful, momentous, and far-reaching implications and ramifications of \nthis vote.\n  If we go through with this vote, Senators are going to have 1 hour \neach, up to 30 hours, and only amendments which are germane can be \noffered. This is too much, and I appeal to the sense of justice, the \nsense of right, and the sense of our duties to our people. I appeal to \nall Senators and to the leadership that we seek to get unanimous \nconsent to put off that vote, to delay it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the very able and distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia--it is my understanding that the motion to proceed to this \nresolution took place a week ago. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator for such a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Parliamentary inquiry. When did the Senate proceed to \nthis resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It appears from the Journal, the Senate \nproceeded to this measure on October 4.\n  Mr. SARBANES. October 4, and today is October 9. October 4, I am told \nby the Chair. Today is October the 9th, on a resolution that may take \nthe Nation into war.\n  Mr. BYRD. That includes Saturday and Sunday.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The distinguished Senator, I think I am correct in \nrecalling, was the leader of the Senate at the time we did the Panama \nCanal treaties.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Did the Senator recall there were two treaties, the \nneutrality treaty and the canal treaty itself? We went to the \nneutrality treaty. Floor debate began on February 6 of 1978. We voted \non March 16 of 1978. So we had a period from February the 6th until \nMarch 16 to consider that treaty.\n  We then went to the Panama Canal treaty. We began debate on March 17 \nof 1978 and we voted on that treaty on April 18 of 1978. In other \nwords, roughly 6 weeks on one treaty and a month on the other treaty.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Neither of which involved the prospect of going to war.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now, as I understand it, we are facing the prospect of, \nin effect, terminating all debate, precluding a lot of potential \namendments, and ending this matter in about one week's time, a matter \nof this grave import. I ask the Senator if that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely correct. Absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I make this observation to my colleague. It seems to me \nit is a sad commentary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I make an observation along the lines of the \ndistinguished colleague now debating this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The distinguished Senator from Virginia, I have been \nwatching him. He is marshaling the war forces on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is this regular order?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I see as part of that process, any time anyone speaks, \nhe wants to make an observation. I would be happy to hear it so I get \nan opportunity to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Senator from Maryland \nmay ask a question of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I share that feeling, and in due time we \nwill get that explanation.\n  At this moment I appeal, I appeal to the Members of the Senate to \nfind a way to give unanimous consent to put aside this vote on tomorrow \nand delay it so as to give this Senate more time to debate and to act \nupon this resolution, which is so weighty, involving, as it does, the \nmost serious, the most solemn question that can ever face this Senate, \nthe question of peace or war. We are being hurried by the rules of the \nSenate, we are being hurried into reaching a decision that is \npremature.\n  I appeal to my colleagues. I appeal to my colleagues. The people out \nthere in the country deserve better than this. They deserve a decision \ntaken after due time, due consideration, ample consideration, ample \nopportunities to offer amendments and to have them decided.\n  As it is under the rules of the Senate, we will be forced tomorrow at \n10:15 a.m. to vote on cloture. If enough Senators voted against \ncloture, that would be one thing. If 41 Senators opposed it--or put it \nthis way: If those who support this resolution cannot get 60 votes \ntomorrow, then we would automatically have additional time.\n  I am concerned the way this Senate is being stampeded, stampeded. I \ndon't blame any Senator in particular. Every Senator here is acting in \naccordance with the rules. I am asking that in this peculiar, unique \nsituation involving so much of the country's treasury, in blood and in \ndollars, I am asking the Senators join with me in putting off this \ndecision. It can be done. It can be done by unanimous consent. That is \nnot asking too much. That is not asking too much.\n  We are talking about people who are in the military of this country \nwho may have to go to war in a foreign country, depending on this vote \ntomorrow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me first yield to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for a question, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague and dear friend from West Virginia.\n  To both of my colleagues, the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, this debate, as stated, started on the 4th, which \nwas last Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Virginia \nand the Senator from Maryland that on further review of the Journal,\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\nthis debate began on October 3, rather than October 4.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  I had the privilege of being on the floor last Friday afternoon for \nover 5 hours with this debate on that side of that aisle, led by my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia. The Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, participated. The Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, participated. We had 5\\1/2\\ hours. I returned to \nthe floor on Monday. We had another roughly 6 hours of debate. Tuesday \nis fresh in the minds of all. And here we are.\n  This is the point I wish to make. I share with my distinguished \ncolleague the seriousness of this vote. It is a vote, hopefully, to \nensure a resolution which will act as a deterrent, I say most \nrespectfully, a deterrent, to the use of force, a resolution that will \nsupport the United Nations that is this very hour working to possibly \ncraft a 17th resolution which would call for inspections. It is timely \nthat the United Nations hear from not only our President, who gave a \nbrilliant speech, but a unified Congress with these resolutions.\n  I can conclude my remarks by saying in 1990/1991, I and all of the \nMembers here--most of us were involved in that debate--the record shows \nthe debate began on January 10, 1991, on the Persian Gulf resolution. \nThere were two resolutions, one submitted by myself and the \ndistinguished Senator, Mr. Lieberman, the other by the then-majority \nleader, Mr. Mitchell. That debate started on the 10th. It concluded 2 \ndays later, just 2 days later, on January 12, 1991, concluding with 2 \nvotes on both resolutions.\n  So that ended up sending men and women of the Armed Forces, ours and \nother nations', into harm's way. Let us hope we have had adequate time, \nhaving begun on the 3rd, as stated by the Chair, and now we are here \ntoday with 13 amendments which have just been submitted, which will be \nrespectfully treated by this body in due course, I hope expeditiously.\n  The rule is being complied with. This is clear. But it is 13 \namendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator agree with me the timetables which the \nSenator from Virginia just set out, both in 1991 and now, show a \ndeterioration in the Senate's level of commitment in terms of debate on \nimportant matters of State?\n  Now, we do not have to go back that far. The time period I cited was \n24 years ago, just shy of a quarter of a century. We took up an \nimportant matter of foreign policy, the Panama Canal treaty--two of \nthem, 4 weeks on one and 4 weeks on the other. Now we are here with a \nresolution to take us to war, and we are told, Well, you know, we have \nbeen on it not quite a week. As the Senator pointed out, there was an \nintervening weekend. Then we are cited as a precedent, Well, in 1991 we \ndid it in a few days.\n\n  Not only, it seems to me, does it make my point in terms of the \nwillingness of the Senate to carry on the great national debate that \nought to take place on important issues of war and peace, but this is a \nmatter of most fundamental importance.\n  I ask the Senator. It seems to me it would require the kind of \nattention and debate that is warranted by an issue of that magnitude.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator is indubitably \ncorrect. There can be no more solemn, no more serious, no more far-\nreaching a decision than the one which the Senate is approaching.\n  All of the talk about how many hours or how many days we spent on \nsome previous resolution or subject is entirely aside the point; \nentirely aside the point.\n  What I am saying here--and every Senator here knows it--is tomorrow \nmorning at 10:15, we will follow the rules of the Senate. We are going \nto vote on cloture on the Lieberman resolution, as modified. It has \nbeen modified. I don't know how many Senators know that. This \nresolution has been modified. I only learned about it today. It has \nbeen modified in such a way that there is no longer a preamble, or what \nis considered a preamble. The words ``whereas''--I would like to \ndiscuss each of these whereas clauses. The whereas clauses have all \nbeen changed to ``since,'' which means the preamble is now a part and \nparcel of the resolution. There is no separate preamble here.\n  So the wheels have been greased. The wheels of legislative action of \ndebate have been greased.\n  So here we are now faced with a vote tomorrow morning at 10:15. How \nmany of us are going to be here beyond 6:00 today? It is only 5 minutes \nto 3 now. How many of us will be here beyond 6:00 today? Then tomorrow, \nwhat time are we coming in? 9:00, 10:00?\n  So we see how little time this Senate is going to be able to focus \nits full attention on this far-reaching resolution which carries within \nits pages the fate, the possible fate of this Nation; the fate of \nhundreds or thousands, or tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands \nof servicemen and our National Guardsmen throughout this country. We \nare holding their fate in our hands.\n  I say that the rules of the Senate in this instance are being \nutilized so strictly they are made more demanding.\n  Why do we have to rush these cloture motions on a matter of this \ngreat moment? Why couldn't we have waited and debated this? What is all \nthe hurry?\n  I say to Senators, and I appeal to the people out there who are \nwatching through those lenses, I appeal to the people in the 50 States \nand the territory and possessions of this country to rise up and to let \nthemselves be heard. Don't vote for cloture. Let us put off this \ncloture vote. That is not asking too much. That is not asking too much.\n  I hope Senators will consider this seriously. Let's not vote on this \ntomorrow morning at 10:15.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for putting this debate in the proper \ncontext and for pointing out what the solemn duty really is in the \nSenate.\n\n  I want to ask my friend a couple of questions.\n  Has my friend heard, as I have, the President himself and many of his \nrepresentatives, including Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Ari \nFleischer, repeat over and over again that the President has not yet \nmade a decision to go to war? Has my friend heard that?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no question. No farther back than August 21, I \nread in the newspapers that the President was concerned about the \nagitation, about all of the commotion--these are my words--that is \ntaking place here concerning his--the President's--plan. Secretary \nRumsfeld on that occasion referred to this agitation as a ``frenzy''. \nThat is my recollection. Go back and check; no farther than August 23.\n  Here we were being told there were no such plans. As we approach it, \nthe drive is on. We are being stampeded. They are saying, Oh, the vote \nwill take place this week.\n  Why all the hurry?\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this resolution. We \nhaven't had a full opportunity to debate this resolution. It has just \nbeen modified overnight. Nobody has really had an opportunity to debate \neach whereas clause.\n  There are amendments that are going to be offered. We are not going \nto have a chance to debate those amendments. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan has an important amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might ask just a couple of questions--I wanted to \nsay to my friend that not only did they say in August this was a \nfrenzy, and the press was paying so much attention to it, and \nchastising the press for talking about Iraq--no. They were in a frenzy. \nBut just two nights ago, our President said he has not made a decision \nto go to war. Colin Powell said that before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on which I proudly serve. Condoleezza Rice repeated it. Ari \nFleischer repeated it. I tried to check out the history where the \nPresident has not made the decision to go to war--over and over again \nthrough his operatives, and he himself said it--yet he is coming to \nthis Congress and quickly wants to have a resolution, not just backing \na new United Nations resolution, which I think we all feel is very \nimportant, and with tough inspections. In fact, most of us believe \nthere should be enforcement\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\nof inspections, if need be, which is in Carl Levin's amendment, which I \nlook forward to voting on.\n  But our President is asking us to give him the authority to go to war \nalone--alone, with no one else. Other Senators will say that is silly, \nSenator Boxer. We are not going it alone. Read the resolution of \nSenator McCain. He can go it alone. That is the deal.\n  Some say we are doing it because we want to force the U.N. to act. I \nagree with Senator Levin. I think it takes the heat off the United \nNations.\n  But the question I ask of my friend is this: In closing, here we are \nbeing asked to give the President authority to take this country to war \nwithout any help, without any other nation, without any of our allies, \nbefore he has made a decision to do so. And I want to ask my friend \nthis because I know he has been here a very long time. He is an Officer \nof the Senate.\n  Has my friend been briefed on how many of our military people, men \nand women, it will take to go to this war?\n  What will the casualties be? How much will it cost? How long will we \nhave to stay there? What happens afterward? What is the impact in the \nregion? Will Saddam Hussein use his weapons of mass destruction on the \nbattlefield against our people? And what protections do they have?\n  Those are just a few questions. I want to ask my friend, have those \nquestions been answered? I have asked them. They have not been \nanswered. Perhaps my friend, having so many more years here, might have \nthe privilege of a response to that before we are asked to take our \npeople to war.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there are many questions the American people \nwant answered. There are many questions the American people are \nentitled to have answers to.\n  I am only pleading here that the Senate give itself time to explore \nthese questions on behalf of the people whom we serve. Give ourselves \ntime. We haven't had time. We have been rushed through this thing. Now, \nbecause of the rules of the Senate, we are going to have to vote \ntomorrow morning at 10:15 on a question that involves peace or war, a \nquestion that involves great sacrifices for this country.\n\n  Nobody knows how great those sacrifices may be. And there are many \nquestions that need to be answered. What will we do once Iraq is \ndefeated? What will we do with Iraq? Will our service men and women be \nrequired to go there? Will they have to stay there 2 months after the \ndefeat of Iraq? 6 months? 1 year? 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?\n  Who is going to pay for reviving the economy of Iraq? Where are the \nmoneys coming from to pay the costs of what may be a war of short \nduration? of what may be a war of long duration? What is the \nPresident's plan? What is the administration's plan? Are we going to \nuse the heavy ground option or the heavy air option, or both the heavy \nground option and the heavy air option?\n  Go over to the hospitals surrounding this Capitol and take a look at \nthe emergency rooms. See how many people are in those emergency rooms. \nSee how short on personnel those hospitals are. I know. I have had my \nwife in a hospital just recently with an appendectomy. Those hospitals \nare short on beds.\n  What about the veterans hospitals? What about an upsurge, if it \ncomes, in casualties of Americans? Are we prepared for this? Are we \nprepared?\n  What is going to happen on the war here at home, homeland security, \nthe security of our country? Look around us here. Just look at the \nmorning papers. The television is full of it. The people of this area \nare concerned about their children, about the public schools, and they \nare being asked not to come to school, not to have recesses.\n  Here we are talking about war in Iraq, when the focus is being taken \noff the war here at home. The people's eyes are on home, what is \nhappening around us. Here is a sniper in this area. He has already \nkilled six people at least, and they don't know what he looks like, \nwhere he lives, nothing about him, except he is a marksman. He is sure \na marksman.\n  Here we are being told: Tomorrow morning at 10:15 we are going to \ncome to the moment of decision. I say it is not right to the American \npeople that we do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not intend to hold the floor too much longer. I yield \nto this Senator, and then I will yield to my friend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator over \nseveral days. One of the points he makes so effectively is the fact \nthat even if we have been on the resolution a few days, we were, I was \nreminded, on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 21 days, the \nenergy bill 23 days, the trade bill 19 days, and the farm bill 18 days.\n  But even if we have been on this bill, would the Senator not agree \nwith me that the principal debate has been on the resolutions, not the \nreal impact of the war and what would happen to American troops who \nwould be involved--the numbers of American troops who would be \ninvolved--what the impact is going to be on our battle with al-Qaida, \nwhat is going to be the impact in terms of the region, in terms of what \nSaddam may do?\n  I would be interested in the Senator's comments on that.\n  Secondly, I would be interested in the Senator's comments on the \nreport this morning in the Washington Post--I am so glad it was \ndeclassified--in which the Central Intelligence Agency effectively has \nagreed that--quoting the paper----\n       Unprovoked by a U.S. military campaign, Iraqi President \n     Saddam Hussein is unlikely to initiate a chemical or \n     biological attack against the United States, intelligence \n     agencies concluded in a classified report. . . .\n\n  That is the first time we have seen that public. That has been \nclassified. Those of us who have been briefed on it have been unable to \nuse that or to say that. That is a major kind of factor, I think, if we \nare being asked to vote on a resolution of war: to find out, in our \nIntelligence Estimate, that the possibility of American troops being \naffected by the use of chemical warfare increases dramatically--\ndramatically--when we are putting Saddam Hussein's back against a wall.\n  This was a question that--I see in the Chamber the chairman of the \ncommittee, who was there at the time. I remember very clearly that \nmoment.\n  But does not the Senator believe that this kind of statement is worth \nthe opportunity for discussion and explanation, that we ought to hear \nat least what the reality is, that the American people ought to \nunderstand, and the parents of those servicemen ought to understand \nwhat their children are going to be faced with?\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that we have been talking about \nresolutions, and we ought to be talking about the whole issue of \nterror, the impact it is going to have on our society--whether we go to \nwar--what the impact is going to be on our servicemen, on the region, \nand on our future?\n  I welcome the Senator's response to the general question about what \nthis debate, to date, has been about, and then the specific issue that \nhas been raised in the newspapers that has to be of central concern to \npeople in relation to authorizing the President to engage in war and \nthe chances of the use of chemical and biological weapons being \nincreased dramatically if Saddam's back is up against a wall in a \nconflict.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. He has put his finger on several important points, one \nof which is this: The American people are just now awakening to the \nfact that the Senate and the House are about to pass a resolution that \nturns the power of the people, as measured by their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress, over to a Commander in Chief--the power to \ndetermine when to go to war, the power to declare war. They are just \nnow becoming awake to that fact.\n  The American people are just now beginning to focus on this. They \nhave not been focused on this. They have not been focused on this. And \nthey are just now beginning to.\n  Also, the article that the Senator raises, from today's newspaper, \nindicates there are many things that have a bearing upon this question \nthat are just now coming to the surface. Organizations, persons, people \nwith expertise, scientists, and so on, are just now beginning to focus, \nand their story is just now beginning to get through.\n  I think we owe it to ourselves. Why would we want to deny ourselves \nhere\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\nin Congress the opportunity to have more facts, the opportunity to \nstudy this matter more seriously, the opportunity to debate it, the \nopportunity to draw up amendments?\n  Here we are faced, under rule XXII, with having to offer our \namendments by 1 o'clock today, in the first-degree amendments. Now, I \nhad to rush to get two amendments ready. I have many other matters that \nare demanding my time. And other Senators are in the same situation, or \neven worse situations.\n  So I plead with the Nation's representatives here in the Senate, with \nthe leadership in the Senate, with the leadership in the other body. I \nplead with Senators to make every effort to try to get a unanimous \nconsent request to waive this cloture vote on tomorrow.\n  We are shortchanging the American people. We are shortchanging \nourselves as representatives of the American people. We are shutting \nourselves out of the opportunity. And it is no fault of any particular \nSenator. It is the rule that we are up against here, and only by \nunanimous consent can we waive it.\n  But I plead in the name of the people of this country, in the name of \nthe young men and women whose lives may be put on the line by the \ndecision that this Senate will make tomorrow morning at 10:15. It is \ntoo weighty. It is too far-reaching. It is only fair to the people of \nAmerica, who are going to be asked to give, in some instances, \neverything they have, if a war ensues. I tell you my friends, I don't \nwant that on my conscience, not I. I apologize to Senators who have \nbeen standing here waiting.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield for no more than 5 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course, I am entitled to yield for a question, but I \nwould like to yield to the Senator from South Carolina. He has been on \nhis feet.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator yielding his right to the floor? If so, I \nwould ask that before he does that, he open himself to a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no intention of holding the floor. I do intend to \noffer an amendment, however, before I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator intends to yield the floor before Senator \nHelms speaks, would the Senator yield for a question first?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question is this: In addition to the fact that cloture, \nif invoked, will close off debate and have the effect which has been \ndescribed here, it has another effect, does it not, which is that \namendments following cloture must be strictly germane?\n  In preparation for the answer to that question, I want to say the \nfollowing: The alternative amendment which I intend to offer is an \namendment which says we should seek the U.N. to authorize force-to-\nforce inspections, to authorize member states to use force-to-force \ninspections--in other words, to go multilaterally with force--but does \nnot at this time authorize a go-it-alone approach. That is my \nalternative.\n  My alternative also specifically provides--this is the question----\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield, please? Can there be an \nunderstanding, when you have completed, that I be recognized for 5 \nminutes? I won't take that long. Would that be agreeable with the \nSenator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Is there objection to the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I would simply request that \nafter the Senator from North Carolina has spoken, I be recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The rest of my question is this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from North Carolina?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The alternative resolution which I intend to offer has a \nprovision in it which will be prohibited from being included if cloture \nis invoked because even though it is obviously relevant to this debate, \nit is not strictly germane under our rules. I want to ask the Senator \nabout this.\n  Part of my alternative resolution says: Let us go to the U.N. Let us \ngo together. Let us go multilaterally. Let's have the strength of the \nworld community behind us because it avoids a lot of negative \nconsequences and gives us great strength in proceeding against Saddam \nto go with the world. But part of my resolution is that Congress would \nnot adjourn sine die so that the Congress could resume session, if \nnecessary, to promptly consider proposals relative to Iraq if, in the \njudgment of the President, the U.N. Security Council does not promptly \nact on a resolution to enforce inspections. That is an important part \nof the resolution that I intend to offer.\n\n  But is it not true, I ask my good friend from West Virginia, if that \npart of the resolution is ruled not strictly germane, although it is \nobviously relevant, that means I would not be able to offer the \nresolution in that form? And is that also not a very negative result of \ncloture being invoked? Does that not deny us an opportunity to vote on \nsomething which is so important to this debate?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is, indeed, most unfortunate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be offering the resolution in two forms: One that \ncontains this important language which would fall if cloture is \ninvoked; one that does not contain it, which it seems to me would then \nbe denying the Senate an opportunity to consider, debate, deliberate a \nfull alternative to the President's go-it-alone approach.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is one of the penalties this Chamber will pay, that \nthe Senator will pay, that the American people will pay as a result of \na rule, a rule which I support and have supported. But here we are, \ncaught in a situation where without adequate debate, we have been \npushed to a cloture vote in the drive--and I don't mean to criticize \nany person, it is a stampede--in the drive to have this decision made \nbefore the Members of Congress go home for the November elections.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I reply to the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is less than 4 weeks away. It is most unfortunate.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I ask the Senator from Michigan a simple question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I just ask the Senator from Michigan a simple \nquestion? Did you not have the right to offer an amendment on Friday, \nMonday, Tuesday? That question has been open to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am going to give up the floor very shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent request earlier, \nthe Senator from North Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes, once the \nSenator from West Virginia has concluded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe there was only debate on Friday and Monday, no \namendments. I am informed, debate only.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my colleagues, please, let's observe the \nrules of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4868 To Amendment No. 4856, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Before I yield the floor, I call up amendment No. 4868 and \nask that it be stated by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4868 to amendment No. 4856, as modified:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide statutory construction that constitutional \nauthorities remain unaffected and that no additional grant of authority \n is made to the President not directly related to the existing threat \n                             posed by Iraq)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this joint resolution--\n       (1) is intended to alter the constitutional authorities of \n     the Congress to declare war, grant letters of Marque and \n     Reprisal, or other authorities invested in Congress by \n     Section 8, Article I of the Constitution; or\n       (2) shall be construed as granting any authority to the \n     President to use the United States Armed Forces for any \n     purpose not directly related to a clear threat of imminent, \n     sudden, and direct attack upon the United States, its \n     possessions or territories, or the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, unless the Congress of the United States otherwise \n     authorizes.\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, point of inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from North \nCarolina, I be recognized, following the----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. I will seek and obtain recognition after the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona be \nrecognized, after which I be recognized following the Senator from \nNebraska, and I think the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to know what the request is. \nWhat is the request?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor \nand he yielded to the Senator from Massachusetts for an inquiry.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I used to be a sports writer. I know what \nfreezing the ball is doing.\n  I ask that it be in order for me to make my short statement seated at \nmy desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the most fundamental and painful of \ndecisions--whether to authorize the President to send U.S. military \npersonnel to war--is being confronted by the Senate today, previous \ndays, and maybe more days. I believe the decision is in good hands.\n  I have had the privilege of serving in this body for nearly 30 years. \nThe men and women in this chamber are the respected servants of the \nAmerican people. I have faith in my fellow Senators.\n  For 3 days in August and 2 days in September, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee heard testimony on the possibility of American military \naction against Iraq. We heard 23 witnesses, including current and \nformer Secretaries of State, former National Security Advisors, a \nnumber of experts on Iraq from academia and from prominent research \ninstitutes, an important defector from Iraq's nuclear weapons program, \nretired senior level military officers, and former members of U.N. \ninspections teams in Iraq.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Biden, deserves our thanks for \nconducting these hearings in a fair and comprehensive manner.\n  The hearings established some fundamental points that deserve \nrepeating here on the floor.\n  First, the threat posed by the Iraqi regime to American national \nsecurity is serious and growing. Former Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright testified that after U.N. inspectors were banished by Iraq in \n1998, ``. . . the risk that Saddam Hussein will succeed in \nreconstituting deliverable weapons of mass destruction has increased. \nIt is in the interest not only of the United States but also of the \nentire international community to act.''\n  Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nationals Richard Holbrooke \nsimilarly stated: ``in my view, Saddam is even more dangerous than \n[former Serbian leader Slobodan] Milosevic, given his continuing quest \nfor weapons of mass destruction. Left alone, he will only seek to \nbecome stronger.''\n  Now, neither of these two eminent individuals share all of President \nBush's foreign policy priorities. But both concede that the threat is \nreal, and growing.\n  Second, three former high-ranking members of the U.N. Special \nCommission agreed that inspections will fail to stop Iraq's development \nof weapons of mass destruction. Charles Deulfer stated that, in his \nopinion, inspections ``are only a short term palliative and do not \naddress the fundamental problem. Saddam knows this.''\n  Ambassador Robert Gallucci noted that ``We can assume that any regime \nthat appeared as though it would be effective in blocking Iraqi WMD \nacquisition would also be resisted by Iraq. Therefore, the only way to \nimpose such a regime short of war would be to pose to Iraq the credible \nalternative of a prompt invasion and regime change if the inspection \nregime change if the inspection regime resisted.''\n\n  Lastly, Ambassador Richard Butler, the former head of the inspections \nteam, warned that inspections were doomed to fail if Saddam succeeds \nonce again in what Butler calls the ``shell game--phony inspections, \nmore deceit, more concealment.'' ``That would,'' he concluded, ``be \ndeeply dangerous, providing an illusion of security.''\n  Third, a variety of witnesses, including Secretary Powell, agreed \nthat containment of the Iraq threat, our policy since the end of \nOperation Desert Storm, is no longer suitable.\n  Secretary Powell told the committee that the box that contains Saddam \nHussein's murderous ambitions cannot last much longer. Secretary \nPowell, said, ``[Saddam] continues to bounce against the walls of that \nbox. And one of these days he'll have a box cutter and he'll be out. \nAnd we don't want to wait and see that day.''\n  Ambassador Butler also suggested that containment no longer works. He \ntold the committee, ``we also need a specific solution to the specific \nproblems posed by this particular and, I suggest, unique outlaw.'' \nFormer Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, National Security \nAdvisor Robert McFarlane, and Dr. Khidir Hamza, former Iraqi nuclear \nweapons designer, all noted Saddam's absolute commitment to the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons.\n  Secretary Weinberger also noted that Saddam's ability to smuggle \ngoods in and out of Iraq, despite U.N. sanctions, earns him billions of \ndollars per year--money that goes to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  In hearings before other committees, our able Secretary of Defense, \nDonald Rumsfeld, has pointed out that the problem is not inspections \nbut disarmament. Saddam has succeeded in circumventing sanctions and \ncontainment to the point where we no longer have the luxury of waiting \nidly by while he continues to develop the means to threaten us and our \nallies.\n  The President's policy is the only way to deal with Iraq today, and \nwe are obliged to give him maximum flexibility to carry it out. Even as \nthe President develops a coalition, we cannot yield to a few countries \nlike China or Russia that would allow Saddam to evade full disarmament.\n  We can no longer countenance Saddam's delays and obfuscations. The \nPresident, in his speech to the Nation Monday night, articulated a \nseries of options to deal with the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. He \ndisplayed the essence of leadership, moving forward in the face of \nevil. Diplomacy absent demonstrated resolve--which was our policy too \noften in the past--will continue to prove absolutely ineffectual.\n  I do hope Senators will stand with the President today. He has shown \nthe leadership necessary to rid the world of Saddam Hussein. We should \ndemonstrate that same leadership and authorize the President to do what \nis now so clearly necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to set up a couple of speakers \non that side, and we are not going to go any more in advance of that. \nWe should tell everybody that, after cloture is invoked, people still \nwill have an opportunity to speak. It is not as if this is the last \ntrain out of the station. If people feel inclined to speak, they can do \nso.\n  The leader will stay in session as long as people want to speak \ntonight. I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be recognized for \n20 minutes; Senator Kerry, up to 45 minutes--he said he may not use all \nof that time--Senator Hagel, for 25 minutes; Senator Dodd, for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could we entertain the desire of the \nSenator from Kansas to speak?\n  Mr. REID. The Democrats have used 20 minutes more during this time \nthan the Republicans, so how long would Senator Roberts speak?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. About 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roberts may speak \nafter Senator Dodd for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a lot of ground was covered in the time \nbetween the last vote and the time that I have been recognized, not \nnecessarily in a structured fashion. I want to respond to some of the \nquestions and comments that were made.\n  First of all, very importantly, the Senator from West Virginia made \nan impassioned plea that we not vote for cloture, not move forward with \nthe disposition of this resolution supporting the President of the \nUnited States of America to take action, if necessary, to bring about \nan elimination of the threat to the U.S. national security.\n  I think it is worthy of a couple of observations, Mr. President. One \nis, in the recent past the Foreign Relations Committee has held \nnumerous hearings and the Armed Services Committee has held numerous \nhearings. In reality, though, this issue has been with us for 11 years, \nand it is not possible to turn on your television set without seeing a \ndiscussion and debate over this issue. The night before last, the \nPresident of the United States spoke to the people of this country on \nthis issue. Debate is taking place in the U.N. There are discussions in \nthe U.N. Security Council as we speak. This issue, more than any other \ntoday, is known to the American people. As we, their representatives, \ndebate and discuss it, it is to further inform them; but they are \nclearly aware of the major aspects of this issue.\n  Since the year 1992, we have begun to be aware that Saddam Hussein \nwould not be overthrown.\n  We became even more aware over time that he was not going to comply \nwith the cease-fire agreements he entered into and the Security Council \nresolutions requiring him to allow intrusive and comprehensive weapons \ninspections throughout his country.\n  His obfuscation, his delay, his outright refusal to allow these \ninspections culminated in 1998 in ejecting those inspectors, and that \nresulted in the passage of legislation on August 14, 1998, which \nPresident Clinton signed into law, S.J. Res. 54, which declared that \nthe Government of Iraq was in material and unacceptable breach of its \ninternational obligations, and urged the President:\n\n     to take appropriate action in accordance with the \n     Constitution and relative laws of the United States to bring \n     Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.\n\n  On October 31, 1998, then-President Clinton signed into law the Iraq \nLiberation Act, which stated:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a domestic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  That was October 31, 1998, the Iraq Liberation Act, signed into law \nby the President of the United States.\n  I have to say allegations or assertions that somehow the American \npeople are not aware of this issue just do not ring true. Anyone who \nbelieves this issue is not being debated around kitchen tables and in \nrestaurants and other social gathering places throughout America is \nsimply not aware of what is going on in America.\n  Yes, they pay attention to this debate, but the issue is well known, \nand there is no reason why we should not invoke cloture.\n  It was interesting to me that my colleague from Virginia mentioned we \nreally only spent 2 days of formal debate on the floor of the Senate in \n1991. The Senator from Connecticut and I were heavily involved in that \ndebate. But the fact is, that issue was debated far and wide. By the \ntime that vote was taken, the American people and the Members of this \nbody were very well aware--very well aware--as to what was at stake and \nwhat, at that time, was a far more controversial issue than this one \nis, if you accept our predictions of an overwhelming vote.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts asked the Senator from West Virginia \nif he knew about the stories carried in this morning's papers about \nSaddam Hussein being likely to use weapons of mass destruction if he is \nattacked.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by George \nTenet be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Statement by DCI George Tenet\n\n       There is no inconsistency between our view of Saddam's \n     growing threat and the view as expressed by the President in \n     his speech. Although we think the chances of Saddam \n     initiating a WMD attack at this moment are low--in part \n     because it would constitute an admission that the possesses \n     WMD--there is no question that the likelihood of Saddam using \n     WMD against the United States or our allies in the region for \n     blackmail, deterrence, or otherwise grows as his arsenal \n     continues to build. His past use of WMD against civilian and \n     military targets shows that he produces those weapons to use \n     not just to deter.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not want to go through the whole \ndebate again, but here is the point. Saddam Hussein continues to \nacquire, amass, and improve on his arsenal of weapons of mass \ndestruction. He continues to attempt to acquire a nuclear weapon. These \nare all well-known facts. So if you believe that Saddam Hussein, after \nwe go through this expression of approval, national debate, Security \nCouncil resolutions, is not going to abandon his request for his \nweapons, then the longer we wait, the more dangerous he becomes. In \nother words, if we attack Iraq tomorrow--and that is not clear yet; we \nhave Security Council resolutions to go through--perhaps Saddam Hussein \nin his desperation may want to use a weapon of mass destruction, but if \nSaddam Hussein does not comply and continues the clear record of \nviolations he has amassed over the last 11 years, then if we have to \nremove these weapons of mass destruction, each day that goes by he \nbecomes more dangerous, his capabilities become better, and, in the \ncase of nuclear weapons, it is not a question of whether, it is a \nquestion of when.\n  Experts will debate whether it is 2 years when he acquires these \nweapons, whether it is 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, but there is no \ndoubt over time he will acquire a nuclear weapon.\n  Why do I mention a nuclear weapon? We have equipment that can protect \nour men and women in the military against biological and chemical \nattack. It is tough to fight, it is bulky equipment, but we do have \nthat equipment. We have not invented any equipment yet that can protect \nour troops from a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments the Senator \nhas made. I think they are right on target. Is there any reason from \nhistory or evidence to believe Saddam Hussein is developing these \nweapons of mass destruction for defensive purposes? Isn't the thought \nhe might use them against someone else if attacked indication he would \nuse them offensively as soon as he feels the opportunity to do so?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, it is very clear he is not developing \nthese weapons for defensive purposes. He has used them twice--once \nagainst his own people, once against troops of a neighboring country in \na conflict.\n  The fundamental point that seems to be lost in this debate sometimes \nis at any time in the last 11 years, Saddam Hussein could have avoided \nany threat to Saddam Hussein's illegitimate, terrible regime. It is a \nterrible and odious regime, but there are lots of bad guys around the \nworld. He could have eliminated any threat if he had just come clean, \ntaken out these weapons of mass destruction, taken out the \nlaboratories, stopped, allowed the inspectors in, so he must have some \nother agenda. The longer we delay when he is in noncompliance, the more \ndangerous that threat becomes.\n\n  There was no contradiction, in my view, of the comments of the \nDirector of the CIA that were widely quoted in the media this morning. \nI can understand, by the way, without knowledge of Saddam Hussein, \nwithout the background we have of his record, without the knowledge of \nwhat he has tried to do over the last 11 years, why those comments \nmight be misconstrued. But taken in the context of the history of this \ndespot, I think it is very clear that if he fails to comply--and we are \ngoing to the United Nations and there will be a Security Council \nresolution or resolutions--then obviously the longer we delay, if he \ncontinues on this reckless path, the more dangerous it becomes and, \nfrankly, the more casualties accrue, in response to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  I wish to make another comment about this debate. There is no Member \nof this body who has any priority or\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\nany franchise on the lives of American young men and women. All of us \nplace that as our highest priority. All of us recognize the sacred \nobligation we have when we vote to send young men and women into harm's \nway, and no one's motives should be or will be impugned in this debate.\n  I think it is important for the Senator from West Virginia to \nappreciate that I and others will object to any unanimous consent \nagreement that would delay a cloture vote tomorrow morning. We believe \nthe American people have been informed, and the Members of this body \nhave been informed.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, Friday we had debate, and we will, \naccording to the majority leader, stay as late or as long as anybody in \nthis body wants to talk or debate or discuss.\n  With all due respect to the Senator from West Virginia, we will \nobject.\n  Mr. President, we are trying to dispose of 13 amendments. Obviously, \npeople want to speak. I respect that, but I do feel compelled to \ncomment on the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia briefly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I ask a brief question before the \nSenator proceeds to the amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our colleague from Connecticut raises a very valuable \nquestion: Is he manufacturing these weapons of mass destruction for the \ndefense of his sovereign nation? The clearest evidence this Senator \nfinds to show that he is not doing that is the excessive amounts.\n  During the inspection regime, while it was somewhat functional in the \nearly 1990s, they discovered records of clearly documented biological \nand chemical weaponry that had been made. To this day, it has never \nbeen unearthed, never been discovered, never been acknowledged by \nSaddam Hussein.\n  So the question is important, and the Senator from Arizona answered \nit very carefully. I suggest that those who have any doubt address the \nexcess quantities of all of these weapons. And for what reason would he \nneed a nuclear weapon? That is a question to which none of us have an \nanswer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, now I will make a few brief comments about the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The amendment is to provide constitutional authorities to the \nPresident of the United States. In the heart of the amendment, it says \nthe President of the United States cannot use the Armed Forces for any \npurposes not directly related to a clear threat of imminent, sudden, \nand direct attack upon the United States, its possessions or \nterritories.\n  If this were 100 years ago, at the time of my hero, Theodore \nRoosevelt, who was ready to send the Great White Fleet around the \nworld, I would vote for this amendment in a New York minute because 100 \nyears ago we had two oceans to protect us. One hundred years ago, we \ndid not have in this world weapons of mass destruction that could \nstrike continents away, travel thousands of miles and strike with \nincredible accuracy. We did not have a threat from a group of people \nwho are yet somewhat unknown to us, who want to destroy our culture, \nwho want to destroy our values, and indeed everything about Western \ncivilization. They travel sometimes in secret without us being able to \ndetect them, in the case of September 11, until too late.\n  One hundred years ago, we had two oceans to protect us. We knew who \nour enemies might be, either real or potential, and we could afford to \nwait until there was an imminent, sudden, or direct attack upon the \nUnited States, its possessions or territories. Then I would have \nsupported this amendment.\n  The fact is, we all know if we wait until there is a direct attack on \nthe United States of America, we pay a very heavy price. I hope the \nSenator from West Virginia, who I am sorry is not in the Chamber, would \nhave appreciated that lesson from September 11; that we cannot wait \nuntil there is a direct, imminent, or sudden attack upon the United \nStates of America. That is why if this amendment were to pass, it would \ncompletely prevent the President of the United States of America from \naddressing a clear and present danger to the United States of America \nin the form of Saddam Hussein's inventory of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator makes a good series of points about the \npending amendment introduced by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  We have language in our resolution that authorizes the President to \ntake action to protect the national security of the United States \nagainst the continuing threat from Iraq. I must say that in my opinion, \nand I ask the Senator for his reaction, the terms that the Senator from \nWest Virginia has stated are literally being met now for this reason: \nAs my friend from Arizona well knows, the Armed Forces of the United \nStates are under direct attack from Iraq as they fly along with their \nBritish colleagues to enforce the no-fly zone.\n  Approximately 7,500 American men and women in uniform are dispatched \nthere, costing the American taxpayer a billion or more dollars a year. \nThis year alone, there have been more than 400 occasions on which Iraqi \nforces have fired at the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Of course, I am opposed to this amendment, but I ask the Senator from \nArizona if he would agree with me that there is a direct attack by Iraq \ngoing on right now, not on the United States or its possessions or \nterritories but on the Armed Forces of our country?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I respond to my friend and say that, yes, if this \namendment said a clear threat of imminent, sudden, or direct attack \nupon the Armed Forces of the United States, clearly that is the case. \nWe saw it in the USS Cole. We saw it in the attacks on our embassies. \nWe have seen it in many places.\n  If there has to be a clear threat of imminent, sudden, and direct \nattack upon the United States, its possessions, or territories, in all \ndue respect, I think Saddam Hussein would be very pleased if we passed \nthis kind of resolution because that would allow him to continue to \nbuild up his inventory, to build his weapons of mass destruction, \nperhaps acquire a missile with sufficient range to reach the United \nStates, and only then could we respond. That is not what I think our \nresponsibilities and duties are to the American people.\n  I am enjoying this debate. I think it is a good one. I look forward \nto hearing the next two speakers because both of them have played a \nvery important and informative role, not only on the floor of the \nSenate but on talk shows and great programs throughout America, both \nwritten and in public.\n  In fact, some of them have been accused of what I have been accused \nof from time to time, and that is seeking a camera, which is, of \ncourse, never true of me or my two colleagues.\n  I certainly look forward to listening to their arguments. I think \nthese next two speakers will contribute enormously to the debate. I \nthink the American people, as well as our colleagues, will be better \ninformed at the completion of their remarks.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor up to 45 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Arizona for his \nintroduction and for his generous comments about the role that Senator \nHagel and I have played.\n  My colleague, Senator Hagel, and I share seats on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. We have both followed this issue for a long period \nof time.\n  Obviously, with respect to an issue that might take Americans to war, \nwe deserve time, and there is no more important debate to be had on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is in the greatest traditions of this \ninstitution, and I am proud to take part in that debate now.\n  This is a debate that should be conducted without regard to parties, \nto politics, to labels. It is a debate that has to come from the gut of \neach and every Member, and I am confident that it does. I know for \nSenator Hagel, Senator McCain, and myself, when we pick up the \nnewspapers and read about the residuals of the Vietnam war, there is a \nparticular sensitivity because I do not think any of us feel a residual \nwith respect to the choices we are making now.\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\n  I know for myself back in that period of time, even as I protested \nthe war, I wrote that if my Nation was again threatened and Americans \nmade the decision we needed to defend ourselves, I would be among the \nfirst to put on a uniform again and go and do that.\n  We are facing a very different world today than we have ever faced \nbefore. September 11 changed a lot, but other things have changed: \nGlobalization, technology, a smaller planet, the difficulties of \nradical fundamentalism, the crosscurrents of religion and politics. We \nare living in an age where the dangers are different and they require a \ndifferent response, different thinking, and different approaches than \nwe have applied in the past.\n  Most importantly, it is a time when international institutions must \nrise to the occasion and seek new authority and a new measure of \nrespect.\n  In approaching the question of this resolution, I wish the timing \nwere different. I wish for the sake of the country we were not here now \nat this moment. There are legitimate questions about that timing. But \nnone of the underlying realities of the threat, none of the underlying \nrealities of the choices we face are altered because they are, in fact, \nthe same as they were in 1991 when we discovered those weapons when the \nteams went in, and in 1998 when the teams were kicked out.\n  With respect to Saddam Hussein and the threat he presents, we must \nask ourselves a simple question: Why? Why is Saddam Hussein pursuing \nweapons that most nations have agreed to limit or give up? Why is \nSaddam Hussein guilty of breaking his own cease-fire agreement with the \ninternational community? Why is Saddam Hussein attempting to develop \nnuclear weapons when most nations don't even try, and responsible \nnations that have them attempt to limit their potential for disaster? \nWhy did Saddam Hussein threaten and provoke? Why does he develop \nmissiles that exceed allowable limits? Why did Saddam Hussein lie and \ndeceive the inspection teams previously? Why did Saddam Hussein not \naccount for all of the weapons of mass destruction which UNSCOM \nidentified? Why is he seeking to develop unmanned airborne vehicles for \ndelivery of biological agents?\n  Does he do all of these things because he wants to live by \ninternational standards of behavior? Because he respects international \nlaw? Because he is a nice guy underneath it all and the world should \ntrust him?\n  It would be naive to the point of grave danger not to believe that, \nleft to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will provoke, misjudge, or \nstumble into a future, more dangerous confrontation with the civilized \nworld. He has as much as promised it. He has already created a stunning \ntrack record of miscalculation. He miscalculated an 8-year war with \nIran. He miscalculated the invasion of Kuwait. He miscalculated \nAmerica's responses to it. He miscalculated the result of setting oil \nrigs on fire. He miscalculated the impact of sending Scuds into Israel. \nHe miscalculated his own military might. He miscalculated the Arab \nworld's response to his plight. He miscalculated in attempting an \nassassination of a former President of the United States. And he is \nmiscalculating now America's judgments about his miscalculations.\n  All those miscalculations are compounded by the rest of history. A \nbrutal, oppressive dictator, guilty of personally murdering and \ncondoning murder and torture, grotesque violence against women, \nexecution of political opponents, a war criminal who used chemical \nweapons against another nation and, of course, as we know, against his \nown people, the Kurds. He has diverted funds from the Oil-for-Food \nprogram, intended by the international community to go to his own \npeople. He has supported and harbored terrorist groups, particularly \nradical Palestinian groups such as Abu Nidal, and he has given money to \nfamilies of suicide murderers in Israel.\n  I mention these not because they are a cause to go to war in and of \nthemselves, as the President previously suggested, but because they \ntell a lot about the threat of the weapons of mass destruction and the \nnature of this man. We should not go to war because these things are in \nhis past, but we should be prepared to go to war because of what they \ntell us about the future. It is the total of all of these acts that \nprovided the foundation for the world's determination in 1991 at the \nend of the gulf war that Saddam Hussein must:\n\n     . . . unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \n     rendering harmless under international supervision of his \n     chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missile \n     delivery systems . . . [and] unconditionally agree not to \n     acquire or develop nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon-\n     usable material.\n\n  Saddam Hussein signed that agreement. Saddam Hussein is in office \ntoday because of that agreement. It is the only reason he survived in \n1991. In 1991, the world collectively made a judgment that this man \nshould not have weapons of mass destruction. And we are here today in \nthe year 2002 with an uninspected 4-year interval during which time we \nknow through intelligence he not only has kept them, but he continues \nto grow them.\n  I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless breach of \ninternational values and standards of behavior which is at the core of \nthe cease-fire agreement, with no reach, no stretch, is cause enough \nfor the world community to hold him accountable by use of force, if \nnecessary. The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass \ndestruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us \nsince the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know \nafter Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that \nhe has continued to build those weapons.\n  He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, \nallowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on \nweapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\n  The Senate worked to urge action in early 1998. I joined with Senator \nMcCain, Senator Hagel, and other Senators, in a resolution urging the \nPresident to ``take all necessary and appropriate actions to respond to \nthe threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end his weapons of mass \ndestruction program.'' That was 1998 that we thought we needed a more \nserious response.\n  Later in the year, Congress enacted legislation declaring Iraq in \nmaterial, unacceptable breach of its disarmament obligations and urging \nthe President to take appropriate action to bring Iraq into compliance. \nIn fact, had we done so, President Bush could well have taken his \noffice, backed by our sense of urgency about holding Saddam Hussein \naccountable and, with an international United Nations, backed a \nmultilateral stamp of approval record on a clear demand for the \ndisarmament of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. We could have had that and we \nwould not be here debating this today. But the administration missed an \nopportunity 2 years ago and particularly a year ago after September 11. \nThey regrettably, and even clumsily, complicated their own case. The \nevents of September 11 created new understanding of the terrorist \nthreat and the degree to which every nation is vulnerable.\n  That understanding enabled the administration to form a broad and \nimpressive coalition against terrorism. Had the administration tried \nthen to capitalize on this unity of spirit to build a coalition to \ndisarm Iraq, we would not be here in the pressing days before an \nelection, late in this year, debating this now. The administration's \ndecision to engage on this issue now, rather than a year ago or \nearlier, and the manner in which it has engaged, has politicized and \ncomplicated the national debate and raised questions about the \ncredibility of their case.\n  By beginning its public discourse with talk of invasion and regime \nchange, the administration raised doubts about their bona fides on the \nmost legitimate justification for war--that in the post-September 11 \nworld the unrestrained threat of weapons of mass destruction in the \nhands of Saddam Hussein is unacceptable, and his refusal to allow U.N. \ninspectors to return was in blatant violation of the 1991 cease-fire \nagreement that left him in power. By casting about in an unfocused, \nundisciplined, overly public, internal debate for a rationale for war, \nthe administration complicated their case, confused the American \npublic, and compromised America's credibility in the eyes of the world \ncommunity. By engaging in hasty war talk rather than focusing on the \ncentral issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the administration \nplaced doubts in the\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\nminds of potential allies, particularly in the Middle East, where \nmanaging the Arab street is difficult at best.\n  Against this disarray, it is not surprising that tough questions \nbegan to be asked and critics began to emerge.\n  Indeed over the course of the last 6 weeks some of the strongest and \nmost thoughtful questioning of our Nation's Iraq policy has come from \nwhat some observers would say are unlikely sources: Senators like Chuck \nHagel and Dick Lugar, former Bush Administration national security \nexperts including Brent Scowcroft and James Baker, and distinguished \nmilitary voices including General Shalikashvili. They are asking the \ntough questions which must be answered before--and not after--you \ncommit a nation to a course that may well lead to war. They know from \ntheir years of experience, whether on the battlefield as soldiers, in \nthe Senate, or at the highest levels of public diplomacy, that you \nbuild the consent of the American people to sustain military \nconfrontation by asking questions, not avoiding them. Criticism and \nquestions do not reflect a lack of patriotism--they demonstrate the \nstrength and core values of our American democracy.\n  It is love of country, and it is defined by defense of those policies \nthat protect and defend our country.\n  Writing in the New York Times in early September, I argued that the \nAmerican people would never accept the legitimacy of this war or give \ntheir consent to it unless the administration first presented detailed \nevidence of the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and proved \nthat it had exhausted all other options to protect our national \nsecurity. I laid out a series of steps that the administration must \ntake for the legitimacy of our cause and our ultimate success in Iraq--\nseek the advice and approval of Congress after laying out the evidence \nand making the case, and work with our allies to seek full enforcement \nof the existing cease-fire agreement while simultaneously offering Iraq \na clear ultimatum: accept rigorous inspections without negotiation or \ncompromise and without condition.\n  Those of us who have offered questions and criticisms--and there are \nmany in this body and beyond--can take heart in the fact that those \nquestions and those criticisms have had an impact on the debate. They \nhave changed how we may or may not deal with Iraq. The Bush \nadministration began talking about Iraq by suggesting that \ncongressional consultation and authorization for the use of force were \nnot needed. Now they are consulting with Congress and seeking our \nauthorization. The administration began this process walking down a \npath of unilateralism. Today they acknowledge that while we reserve the \nright to act alone, it is better to act with allies. The administration \nwhich once seemed entirely disengaged from the United Nations \nultimately went to the United Nations and began building international \nconsensus to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. The administration began \nthis process suggesting that the United States might well go to war \nover Saddam Hussein's failure to return Kuwaiti property. Last week the \nSecretary of State and on Monday night the President made clear we \nwould go to war only to disarm Iraq.\n  The administration began discussion of Iraq by almost belittling the \nimportance of arms inspections. Today the administration has refocused \ntheir aim and made clear we are not in an arbitrary conflict with one \nof the world's many dictators, but a conflict with a dictator whom the \ninternational community left in power only because he agreed not to \npursue weapons of mass destruction. That is why arms inspections--and I \nbelieve ultimately Saddam's unwillingness to submit to fail-safe \ninspections--is absolutely critical in building international support \nfor our case to the world.\n  That is the way in which you make it clear to the world that we are \ncontemplating war not for war's sake, and not to accomplish goals that \ndon't meet international standards or muster with respect to national \nsecurity, but because weapons inspections may be the ultimate \nenforcement mechanism, and that may be the way in which we ultimately \nprotect ourselves.\n  I am pleased that the Bush administration has recognized the wisdom \nof shifting its approach on Iraq. That shift has made it possible, in \nmy judgment, for the Senate to move forward with greater unity, having \nasked and begun to answer the questions that best defend our troops and \nprotect our national security. The Senate can now make a determination \nabout this resolution and, in this historic vote, help put our country \nand the world on a course to begin to answer one fundamental question--\nnot whether to hold Saddam Hussein accountable, but how.\n  I have said publicly for years that weapons of mass destruction in \nthe hands of Saddam Hussein pose a real and grave threat to our \nsecurity and that of our allies in the Persian Gulf region. Saddam \nHussein's record bears this out.\n  I have talked about that record. Iraq never fully accounted for the \nmajor gaps and inconsistencies in declarations provided to the \ninspectors of the pre-Gulf war weapons of mass destruction program, nor \ndid the Iraq regime provide credible proof that it had completely \ndestroyed its weapons and production infrastructure.\n  He has continually failed to meet the obligations imposed by the \ninternational community on Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf the \nIraqi regime provide credible proof war to declare and destroy its \nweapons of mass destruction and delivery systems and to forego the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. during the 7 years of weapons \ninspections, the Iraqi regime repeatedly frustrated the work of the \nUNSCOM--Special Commission--inspectors, culminating in 1998 in their \nouster. Even during the period of inspections, Iraq never fully \naccounted for major gaps and inconsistencies in declarations provided \nto the inspectors of its pre-gulf war WMD programs, nor did the Iraqi \nregime provide credible proof that it had completely destroyed its \nweapons stockpiles and production infrastructure.\n  It is clear that in the 4 years since the UNSCOM inspectors were \nforced out, Saddam Hussein has continued his quest for weapons of mass \ndestruction. According to intelligence, Iraq has chemical and \nbiological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of the 150 \nkilometer restriction imposed by the United Nations in the ceasefire \nresolution. Although Iraq's chemical weapons capability was reduced \nduring the UNSCOM inspections, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons \neffort over the last 4 years. Evidence suggests that it has begun \nrenewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including \nmustard gas, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX. Intelligence reports show that \nIraq has invested more heavily in its biological weapons programs over \nthe 4 years, with the result that all key aspects of this program--R, \nproduction and weaponization--are active. Most elements of the program \nare larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war. Iraq \nhas some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly \nproducing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, \nfor delivery on a range of vehicles such as bombs, missiles, aerial \nsprayers, and covert operatives which could bring them to the United \nStates homeland. Since inspectors left, the Iraqi regime has energized \nits missile program, probably now consisting of a few dozen Scud-type \nmissiles with ranges of 650 to 900 kilometers that could hit Israel, \nSaudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region. In addition, Iraq is \ndeveloping unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs, capable of delivering \nchemical and biological warfare agents, which could threaten Iraq's \nneighbors as well as American forces in the Persian Gulf.\n\n  Prior to the gulf war, Iraq had an advance nuclear weapons \ndevelopment program. Although UNSCOM and IAEA International Atomic \nEnergy Agency inspectors learned much about Iraq's efforts in this \narea, Iraq has failed to provide complete information on all aspects of \nits program. Iraq has maintained its nuclear scientists and technicians \nas well as sufficient dual-use manufacturing capability to support a \nreconstituted nuclear weapons program. Iraqi defectors who once worked \nfor Iraq's nuclear weapons establishment have reportedly told American \nofficials that acquiring nuclear weapons is a top priority for Saddam \nHussein's regime.\n  According to the CIA's report, all U.S. intelligence experts agree \nthat Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons. There\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\nis little question that Saddam Hussein wants to develop nuclear \nweapons. The more difficult question to answer is when Iraq could \nactually achieve this goal. That depends on is its ability to acquire \nweapons-grade fissile material. If Iraq could acquire this material \nfrom abroad, the CIA estimates that it could have a nuclear weapon \nwithin 1 year.\n  Absent a foreign supplier, it might be longer. There is no question \nthat Saddam Hussein represents a threat. I have heard even my \ncolleagues who oppose the President's resolution say we have to hold \nSaddam Hussein accountable. They also say we have to force the \ninspections. And to force the inspections, you have to be prepared to \nuse force.\n  So the issue is not over the question of whether or not the threat is \nreal, or whether or not people agree there is a threat. It is over what \nmeans we will take, and when, in order to try to eliminate it.\n  The reason for going to war, if we must fight, is not because Saddam \nHussein has failed to deliver gulf war prisoners or Kuwaiti property. \nAs much as we decry the way he has treated his people, regime change \nalone is not a sufficient reason for going to war, as desirable as it \nis to change the regime.\n  Regime change has been an American policy under the Clinton \nadministration, and it is the current policy. I support the policy. But \nregime change in and of itself is not sufficient justification for \ngoing to war--particularly unilaterally--unless regime change is the \nonly way to disarm Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction pursuant to \nthe United Nations resolution.\n  As bad as he is, Saddam Hussein, the dictator, is not the cause of \nwar. Saddam Hussein sitting in Baghdad with an arsenal of weapons of \nmass destruction is a different matter.\n  In the wake of September 11, who among us can say, with any \ncertainty, to anybody, that those weapons might not be used against our \ntroops or against allies in the region? Who can say that this master of \nmiscalculation will not develop a weapon of mass destruction even \ngreater--a nuclear weapon--then reinvade Kuwait, push the Kurds out, \nattack Israel, any number of scenarios to try to further his ambitions \nto be the pan-Arab leader or simply to confront in the region, and once \nagain miscalculate the response, to believe he is stronger because he \nhas those weapons?\n  And while the administration has failed to provide any direct link \nbetween Iraq and the events of September 11, can we afford to ignore \nthe possibility that Saddam Hussein might accidentally, as well as \npurposely, allow those weapons to slide off to one group or other in a \nregion where weapons are the currency of trade? How do we leave that to \nchance?\n  That is why the enforcement mechanism through the United Nations and \nthe reality of the potential of the use of force is so critical to \nachieve the protection of long-term interests, not just of the United \nStates but of the world, to understand that the dynamic has changed, \nthat we are living in a different status today, that we cannot sit by \nand be as complacent or even negligent about weapons of mass \ndestruction and proliferation as we have been in the past.\n  The Iraqi regime's record over the decade leaves little doubt that \nSaddam Hussein wants to retain his arsenal of weapons of mass \ndestruction and, obviously, as we have said, grow it. These weapons \nrepresent an unacceptable threat.\n  I want to underscore that this administration began this debate with \na resolution that granted exceedingly broad authority to the President \nto use force. I regret that some in the Congress rushed so quickly to \nsupport it. I would have opposed it. It gave the President the \nauthority to use force not only to enforce all of the U.N. resolutions \nas a cause of war, but also to produce regime change in Iraq, and to \nrestore international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region. It \nmade no mention of the President's efforts at the United Nations or the \nneed to build multilateral support for whatever course of action we \nultimately would take.\n  I am pleased that our pressure, and the questions we have asked, and \nthe criticisms that have been raised publicly, the debate in our \ndemocracy has pushed this administration to adopt important changes, \nboth in language as well as in the promises that they make.\n  The revised White House text, which we will vote on, limits the grant \nof authority to the President to the use of force only with respect to \nIraq. It does not empower him to use force throughout the Persian Gulf \nregion. It authorizes the President to use Armed Forces to defend the \n``national security'' of the United States--a power most of us believe \nhe already has under the Constitution as Commander in Chief. And it \nempowers him to enforce all ``relevant'' Security Council resolutions \nrelated to Iraq. None of those resolutions or, for that matter, any of \nthe other Security Council resolutions demanding Iraqi compliance with \nits international obligations, calls for a regime change.\n  In recent days, the administration has gone further. They are \ndefining what ``relevant'' U.N. Security Council resolutions mean. When \nSecretary Powell testified before our committee, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on September 26, he was asked what specific U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions the United States would go to war to enforce. His \nresponse was clear: the resolutions dealing with weapons of mass \ndestruction and the disarmament of Iraq. In fact, when asked about \ncompliance with other U.N. resolutions which do not deal with weapons \nof mass destruction, the Secretary said:\n\n       The President has not linked authority to go to war to any \n     of those elements.\n\n  When asked why the resolution sent by the President to Congress \nrequested authority to enforce all the resolutions with which Iraq had \nnot complied, the Secretary told the committee:\n\n       That's the way the resolution is currently worded, but we \n     all know, I think, that the major problem, the offense, what \n     the President is focused on and the danger to us and to the \n     world are the weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  In his speech on Monday night, President Bush confirmed what \nSecretary Powell told the committee. In the clearest presentation to \ndate, the President laid out a strong, comprehensive, and compelling \nargument why Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs are a threat \nto the United States and the international community. The President \nsaid:\n\n       Saddam Hussein must disarm himself, or, for the sake of \n     peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\n\n  This statement left no doubt that the casus belli for the United \nStates will be Iraq's failure to rid itself of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I would have preferred that the President agree to the approach \ndrafted by Senators Biden and Lugar because that resolution would \nauthorize the use of force for the explicit purpose of disarming Iraq \nand countering the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Biden-Lugar resolution also acknowledges the importance of the \nPresident's efforts at the United Nations. It would require the \nPresident, before exercising the authority granted in the resolution, \nto send a determination to Congress that the United States tried to \nseek a new Security Council resolution or that the threat posed by \nIraq's WMD is so great he must act absent a new resolution--a power, \nincidentally, that the President of the United States always has.\n  I believe this approach would have provided greater clarity to the \nAmerican people about the reason for going to war and the specific \ngrant of authority. I think it would have been a better way to do this. \nBut it does not change the bottom line of what we are voting for.\n  The administration, unwisely, in my view, rejected the Biden-Lugar \napproach. But, perhaps as a nod to the sponsors, it did agree to a \ndetermination requirement on the status of its efforts at the United \nNations. That is now embodied in the White House text.\n  The President has challenged the United Nations, as he should, and as \nall of us in the Senate should, to enforce its own resolutions vis-a-\nvis Iraq. And his administration is now working aggressively with the \nPerm 5 members on the Security Council to reach a consensus. As he told \nthe American people Monday night:\n\n       America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that \n     helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the \n     Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, \n     immediate requirements.\n\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\n\n  Because of my concerns, and because of the need to understand, with \nclarity, what this resolution meant, I traveled to New York a week ago. \nI met with members of the Security Council and came away with a \nconviction that they will indeed move to enforce, that they understand \nthe need to enforce, if Saddam Hussein does not fulfill his obligation \nto disarm.\n  And I believe they made it clear that if the United States operates \nthrough the U.N., and through the Security Council, they--all of them--\nwill also bear responsibility for the aftermath of rebuilding Iraq and \nfor the joint efforts to do what we need to do as a consequence of that \nenforcement.\n  I talked to Secretary General Kofi Annan at the end of last week and \nagain felt a reiteration of the seriousness with which the United \nNations takes this and that they will respond.\n  If the President arbitrarily walks away from this course of action--\nwithout good cause or reason--the legitimacy of any subsequent action \nby the United States against Iraq will be challenged by the American \npeople and the international community. And I would vigorously oppose \nthe President doing so.\n  When I vote to give the President of the United States the authority \nto use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein, it is because I \nbelieve that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his \nhands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security and that of our \nallies in the Persian Gulf region. I will vote yes because I believe it \nis the best way to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. And the \nadministration, I believe, is now committed to a recognition that war \nmust be the last option to address this threat, not the first, and that \nwe must act in concert with allies around the globe to make the world's \ncase against Saddam Hussein.\n  As the President made clear earlier this week, ``Approving this \nresolution does not mean that military action is imminent or \nunavoidable.'' It means ``America speaks with one voice.''\n  Let me be clear, the vote I will give to the President is for one \nreason and one reason only: To disarm Iraq of weapons of mass \ndestruction, if we cannot accomplish that objective through new, tough \nweapons inspections in joint concert with our allies.\n  In giving the President this authority, I expect him to fulfill the \ncommitments he has made to the American people in recent days--to work \nwith the United Nations Security Council to adopt a new resolution \nsetting out tough and immediate inspection requirements, and to act \nwith our allies at our side if we have to disarm Saddam Hussein by \nforce. If he fails to do so, I will be among the first to speak out.\n  If we do wind up going to war with Iraq, it is imperative that we do \nso with others in the international community, unless there is a \nshowing of a grave, imminent--and I emphasize ``imminent''--threat to \nthis country which requires the President to respond in a way that \nprotects our immediate national security needs.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair has recognized a similar need to \ndistinguish how we approach this. He has said that he believes we \nshould move in concert with allies, and he has promised his own party \nthat he will not do so otherwise. The administration may not be in the \nhabit of building coalitions, but that is what they need to do. And it \nis what can be done. If we go it alone without reason, we risk \ninflaming an entire region, breeding a new generation of terrorists, a \nnew cadre of anti-American zealots, and we will be less secure, not \nmore secure, at the end of the day, even with Saddam Hussein disarmed.\n  Let there be no doubt or confusion about where we stand on this. I \nwill support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force, if we ever \nexhaust those other options, as the President has promised, but I will \nnot support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is \nimminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any \ncircumstances.\n  In voting to grant the President the authority, I am not giving him \ncarte blanche to run roughshod over every country that poses or may \npose some kind of potential threat to the United States. Every nation \nhas the right to act preemptively, if it faces an imminent and grave \nthreat, for its self-defense under the standards of law. The threat we \nface today with Iraq does not meet that test yet. I emphasize ``yet.'' \nYes, it is grave because of the deadliness of Saddam Hussein's arsenal \nand the very high probability that he might use these weapons one day \nif not disarmed. But it is not imminent, and no one in the CIA, no \nintelligence briefing we have had suggests it is imminent. None of our \nintelligence reports suggest that he is about to launch an attack.\n  The argument for going to war against Iraq is rooted in enforcement \nof the international community's demand that he disarm. It is not \nrooted in the doctrine of preemption. Nor is the grant of authority in \nthis resolution an acknowledgment that Congress accepts or agrees with \nthe President's new strategic doctrine of preemption. Just the \nopposite. This resolution clearly limits the authority given to the \nPresident to use force in Iraq, and Iraq only, and for the specific \npurpose of defending the United States against the threat posed by Iraq \nand enforcing relevant Security Council resolutions.\n  The definition of purpose circumscribes the authority given to the \nPresident to the use of force to disarm Iraq because only Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction meet the two criteria laid out in this \nresolution.\n\n  Congressional action on this resolution is not the end of our \nnational debate on how best to disarm Iraq. Nor does it mean we have \nexhausted all of our peaceful options to achieve this goal. There is \nmuch more to be done. The administration must continue its efforts to \nbuild support at the United Nations for a new, unfettered, \nunconditional weapons inspection regime. If we can eliminate the threat \nposed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction through inspections, \nwhenever, wherever, and however we want them, including in palaces--and \nI am highly skeptical, given the full record, given their past \npractices, that we can necessarily achieve that--then we have an \nobligation to try that as the first course of action before we expend \nAmerican lives in any further effort.\n  American success in the Persian Gulf war was enhanced by the creation \nof an international coalition. Our coalition partners picked up the \noverwhelming burden of the cost of that war. It is imperative that the \nadministration continue to work to multilateralize the current effort \nagainst Iraq. If the administration's initiatives at the United Nations \nare real and sincere, other nations are more likely to invest, to stand \nbehind our efforts to force Iraq to disarm, be it through a new, \nrigorous, no-nonsense program of inspection, or if necessary, through \nthe use of force. That is the best way to proceed.\n  The United States, without question, has the military power to enter \nthis conflict unilaterally. But we do need friends. We need logistical \nsupport such as bases, command and control centers, overflight rights \nfrom allies in the region. And most importantly, we need to be able to \nsuccessfully wage the war on terror simultaneously. That war on terror \ndepends more than anything else on the sharing of intelligence. That \nsharing of intelligence depends more than anything else on the \ncooperation of countries in the region. If we disrupt that, we could \ndisrupt the possibilities of the capacity of that war to be most \neffectively waged.\n  I believe the support from the region will come only if they are \nconvinced of the credibility of our arguments and the legitimacy of our \nmission. The United Nations never has veto power over any measure the \nUnited States needs to take to protect our national security. But it is \nin our interest to try to act with our allies, if at all possible. And \nthat should be because the burden of eliminating the threat posed by \nweapons of mass destruction should not be ours alone. It should not be \nthe American people's alone.\n  If in the end these efforts fail, and if in the end we are at war, we \nwill have an obligation, ultimately, to the Iraqi people with whom we \nare not at war. This is a war against a regime, mostly one man. So \nother nations in the region and all of us will need to help create an \nIraq that is a place and a force for stability and openness in the \nregion. That effort is going to be long term, costly, and not without \ndifficulty, given Iraq's ethnic and religious divisions and history of \ndomestic turbulence. In Afghanistan, the administration has given more \nlipservice\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\nthan resources to the rebuilding effort. We cannot allow that to happen \nin Iraq, and we must be prepared to stay the course over however many \nyears it takes to do it right.\n  The challenge is great: An administration which made nation building \na dirty word needs to develop a comprehensive, Marshall-type plan, if \nit will meet the challenge. The President needs to give the American \npeople a fairer and fuller, clearer understanding of the magnitude and \nlong-term financial cost of that effort.\n  The international community's support will be critical because we \nwill not be able to rebuild Iraq singlehandedly. We will lack the \ncredibility and the expertise and the capacity.\n  It is clear the Senate is about to give the President the authority \nhe has requested sometime in the next days. Whether the President will \nhave to use that authority depends ultimately on Saddam Hussein. Saddam \nHussein has a choice: He can continue to defy the international \ncommunity, or he can fulfill his longstanding obligations to disarm. He \nis the person who has brought the world to this brink of \nconfrontation. He is the dictator who can end the stalemate simply by \nfollowing the terms of the agreement which left him in power.\n\n  By standing with the President, Congress would demonstrate our Nation \nis united in its determination to take away that arsenal, and we are \naffirming the President's right and responsibility to keep the American \npeople safe. One of the lessons I learned from fighting in a very \ndifferent war, at a different time, is we need the consent of the \nAmerican people for our mission to be legitimate and sustainable. I do \nknow what it means, as does Senator Hagel, to fight in a war where that \nconsent is lost, where allies are in short supply, where conditions are \nhostile, and the mission is ill-defined.\n  That is why I believe so strongly before one American soldier steps \nfoot on Iraqi soil, the American people must understand completely its \nurgency. They need to know we put our country in the position of \nultimate strength and that we have no options, short of war, to \neliminate a threat we could not tolerate.\n  I believe the work we have begun in this Senate, by offering \nquestions, and not blind acquiescence, has helped put our Nation on a \nresponsible course. It has succeeded, certainly, in putting Saddam \nHussein on notice that he will be held accountable; but it also has put \nthe administration on notice we will hold them accountable for the \nmeans by which we do this.\n  It is through constant questioning we will stay the course, and that \nis a course that will ultimately defend our troops and protect our \nnational security.\n  President Kennedy faced a similar difficult challenge in the days of \nthe Cuban missile crisis. He decided not to proceed, I might add, \npreemptively. He decided to show the evidence and proceeded through the \ninternational institutions. He said at the time:\n\n       The path we have chosen is full of hazards, as all paths \n     are . . . The cost of freedom is always high, but Americans \n     have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and \n     that is the path of surrender, or submission.\n\n  So I believe the Senate will make it clear, and the country will make \nit clear, that we will not be blackmailed or extorted by these weapons, \nand we will not permit the United Nations--an institution we have \nworked hard to nurture and create--to simply be ignored by this \ndictator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, the Senate is, by design, a deliberative \ninstitution. Over this past week, we have witnessed thoughtful debate \nand commentary on how to meet the challenge of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. \nOurs is not an academic exercise; debate informs our decision whether \nto authorize the President to use force if necessary to enforce U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions dealing with Iraqi disarmament.\n  There are no easy answers in Iraq. The decision to commit our troops \nto war is the most difficult decision Members of Congress make. Each \ncourse of action we consider in Iraq leads us into imperfect, \ndangerous, and unknown situations. But we cannot avoid decision on \nIraq. The President cannot avoid decision on Iraq. The risks of \ninaction are too high. We are elected to solve problems, not just \ndebate them. The time has come to chart a new course in Iraq and in the \nMiddle East.\n  History informs our debate and our decisions. We know tyranny cannot \nbe appeased. We also know our power and influence are enhanced by both \na nobility of purpose and the support of allies and institutions that \nreinforce an international commitment to peace and prosperity. We know \nwar has its own dynamic, that it favors neither ideology, nor \ndemocracy, nor tyranny, that men and women die, and that nations and \nindividuals who know war are never again the same.\n  President Bush has rightly brought the case against Iraq back before \nthe United Nations. Our problems with Iraq, as well as terrorism and \nthe worldwide proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are not \nAmerica's alone. Israel, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq's own \nKurdish population, and other nations and peoples are on the front \nlines of Saddam Hussein's ambitions for weapons of mass death.\n  The United Nations, with American leadership, must act decisively to \nend Saddam Hussein's decade-long violations of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions.\n  America's best case for the possible use of force against Iraq rests \nwith the American and international commitment to enforcing Iraq's \ndisarmament. The diplomatic process is not easy, and we face the \ncompeting interests and demands of Russia, France, China, and others, \nwhose interests in Iraq may not always be the same as ours. A regional \nand international coalition is essential for creating the political \nenvironment that will be required for any action we take in Iraq, and \nespecially for how we sustain a democratic transition in a post-Saddam \nIraq. We cannot do it alone.\n  America--including the Congress--and the world, must speak with one \nvoice about Iraqi disarmament, as it must continue to do so in the war \non terrorism.\n  Because the stakes are so high, America must be careful with her \nrhetoric and mindful of how others perceive her intentions. Actions in \nIraq must come in the context of an American-led, multilateral approach \nto disarmament, not as the first case for a new American doctrine \ninvolving the preemptive use of force. America's challenge in this new \ncentury will be to strengthen its relationships around the world while \nleading the world in our war on terrorism, for it is the success of the \nfirst challenge that will determine the success of the second. We \nshould not mistake our foreign policy priorities for ideology in a rush \nto proclaim a new doctrine in world affairs. America must understand it \ncannot alone win a war against terrorism. It will require allies, \nfriends, and partners.\n  American leadership in the world will be further defined by our \nactions in Iraq and the Middle East. What begins in Iraq will not end \nin Iraq. There will be other ``Iraqs.'' There will be continued acts of \nterrorism, proliferating powers, and regional conflicts. If we do it \nright and lead through the U.N., in concert with our allies, we can set \na new standard for American leadership and international cooperation. \nThe perception of American power is power, and how our power is \nperceived can either magnify or diminish our influence in the world. \nThe Senate has a constitutional responsibility and an institutional \nobligation in this effort.\n  Federalist Paper No. 63 specifically notes the responsibilities of \nthe Senate in foreign affairs as follows:\n\n       An attention to the judgment of other nations is important \n     to every government for two reasons: The one is that \n     independently of the merits of any particular plan or \n     measure, it is desirable, on various accounts, that it should \n     appear to other nations as the offspring of a wise and \n     honorable policy; the second is that, in doubtful cases, \n     particularly where the national councils may be warped by \n     some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or \n     known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide \n     that can always be followed. What has not America lost by her \n     want of character with foreign nations and how many errors \n     and follies would she not have avoided, if the justice and \n     propriety of her measures had, in every instance, been \n     previously tried by the light in which they would probably \n     appear to the unbiased part of mankind?\n\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n\n  Remarkable words. The resolution before us today should be tried in \nthat same light as the Federalist Papers points out. The original \nresolution proposed by the Bush administration, S.J. Res. 45, would \nhave been a setback for this institution. It did not reflect the best \ndemocratic traditions of either Congressional-Executive relations, or \nthe conduct of American foreign policy.\n  S.J. Res. 46, sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Warner, McCain, and \nBayh, is a far more responsible and accountable document than the one \nwe started with 3 weeks ago. I congratulate my colleagues, especially \nSenators Lugar, Biden, and Daschle, and the four sponsors of this \nresolution, for their efforts and leadership in getting it to this \npoint.\n  S.J. Res. 46 narrows the authorization for the use of force to all \nrelevant U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq, and to defending our national \ninterests against the threats posed by Iraq. It includes support for \nU.S. diplomatic efforts at the U.N.; a requirement that, before taking \naction, the President formally determines that diplomatic or other \npeaceful means will not be adequate in meeting our \nobjectives; reference to the war powers resolution requirements; and \nperiodic reports to Congress that include those actions described in \nthe section of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 regarding assistance and \nsupport for Iraq upon replacement of Saddam Hussein. This resolution \nrecognizes Congress as a coequal partner in dealing with the threat \nfrom Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n\n  If disarmament in Iraq requires the use of force, we need to consider \ncarefully the implications and consequences of our actions. The future \nof Iraq after Saddam Hussein is also an open question. Some of my \ncolleagues and some American analysts now speak authoritatively of \nSunnis, Shiites, and Kurds in Iraq, and how Iraq can be a test case for \ndemocracy in the Arab world.\n  How many of us really know and understand much about Iraq, the \ncountry, the history, the people, the role in the Arab world? I \napproach the issue of post-Saddam Iraq and the future of democracy and \nstability in the Middle East with more caution, realism, and a bit more \nhumility. While the people of the Arab world need no education from \nAmerica about Saddam's record of deceit, aggression, and brutality, and \nwhile many of them may respect and desire the freedoms the American \nmodel offers, imposing democracy through force in Iraq is a roll of the \ndice. A democratic effort cannot be maintained without building durable \nIraqi political institutions and developing a regional and \ninternational commitment to Iraq's reconstruction. No small task.\n  To succeed, our commitment must extend beyond the day after to the \nmonths and years after Saddam is gone. The American people must be told \nof this long-term commitment, risk, and costs of this undertaking.\n  We should not be seduced by the expectations of ``dancing in the \nstreets'' after Saddam's regime has fallen, the kites, the candy, and \ncheering crowds we expect to greet our troops, but instead, focus on \nthe great challenges ahead, the commitment and resources that will be \nneeded to ensure a democratic transition in Iraq and a more stable and \npeaceful Middle East. We should spend more time debating the \ncost and extent of this commitment, the risks we may face in military \nengagement with Iraq, the implications of the precedent of United \nStates military action for regime change, and the likely character and \nchallenges of a post-Saddam Iraq. We have heard precious little from \nthe President, his team, as well as from this Congress, with a few \nnotable exceptions, about these most difficult and critical questions.\n  We need only look to Afghanistan where the Afghan people joyously \nwelcomed our liberation force but, months later, a fragile transition \ngovernment grapples with rebuilding a fractured political culture, \neconomy, and country.\n  However, Iraq, because of its resources, geography, capabilities, \nhistory, and people, offers even more complications and greater peril \nand, yes, greater opportunities and greater promise. This is the vast \nunknown, the heavy burden that lies ahead.\n  The Senate should not cast a vote in the hopes of putting Iraq behind \nus so we can get back to our campaigns or move on to other issues next \nyear. The decision to possibly commit a nation to war cannot and should \nnot ever be considered in the context of either party loyalty or \ncampaign politics. I regret that this vote will take place under the \ncloud and pressure of elections next month. Some are already using the \nIraq issue to gain advantage in political campaigns. It might have \nbeen better for our vote to have been delayed until after the \nelections, as it was in 1990. Authorizing the use of force against Iraq \nor any country for any purpose should always be weighed on its own \nmerits, not with an eye on the politics of the vote or campaign TV \nspots. War is too serious, the human price too high, and the \nimplications unforeseen.\n\n  While I cannot predict the future, I believe that what we decide in \nthis Chamber this week will influence America's security and role in \nthe world for the coming decades. It will serve as the framework, both \nintentionally and unintentionally, for the future. It will set in \nmotion a series of actions and events that we cannot now understand or \ncontrol.\n  In authorizing the use of force against Iraq, we are at the beginning \nof a road that has no clear end. The votes in Congress this week are \nvotes for an intensification of engagement with Iraq and the Middle \nEast, a world of which we know very little and whose destiny will now \nbe directly tied to ours.\n  America cannot trade a new focus on Iraq for a lesser effort in the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The bloodshed between Israel and the \nPalestinians continues, and the danger mounts. Stability in Afghanistan \nis not assured. We must carry through with our commitment. Stability in \nthis region depends on it. America's credibility is at stake, and long-\nterm stability in central and South Asia hangs in the balance.\n  We must also continue to pay close attention to North Korea where \nthere is no guesswork about nuclear weapons. There on the Korean \npeninsula reside nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and 37,000 \nAmerican troops. Despite setting the right course for disarmament in \nIraq, the administration has yet to define an end game in Iraq or \nexplain the extent of the American commitment if regime change is \nrequired, or describe how our actions in Iraq might affect our other \nmany interests and commitments around the world.\n  I share the hope of a better world without Saddam Hussein, but we do \nnot really know if our intervention in Iraq will lead to democracy in \neither Iraq or elsewhere in the Arab world. America has continued to \ntake on large, complicated, and expensive responsibilities that will \nplace heavy burdens on all of us over the next generation. It may well \nbe necessary, but Americans should understand the extent of this burden \nand what may be required to pay for it and support it in both American \nblood and trade.\n  As the Congress votes on this resolution, we must understand that we \nhave not put Iraqi issues behind us. This is just the beginning. The \nrisks should not be understated, miscast, or misunderstood. Ours is a \npath of both peril and opportunity with many detours and no shortcuts.\n  We in the Congress are men and women of many parts. For me, it is the \npresent-day Senator, the former soldier, or concerned father who guides \nmy judgment and ultimate vote? It is pieces of all, for I am pieces of \nall. The responsibilities of each lead me to support the Lieberman-\nMcCain-Warner-Bayh resolution, for which I will vote.\n  In the end, each of us who has the high honor of holding public \noffice has the burden and privilege of decision and responsibilities. \nIt is a sacred trust we share with the public. We will be held \naccountable for our actions, as it must be.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he departs the floor, I commend my \ncolleague from Nebraska. I regret--it is late in the day, and I am sure \nthere is\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\ngoing to be more speechifying tomorrow on this subject matter--but I \nregret there were not more Members present to hear his comments.\n  Senator Hagel is one of the most thoughtful Members of this body. \nWhen he talks about the sum of all our parts and talks about being a \nfather and a soldier, it is always in our interest to listen to those \nwho have worn the military uniform into combat when we debate the \nissues of war and peace because they know more than just intellectually \nand theoretically what the price can be.\n\n  I believe I should give my remarks because I have written these \nthings out, but I can associate myself with the comments of my friend \nfrom Nebraska. He pretty much couches a lot of my thinking on how this \nhas evolved, where we are, what we have come to this evening, the pace \nat which we are moving, the regrets I feel about how I wish this debate \nwere being conducted under circumstances other than on the eve of an \nelection in this country where already the campaign spots are running \nwildly one way or the other in terms of where people are. So I commend \nthe Senator for his comments this afternoon on this subject matter.\n  I come this afternoon to speak about the subject which is on the \nminds not only of all of us but I think millions of our constituents \nacross the country, the possibility of going to war against Iraq.\n  On Monday night, President Bush, I think, spoke for all of us. I know \nof no one who really disagrees at all. He described Saddam Hussein as a \nhomicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction. It \nis that addiction that demands a strong response. We all agree on that. \nThere is no question that Iraq possesses biological and chemical \nweapons and that he seeks to acquire additional weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. That is not in debate. I also \nagree with President Bush that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and \nmust be disarmed, to quote President Bush directly. I suspect virtually \nevery Member of this Chamber would not vary too much with those \nconclusions.\n  How imminent that threat is, unfortunately, has been extremely \ndifficult to assess. This is because of a troubling new trend by the \nintelligence agencies to not just give us information and objective \nanalysis but, in my opinion, too often to insert themselves into \npolicymaking. That is not their job. It is not the job of the \nintelligence agencies to make policy. It is their job to provide others \nin the executive branch and the Congress with neutral information, with \nfacts on which we will ultimately base our policy judgments.\n  This is a very troubling trend, in my view, which I believe ought to \nstop. If we are to go to war, it is even more important that we trust \nthe information given by the intelligence agencies.\n  Nevertheless, this week we are debating because there are profound \ndisagreements over how, when, and with whom we should act to deal with \nthe threat posed by Iraq.\n  To have a different answer to these questions than the President \nshould not be considered unpatriotic or partisan. Unfortunately, that \nis the kind of rhetoric we are hearing too often today.\n  Let's be honest. We are less than 30 days out from a national \ncongressional election in this country. That is never an easy time for \nthe Congress and the executive branch to come together on much of \nanything, let alone the question of war and peace.\n  Some in this Chamber have said the eve of an election is in fact the \nbest time for Members of Congress to make decisions such as these. I \ncould not disagree more. As my good friend and colleague, Senator Byrd, \nhas passionately reminded us every day this week, forcing a vote on \nthis issue so close to an election will, whether we like it or not, \nembroil the issue in politics more than usual.\n  The campaign ads running across this country speak for themselves. \nForcing Congress's hand on this important matter does a disservice, I \nbelieve, to the American public and to this most profound and serious \ndebate. But now we have no choice but to consider the matter and to \nvote on the issues of this utmost gravity, the issues of war and peace \nand of life and death, for those who will engage in it.\n\n  The President has asked Congress to grant him the authority to use \nforce against Iraq, if he deems it necessary, and Congress will provide \nthe President with the authority to respond effectively to the threat \nposed by Iraq. But we will do so only after careful consideration of \nall of the stakes involved.\n  My colleagues, Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, Senator Levin, and \nothers, have done an outstanding job of highlighting their questions \nand concerns, reflecting the questions and concerns raised by millions \nof Americans across political and economic lines, across geographic \nlines in this country; questions and concerns regarding the use of \nforce and the resolution the President originally sent to Congress, a \nnumber of these concerns which I think many of us share.\n  Many of us believe the language of the President's original request \nwas too far reaching, empowering the President to use all means \nnecessary that he would determine appropriate, including force, to \nrestore peace and stability to the region. That was an open invitation \nfor an American military involvement in the broad context of the Middle \nEast. And the language was far too unilateral. It did not even mention \na role for the United Nations or our allies.\n  Thanks to the efforts of our congressional leaders--and I commend \nspecifically Senator Daschle and others--we now have a compromise \nresolution, a modified resolution, correcting many of the evident flaws \nin the initial resolution that was sent to us.\n  The resolution now before us is limited to Iraq, and it contemplates \nthe possibility of resolving this threat peacefully through the use of \ndiplomacy. It also acknowledges the importance of maintaining our focus \non our continuing war on terrorism as we consider what action to take \nin Iraq.\n  Despite these changes, of course, questions do remain. First and \nforemost, will the President use the authority granted by Congress to \ngo it alone? Or will he take the time to build the international \ncoalition that the overwhelming majority of Americans believe is the \nbetter course of action to follow?\n  If he chooses to go it alone, I believe that will be a terrible \nmistake, and I think millions of others in this country do as well. \nGiven the geography and the politics of the region in the Middle East, \nI do not see how the United States could engage Iraq militarily, \nwithout the help of others, without seriously undermining our chances \nof success. And it would be terribly destabilizing to the entire \nregion.\n  There are many reasons for acting with international support.\n  I have already commended the President for his decision to look first \nto the United Nations to answer these questions. On September 12, \nspeaking before the United Nations General Assembly, President Bush \nenumerated Iraq's repeated failures to meet its international \nobligations.\n  The U.N. has been a valued body for the last one-half of the 20th \ncentury. It has not always done what we wanted. It has not always acted \ndeliberately. It has not always acted with the kind of force and \ndirection that many of us wish it would have. But think what the world \nwould have looked like over the last 50 years had there not been a \nUnited Nations to have a forum where the world gathers to try to \nresolve the many conflicts that confront us.\n\n  It has not served our interests well to have national leadership \nridicule this institution. We are the founders, in many ways, of the \nU.N. system. It was the great leaders in the post-World War II period \nwho insisted we try to frame an international body where we might \nresolve disputes other than going through what we did throughout World \nWar II. My hope would be that as dark as these clouds may seem as we \ndebate and consider the issue of Iraq, that this may be an opportunity \nfor the institution of the United Nations to mature into the 21st \ncentury role it must if we are going to succeed in the efforts against \nterrorism, the efforts against Iraq or other problems that will emerge, \nwithout any question, in the coming years.\n  My hope will be that this U.N. will look at what we are doing, listen \nto what we are saying as one nation, and consider how important its \nrole must be in the coming weeks and months. If there ever were a set \nof circumstances that justified U.N. action, I believe it is now on \nIraq, without any question.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n  If the framework of international law, developed at the U.N. over the \nlast 50 years to protect peace and security, is to stand, then the U.N. \nmust act with leadership. It is my sincere hope that the President has \nthe patience and staying power to make the U.N. work in support of our \ninterests.\n  There is also no question that the President's speech, in which he \ncalled for a more engaged U.N., got Saddam Hussein's attention. Iraq \nquickly announced its willingness to permit weapons inspections \nbeginning as early as the middle of October.\n  At the end of the day, I suspect Iraq will accept whatever terms are \nultimately contained in a final version of the U.N. resolution now \nunder consideration. To be credible, however, that resolution must have \nteeth. It must be enforceable, by military means, if necessary, should \nIraq fail to comply with any new disarmament regime.\n  I also have questions about the ultimate goal of U.S. strategy, what \nit is and what it ought to be. Is it the destruction of Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction or the Iraqi regime itself? Secretary of State \nColin Powell was definitive before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in saying--and I quote him--regime change for its own sake \nwas not the administration's goal.\n  Specifically, he stated:\n\n       If Iraq was to disarm as a result of an inspection regime \n     that gave us and the Security Council confidence that it had \n     been disarmed, I think it unlikely that we would find a casus \n     belli.\n\n  Many Members are still very concerned that President Bush has regime \nchange on his mind. If anything, Monday night's speech clarified this \nposition when he said that ``regime change in Iraq is the only certain \nmeans of removing a great danger to our Nation.''\n  I hope the President will heed the advice of his Secretary of State \nand keep our eye on the ball. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction should \nbe our immediate threat or seen as our immediate threat, not some two-\nbit dictator that Saddam Hussein is. It is the weapons of mass \ndestruction; but for those we would not be here debating or discussing \nthe matter we are this evening.\n  Finally, I still have concerns about how the President intends to \nmanage the war on terrorism if we confront Iraq militarily. September \n11 revealed Saddam Hussein is not the only or perhaps even the greatest \nthreat to our national security. Those who hold no allegiance to any \nstate, who have no name or return address, are a far greater threat to \nAmerica and the American way of life. As recent arrests in Buffalo, NY, \nand Portland, OR, remind us, these threats are not always in some \ndistant land. The United States acting without global support could \ndivert our military intelligence assets away from our global effort to \ncombat terrorism and to uproot terrorist organizations. It could also \nweaken the multilateral coalition forged over the last 12 months to \ncombat this international scourge.\n  I state for the record I do not hold some ironclad view that the \nUnited States should never use force or act alone. And I believe that \nthe President of the United States already has the authority as \nCommander in Chief to deploy military force to protect America against \nall imminent threats. The pending resolution recognizes this reality. \nThe fact is, unless force is a real option, our resolution will not \nhave the credibility needed to, once and for all, get Saddam Hussein's \nfull attention on this matter.\n  As I said earlier, I accept the proposition that we must deal with \nthe Iraqi threat. I stand prepared, as almost all of our colleagues do, \nto support the unilateral use of force against Iraq but only if U.N. or \nother multinational efforts prove ineffective, or if Saddam Hussein is \nusing them as a guise to rebuild his offensive weapons capabilities.\n  We still have time to do this right.\n  Mr. WARNER. At the appropriate time, could I pose a question on the \nUnited Nations to my colleague?\n  Mr. DODD. After I complete my remarks.\n  We still have time to do this right. We should have an opportunity to \ndebate and vote on all meaningful alternatives to the pending \nresolution, regardless of parliamentary technicalities. For that \nreason, I join with my colleague, Senator Byrd, in opposing cloture \nwhen we vote on this issue tomorrow. I am not persuaded that the \nsituation is so dire that a few more days or an additional week of \ndeliberations at the U.N. will be harmful to our interests.\n  I have been in this body 22 years. The unique role of the Senate is \nthe role of debate, unlimited debate. It is what makes us fundamentally \ndifferent from the Chamber down the hall. If there are Members of this \nbody who wish to be heard and wish to offer meaningful ideas to \nsomething as critical as this, then asking this body to take a few more \ndays to weigh and discuss those matters ought not to be denied. We are \ninvoking cloture too often. I know people are interested in efficiency, \nbut if efficiency was the only goal of the Founding Fathers, they \nnever would have created this body to begin with. They understood the \nimportance of debate and discussion when a matter of this magnitude and \nthis significance is before the American public.\n\n  I don't know how many others intend to support my colleague from West \nVirginia, but I do, not because I necessarily agree with him in his \nfinal conclusion, but I stand to defend his right to be heard and to \nsee to it that he has the opportunity to exhaust his ideas, to share \nthem not only with Senators but with the American people. I hope \ncloture will not necessarily be invoked prematurely.\n  Our own CIA Director states the likelihood of Iraq using weapons of \nmass destruction against the United States or passing them off to \nterrorists to do so is currently long. The real risk emerges should \nSaddam Hussein believe an attack by the United States is imminent. That \nis according to press accounts today.\n  I hope the President does not see the passage of a resolution in the \nCongress as a termination state for his efforts at the United Nations \nbut rather as a sign of unity and support of continued effort by the \nUnited States to elicit further action by the United Nations.\n  Senators Biden, Lugar, Senator Hagel and others crafted an approach \nto this issue that I found extremely constructive. I regret the \nadministration did not endorse their ideas. This week's debate would be \nfar less contentious had they done so. Their idea was, of course, to \nfocus on the weapons of mass destruction, a multilateral force, \nunilateral action if the U.N. efforts or multilateral efforts failed \nand serious thoughts about what you do to win the peace after the \nconflict is over. That idea will not be offered as an alternative. I \nregret that is the case. It is an idea that I found potentially rather \nattractive.\n  Some very important elements of the Biden-Lugar draft resolution have \nbeen incorporated in the White House compromise language. I commend the \nWhite House, those that have been involved in crafting this resolution \nfor including this language.\n  First in this resolution there is an acknowledgment of U.S. efforts \nwithin the United Nations Security Council to forge international \nagreement on a prompt and decisive strategy to compel Iraqi compliance \nand the explicit congressional endorsement of such evidence.\n  Second, the requirement that the President make several important \ndeterminations before exercising any military option; namely, ``that \nfurther diplomatic or other peaceful means alone will not adequately \nprotect the national security of the United States.'' And that our \nefforts to fight international terrorism will not be undermined by \nmilitary action against Iraq. Those determinations are going to be \nextremely important.\n  Third, and most importantly, the narrowing of the President's \nauthority to use force to specifically defend the national security of \nthe United States against a threat posed by Iraq's possession of \nweapons of mass destruction. As I noted earlier, Secretary Colin Powell \nmade it clear in testimony before the Senate and in remarks elsewhere, \nthat it is Iraq's weapons of mass destruction that is the threat to our \nnational security. If Iraq disarms or is disarmed, then the immediate \nthreat to our security would evaporate and force would not be \nnecessary. The benefits of that outcome should be obvious to all.\n  Finally, the new language recognizes the need to have in place an \neffective exit strategy should military force prove unavoidable. These \nchanges in the original text of the resolution are extremely important. \nWithout them, I\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nwould not be able to consider support of this legislation.\n\n  Let me sum up where this Senator stands on this. I support Senator \nByrd's motion because more time is needed. It is not a burden on this \nbody to consider questions and to listen to Members. We should not be \ncut off in debate in being heard on a matter of this importance and \nsignificance. I regret Senators Biden and Lugar and others have not \nmoved forward with their proposal. It was the most comprehensive \napproach, in my view, to dealing with the questions of weapons of mass \ndestruction, U.N. involvement in the aftermath of the conflict.\n  Third, I think every effort ought to be made to resolve this threat \nas peacefully as possible.\n  Fourth, that if military force becomes necessary, every effort must \nbe made to do it multilaterally either through the U.N. or multilateral \ncoalitions.\n  Fifth, I believe the more immediate threat is international \nterrorism, and that such a threat can only be contained through \ncollective action.\n  Sixth, if we must act unilaterally, then the threat must be clear, \ngrave, and imminent.\n  Last, in cases of preemptive action, we must be even more sure the \nthreat is immediate and grave for the obvious reasons of setting \nprecedent that other nations may model in conflicts that threat \neveryone around the globe.\n  The context within which I deliberated over the difficult decision on \nhow I would vote on this imperfect resolution has been hard, always \nbeing mindful of the dangers that could result from granting authority \ncontained in this resolution. Ultimately, my main reason for supporting \nthe resolution is that I believe the chances of avoiding war with Iraq \nare enhanced substantially if this country is united as a nation.\n  I know members of the United Nations Security Council are listening \nto this debate very intently and are going to watch this vote very \ncarefully. American unity will strengthen, I believe, the President's \nhand in convincing members of the Security Council that the civilized \nworld must act and must unite in its action.\n  Today, in joining with many of my colleagues in support of this \nresolution, I do so in the fervent hope that this show of unity in \nauthorizing the President to use force will reduce the likelihood that \nforce will ultimately be necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNevada is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished assistant leader. \nI apologize to the Chair. I understand he has a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Thank you. I know the Senator from Kansas is to be \nrecognized next.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the statement \nof the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, that Senator Dayton be \nrecognized for 15 minutes; following that, Senator Frist be recognized \nfor 15 minutes; following Senator Frist, Senator Domenici be recognized \nfor 20 minutes; and, following that, Senator Levin be recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no objection.\n  While the leader is in the Chamber--I had the opportunity to speak \nwith the leader just a minute ago--the pending amendment is by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I hope, in order to \nkeep the momentum going on this bill, that we can move forward towards \ndebate on that amendment and its terms such that, should there be those \non our side who wish to table or otherwise move along--we have 13 \namendments here, and a number of them have been determined by the \nParliamentarian to be germane. Given cloture tomorrow, of which the \nassistant leader is familiar, I am just suggesting strongly that the \nByrd amendment be the pending amendment.\n  Is there a possibility in the assistant leader's mind that we might \naddress that amendment tonight by way of a vote?\n  Mr. REID. I will be speaking to Senator Byrd momentarily.\n  I also say--to make sure everyone understands--that the majority \nleader, after the last vote, announced that we are going to finish this \nlegislation tomorrow. Tomorrow takes us into Friday morning. But he has \nindicated we are going to finish this. There is a lot of work to do. \nBut it can be done--it will be done. There is no question but that we \nare going to do it. If any Senators are waiting around until next week \nto give their speech, there will be no next week.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is obvious to the leader, but the \namendments, I respectfully say, are on his side of the aisle. \nTherefore, his assistance is vital in helping us move these amendments \nalong so that they can be given a proper amount of consideration, and \nbefore they are acted upon by a vote, for those that require a vote.\n  Mr. REID. The reason we have two Republicans is in order to balance \nout the time. The Senator from Massachusetts spoke for longer than \nothers have spoken.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, the \nassistant leader, has been eminently fair in working with Senator \nMcCain and myself in the management of this, as well as Senator \nLieberman who also has taken quite an active role in the management. I \nthink we have had a good debate. The pending amendment laid down by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is a matter that I think \nshould be addressed as early as we can possibly arrange, and possibly \ndispose of it tonight, one way or the other, so that we can move on \nwith this volume of some 13 amendments, many of which are germane.\n  Mr. REID. I will speak to Senator Byrd. Senator Lieberman has an \namendment on which he has talked for about a week or more. We will have \nto get consent to set Senator Byrd's amendment aside, or dispose of \nSenator Byrd's amendment prior to that time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will work in consultation with \nleadership on that side.\n  Does the Senator think there is an option by which Senator Levin's \namendment can be disposed of?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. He follows Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. WARNER. Just a rough calculation--would that be at approximately \n8 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. No. That will be approximately an hour from now, or an hour \nand twenty minutes from now. It would be about a quarter to 7.\n  Mr. WARNER. Give or take an hour here or there. Nevertheless, what \nthe leader is indicating is that there is a possibility that amendment \ncould be acted upon tonight by vote.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Levin has indicated he would like to dispose of \nthat tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Once again, I think Senator Levin has several amendments. \nDo we know which one that might be in this batch of 13?\n  Mr. REID. It is the amendment he has spoken about for several days. I \ndon't know how to identify it more than that. But it is the \nalternative--I think is a good way to put it--to the Lieberman \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Perhaps Senator Levin, through his staff or others, \ncould indicate at the earliest possible time which of the several \namendments it is so we can be prepared to reciprocate in an active \ndebate and perhaps reach a conclusion.\n  Mr. President, I was going to direct a question to my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. REID. Was the unanimous consent request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous unanimous \nconsent request is agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his assistance.\n  My respect for my colleague from Connecticut is predicated on many--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia that Senator Roberts is to speak next.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right. We are trying to encourage some colloquy \nand questioning. I will not take a long time.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be brief in my answer.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. That will be a salutary moment. We \nwill get quickly to it.\n  I read to my friend a quote by President John F. Kennedy in \nconnection with the Cuban missile crisis of 1962:\n\n       This Nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace and our own proposal for a peaceful \n     world, at any\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\n     time, in any forum, in the Organization of American States, \n     in the United Nations, or in any other meeting that could be \n     useful without limiting our freedom of action.\n\n  In looking at the amendments, certainly one of them proposed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan says very clearly that \nauthorization for the use of armed forces is predicated on action by \nthe United Nations. To me, that contravenes what President Kennedy laid \ndown as a form of this.\n  Does the Senator think there is any basis for subordinating the right \nof our President to use the Armed Forces, if he deems it necessary, to \naction by the United Nations?\n  Mr. DODD. I do not know if my colleague was listening to my remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened very carefully.\n  Mr. DODD. I made the point. Certainly my point is that we should try \nto resolve this matter without conflict, if possible.\n\n  There was some confusion about that, when I listened to the Secretary \nof State and the President, as to whether it is regime change or \nweapons of mass destruction. There is a lot of confusion in the \nAmerican public about that as well.\n  Let us assume they are going to come together and try to resolve that \nwithout any conflict. It ought to be done. I think the President's \nfather did it well and right back in 1991 with a coalition. It worked \nbetter than imagined. It certainly set a precedent for how we are going \nto deal or should deal with matters in the future.\n  I have said the reason I am supporting the resolution is that I \nbelieve it will strengthen our hand at the United Nations to get them \nto act with some assertiveness. But I also have said, at the end of the \nday, if the security interests of the United States are in jeopardy and \nthere is nothing else to be done in the United Nations, or if other \ncoalitions would not support us, we will never leave the security of \nthis country, this Nation, vulnerable and solely dependent upon the \nwillingness of the international organizations to support us.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I share that view. I say to my good \nfriend that acting on it now and not further delaying, with this \nChamber and that of the House of Representatives, hopefully, acting on \nidentical language, can in a strong voice say to the United Nations \nthat we stand foursquare behind our President in his remarks and his \nrequest that the United Nations take strong action.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond very quickly on that.\n  I understand the management of bills here. I spent 9 days on election \nreform with 46 amendments; 100 were offered. I think election reform is \na pretty important issue. But I don't think it is more important than \nthe issue we are discussing today.\n  My point simply was to say, on matters such as this, that the role of \nthe Senate is so critically important and the Founders intended it to \nbe such that if Members of this body, elected to this body, feel \nstrongly and passionately about being heard on this matter and have \nideas they wish to contribute to the debate, we ought to be most \nreluctant to deprive a Member of this body of the opportunity to be \nheard.\n  I understand the significance of moving quickly. But it is dangerous \nindeed on a matter of this gravity to curtail debate to merely try to \nget a resolution adopted quickly. I want to hear what my colleagues \nhave to say. I know we are going to come to a conclusion on this fairly \nquickly. But to cut off debate prematurely I think would be a mistake.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share that sentiment. But I remind my \ncolleague, this Senator was privileged to be on the floor last Friday \nfor 5 hours. You were present. You recall that debate. Senator Kennedy \nwas present. And Senator Byrd was most active. And again there was \ndebate another 5 or 6 hours on Monday and Tuesday. So there has been \nadequate opportunity. And there remains opportunity for Senators to be \nheard. I hope we do not cut off any Senator from the opportunity to \nspeak to this important matter.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I know another Senator is \nabout to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their very \nlearned colloquy to make sure all Senators have an opportunity to speak \non this extremely important issue.\n  As we debate whether to authorize the President, basically, to use \nmilitary force to remove Saddam Hussein from power and to neutralize \nhis emerging weapons of mass destruction capability, I would like to \noffer several observations.\n  The first is that the United Nations, as an institution, has \ncompletely and unequivocally failed to disarm Iraq consistent with its \nown resolutions--the resolutions agreed to also by Saddam Hussein--\nfollowing the Persian Gulf war of 1991. The key word here is to \n``disarm.''\n  During debate on this very crucial issue, I think we have \nconcentrated too much on the concept of ``inspections'' and the \npossibility of trying to really somehow initiate a new inspections \nregime. As a matter of fact, if you read all of the newspaper accounts \non this issue, and if you pay attention to the television, the radio, \nand the debate, it seems to me ``inspections'' becomes the key word. I \ndon't think that is the case. The key issue is not inspections. The key \nissue is disarmament.\n  Again, both Iraq, under the heavy hand of Saddam Hussein, and the \nUnited Nations, have failed in the agreed-upon mandate to follow or \ntake action consistent with resolutions following the Persian Gulf war \nover a decade ago. And we are talking about actual, transparent, real--\nreal--disarmament.\n  The second observation I would like to make is that one of the \ncrucial reasons both Houses of Congress should support the Warner and \nthe Lieberman resolution, on behalf of the President, as opposed to, I \nguess, 13 amendments we are going to be considering--and I do not \nchallenge or wish to impugn any intent on the part of any Member who \nhas an amendment on this important issue--but basically one of the \ncrucial reasons we should really do our business and support this \nresolution is that it will, I think, strengthen the hand of Secretary \nof State Powell--he told that to us as of this week, both sides of the \nbody--in his efforts to convince the U.N. Security Council to adopt new \nresolutions, resolutions whose goal would be to produce tangible--\nagain, not inspections--but inspections that would lead to disarmament. \nThere is always that hope, and, obviously, that would be the preferred \noutcome as opposed to military action.\n\n  So it seems to me that is the goal of the resolution we are now \nconsidering.\n  In that regard, let me stress that we should act prior--prior--to the \nU.N. deliberations. We should act first. We should act in concert. To \ntie the hands of this President, or any future President with regard to \nmatters of vital national security interests where war or peace hang in \nthe balance, to subject him to U.N. approval or action, will constrain \nthe freedom of action on the part of the United States by the very \ncountries that are now responsible for a decade of U.N.--U.N.--inaction \nand almost irrelevance.\n  Let us be realistic. Let us be realistic. Saddam Hussein has \ndemonstrated ad nauseam over the last 10 years that he will never \npermit the removal or destruction of his weapons of mass destruction \ncapability. Here is my personal view on this. He cannot, and he will \nnot. Now, why?\n  They are the very source of his authority in Iraq as well as the \nPersian Gulf. All of his ambitions--I perceive that he perceives \nhimself as perhaps the heir apparent or maybe even the reincarnation of \nKing Nebbuchadnezzar, Pan-Arabia. He has demonstrated a willingness to \nuse weapons of mass destruction both against his own countrymen and \nagainst other nations. He is a student and protege and follows the \nexample of Stalin. And he rules by fear.\n  So wishful thinking aside--and I have wishful thinking--but wishful \nthinking aside, I do not believe he is ever going to give up and \ndisarm--ever.\n  Third, any notion that the United States itself is off limits to a \nmassive attack by groups that are cooperating with or supported by \nBaghdad should now be gone. It is called sanctuary for further \nterrorist attacks against our homeland. We are not off limits. We\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nare now terrorist targets, as proved by 9/11 and previous attacks.\n  Fourth, any notion that we have time left to coast along as \ngovernments in Iraq, Iran, or elsewhere continue to pursue their \nweapons of mass destruction programs with the possibility, if not \nintent, to distribute these technologies to fundamentalist terrorist \ncells should be gone as well.\n  I know, while ``hard evidence'' of an Iraqi role in the attacks of 9/\n11 may be hard to prove--the so-called smoking gun--I do not think we \ncan afford to be naive. Particularly in the Middle East, terror groups \nand states work together when and where their interests are common. And \ntheir intent is the destruction of the United States, the murder of our \ncitizens, and the elimination of our influence, real and perceived.\n  Just yesterday, in the continuing investigation of the September 11 \nattack, in an unclassified--let me stress, unclassified--and public \nhearing, I asked the panel of witnesses--the expert witnesses--what, \nafter 9/11, still kept them up at night. And I asked them what policy \ndrum they could or would beat to bring about a change in policy to \nsafeguard our own country.\n\n  The answer was to take away the terrorists' sanctuary; that we \nmistakenly think that if we can only bring bin Laden to justice, render \nthe al-Qaida harmless, then we can somehow go back to business as \nusual.\n  That simply is not the case. I think an error is being made in the \ndebate on this most important topic when we say, now, on one hand, if \nwe do not take action in regard to Iraq we can then continue the war \nagainst terrorism. The action against Iraq is to prevent further \nsanctuary for terrorism. It is inseparable.\n  The stark fact of the matter is that danger of another terrorist \nattack on this country is still not a matter of if, it is a matter of \nwhen. The distinguished then-chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, remembers full well creating a subcommittee called the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats. Three years ago we predicted this \nwould happen, citing past attacks. It is not a matter of if, but when. \nThat condition still exists today. It is transnational in terms of the \nthreat. It involves many terrorist organizations and cells. And, yes, \nit is ongoing.\n  Yesterday, under the heading of lessons learned from past terrorist \nattacks, the Intelligence Committee once again heard from experts \nciting a common thread of transnational, interconnected terrorism. At \nour peril, difficult connect-the-dots intelligence analyses did not \nmeet the threshold of a threat warning and were ignored. We were risk \naverse. The terrorists who conducted past attacks attacked again. There \nwere warnings. They were not heeded. They did not meet the criterion of \na threshold of a threat warning, and we suffered the consequences. They \nattacked at the 1993 World Trade Center, Khobar Towers, our embassies, \nthe thwarted--thank goodness--attack in regard to the Millennium, and, \nfinally, the U.S.S. Cole. The attacks are a microcosm of the challenge \nwe face.\n  If Iraq and, indeed, other regimes are left unchallenged, my \ncolleagues, it is only a matter of time before they transfer the \ncapability for weapons of mass destruction to a terrorist cell that \nwill use that capability against the United States.\n  Now, remember, the criminal justice model of gathering evidence and \npresenting a case does not apply here. By the time you have evidence, \nit is too late. We will not lose buildings and thousands of people when \nthat happens. We will lose whole cities and hundreds of thousands of \npeople.\n  Iraq is absolutely a component in the war against terrorism. Let me \ntry to make that point. In light of the events of September 11, 2001, I \nbelieve this body has more reason to support action against Iraq than \nit had in the winter of 1991. That is a pretty strong statement. \nBecause preventing weapons of mass destruction from being acquired by \nterrorist cells should be the No. 1 policy priority of this Federal \nGovernment. This means neutralizing regimes that possess or seek such \nweapons and are predisposed to harboring, assisting, sympathizing with \nthe bin Ladens of the world. That is a real priority for us.\n  Yes, there is more than one fundamentalist maniac with a significant \nand diverse following.\n  I support the resolution endorsed by the White House and sponsored by \nSenators Lieberman and Warner because I think our President realizes--\nmost Senators realize--what leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Harry \nTruman realized: No matter what the short-term consequences would be in \nregards to politics, American survival must be assured. It is a first \npriority. It is our highest agenda.\n  There is reasonable concern about downside risk. You bet there is. I \nhave those concerns. I share those concerns. I have been listening to \nthese concerns during the debate on this subject. We have had several \ndays of very good debate. The President and his national security team \nknow that. All Members of the House and Senate and all thinking \nAmericans know that. Yes, there is real concern.\n  I am a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I have asked question after question after \nquestion in the ``what if'' category. What if Saddam Hussein uses his \nweapons of mass destruction--of course, that means he has reconstituted \nhis weapons of mass destruction capability, posing an ever-increasing \nthreat--what if he uses those reconstituted weapons of mass destruction \nagainst our troops, against Gulf State partners that will support us, \nagainst Israel, or against his own people? He has done that before. \nWill Israel, if attacked, simply remain on the sidelines? Will we see \nprolonged combat? Will there be a violent upheaval in the Mideast, in \nthe Arab nations?\n  What happens if we win? There has been a lot of discussion about \nthat. How long will we have to stay? What kind of infrastructure \nimprovements will we have to pay for if, in fact, that is the case? \nWhat do we win? How do you win a war against a tyrant who may well \ndestroy his own country and kill his own people, blame us, or who would \nlaunch or sponsor a terrorist attack in the United States as a result \nof our involvement, all in the name of self-preservation?\n  Those are tough questions. Those are very real concerns. The \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia indicated we need more time to \nanswer these concerns. How many casualties if, in fact, we go into \nmilitary action against Iraq? Mrs. Boxer, the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, asked the question, how much will it cost? Maybe it \nwas reversed. Maybe Senator Byrd asked that question, and Senator Boxer \nasked about casualties. What about military tactics? I must say that is \nprobably the last thing I hope the Pentagon would share with the \nCongress, for obvious reasons. What about the sacrifices in regards to \nthe American people? How much will it cost?\n  All of these concerns and all of these dangers are real. But, my \ncolleagues, there are no specific and easy answers to these questions. \nAs much as we would like otherwise, the intelligence community and the \nPresident and the administration, our military cannot provide absolute, \nspecific answers. They can try to be specific, but absolute answers? I \nam sorry. They do provide estimates, based upon the best collection and \nanalysis that is possible.\n\n  This debate and the issues at hand demand candor. President Bush has \nbeen candid. As the President said, the hope is we don't have to take \nmilitary action. But if that becomes necessary, it will be difficult. \nTime after time in history, and in repeated testimony from those within \nour intelligence community, we see the greatest risk is to do nothing. \nWe are not free unless we are free from fear. Americans have known \nfear--be it during the Cuban missile crisis or in the aftermath of \nPearl Harbor or the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. We \nmust not, however, accept fear as our destiny. We must be proactive in \nregards to national security.\n  We must be preemptive. Yes, preemptive, that new doctrine that is \ncausing a rethink of our foreign policy, our military strategy, our \npolitics, our foreign relations. It is a brand new world. It is an \nasymmetrical world. It is a world that was written about by Samuel P. \nHuntington when he wrote the book ``The Clash of Civilizations and the \nRemaking of the World Order,'' the preemption doctrine. Here we are and \nwe are debating it.\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\n  Make no mistake, this has nothing to do with partisan rivalry. This \nis about our future, both immediate and long term. This is the state of \naffairs we leave for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Senator Warner just made a statement on the floor I am going to quote \nagain, almost 40 years ago to this date, when President John F. Kennedy \naddressed the Nation in regard to the Cuban missile crisis. He said:\n\n       This nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful \n     world, at any time and in any forum--in the Organization of \n     American States, in the United Nations, or in any other \n     meeting that could be useful--\n\n  Here is the key phrase:\n\n       . . . without limiting our freedom of action.\n\n  In that regard, I hope we follow President Kennedy's advice. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the resolution introduced by Senators Warner \nand Lieberman and to oppose the various 13 amendments that would weaken \nthe resolution and our resolve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``A Chronology of \nDefiance'' by Michael Kelly; an article called ``The Myth of U.N. \nSupport'' by Charles Krauthammer; and an article, ``The Weight of \nAmerican Empire,'' which talks in detail about the new policy of \npreemption, by John Keegan, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 2002]\n\n                        A Chronology of Defiance\n\n                           (By Michael Kelly)\n\n       ``U.N. Inspectors Can Return Unconditionally, Iraq Says,'' \n     the headline reads. This, to put it mildly, and in the words \n     of an old and apt phrase, shall not stand.\n       Consider the following darkly comic tale, mostly taken from \n     the Congressional Research Service:\n       On March 3, 1991, the coalition forces of the Persian Gulf \n     War signed the Safwan accords, ending hostilities in the \n     insane conflict Iraq had forced. On April 3, the United \n     Nations passed Security Council Resolution 687 requiring Iraq \n     to end its weapons-of-mass-destruction programs, recognize \n     Kuwait, account for missing Kuwaitis, return Kuwaiti property \n     and end support for international terrorism. Iraq immediately \n     began a decade-long pattern of defiance, alternating with \n     stalling, tactical capitulation and more defiance. This was \n     particularly so concerning what remains the central issue: \n     the demand that it destroy its weapons of mass destruction \n     and stop developing new ones.\n       To enforce and conduct inspections, the United Nations \n     created a special commission, UNSCOM, which went to work in \n     April 1991. Almost immediately, Iraq began impeding the \n     inspections. The United Nations responded by passing its \n     first resolution-to-enforce-the-resolution, Resolution 707, \n     on Aug. 15, which ordered Iraq to comply with unfettered \n     inspections of all sites and to make full disclosure of all \n     of its suppliers to its program for weapons of mass \n     destruction. On Oct. 11, the United Nations also passed \n     Resolution 715, which established a long-term monitoring \n     program.\n       Some success ensued, but Iraq resumed impeding inspections \n     in March 1996. The Security Council responded with Resolution \n     1060, on June 12, 1996, demanding, again, Iraqi cooperation, \n     which was not forthcoming. So, on June 21, 1997, the august \n     body duly passed Resolution 1115, which threatened \n     noncooperating Iraqi government officials with travel \n     restrictions. This was followed on Oct. 23, 1997, by \n     Resolution 1134, which threatened travel restrictions--\n     again--and which banned consideration of lifting the U.N. \n     sanctions against Iraq until April 1998.\n       On Oct. 29, Iraq barred American inspectors assigned to \n     UNSCOM from conducting any inspections. So, on Nov. 12, 1997, \n     the United Nations went right darned ahead and imposed those \n     mean old travel restrictions. The next day, Iraq expelled all \n     the American inspectors. The U.S. House of Representatives \n     passed a resolution authorizing the use of unilateral U.S. \n     military action if necessary. But the measure died in the \n     Senate, of inattention.\n       In November 1997, Russia brokered a compromise that allowed \n     UNSCOM to resume some temporary and sharply limited \n     inspections. In February 1998, U.N. Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan put together a second compromise, by which Iraq agreed \n     to allow inspections with the proviso that it be allowed to \n     protect ``presidential sites'' from undue indignity. Iraq \n     designated eight large tracts of land (containing more than \n     1,000 buildings) as ``presidential sites.'' Inspectors could \n     visit these sites only after announcing the visit in advance \n     and informing the Iraqis of the composition of the visiting \n     team--nuclear, chemical or biological inspectors. In \n     appreciation of this joke, the Clinton administration \n     supported lifting the travel ban on Iraq and resuming \n     sanction reviews.\n       In August 1998, Iraq barred UNSCOM from inspecting any new \n     facilities. The Senate and House passed a resolution, signed \n     on Aug. 14, declaring Iraq to be in ``material breach'' of \n     the cease-fire. On Sept. 9, the Security Council adopted \n     Resolution 1194, suspending sanction reviews. On Oct. 30, the \n     council offered Iraq yet another chance to have the sanctions \n     lifted if it complied with inspections, but Iraq spurned the \n     offer and announced the cessation of all cooperation with \n     UNSCOM. A very angry Security Council passed the very fierce \n     Resolution 1205, which called Iraq's action a ``flagrant \n     violation'' of the February 1998 agreement. A very, very \n     angry President Clinton very, very fiercely threatened \n     airstrikes. On Nov. 14, Iraq agreed to cooperate. President \n     Clinton promptly canceled the airstrikes.\n       On Dec. 15, 1998, UNSCOM announced that Iraq had refused to \n     hand over key weapons-program documents and was, again, \n     impeding inspections. UNSCOM inspectors withdrew from the \n     country and the United States and Britain bombed Iraqi \n     military and security targets for several days. UNSCOM never \n     went back into Iraq. On Dec. 17, 1999, the Security Council \n     passed Resolution 1284 establishing a new inspection body, \n     UNMOVIC, and offering Iraq the suspension of most sanctions \n     in exchange for a resumption of inspections. In February \n     2001, Iraq entered into talks with the U.N. secretary general \n     on this basis, ``but the talks made little progress.''\n       I'd say the current Iraqi offer can be dispensed with, oh, \n     now.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 4, 2002]\n\n                        The Myth of U.N.

Edward M. Kennedy, Iraq crisis, address to the Johns \n     Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Sept. 27, \n     2002\n       How far the Democrats have come. Forty years ago to the \n     month, President Kennedy asserts his willingness to present \n     his case to the United Nations, but also his determination \n     not to allow the United Nations to constrain America's \n     freedom of action. Today his brother, a leader of the same \n     party, awaits the guidance of the United Nations before he \n     will declare himself on how America should respond to another \n     nation threatening the United States with weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       Ted Kennedy is not alone. Much of the leadership of the \n     Democratic Party is in the thrall of the United Nations. War \n     and peace hang in the balance. The world waits to see what \n     the American people, in Congress assembled, will say. These \n     Democrats say: Wait, we must find out what the United Nations \n     say first.\n       The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl \n     Levin, would enshrine such lunacy in legislation, no less. He \n     would not even authorize the use of force without prior U.N. \n     approval. Why? What exactly does U.N. approval mean?\n       It cannot mean the U.N. General Assembly, which is an empty \n     debating society. It means the Security Council, Now, the \n     Security Council has five permanent members and 10 rotating \n     members. Among the rotating members is Syria. How can any \n     senator stand up and tell the American people that before \n     deciding whether America goes to war against a rogue state \n     such as Iraq, it needs to hear the ``final recommendation'' \n     of Syria, a regime on the State Department's official \n     terrorist list?\n       Or maybe these senators are awaiting the wisdom of some of \n     the other nonpermanent members. Cameroon? Mauritius? Guinea? \n     Certainly Kennedy and Levin cannot be saying that we must not \n     decide whether to go to war until we have heard the \n     considered opinion of countries that none of their colleagues \n     can find on a map.\n       Okay. So we are not talking about these dots on the map. We \n     must be talking about the five permanent members. The United \n     States is one. Another is Britain, which support us. That \n     leaves three. So when you hear senators grandly demand the \n     support of the ``international community,'' this is what they \n     mean: France, Russia and China.\n       As I recently asked in this space, by what logic does the \n     blessing of these countries bestow moral legitimacy on \n     American action? China's leaders are the butchers of \n     Tiananmen Square. France and Russia will decide the Iraq \n     question based on the coldest calculation of their own \n     national interest, meaning money and oil.\n       Everyone in the Senate wants a new and tough inspection \n     regime in Iraq: anytime, anywhere, unannounced. Yet these \n     three countries, whose approval the Democrats crave, are \n     responsible for the hopelessly diluted and useless inspection \n     regime that now exists.\n       They spent the 1990s doing everything they could to \n     dismantle the Gulf War mandate to disarm Saddam Hussein. The \n     Clinton administration helplessly acquiesced, finally \n     approving a new Security Council resolution in 1999 that gave \n     us the current toothless inspections regime. France, Russia \n     and China, mind you, refused to support even that resolution; \n     they all abstained because it did not make yet more \n     concessions to Saddam Hussein.\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\n       After a decade of acting as Saddam Hussein's lawyers on the \n     Security Council, these countries are now to be the arbiters \n     of America's new and deadly serious effort to ensure Iraqi \n     disarmament.\n       So insist leading Democrats. Why? It has no moral logic. It \n     has no strategic logic. Forty years ago, we had a Democratic \n     president who declared that he would not allow the United \n     Nations or any others to tell the United States how it would \n     defend itself. Would that JFK's party had an ounce of his \n     confidence in the wisdom and judgment of America, deciding \n     its own fate by its own lights, regardless of the wishes of \n     France.\n       Or Cameroon.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 6, 2002]\n\n                     The Weight of American Empire\n\n                            (By John Keegan)\n\n       Warminster, England.--The statement of principles that will \n     guide the national security strategy of the United States \n     during the war on terrorism, and against states that acquire \n     weapons of mass destruction for nefarious purposes, is \n     presented in the language of American statecraft at its most \n     traditional. The allusions from the past proliferate--\n     allusions to the Four Freedoms, to the Atlantic Charter, even \n     to President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The values \n     that President Bush promises to defend with all the power at \n     his disposal are central to the American way--democratic \n     self-government, free association, freedom of expression, \n     equal rights for individuals. It is a very American, and very \n     old-fashioned, document.\n       At the same time, it makes commitments that are \n     unprecedented in the language of American national policy. To \n     put it bluntly, the president makes threats. He warns \n     terrorists that they will be opposed by every weapon and \n     every means at America's disposal. That might be expected and \n     is no more than terrorists deserve.\n       But he also warns that states that harbor terrorists--or \n     are compromised by terrorism--will be held to account, by \n     which he means military account. He goes on to say that \n     enemies of the United States who are preparing weapons of \n     mass destruction (enemies unspecified but by implication \n     already identified by the Pentagon and State Department) will \n     find themselves targets of U.S. action, even if--and this is \n     a particularly menacing note--such preparations are not \n     complete and the threats to American and its allies are not \n     fully formed.\n       No doubt it is America's readiness to make threats that \n     contributes to the anti-Americanism now rampant in Europe. \n     Fifty years of peace have skewed the European outlook on the \n     world. Apart from some minor Balkan troubles, Europeans have \n     not known war since 1945, and they have fallen into the habit \n     of viewing war as an alien activity to which they have found \n     a superior alternative--the building of pan-European \n     institutions, free trade and the convening of tedious \n     international conferences. They conveniently forget the \n     threat posed until 1990 by the vanished Soviet Union and they \n     show no appreciation at all of the effort and expense \n     undertaken by the United States in acting as the leading \n     military member of NATO during the Cold War.\n       There can be no doubt that the American approach to the \n     future is far more realistic than the European and would have \n     been so, if stated, even before the Sept. 11 attacks. Indeed, \n     the logic of President Bush's statement depends less on the \n     emergence of terrorism as a serious threat to civilized \n     states, or even on Saddam Hussein's specific defiance of U.N. \n     resolutions requiring him to admit weapons inspectors, than \n     it does on factors already apparent as the Cold War was \n     drawing to its close.\n       Students of the Cold War perceived that it imposed, for all \n     the rhetoric of nuclear threat and counter-threat, an \n     artificial stability in international relations. The \n     existence of two superpowers, and the confrontation between \n     them, obliged almost all states to choose sides--and, having \n     chosen, to accept a consequent restraint on their foreign \n     military power. The superpowers offered protection to \n     their clients. But they also expected and got a measure of \n     obedience.\n       In no respect was that more true than in the acquisition of \n     weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. On \n     whatever else they did not agree, the United States and \n     Soviet Union--as the world's only fully equipped nuclear \n     powers--concurred that possession of nuclear weapons should \n     be confined to the smallest possible number of states. From \n     their points of view, the ideal number would have been two. \n     But failing America's ability to constrain its wartime \n     nuclear partner, Britain (which had acquired most of the \n     necessary expertise to build bombs), and then France (which \n     could not bear the indignity of nuclear inferiority to its \n     ancient enemy), the United States reluctantly accepted a \n     troika of Western nuclear powers. The Soviet Union would have \n     preferred to remain the only communist nuclear power, but \n     China's size and strength prevented Moscow from constraining \n     Beijing.\n       Thus the nuclear balance of the Cold War years was \n     established on a basis of five powers; and, as each was a \n     stable state, experienced in the ways of the world, the tacit \n     agreement between the superpowers to maintain world order \n     worked. Indeed, it survived even unilateral superpower \n     efforts to win local wars at the boundary between the spheres \n     of influence--Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola.\n       The more farsighted observers perceived, however, that, \n     should the Cold War ever come to and end, so would the \n     stability it had imposed. While most states, particularly the \n     richer and longer-established ones, would choose to go on as \n     before, a minority of others, those with grievances against \n     their neighbors or with their standing in the world order, \n     would rebel. They would try to become local superpowers and \n     they would challenge the right of the United States and \n     Russia, the Soviet Union's successor, to maintain the old \n     Cold War order.\n       So it has turned out. The emergence of India and Pakistan \n     as nuclear powers, though undesirable, was predictable and is \n     containable. They deter each other. The dissidences of Iraq \n     and of Chechnya are of a different order. Chechnya, \n     traditionally disruptive of Russia's efforts to maintain \n     order in its borderlands, is a menace and Moscow deserves \n     Washington's support in its effort to bring the Chechens \n     under control. Iraq is a far more serious problem, since it \n     is a comparatively advanced state and potentially very rich. \n     Under a regime that would cooperate with the international \n     community, it would be nothing but a force for good in the \n     Middle East. Its society is not Islamic and its population is \n     well educated. But because power in Iraq has, lamentably, \n     passed to a megalomaniac and his hometown clique, it has \n     become exactly what students of post-Cold War politics feared \n     the future might bring at its worst.\n       Unspoken in Bush's national security document is the idea \n     that small, unstable, self-seeking states under dictatorial \n     control must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. Iraq \n     happens merely to be the first in that category to appear. \n     Its pretensions to nuclear power must be quashed. But--and \n     this is the real import of the president's statement--so must \n     similar pretensions, if and when they appear, forever. The \n     president has committed his country to a fearsome duty. It \n     will never go away.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time that \nSenator Dayton had under the order that had been entered be given to \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have time tomorrow to speak, too. I will \nmake a much longer speech on my views on this subject.\n  There used to be a trial lawyer I practiced law under. I used to sit \nin the counsel chair next to him and watch how he tried cases. He used \nto say to the jury, when he started the case, his opening statement, he \nwould say: I want you to keep your eye on the ball. I want you to focus \non the issue at hand.\n  He would turn to his client, who sometimes was not the most admirable \nof people, who may have been innocent but not admirable. And he would \nsay: I want you to take a look at my client. You wouldn't invite my \nclient home for dinner. You wouldn't want your daughter going out with \nmy client. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't even go have a cup of coffee \nwith him after this. The question is not whether or not he is a homely \nguy or a bad guy, or whether or not he is a guy who you would like to \nhave as a friend.\n  The question is, did he kill Cock Robin? Keep your eye on the ball. \nWhat is going to happen here is you are going to have the State coming \nin saying this is a bad guy. He is an ugly guy. Look at him, he doesn't \ndress very well. Look at him, he is not very amiable. Keep your eye on \nthe ball.\n  Just listening to my friend from Kansas and others today, I think we \nare kind of taking our eye off the ball. Tomorrow I will go into this \nin great detail. But let's remind ourselves why are we here right now. \nWhy are we here, notwithstanding the fact Senator Lieberman and \nCongressman Gephardt went down and stood with the President of the \nUnited States and said they adopted a resolution? That is not why we \nare here today. We are not here because of that. We are here because of \nwhat the President told us. Everybody remember, keep your eye on the \nball.\n  The President said he has not decided whether or not we are going to \ngo to war. He said it is his hope that we not go to war. It is his hope \nit can be avoided. Yet, for the first time in the history of the United \nStates of America, in my judgment, the President of the United States \nis asking for the Congress to give him the equivalent of a declaration \nof war--to go to war--before the President has made up his mind. He has \nnot made up his mind.\n  Keep your eye on the ball. Follow the bouncing ball like in the old \nLawrence Welk days. A, the President has not decided whether or not to \ngo to war; B, the President says give me the authority to go to war; C, \nwe say on what\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nbasis do you want to go to war, Mr. President?\n  The details matter. If, for example, we leave here, setting a \nprecedent, suggesting the reason we might go to war is because of this \nnew doctrine of preemption, which no one has explained--no one has \nexplained it. I sat at the White House, I say to my friend from \nVirginia, with Dr. Rice for hours. Dr. Rice said it is no different \nthan what has always been the policy of the U.S.\n  Well, if that is the case, then I don't have any problem. The \nPresident always has the right to act preemptively if we are in \nimminent danger. If they are coming up over the hill, he can respond; \nif troops are coming out of Tijuana, heading north, we can respond; if \nthey are coming down from Toronto, we can respond; if missiles are on \ntheir way, we can respond. But that is not the way I hear it being used \nhere. We are talking about preemption, as if we are adopting a policy. \nAs Dr. Kissinger said before our committee, that will undo an agreement \nthe Western World made in the early 1640s at the end of the religious \nwars in Europe, which said no country has a right to preemptively move \nagainst another country because they think they are going to be bad \nguys.\n  So this is a pretty big deal. Words matter. And so I say to my \nfriends, let's go back. Why did the President ask us for a resolution \nwhen he sent up the draft resolution? Why? He stated forthrightly why. \nHe said: Because I need to demonstrate that I have support in order not \nto go to war. That is what he said. He said: You, the Congress, give me \noverwhelming support. Then the U.N. will know I mean it. Then the \nSecurity Council will say if we don't, he will, so we better. That is \nthe reason why we are here. That is the reason, I remind my colleague \nfrom Connecticut and my friend from Virginia, why we are here. \nOtherwise, it is ridiculous--a President saying I don't know whether I \nwant to go to war yet, but declare it.\n  So I hope people don't start confusing things on this floor. I may \nnot be around here after November--I hope I am; I am up for reelection, \nbut I don't want to be on this floor 6 years from now and have someone \nstand up and inaccurately say, by the way, back in the year 2002, in \nOctober, we adopted a policy of preemption. Therefore, even though we \nare in no imminent danger, even though there is no violation of any \ninternational rule, we think the country of Xanadu are bad guys and we \nare invading. That would be a serious mistake. Let me tell you why--not \nbecause as an American and as President, if I were President, or as a \nSenator, or as a Congressman, I would like to have that ability. But, \nguess what, I don't want Beijing waking up one morning and saying, you \nknow, we have a right to preemptively attack Taiwan. I don't want India \nwaking up one morning and saying, by the way, we have a right \npreemptively to attack Pakistan. In case you are all wondering--and I \nknow my colleagues are not, because they know the score and they are \nthinking about both of those things--both of those countries could \nconceivably reach that conclusion. It's not an impossibility, if the \nmost powerful Nation in the world establishes an unnecessary doctrine. \nSo let's keep our eye on the ball.\n\n  Why are we being asked to do this--to give the President the kind of \nmomentum he needs to allow the Secretary of State to convince the \nSecurity Council to do what they should do in the first place?\n  The second point I would like to make is this: We are, right now, \ntalking about preemption, when there is no need for any doctrine of \npreemption to justify us going against Iraq with others, or alone, if \nneed be. Let's get the facts straight. There is a guy named Saddam \nHussein who, in the early 1990s, broke international law, invaded \nanother country, violating every rule of international law. The world, \nunder the leadership of a President named Bush, united and expelled him \nfrom that country. Upon expulsion, he said a condition for your being \nable to remain in power, Saddam Hussein, is you sue for peace and you \nagree to the following terms of surrender. Those terms of surrender, \nunlike with the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties where surrender \ncomes about, were in the form of concessions to the U.N., to the world. \nSo he signed onto a number of resolutions.\n  If the world decides it must use force for his failure to abide by \nthe terms of surrender, then it is not preempting, it is enforcing. It \nis enforcing, it is finishing a war he reignited, because the only \nreason the war stopped is he sued for peace.\n  So, for Lord's sake, anybody who decides to vote for this resolution, \nplease do not rest it on this cockamamie notion of preemption. You will \nrue the day. If that is the precedent we establish for our own safety's \nsake, you will rue the day.\n  The third point I want to make about keeping your eye on the ball \nhere is--the fact of the matter is the President of the United States \nhas not yet, A, made the decision about going to war and, B, if he \ndecides to go to war, he has not made the case to the American people.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that before my colleagues jump all over \nit. He made a clear case to the U.N. that by the standards of the \nUnited Nations, this man, Saddam Hussein, has flouted the rules of the \nU.N.--absolutely an overwhelming case. Then he came along on Monday and \nhe made a clear case, in the minds of many, to the American people that \nSaddam Hussein is a danger to the United States.\n  But there is one more case he has to make. Those of us out of the \ngeneration of Vietnam, and those who were in power during the \ngeneration of Vietnam, know that no matter how well articulated, no \nmatter how well formulated a foreign policy is, it cannot be sustained \nwithout the informed consent of the American people. What is being \nasked of them? The American people do not know what is going to be \nasked of them yet.\n  I am fully confident if the President decides, in concert with \nothers, war is necessary, he will have to inform them before he \nlaunches it. I say that because he personally told me that. I asked \nhim. My friend from Virginia may have been at the leadership meeting 3 \nweeks ago in the cabinet room when the President turned to me after \nothers had spoken and said, ``Mr. Chairman, will you be with me?'' I \nsaid, ``Mr. President, I will be with you on the condition that you do \ntwo things: One, you make every effort possible to do this under the \nauspices of the U.N. or the coalition, like we did in Kosovo; and you \ninform the American people that it is going to require substantial \nAmerican forces and substantial American money to stay in Iraq after \nSaddam Hussein is down.'' He looked at me in the presence of everybody \nand said, ``I will do that.'' So I take him at his word.\n  I lay you 8 to 5, if you go home and ask your constituents who say \nthey are for war--ask them the following question: How long do you \nthink we are going to have to keep American forces in Iraq? I will lay \nyou 8 to 5 that 90 percent will look at you with a blank stare and ask: \nWhat do you mean, stay in Iraq? What are you talking about, stay in \nIraq? They have no notion. Senator Dodd, Senator Sarbanes, and I, and \nthe Foreign Relations Committee held several very good hearings. At one \nhearing, we had the fellow who headed up the office in the Pentagon as \nto what we do after we win the war--planning. We had two other military \nexperts.\n\n  Do my colleagues know what they told us? They probably told you the \nsame thing in Armed Services Committee. It is probable we will have to \nkeep at least 75,000 American forces in Iraq for at least 1 year at a \ncost of $19 billion. Maybe it will not be 75,000. Maybe it will be \n25,000; maybe 105,000. I do not know. But we have an obligation to tell \nour constituents.\n  As I said to my good friend, Mr. Brownback, who is on our committee, \nin one of our hearings: Everything may go smoothly. And I think there \nis a possibility it could happen. If we have to go to war, everything \nmay go smoothly, and once he is down and does not use chemical weapons, \nthe army surrenders and the Republican Guard crumbles, and he is \nassassinated on the way out of town, and we get our hands on the \nweapons of mass destruction quickly, we identify where they are, we \ndestroy them, and the rest of the world comes in to help us with the \nburden of keeping Iraq from splitting into at least three separate \npieces--that could all happen. That is possible.\n  What happens if it does not? Big nations cannot bluff. We should tell \nthe\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nAmerican people straight up, and I am prepared to do it and support it: \nIf, in fact, we are forced to go into Iraq with other nations, for his \nfailure to comply, say goodbye for a while to the new permanent tax \ncut; say goodbye for a while to significant increases in health care \nfunding; say goodbye for a while to a whole lot of issues for those who \nvote for this.\n  This is the time for a little honesty in advertising. This is the \ntime the American people are strong, they are bright, and they are \nwilling to take this on. The one thing I believe they will not stand \nfor is being sold a bill of goods. We are not stopping 400 miles short \nof Baghdad this time if we go. We are not. The Senator from West \nVirginia has said repeatedly, this is a considerable undertaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I said, I will tomorrow go into much greater detail. \nAgain, keep your eye on the ball and level with the American people as \nwe go through this process because I think if Saddam Hussein is around \n5 years from now, we are in deep trouble as a country--we are in deep \ntrouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is to be recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, can I inquire what the parliamentary \nsituation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is to speak for 15 \nminutes, followed by the senior Senator from New Mexico for 20 minutes, \nand the senior Senator from Michigan for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. For what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is this all being done through unanimous consent \nrequests?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nafter the senior Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have to object at this time. I have been \nin consultation with the senior Senator from West Virginia who had \nexpressed some interest in taking that slot. Without losing my right to \nthe floor, does the senior Senator from West Virginia wish to speak to \nhis desires? He has the pending amendment, and I think it is very \nimportant that the Senate have the opportunity tonight to vote on your \namendment. Of course, the Senator will desire to speak for a period of \ntime prior to, I anticipate, a motion to table.\n  I have the floor, but I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Beg your pardon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia for a \ncomment or an observation he wants to make, but I do not yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserved the right to object to the Senator's unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But that does not give the Senator the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I reserved the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. He did not yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor and cannot \nmake that request.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I respond now?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under the order, the \nSenator from Tennessee is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, under the unanimous consent \nagreement. The Senator from Maryland proposed a unanimous consent \nrequest. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Tennessee \nhas the floor and is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield, \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I had indicated to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia that I would like to be recognized after Mr. Levin. I \nbelieve he is last on the list. I have no problem with the Senator--if \nthe Senator will agree to allow him--Mr. Sarbanes to follow Mr. Levin \nand then I would like to be recognized at that time.\n  Mr. REID. If I can ask a question of the Senator from West Virginia, \nwho proposed a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If people have a question as to the position we are in \ntoday, yesterday we tried lining up speakers, and that did not work. \nToday we lined up two speakers on each side so people do not come to \nthe Chamber and have to wait. That is what we did. That is the position \nwe are in now. Both cloakrooms received requests from people who wanted \nto speak. That is what we have done.\n  There is a question as to who is going to be the next speaker. I will \nonly say there is no requirement to do so. We have been going back and \nforth: Senator Levin and then I assume we will go to a Republican. \nAfter Senator Levin, anybody could get the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Can I inquire who follows Senator Frist?\n  Mr. REID. After Senator Frist is Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That does not strike me as going back and forth.\n  Mr. REID. We had Senator Kerry, who spoke for 45 minutes. These two \nSenators are speaking for a total of 35 minutes. That is the amount of \ntime Senator Kerry had.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield? I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak with the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Without interfering with the Senator from Tennessee, is \nit his predilection to continue this debate tonight until all speakers \nare finished, or is the desire of the majority leader and the majority \nwhip to have a vote on the Byrd amendment, or put it off until \ntomorrow? We have 13 amendments pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we all know, I say to my friend, anyone \nwho has the floor can move to table the amendment of the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I assume that because of the respect people have for \nSenator Byrd, before that happens someone will give him the opportunity \nto speak. I am sure that will happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further, it is not our desire \nto propose a motion to table until the Senator from West Virginia has \nhad ample time to discuss his amendment. I do not think that would be \nappropriate. But at some point, I hope we can reach a point where we \ncan have a motion to table or an up-or-down vote on the amendment. For \nthe benefit of all Senators, perhaps we can try to ascertain that.\n  Mr. REID. The answer to your question, from my perspective, the best \nthing to do for an orderly process is to dispose of the Byrd amendment \nand then move to the Levin amendment for which we have been waiting a \nlong time.\n  Before we dispose of the Byrd amendment, I am sure, as I indicated--\nwhether it is Domenici, whoever it is--will give the Senator from West \nVirginia ample opportunity to discuss his amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona asked me if that should happen. That is what \nshould happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I can finish. So we will dispose of the Byrd amendment \ntonight, if it is agreeable with the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. I will put it another way. Senator Byrd's amendment, as he \nknows, being the mother of all parliamentarians, can be disposed of at \nany time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I think we would like to move this along. I hope Senator \nByrd's amendment will be disposed of before we move to the Levin \namendment. That is not a necessity, but it would make it a little more \norderly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, could I ask Senator Byrd's predilections on this \nissue?\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his question. I say to the Senator, he has amendments, and \nhe has already submitted his amendments. I would like to have a chance \nto vote on these amendments before the cloture vote. I hope we will get \nthe cloture vote delayed at least a few hours tomorrow until Senators, \nsuch as Mr. Levin, who have amendments will have a fair shot at \nexplaining their amendments and have a vote on them before cloture. I \ndo not know whether the Senate will be disposed to do that or not.\n  Let me see if I can answer the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I \nhave another amendment I would like to get voted on, too. I would like \nto offer it to the amendment that is pending. I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona--and he is a very distinguished \nSenator--the other amendment would be to provide a sunset provision.\n  So if the Senate is going to waive its constitutional powers to the \nextent that I think would be required if the Lieberman amendment were \nto be agreed upon, I would like at least for the Senate to have a \nsunset provision so there would be a time limit when the Lieberman \namendment would run its course. If the Congress wanted to renew that, \nCongress could do it, of course, but at least my amendment would say 12 \nmonths, and the President could extend that for 12 months.\n  That is a rough explanation of my amendment. So that would be 12 \nmonths for the President under my amendment, providing for the \nPresident on his own to extend that for an additional 12 months, but at \nthe end of that time it is over unless the Congress renews or extends \nit. I would like to have that amendment also voted upon.\n  I am very willing to enter into some kind of an agreement, say, to \nvote up or down on both amendments. There would be a vote on the \nLieberman amendment and then a vote on cloture tomorrow at some point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have been endeavoring to accommodate \nthe pending amendment with the time agreement such that it could be \nbrought up as soon as possible.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and I have had no discussion about a \nsecond amendment, and I urge that we allow the Senator from Tennessee \nto speak, and in the interim let's gather and see whether or not we can \nreconcile honest differences and motives.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just suggest one thing, maybe we could have all \nof this taken care of by not having a cloture vote. Cloture is going to \nbe invoked by a large margin. Maybe we would not need a cloture vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. There are Senators on this side who wish to leave intact \nthis present procedure, which is working well. It has produced 13 \namendments, 7 of which have been ruled germane thus far by the \nParliamentarian. This debate is well underway, well structured, and can \nproceed.\n  At the moment, we have a pending amendment, and I urge that we allow \nthe Senator from Tennessee----\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the 15 minutes allocated to \nthe Senator from Tennessee be given in its entirety. We have taken most \nof that time. Then during that time, we will confer as to how we can \nproceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Tennessee has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Members of this body will soon vote on \nauthorizing the President to use the military might of this Nation \nagainst Saddam Hussein. This decision has weighed heavily on me, as it \nhas on us all. No one takes lightly the prospect of young Americans \nrisking their lives on the battlefield of war, but we and they swear an \noath to defend our rights and freedoms against all enemies. And so our \nduty we must now do.\n  Saddam Hussein is a direct and deadly threat to the American people \nand to the people of the world. He holds the power to murder not just \nhundreds or thousands or tens of thousands, but millions. He defies all \ninternational efforts to restrain that power and keep world peace, and \nhe disdains the value of human life, even the lives of his own people. \nThis is an evil, lawless, and murderous man.\n  The resolution before the Senate is carefully constructed to \nencourage the widest possible international support for unified action \nagainst Saddam Hussein. The nations of the world need to show him they \nwill no longer tolerate his arrogant contempt for United Nations \nresolutions, requiring him to give up his weapons of mass destruction \nand cease the gross human rights violations he has committed on his own \npeople. I support the President's intensive efforts to build such a \ncoalition, and I pray for his success.\n  No one wants to avoid a war more than I do. I am a physician. I have \ndevoted my life to a profession that is centered on saving lives. Only \nwhen we have exhausted all reasonable efforts at keeping peace should \nwe consider waging war. The President shares a firm commitment to this \nprinciple. I consider this resolution a strong statement of support for \npeace and, if the Nation must, for war as well. For if the safety of \nour people, the security of our Nation, and the stability of the world \nremain so threatened, we must risk war for peace. To do anything less \nwould leave a grave and growing danger looming over the lives of \nmillions.\n  This evening I will talk about Saddam Hussein's past, his present, \nand what I consider his greatest danger, a robust biological weapons \nprogram. More than chemical and nuclear weapons, Saddam's biological \nweapons pose a unique and immediate threat. Unlike other conventional \nweapons, they are easily made. They can be readily concealed and are \nbeyond the reach of inspectors and can readily be delivered across \nborders and, yes, even across oceans. In the hands of a madman, \nbiological weapons literally threaten us all.\n  I refer to the words on this chart concerning Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, excerpts from an October 2002 unclassified CIA report, \nwhich reads:\n\n       Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW--\n\n  Biological weapon--\n\n     agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a \n     variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by \n     bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers and covert operatives, \n     including potentially against the U.S. homeland.\n\n  Indeed, these biological weapons literally threaten us all--\n``potentially against the U.S. homeland.''\n  Saddam Hussein has pursued the most deadly weapons known to man, with \nbrutal determination. His arsenal has included tens of thousands of \ntons of chemical agents and biological agents. He has come within \nmonths of acquiring nuclear weapons, and he has developed many means, \nboth in number and type, to deliver his desired destruction.\n  History shows that dictators do not amass such weapons without the \nintent to use them. Indeed, Saddam Hussein has accumulated chemical \nweapons and used them to attack his neighbors and even murder his own \npeople. During the Iran-Iraq war, which lasted from 1980 to 1988, \nSaddam Hussein inflicted 20,000 casualties by striking with chemicals--\nmustard gas, sarin, and tabun. He also used mustard and nerve agents to \nmurder as many as 5,000 Iraqi Kurds and inflict the misery of chemical \nwarfare on another 10,000.\n  I show this chart briefly to demonstrate the impact of these \nchemicals. Saddam Hussein used the chemicals on his own people. We can \nsee the effects of this tragedy among the victims, who are women and \nchildren in this picture.\n  Saddam Hussein was fully prepared to use biological weapons during \nthe gulf war. In 1995, Iraq admitted it had produced 19,000 liters of \nbotulinum toxin, 8,500 liters of anthrax, and 2,200 liters of \naflatoxin. That is enough botulinum toxin--remember, that is the most \npotent poison known to man--to kill every man, woman and child on \nEarth.\n  Iraq also admitted it had loaded thousands of liters of agents into \nbombs, into munitions, into dozens of warheads and aircraft spray \ntanks, just as American and allied forces prepared to liberate Kuwait. \nBefore the gulf war, intelligence experts believed Saddam Hussein was \nat least 8 to 10 years from having a nuclear weapon. That estimate was \nway off. Iraq had already assembled many of the pieces needed to build \na nuclear weapon. What it lacked was fissile material that makes up the \nexplosive core of a nuclear device. If Saddam Hussein had been able to \nobtain that material, either by making it or buying it, he would likely \nhave had a nuclear bomb by no later than 1993.\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\n  Indeed, Iraq has gone to great lengths to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. Its efforts to hide the weapons have been equally \nambitious. Saddam Hussein has defied the international community almost \nfrom the moment he came to power in 1979. His rule has been a constant \nthreat to peace among the Iraqi people, in the Middle East, and \nthroughout the world.\n  Saddam Hussein has twice invaded sovereign nations. In 1980, he \nlaunched the Iran-Iraq war solely for territorial gain. Eight years, \none million casualties and hundreds of billions of dollars later, the \nwar ended with Iraq gaining nothing. In 1990, Saddam Hussein started \nthe gulf war by invading Kuwait. His objective? Seize control of his \nneighbor's oil fields. We expelled him. As we did, he fired dozens of \nScud missiles into Israel and into Saudi Arabia and the waters off \nQatar.\n  Iraq has shown as much contempt for the international community as it \nhas shown aggression toward its neighbors. Since 1990, Iraq has \nviolated 16 United Nations Security Council resolutions. Inspectors \ncharged with enforcing those resolutions have been deceived, they have \nbeen obstructed, they have been intimidated by Saddam Hussein and his \nhenchmen.\n  Saddam Hussein has funneled as much as $9 billion from the United \nNations Oil-for-Food program into his weapons of mass destruction \nprogram and other illegal activities, starving his people and \nstrangling the economy.\n  To Saddam Hussein international treaties are worth less than the \npaper on which they are written. Iraq is the only nation publicly cited \nfor violating the Geneva Convention ban on using chemical weapons. Its \nbiological weapons program has directly violated the Biological and \nToxin Weapons Convention. And Iraq has utterly ignored the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, which has been signed by 187 countries since its \ninception in 1968.\n  Saddam Hussein said in a recent speech, ``The present of any nation \nor people cannot be isolated from its past . . .'' Indeed. What Saddam \nhas done in the past is reckless, lawless and appalling. But what he is \ndoing now should frighten us all and compel the world to action. Not \nonly does he continue to develop and produce weapons of mass \ndestruction, but he's more likely to use them than ever before. I am \nparticularly concerned about the unique and immediate threat Saddam's \nbiological weapons program presents.\n  Iraq has lethal and incapacitating biological weapons agents \npotentially to use against the United States homeland.\n  Iraq likely produced two to four times more biological agents than it \npublicly admitted in 1995. United Nations inspection teams could not \naccount for biological culture growth media that would have easily \ntripled Saddam's stocks of anthrax--a bacteria that can be rapidly and \neasily produced as a weapon of mass destruction. Mr. President, 30,000 \nmunitions designed solely for chemical and biological agents were also \nunaccounted for. Missing biological agents, missing biological \nmunitions and Iraq's pattern of deception lead to only one conclusion: \nSaddam Hussein today retains a large arsenal of deadly living \nmicroorganisms available as weapons of mass destruction.\n  That arsenal likely contains stocks of live viruses and bacteria \nproduced not only before the Gulf War, but also after, especially since \nweapons inspectors left Iraq in 1998. Saddam has expanded so-called \n``dual-use'' facilities--laboratories, research centers and \nmanufacturing plants that have civilian or commercial uses, but are \nlikely used to build his arsenal of microbiological terror, as well.\n  Iraq has rebuilt known biological weapons facilities that were \ndestroyed during the Gulf War, by our military, or after, by weapons \ninspectors. Also, Saddam retains the equipment and, even more crucial, \nthe human expertise to continue building his biological weapons \ncapability. Unlike nuclear weapons, which take years and massive \nresources to make, biological weapons are inexpensive, can be made \neasily, within weeks, in a small room, with minimal equipment and \nmanpower. That is what makes biological weapons so unique and capable \nof causing such death and destruction.\n  To that end, our intelligence community believes Iraq has built \nmobile germ warfare production laboratories. Iraq has learned a lot \nabout weapons inspections since the Gulf War. Saddam hid his biological \nweapons program from inspectors for 4 years. Mobile biological labs are \nthe ideal weapon of deception. They can be quickly moved in \ninconspicuous trailers and hidden in very small spaces, including, for \nexample, in a single room in one of Saddam Hussein's presidential \npalaces. Such laboratories would be almost invisible to the outside \nworld.\n  There is also evidence that Iraq may be developing and producing a \nnew generation of more virulent biological agents. Defectors allege \nthat Iraq is developing an agent called ``Blue Nile''--which may be a \ncode name for the ebola virus. Ebola is a deadly virus for which there \nis no treatment and there is no vaccine. And many experts believe \nSaddam Hussein may have stocks of the smallpox virus. One of the last \nnaturally occurring smallpox outbreaks occurred on Iraqi soil in the \nearly 1970s, which is precisely when Iraq launched its weapons of mass \ndestruction program.\n  Though U.S. defenses against smallpox are now much stronger, a 2001 \nstudy by Johns Hopkins University found that a smallpox attack launched \nat three locations in the United States could kill in a worst case \nscenario one million and infect another two million Americans within \ntwo months.\n  Saddam has invested not only in developing and producing new viruses \nand bacteria, but also new means to deliver those agents. Iraq has \nexperimented with a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles as part of its \nlongstanding weapons of mass destruction program. But intelligence \nexperts believe Iraq has vastly improved its designs and now has a \ndrone aircraft that can carry and spray up to 80 gallons of anthrax. \nSuch an airplane would be the most effective way to deliver biological \nweapons over a vast area and would represent a dire threat to the Iraqi \npeople, its neighbors and the international community.\n  The danger of germ weapons is not merely that Saddam Hussein has \nthem, but that he would use them . . . even against the United States. \nBiological agents are ideal terrorist weapons. Unlikely other weapons \nof mass destruction, one cannot hear them or taste them or smell them. \nThey can be invisible to the human eye.\n  They can be transported long distances without detection in, for \nexample, a terrorist's pocket. They can take hours and even days to \ntake effect, allowing a terrorist to be long gone--to escape.\n  Thus, Saddam's robust biological weapons program, combined with the \nsupport of terrorism, is a deadly force capable of exceeding the death \nand destruction of even a nuclear bomb.\n  Saddam does support terrorism. Iraq harbors several terrorist groups \nthat have targeted and murdered American citizens. The Iraqi regime has \nbeen in contact with al-Qaida for at least a decade and, as recently as \nthis year, allowed a senior leader to receive medical treatment in \nBaghdad.\n  I am hopeful that inspectors will return to Iraq with totally \nunfettered access to all suspected biological weapons sites. But, \nremember, such a site can be an 8-by-12-foot room deep in the basement \nof a huge Presidential palace.\n  I am hopeful that Saddam Hussein will disarm and destroy his ability \nto develop and produce such weapons in the future. But I am not \noptimistic. Saddam Hussein knows his chemical and biological stocks are \nthe source of his power at home and in his region and can be a tool of \nblackmail. Weapons of mass destruction are as much a part of Saddam \nHussein as freedom and democracy are of America.\n  The test of our resolve in the war on terror was Afghanistan. There \nwe fought the terrorist group and its supporting regimes that murdered \nmore than 3,000 of our own citizens. We were attacked, and, as any \ncapable nation would do, we responded.\n  Now we face a second test. Saddam Hussein has not yet struck, and we \nhope he doesn't. We hope he disarms his weapons of mass destruction and \nchooses peace over war. It is his choice. But should he force us to \nwar, we will fight for a noble and a just cause--to prevent a future \nand far worse attack than that of September 11, 2001. America will be \nvictorious in this next phase of the war on terror, for the worst of a\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\ndictator cannot defeat the will of a free people.\n  Saddam Hussein will fight to preserve his grip on power and protect \nweapons that murder millions. But if we must fight, we will do so for \nlove of country, for respect of humanity, and for the rights and \nfreedoms that all people deserve to enjoy, including the Iraqi people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, under the \nprevious order, is to be recognized.\n  The Chair wants to say that it is his view that the subject matter is \nof enormous gravity, and the subject matter and statement of the \nSenator is most compelling. So anyone who does not share that view will \nleave the Chamber. And that will be pursued by those officers. And the \nSergeants at Arms in the galleries are requested to ensure the gallery \nfollows the same.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I proceed, I would like to \ncongratulate the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. When he writes \nhis name uses the title ``Senator'' followed by ``M.D.'' I think you \nwill always be a doctor even if you are not always a Senator. I am \nhappy to know you in both capacities--as a member of the medical \nprofession--and among our ranks as senators. We in the Senate are very \nfortunate that a few years ago at the peak of your profession you \ndecided to come here, and your people there in Tennessee sent you. I \nhave been here 30 years--roughly five times, I think, that you have \nbeen here. I have gotten to know you very well. I consider you among \none of my very best friends--not only here but in the world. I am very \nproud of what you had to say here tonight.\n  I am not going to speak about the technical matters. If anybody wants \nproof about the quantity and the tremendous damage that the weapons \nwhich Saddam probably possesses can cause humankind, they can read \nSenator Bill Frist's statement just ahead of mine.\n  I have difficulty when speaking on a subject such as this to \ndisengage from being a full-blooded American and try to see the issue \nfrom a global perspective. It is very hard for me to see the world and \nsee this issue in any way other than from the eyes of an American who \ngrew up here and has lived here for the years I have been on this \nEarth. I am prejudiced by my great confidence in America being the \nright country to see that the Middle East stops being a tinderbox. I \nthink we are the right country, and probably the only country that can \nkeep Saddam Hussein from using those weapons of mass destruction. We \nare the only country that will see to it that he brings minimal damage \nto this world.\n  I have concluded, after much study, that we must give our President \nthis authority--not because he is going to use it, but quite to the \ncontrary: to raise hopes he won't have to use it.\n  I am voting aye on giving the President this authority because I am \nconvinced that the one and only way to prevent Saddam Hussein from \ndoing tremendous damage to humankind and to the Earth is to say to our \nPresident, You have the full strength of the American military to keep \nhim from doing anything of great harm.\n  That sounds like a terribly simple proposition, but I don't think it \nis. I think if one wanted to write a 30- or 40-page speech about what I \njust said, one could devote 5 pages just to the history of the United \nStates. They could about how our country started and what our first \nwars were all about. They could talk about the First World War and the \nhorror of chemical weapons used in that conflict.\n  Do you know I had an uncle in the First World War in 1919? I wondered \nwhen I was growing up how come an aunt of mine used to get a little \ncheck in the mail--$19.80, or something. Finally, I said to my mother: \nWhat does my auntie do with that money? She said: She gets it for all \nof the life of her husband--she then told me in Italian--because your \nuncle, mio zio, was gassed by the Kaiser in the First World War with \nmustard gas.\n  You see, how many years ago was that?--80 or 90?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators on the floor will kindly take \ntheir conversations off the floor so the Senator from New Mexico may \nhave the full attention of the Senate.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  So one could write at length about the parallels in our country's \nhistory and how it relates to today. Then follow every war we have been \nin, and then ask, What country is the most just throughout its history? \nWould there be any question? It would be the United States. Yet, we \nhave people saying we shouldn't get involved in this, as if we are some \nbig bamboozling country wrought on doing damage. History will tell us \nand tell the world that that is not why America would get involved in \nthis situation. Isn't that right? Historically, the United States has \nonly used military force when we can do some good. We stand for some \nprinciple or concept that we really think is tremendous--in this case, \ndemocracy versus dictatorship, democracy and freedom versus the kind of \ndespicable character about whom our President has been speaking to us \nfor a long time. The world is seeing a new kind of war that started \nwith the destruction of our towers and our Pentagon.\n  This war has its origins right there in that Middle East where, if \naction is not taken, humankind is going to have some big problems. And \nI concluded that if we want to make sure our military personnel are \nsafe, we would have to get them out of the Middle East, bring them all \nhome. But guess what? If we did that there would be a war in the Middle \nEast without question. It would not take Saddam Hussein very long \nbefore he would attack Israel. And if he wasn't successful, who else \nmight join to help him? Perhaps two or three other nations who would be \nwilling to take up arms against Israel. So I believe there is a real \nreason for us to work through the United Nations to try to bring peace \nto that area.\n\n  So I do not intend to go into all the details about the threat Iraq \nposes, rather, I just want to talk about the conclusions I tried to \ndraw about dealing with that threat. One that I just talked to Senator \nFrist about, is that we are probably as good a nation as any in the \nworld to decide that action needs to be taken. I have also concluded \nthat to be successful, we had better give our President the authority \nhe needs to act. In this way can better negotiate so as to maintain the \npeace.\n  I guess I am going to stop for a minute and ask, is something going \non I should know about? I have 20 minutes to speak. If people are not \nwaiting, I am going to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: The Senator from New \nMexico has the floor; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time does the Senator have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes remaining, and he \nis followed by the Senator from Michigan for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we are 32 minutes away from \nsomeone on that side being recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I \nam delighted to have found you on the floor just before my remarks. As \nalways, you eloquently in describing what terrible things this man can \nwrought on this world and how we need to be careful. If we are going to \nget involved, we ought to be prepared. And what I added tonight, is \nthat if we are going to do anything about it, we have to give our \nPresident the authority he needs. And he may well need our Army, our \nmilitary to do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lieberman-Warner-\nBayh-McCain amendment because I am convinced that without clear \nauthority to act decisively, it is not possible for the President of \nthe United States to effectively confront the growing threat in Iraq.\n  As I just said in talking with my friend from Tennessee, I do not \nthink it is going to be very effective for us to say: Mr. President, \nstay involved, go to the U.N., talk to everybody about the despicable \ncharacter who is now the head of Iraq.\n  I don't think that is going to do anything if the President is not \nbacked up\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\nwith real authority to take military action. I don't want our President \nto engage in an effort that, from the onset, will not allow him to \nachieve intervention by the U.N. with a resolution of consequence.\n  What I want for the American people is for our President to be able \nto effectively work with the U.N. to the maximum extent, as this \nresolution allows.\n  This resolution makes certain that if the United States is involved, \nour President, after trying negotiations--and the words are voluminous \non how hard he must try to resolve this matter peacefully and to keep \nCongress informed, he must give us reports--that he has the strength of \nthe U.S. military if that does not work. And, frankly, I repeat, I \nthink that is more apt to preserve peace than if we do not give the \nPresident the power.\n  I am concerned that the world is already set up for a major war in \nthe Middle East. And the only way to prevent it is to give our \nPresident the authority he needs to negotiate effectively, to go to the \nU.N., to go to our friends, to use diplomacy, but to be ready to say: \nThe people of the United States, through our Congress, gave me \nauthority to do more than that. They gave me authority to intervene and \nuse the full power of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend.\n  Will Senators kindly take their conversations off the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe while they are gone, and the only one here is \nSenator Byrd, I could ask unanimous consent that I have an additional \nhour.\n  I am just joking, so you don't have to object.\n  In any event, it is clear to me that in the absence of this \nauthority, Saddam Hussein will continue to assume that America's \nwarnings are not serious. He will continue with all manner of delay and \ndefiance, and he will continue to buy time for further development of \nweapons of mass destruction. And that is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, while I will associate myself with the technical \nremarks of my friend, the doctor from Tennessee, I know a little bit \nabout nuclear weapons. It is my subcommittee on appropriations that \nfunds them, and has for the last 6\\1/2\\ years. So I know a little bit \nabout that.\n  But I also remember when we went and talked to groups about weapons \nof mass destruction, and we described gas and biological weapons of \nmass destruction by holding up a jar. It was not like this glass I hold \nin my hand, but what we actually used was a mayonnaise jar, the size \njar that most people associate with a jar of mayonnaise that you would \nhave in a refrigerator.\n  And we held that up and said: If you know how to make real poisonous \ngas, and real biological killers, you can put them in a bottle this \nsmall. The chemistry needed to produce these poisons could be \naccomplished in a little room about the size of a kitchen. And the \ndestruction that could be caused is beyond perception.\n  So we will find that it is not as easy as to deter these weapons as \nwere nuclear weapons for all the years we were standing head to head \nand toe to toe with the Soviet Union. We knew everything about their \nnuclear weapons; they knew everything about ours. But this batch of \nterrorists, who are bent on mass destruction, have us much more over a \nbarrel than the Soviet Union did with nuclear weapons when we faced \nmutual assured destruction, sometimes called MAD, as the premise that \nwould prevent war.\n  So it is clear that weapons of mass destruction are going to \ncontinue, under the auspices and direction of the scientists who have \nbeen brought into Iraq, and be shipped around the world by Iraqi \nleaders, to put these terrible kinds of things in the hands of others, \nwho are the ``minutemen'' of Saddam around the world.\n  So I say again, by enacting the resolution that is before us, we \nemphasize our resolve to act in the event that Saddam impedes the work \nof U.N. weapons inspections. We will emphasize by this our resolve to \nact. So let's be clear. Saddam Hussein only understands the language of \nforce. This resolution provides unambiguous authority for the President \nto use force. It is this authority, and Congress's support, that gives \nus the best hope of avoiding confrontation in pursuit of Iraq's \ndisarmament.\n  So it is the expectation of New Mexicans and all Americans that \nwherever their President considers sending U.S. troops to battle, that \nhe does so in full consultation with the Congress and our allies in the \nwar on terrorism. The American people also expect that the President \nwill commit U.S. forces only after diplomatic avenues have been \nexhausted. And this resolution says that.\n  This resolution underscores those concerns by imposing unambiguous \nresponsibilities on our President.\n  I am sure that resolution has been read to the American people and \nthose watching us more than once.\n  But let me just state a couple of them. Prior to using force or \nwithin 48 hours after exercising the authority, the President is \nrequired to certify to Congress that diplomatic and other peaceful \nmeans cannot protect our national security against the threat posed by \nIraq. Also, he must certify that such means are not likely to bring \nIraq into compliance with all relevant U.N. resolutions.\n  Second, only in the event that diplomatic efforts fail and Iraq \ncontinues to breach its international obligations and the inspectors \nare given every opportunity for unimpeded access, then our President \ncan use the military. He doesn't have to come back to us under those \ncircumstances.\n  Believe me, Saddam Hussein and his military and his scientists will \nimmediately understand what it means if we give our President the \nauthority to use force. There is no longer the delay in communications. \nIraq will know we are serious, and we can be more effective in our \ndiplomacy. If it doesn't work, we leave it in the hands of our \nPresident.\n  Some observers think this resolution gives the President too much \nauthority. In fact, the resolution gives the President no more \nauthority than he already has as Commander in Chief to provide for the \nnational security for the United States. What the resolution does is to \nrecognize the clear and present danger of Saddam Hussein with weapons \nof mass destruction. It says he is a weapon of mass destruction. It \ncalls the President to exercise this authority as a last resort, and \nonly in the event that all negotiations are fruitless, and with the \nadded condition that he explain his actions to the Congress.\n  I believe the best way to prevent the Middle East, in this moment of \nhistory, from exploding into a war is for us to recognize how important \nwe are to achieving peace, how important it is that we ask our \nPresident to be our instrument of peace in this very troubled part of \nthe world.\n  Even a person as culpable and as lacking in human decency as Saddam \nHussein will understand that our President, once given the proper \nauthority, will take all necessary action to ensure the security of \nAmerica and humankind against the destruction of weapons of mass \ndestruction. I believe he is far less likely to unleash weapons of mass \ndestruction when he knows that the American military, with the full \nsupport of Congress, is poised to stand in his way.\n  We have just today approved the biggest Defense bill ever in the \nhistory of America. We have given the President most of what he asked \nfor in that bill. I believe it could not be worse news for Saddam \nHussein than to learn that the U.S. Congress has approved the money \nneeded to bolster our military and then, to learn shortly thereafter, \nthat it has approved a resolution giving our President the real \nauthority he needs to use military force to disarm Iraq. I believe this \nis the best way to secure peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me just say we have spent a lot of time, \nand we have a plan. It is not one that is going to finish quickly. We \nhave a lot of work to do tonight. But this is a tremendous step \nforward. I ask everybody to listen.\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\nWe have worked with a number of Senators for some time. I will just say \nI also have permission from the minority to allow Senator Sarbanes to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes following the statement of the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter the pledge tomorrow morning, following the 9:15 a.m. convening of \nthe Senate, Senator Byrd be recognized to offer an amendment No. 4869; \nthat there be a time limitation of 20 minutes, with the opposition \ncontrolling 5 minutes and Senator Byrd controlling 15 minutes; that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the \namendment; that following the disposition of that amendment, there be \n30 minutes of debate equally divided between the leaders, with Senator \nLott controlling the first 15 minutes and Senator Daschle controlling \nthe final 15 minutes, and upon completion of that time, the Senate vote \non Senator Lieberman's amendment, and that will be cloture on the \nLieberman amendment; that following that vote, there be a time \nlimitation of 45 minutes on Senator Byrd's amendment No. 4868, with \nSenator Byrd controlling 30 minutes, Senator Lieberman, or his \ndesignee--the only change would be Senator Biden would control the 15 \nminutes in opposition. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate vote on Senator Byrd's amendment; further, that no second-degree \namendments be in order to either of the above-listed amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I am \nperfectly agreeable to everything that has been said with reference to \nmy amendments. I wonder if we can get a little more time for debate on \nthe motion to invoke cloture. We have nothing but 15 minutes for Mr. \nLott and 15 minutes for Mr. Daschle. I would like to have a few minutes \nto express opposition to cloture. I know it will be futile, but can we \nwork out an additional 30 minutes? The two leaders can close, but this \nagreement only gives the two leaders a chance to talk on cloture. That \nis a key vote. I would like to have a few minutes on that, and perhaps \nother Senators would like time on either side.\n  Mr. REID. The question is, prior to the cloture vote, would the \nminority have objection--or would anybody object to Senator Byrd having \nmore time? How about 10 minutes, because the leaders only get 15?\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the time so short?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd, I say respectfully the two leaders have \nindicated they are going to finish this tomorrow. Each minute we stall \nmeans that much later we have to go.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not stalling.\n  Mr. REID. No one said the Senator is stalling. Each minute that we do \nnot move forward means it will be that much later. Will the Senator \nagree to 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. This is a question of life or death. Can I not get more \nthan 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, does each leader get 15 \nminutes?\n\n  Mr. REID. That's right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why don't we give Senator Byrd 15 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator McCain is going to handle the Byrd amendment--\n  Mr. REID. This is on cloture. Prior to cloture. Why don't we do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our leader will speak prior to cloture.\n  Mr. REID. I modify the request to that effect.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator to recast \nwhat he is now seeking to achieve.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. In the morning, at 9:15, we are going to come in. \nSenator Byrd would be recognized to offer amendment No. 4869, and there \nwill be 20 minutes. He has 15 minutes and the opposition has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could Mr. McCain's name be put next to that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, 5 minutes to Senator McCain. And then following that, \nthere would be a vote on that amendment. Then there will be a vote on \ncloture. Prior to vote on cloture, Senator Daschle would have the last \n15 minutes, Senator Lott would be the middle speaker, and Senator Byrd \nwould be recognized for the first 15 minutes prior to the cloture vote. \nAfter that, Senator Byrd's other amendment would be brought up, with \nthe time as indicated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator repeat the time.\n  Mr. REID. There will be 45 minutes for Senator Byrd and 15 minutes \nfor Senator McCain.\n  Mr. WARNER. Make that McCain-Warner.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dayton wants to speak for 15 minutes on the Byrd \namendment after cloture.\n  Mr. WARNER. How about the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. REID. We are going to work that out further. Please don't go any \nfurther.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the leader that the Senator from Michigan is a \nvital part of the UC.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to work on him, Senator Durbin and Senator \nBoxer.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be along the lines we agreed to in our \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection to the Senator's request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. \nPursuant, then, to this unanimous consent agreement, I understand it \nwould then be in order for me to proceed and to lay down my amendment \ntonight.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment we have spoken about, that's right. The \nSenator is next in order, anyway.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Byrd amendment has not been disposed of.\n  Mr. REID. There is a gentlemen's agreement that will be set aside for \nyou to offer your amendment because there is a time--I guess you would \nsay a gentlemen's and ladies' agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object. I have no intention of \nobjecting. Following the cloture vote, if cloture is invoked, what--\n  Mr. REID. We go immediately to your amendment. You have 45 minutes on \nthat, and there are 15 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. BYRD. On that amendment. And then--\n  Mr. REID. Then we are going to work things out after that. We have \ntalked to Senator Levin and we will talk to Senators Boxer and Durbin. \nI think we can work something out per the conversation we all had in \nthe cloakroom.\n  Mr. BYRD. Assuming cloture is invoked on this serious question--which \nit will be--there will be 30 hours for debate.\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes. As I indicated, we will work with the Senator tomorrow \non the time the Senator can have.\n  Mr. BYRD. I beg the Senator's pardon.\n  Mr. REID. We will work with the Senator on time so he can have some \ntime yielded to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope so.\n  Mr. REID. I indicated I will work on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is an honorable man and I thank him for all of \nhis good work. I hope I am not limited tomorrow to 3 hours and 4 hours. \nI hope whatever Senators want to yield time to me may be allowed to do \nso.\n  Mr. REID. I respectfully say to my friend, I would love to get over \nthis hurdle, and we will worry about that tomorrow. I will do my best.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know about getting over the hurdles. I was always afraid \nsomething would crawl out of the woodwork before I would get the Chair \nto put the question. I have nothing further.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Upon the disposition of the second Byrd amendment, \nwhich would be after cloture--\n  Mr. REID. We are working on that now, what will happen on that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How about the Levin amendment?\n  Mr. REID. We tentatively have that worked out. I need to get off the \nfloor and we can work that out. I am certain we have an agreement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand that now the Byrd amendment will be laid \naside so that the Levin amendment can be called up.\n  Mr. REID. Following his statement, the Senator from Maryland would be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Did the Chair enter the order?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces, \npursuant to a new resolution of the United Nations Security Council, to \ndestroy, remove, or render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, \n  nuclear weapons-usable material, long-range ballistic missiles, and \n              related facilities, and for other purposes)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Multilateral \n     Use of Force Authorization Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687 (1991), Iraq made a commitment--\n       (A) to destroy, remove, or render harmless all chemical and \n     biological weapons and stocks of agents and all related \n     subsystems and components and all research, development, \n     support, and manufacturing facilities related thereto;\n       (B) to destroy, remove, or render harmless all ballistic \n     missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers, and \n     related major parts and production facilities;\n       (C) not to acquire or develop any nuclear weapons, nuclear-\n     weapons-usable material, nuclear-related subsystems or \n     components, or nuclear-related research, development, \n     support, or manufacturing facilities; and\n       (D) to permit immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's \n     biological, chemical, and missile capabilities, and assist \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency in carrying out the \n     destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of all nuclear-\n     related items and in developing a plan for ongoing monitoring \n     and verification of Iraq's compliance.\n       (2) The regime of Saddam Hussein consistently refused to \n     cooperate with United Nations Special Commission weapons \n     inspectors in Iraq between 1991 and 1998 by denying them \n     access to crucial people, sites, and documents.\n       (3) On October 31, 1998, Iraq banned the United Nations \n     weapons inspectors despite its agreement and obligation to \n     comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     (1991).\n       (4) Iraq continues to develop weapons of mass destruction, \n     in violation of its commitments under United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 687 (1991) and subsequent resolutions, and \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass \n     destruction against its own people and other nations.\n       (5) The development of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq \n     is a threat to the United States, to the friends and allies \n     of the United States in the Middle East, and to international \n     peace and security.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL POLICY FOR UNITED NATIONS SECURITY \n                   COUNCIL ACTION ON IRAQ.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) supports the President's call for the United Nations to \n     address the threat to international peace and security posed \n     by Saddam Hussein's continued refusal to meet Iraq's \n     obligations under resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council to accept the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless of its weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons-\n     usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of \n     150 kilometers, and related facilities, and to cease the \n     development, production, or acquisition of such weapons, \n     materials, and missiles;\n       (2) urges the United Nations Security Council to adopt \n     promptly a resolution that--\n       (A) demands that Iraq provide immediate, unconditional, and \n     unrestricted access of the United Nations weapons inspectors \n     so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons-\n     usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of \n     150 kilometers, and related facilities are destroyed, \n     removed, or rendered harmless; and\n       (B) authorizes the use of necessary and appropriate \n     military force by member states of the United Nations to \n     enforce such resolution in the event that the Government of \n     Iraq refuses to comply;\n       (3) affirms that, under international law and the United \n     Nations Charter, the United States has at all times the \n     inherent right to use military force in self-defense; and\n       (4) will not adjourn sine die this year and will return to \n     session at any time before the next Congress convenes to \n     consider promptly proposals relative to Iraq if in the \n     judgment of the President the United Nations Security Council \n     fails to adopt or enforce the resolution described in \n     paragraph (2).\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES \n                   PURSUANT TO A NEW UNITED NATIONS SECURITY \n                   COUNCIL RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--Pursuant to a resolution of the United \n     Nations Security Council described in section 3(2) that is \n     adopted after the enactment of this joint resolution, and \n     subject to subsection (b), the President is authorized to use \n     the Armed Forces of the United States to destroy, remove, or \n     render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear \n     weapons-usable material, ballistic missiles with a range \n     greater than 150 kilometers, and related facilities, if Iraq \n     fails to comply with the terms of the Security Council \n     resolution.\n       (b) Requirements.--Before the authority granted in \n     subsection (a) is exercised, the President shall make \n     available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination \n     that the United States has used appropriate diplomatic and \n     other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with a \n     resolution of the United Nations Security Council described \n     in section 3(2) and that those efforts have not been and are \n     not likely to be successful in obtaining such compliance.\n       (c) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution (22 U.S.C. 1544(b)).\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     joint resolution, and at least once during every 60-day \n     period thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing a summary of the status of efforts--\n       (1) to have the United Nations Security Council adopt the \n     resolution described in section 3(2); or\n       (2) in the case of the adoption of such resolution, to \n     obtain compliance by Iraq with the resolution.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment will provide an alternative \nto the Lieberman amendment. This amendment will authorize the President \nto use military force supporting the U.N. resolution that he seeks, but \nthen provides that if he seeks to go it alone, if he wants authority to \nproceed unilaterally, he would then call us back into session.\n  This amendment provides that if the President then seeks authority to \nunilaterally go it alone without the authority of the United Nations, \nnot in support of a U.N. resolution, he would then call us back into \nsession and seek that authority from the Congress.\n  This is an alternative to the unilateral approach which is in the \nWhite House-supported resolution. This gives the same authority to the \nPresident to use military force of the United States in support of the \nU.N. resolution that he seeks, but does not at this time address the \nissue of going it alone and authorizing unilateral action or saving \nthat for a later time should the United Nations not act.\n  President Bush described in Cincinnati in detail the threat that \nSaddam Hussein's regime poses.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend will yield for a \nmoment. I just discovered in the haste of activities that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has 30 minutes \nto present his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And then there is no time reserved for the Senator from \nVirginia to do any rebuttal following that amendment, but there is now \ntime given to the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, immediately \nfollowing the Senator from Michigan; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, President Bush described in Cincinnati in \ndetail the threat that the Saddam Hussein regime poses. I have \nrelatively few differences with that description, and I believe if \nSaddam Hussein continues to refuse to meet his obligation to destroy \nhis weapons of mass destruction and his prohibited missile delivery \nsystems, that the United Nations should authorize member states to use \nmilitary force to destroy those weapons and systems and that the United \nStates Armed Forces should participate in and lead a United Nations \nauthorized force. That is what my amendment provides.\n  The issue that is in dispute is whether unilateral force should be \nauthorized by Congress at this time in case the United Nations does not \nact--whether we should authorize the President now to go it alone \nwithout U.N. authorization if the United Nations does not act. How we \nanswer that question could have a profound and lasting effect on the \nsafety of our children and grandchildren for decades to come because \nthe difference between attacking a nation with the support of the world \ncommunity or attacking it without such support is fundamental.\n  The President answers the question by seeking a resolution from \nCongress that gives him the authority to use force under the auspices \nof the United Nations or to go it alone if the United Nations fails to \nact. He seeks this unilateral authority even though he does not \ncondition its use on the threat to the United States by Saddam as being \nimminent.\n\n  Indeed, the President stated in the national security strategy that \nwas released by the White House last month that preemptive attacks to \nforestall or prevent hostile acts by our adversaries can now be \nundertaken although a threat is not imminent.\n  The new strategy the President has adopted explicitly states:\n\n       We just adapt the concept of imminent threat to the \n     capabilities and objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue \n     states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using \n     conventional means.\n\n  The President's Iraq resolution and the national security strategy, \ntherefore, both take the position that an imminent threat is no longer \nrequired as a basis for our military action in self-defense. The \nPresident is explicitly seeking to modify the traditional concept of \npreemption by deleting the need for ``imminent'' and substituting that \nof ``sufficient threat'' in the strategy document and ``continuing \nthreat'' in the proposed resolution--dropping the requirement for \n``imminent''--that the threat be imminent--and substituting something \nfar less--``sufficient'' or ``continuing.''\n  That the President is seeking authorization for a unilateral \npreemptive attack without U.N. authorization or requirement of imminent \nthreat is at the heart of the Senate debate that is presently taking \nplace.\n  Under the traditional international law concept of preemption in \nself-defense, the United States would be justified in acting alone in \nthe case of a serious threat to our Nation that is imminent. In a case \nwhere a threat is not imminent, military action would also be justified \nif it were carried out pursuant to the authorization for the use of \nforce by member states of the United Nations.\n  The choice facing the Senate is whether Congress should now, at this \ntime, give the President the authority to go it alone, to act \nunilaterally against Iraq if the United Nations fails to act.\n  Congress is being presented with this issue at the very same time our \nSecretary of State is trying to get the United Nations to back a tough \nnew resolution authorizing member states to use military force to \nenforce Iraqi compliance with inspections and disarmament.\n  On Monday, the President said:\n\n       I have asked Congress to authorize use of America's \n     military if it proves necessary to enforce U.N. Security \n     Council demands.\n\n  That sounds like my alternative, but in fact the White House \nresolution asks for much more.\n  The resolution the White House seeks is not limited to the use of \nforce if the United Nations authorizes it. On the contrary, it \nspecifically authorizes now the use of force on a unilateral, go-it-\nalone basis, that is, without Security Council authorization. The \nPresident's rhetoric does not match the resolution before us.\n  The White House approach also authorizes the use of force beyond \ndealing with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery, which is also a difference from my resolution.\n  The resolution which I offer on behalf of those cosponsors and myself \nis consistent with how I think most Americans want us to proceed. It \nemphasizes the importance of dealing with Iraq on a multilateral basis, \nand it withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether the \nUnited States should go it alone, that is, whether we should act \nunilaterally against Iraq if the United Nations fails to act.\n  This resolution I am offering does the following: First, it urges the \nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution promptly that \ndemands unconditional access for U.N. inspectors so Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles may be located and \ndestroyed, and within that same U.N. resolution authorizes the use of \nnecessary and appropriate force by U.N. member states as a means of \nenforcement in the event that Iraq refuses to comply.\n  Our resolution also specifically authorizes use of United States \nArmed Forces pursuant to that U.N. Security Council resolution if Iraq \nfails to comply with its terms and the President informs the Congress \nof his determination that the United States has used appropriate \ndiplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain Iraqi compliance with \nsuch a U.N. resolution. Our resolution affirms that under international \nlaw and under the U.N. charter, especially article 51, the United \nStates has at all times the inherent right to use military force in \nself-defense. This affirms the fact that there is no U.N. veto over \nU.S. military action.\n  I repeat that because some of our colleagues have suggested otherwise \nabout our resolution. The resolution we are offering explicitly affirms \nthe fact there is no U.N. veto over U.S. military action because we \nstate explicitly the United States has at all times an inherent right \nto use military force in self-defense. Our resolution also provides \nCongress will not adjourn sine die so that Congress can return to \nsession, if necessary, and promptly consider proposals relative to Iraq \nif, in the judgment of the President, the U.N. Security Council does \nnot promptly act on the resolution I have described above.\n  Our resolution therefore supports the President's appeal to the \nUnited Nations and it approves now the use of our Armed Forces to \nsupport the action of the United Nations to force compliance by Saddam \nHussein with inspections and disarmament. However, it does not \nauthorize now, before we know whether or not we have the world \ncommunity on our side, U.S. Armed Forces going alone. Should we need to \nconsider that possibility at a future time, the resolution provides for \nthe immediate recall of Congress to do so.\n  Our resolution does not, on the matter of war and peace, life and \ndeath, exceed the grant of authority needed by the President at this \ntime.\n  If Congress instead endorses the White House approach, allowing the \nunilateral use of force at this time, even in the absence of a U.N. \nauthorization, we will be sending an inconsistent message. We will be \ntelling the United Nations that if they do not act, we will, at the \nsame time we are urging them to act. We would be taking the U.N. off \nthe hook if we adopt the go-it-alone resolution. We would be telling \nthe United Nations they are not particularly relevant at the same time \nwe are urging them to be very relevant. If we want the United Nations \nto be relevant and credible, if we want the United Nations to succeed, \nif we want the United Nations not to be limited to humanitarian and \ndisaster relief and other tasks that are mighty useful but not \nessential--and I think most of us do--then we have to focus our efforts \nthere and give those efforts a chance to succeed.\n\n  If we act wisely, authorizing the use of our forces pursuant to a \nU.N. resolution authorizing member States to use\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nforce, we will not only unite the Congress, ultimately we will unite \nthe world community on a course of action that will seek the \nelimination of Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten the world with \nweapons of mass destruction. That is where our focus should be, uniting \nthe world, not dividing it. Moreover, a going-alone approach, in which \nwe attack Iraq without the support and participation of the world \ncommunity, entails serious risks and could have serious consequences \nfor us in the Middle East and around the world. It makes a difference, \nwhen deciding to use force, whether that use of force has the support \nof the world community. It makes a difference for us in the current \nsituation involving a possible attack on Iraq. If we go it alone, will \nwe be able to use air bases, ports, supply bases, overflight rights in \nthe region? Those rights and capabilities are important to the success \nof a military operation against Saddam.\n  The Saudis have said publicly that without the U.N. authorization, we \nwill not have access to important bases, and that is just one country. \nOthers have said something very similar. If we go it alone, will there \nbe a reduction in the broad international support for the war on \nterrorism, including the law enforcement, financial and intelligence \ncooperation that is so essential? If we go it alone, will that \ndestabilize an already volatile region and undermine governments such \nas Jordan and Pakistan? Could we possibly end up with a radical regime \nin Pakistan, a country which has nuclear weapons? If we go it alone, \nwill Saddam Hussein or his military commanders be more likely to use \nweapons of mass destruction against other nations in the region and \nagainst our military forces in response to our attack? That would be \nthe case if he faced a U.N.-authorized coalition, particularly if that \ncoalition included Muslim nations as the coalition did during the gulf \nwar.\n  If we go it alone, will we be undercutting efforts to get other \ncountries to help us with the expensive and lengthy task of stabilizing \nIraq after Saddam is removed? Beyond the current situation relative to \nusing force in Iraq, going it alone without U.N. authorization, based \non a modified concept of preemption that no longer requires the threat \nto be imminent, will lead to a serious risk to international peace and \nsecurity. If we act unilaterally, without U.N. authority or an imminent \nthreat, that will create a dangerous situation for international peace \nand stability in the long term. We will be inviting other nations to \nforego an important rule of international law requiring a serious and \nimminent threat before one nation can attack another nation in the name \nof self-defense.\n  India and Pakistan have a continuing threat, in their view, from each \nother. Even Greece and Turkey at times view each other as a continuing \nthreat. If that becomes the test, and if we set the precedent in this \nresolution to authorize that kind of attack, in the absence of an \nimminent threat, we will be setting the world on a very different \ncourse, and we must consider a long time before doing that. That is \nwhat we should be called back into session to consider if the U.N. does \nnot authorize force.\n  By seeking a U.N. resolution that will authorize U.N. member States \nto use force if Iraq does not comply with its terms, we are not giving \nthe United Nations a veto over the conduct of our foreign policy. What \nwe are doing is getting from the United Nations strength and \ninternational support should military force be necessary. We should be \nseeking to unite the world against Saddam Hussein, not dividing it. Our \nimmediate objective should be to get the United Nations to act, locate, \nand destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the means of \ndelivering them. The threat Saddam presents is real and we should deal \nwith it. But authorization for preemptive, unilateral U.S. action in \nIraq does not need to, and should not be granted at this time. If the \nU.N. does not act, Congress can be called back promptly to consider a \nrequest to authorize force unilaterally and to consider the serious and \ndifferent risks involved in pursuing the unilateral course.\n\n  Last Monday's Washington Post carried a story in which a senior \nEuropean official's response to the U.S. going it alone was:\n\n       A lot of Europeans would feel they had been put in an \n     intolerable position.\n\n  For those who would agree to participate militarily:\n\n       . . . it would be less a coalition of the willing than of \n     the dragooned.\n\n  Javier Solana, former NATO Secretary-General, currently the EU's top \nforeign policy official, in an address at NATO headquarters last week \nstated:\n\n       Ad hoc coalitions of docile followers to be chosen or \n     discarded at will is neither attractive nor sustainable.\n\n  Just last week, after hearing from Prime Minister Blair and Foreign \nMinister Straw, the ruling Labor Party's conference in Britain issued a \nformal position on Iraq that included the following:\n\n       The conference believes that the authority of the U.N. will \n     be undermined unless it is enforced, and recognizes that in \n     the last resort this could involve military action but \n     considers that this should be taken within the context of \n     international law and with the authority of the U.N.\n\n  Just last Friday, Turkey's Presidential spokesman said his nation \nwould participate in a campaign against Iraq only if the world body \nblessed them, stating ``an operation not based on international law \ncannot be accepted.''\n  The best chance of having Saddam Hussein comply with U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions is to make sure when he looks down the barrel of a \ngun that he sees the world at the other end, not just the United \nStates. I believe he will not open up to inspections without looking \ndown the barrel of a gun. I think only the credible threat of force \nwill, indeed, disarm Saddam Hussein. But the question remains whether \nor not we want that force to be the world's authorized, supported \nforce, or whether or not we at this time want to say, well, if they \ndon't, we will. We will go it alone. When we do not need to address \nthat issue at this time when the President is going to the United \nNations, when it undermines our argument at the United Nations that we \nwant them and need them to adopt a strong resolution, to enforce it, to \nauthorize member states to use military force to enforce it. That is \nthe direction we should be going, that is the focus we should have, and \nit should be strong and undiluted, the question of whether we authorize \nat this time a go-it-alone approach, when that is not what is needed at \nthis time.\n  Congress should give the President what he said in Cincinnati he was \nasking for: The authority to use U.S. military force to enforce U.S. \nSecurity Council demands; not what the resolution that is supported by \nthe White House provides, which is going-it-alone authority. Our focus \nthen would be where it belongs, securing a United Nations resolution \nthat can unite the world; that has the best chance of forcing \ncompliance and avoiding war; that reduces the risk to our forces and to \nour interests throughout the world; that avoids to the maximum extent \npossible the negative consequences if force is required, including the \nloss of cooperation on the war on terrorism. That is the best chance of \nisolating Saddam Hussein, rather than isolating the United States.\n  I wonder how much time I have remaining?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield 4 minutes to my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nMichigan for his thoughtful approach. I believe what Senator Levin has \nput forward is the right approach. It minimizes the risk to our \ncountry, to our troops, and maximizes the ability for the world \ncommunity, including the United States, to come together, to make sure \nthat Saddam Hussein does not have the opportunity to use weapons of \nmass destruction against us or against anyone else in the world.\n  I would, just to support Senator Levin, quote again as I did last \nweek on the floor of the Senate in my own statement, Brent Scowcroft, \nformer National Security Adviser to President Bush, who wrote in the \nWall Street Journal: An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously \njeopardize, if not destroy, the global counterterrorism campaign we \nhave undertaken. Ignoring that clear world sentiment against an attack \nwould result in a serious degradation in international cooperation\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nwith us against terrorism. And make no mistake, we simply cannot win \nthat war without enthusiastic international cooperation, especially on \nintelligence.\n  I believe Senator Levin's approach guarantees we keep our focus on \nthe coalition that has come together to fight terrorism in the world \nand at the same time gives us the opportunity to build that same \ncoalition to turn attention to the threats of Saddam Hussein. We can do \nboth. We can do it correctly. And we can minimize the risk that I \nbelieve will be there if we, in fact, rush to act alone.\n  I thank Senator Levin, again, certainly as Chair of the Armed \nServices Committee, for his continual service to our country and his \nunderstanding of what it takes to make sure we are able to keep our \nfocus on terrorism and take the time and the opportunity to build that \nsame coalition to address the threats of Saddam Hussein's weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin approach. I believe this is \nthe approach that will allow us to make sure we do this right. I urge \nits adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 4868 to remove paragraph 2, and further I ask consent to \nmodify my amendment No. 4869 to change the references to Sec. 3(a) to \n4(a).\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, could the Senator from West \nVirginia tell us what these changes mean?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The second one is just a technical change in \nparagraphs, from 3(a) to 4(a). It makes no change in the substance of \nthe amendment.\n  The other change, I asked unanimous consent to modify my amendment \nNo. 4868 to remove paragraph 2. This amendment is not affected by \ngermaneness, no matter what happens. As submitted to the desk earlier, \nparagraph 2 is as follows--I want to take this out. Here is what I am \nmoving to do. I can best clarify it by reading the entire amendment, \nand then I will state to the Senate where I want it cut off.\n  My amendment would be Sec. 5. Statutory Construction.\n\n       Nothing in this Joint Resolution--\n       (1) is intended to alter the constitutional authorities of \n     the Congress to declare war, grant letters of Marque and \n     Reprisal, or other authorities invested in Congress by \n     Section 8, article I of the Constitution; or\n\n      that is straightforward.\n\n  Now, the part I wanted to take out says:\n\n       Or, (2) shall be construed as granting any authority to the \n     President to use the United States Armed Forces for any \n     purpose not directly related to a clear threat of imminent, \n     sudden, and direct attack upon the United States, its \n     possessions or territories, or the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, unless the Congress of the United States otherwise \n     authorizes.\n\n  I am asking to lop off that second paragraph. I had some concerns \nexpressed by several of my colleagues on this side with respect to that \npart.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, respectfully and regrettably, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to both requests?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair is correct, to both requests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will reconsider that.\n  I withdraw my request for the moment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the time of the \nSenator from West Virginia has not been off the time of the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan now has 6 minutes. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand my friends have some questions which I would \nbe happy to try to answer on my 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \npermitting my colleague from Connecticut and myself to ask questions. I \nthink the Senator from Connecticut can go first with his question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Michigan.\n  Let me ask this question. The Senator's amendment provides the Senate \nnot adjourn this year and return to session at any time before the next \nCongress convenes to consider promptly proposals relative to Iraq if, \nin the judgment of the President, the United Nations Security Council \nfails to adopt or enforce the resolution described in paragraph 2.\n  My question to the Senator from Michigan is whether he has decided \nunder those circumstances whether he would support a resolution \nauthorizing the President to use force and the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States to enforce the United Nations resolutions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the circumstances would determine the answer to \nthat question that exists at the time. But the risks of going it alone \nare so much greater than going multilateral support. It seems to me we \nshould consider those risks before reaching a decision. Tonight I have \nlaid out some of those risks which I believe are serious risks of going \nit alone. That is what I think we would all need to consider at great \nlength before authorizing going-it-alone authority.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, regrettably we \nhave to very forcefully object to your amendment before the vote. But I \nsay that our President, at the urging of everybody who said go to the \nUnited Nations, went to the United Nations. He gave a brilliant speech. \nThe Secretary of State met with us yesterday. I met with him \npersonally. The Secretary of State is doing everything possible to \navoid a two-step process. I say regrettably to my good friend, were we \nto adopt this amendment, it would completely dislodge the efforts \nongoing at this time in the United Nations to get, if possible, one \nsingle No. 17 resolution and put it in place.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I turn that into a question, whether or not I agree. It \nseems to me the opposite is true. We are asking the United Nations to \ntake action. We want them to do it with one step. My resolution urges \none step--impose the obligation on Saddam Hussein, and authorize force \nto enforce that mandate. It is one step in my resolution.\n  If we go to the U.N., as we are now doing, and say we really need \nyou, it is really important we have United Nations support, that is \nwhat we are saying, the President said we want you to be credible, it \nis totally inconsistent at the same time in your resolution to say, by \nthe way, if you do not do it, we will. It just takes the United Nations \noff the hook. It sends the opposite message to the U.N. from what we \nshould be saying to the United Nations and I thought the President was \nsaying to the United Nations: We want you to be credible. We need the \nworld to come together for Saddam Hussein.\n  The resolution that the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nConnecticut supports is basically to say, if you do not do it, we will \ngo it alone.\n  That is the wrong message to the world for many reasons.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  My friend from Michigan knows one of the reasons I cosponsored the \nresolution underlying it is I believe the best way for us to get the \nUnited Nations to act to enforce its own resolutions is if we make \nclear we are prepared to do so ourselves, although that is not our \npreference.\n  Here is my question: In section 3(3) of the Senator's amendment, you \ndo affirm under international law the U.S. has at all times the \ninherent right to use military force itself. You argued tonight that is \nan indication that those who have said your amendment gives a veto to \nU.N. over U.S. actions are not correct. But isn't it true the section \njust below, section 4(a) of your amendment, says the President is \nauthorized to use the Armed Forces of the U.S. to destroy, remove, or \nrender harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons \nmaterial, ballistic missiles, et cetera, only pursuant to a resolution \nof the United Nations Security Council as described above?\n  So while you recognize the inherent right of the U.S. to defend \nitself, to take military action in self-defense, isn't it true your \namendment does give\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\nthe United Nations a veto over the authority of the United States to \ntake action to enforce the resolutions of the United Nations?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is quite the opposite. The good Senator from \nConnecticut read the language which makes it clear there is no veto. We \ncan always have the inherent right to use military force in self-\ndefense, period. We never will yield that to the United Nations or to \nanyone else.\n  My good friend from Connecticut was the author of a resolution back \nin 1991. He led the way on this authorization in the gulf war. The \nSenator was correct in his analysis, that we should move in the gulf \nwar, and my good friend from Virginia was as well. That resolution the \nSenator from Connecticut offered to support military action in the gulf \nwar said the following: The President is authorized, subject to \nsubsection (b), to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United \nNations Security Council Resolution 678.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Virginia in the \ngulf war resolution had language which was adopted by a close majority, \nbut nonetheless adopted, which said the President is authorized to use \nUnited States Armed Forces pursuant to the United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution. Nobody suggested then that the Senator from \nConnecticut was giving the United Nations a veto over U.S. military \nforce. That was a grant of authority to enforce a United Nations \nresolution. That is the same language we are using.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Michigan is quite correct. The \ndifference, I want to respectfully suggest, is in the context--in the \nhistorical context. There was an invasion by Iraq of Kuwait. There had \nalready been a United Nations Security Council resolution. That is why \nthe authority was as described.\n  Here, this resolution by Senators Warner, McCain, Bayh, and I have \nintroduced is based on a record now of 11 years in which everything \nelse has been tried to get Iraq to comply with those resolutions, and \nthey haven't.\n  I think the difference here--I ask the Senator if he would react--is \nthat the Senator has acknowledged the obvious inherent right of the \nUnited States to act in self-defense. That is a higher standard than \nthe question of acting to enforce United Nations Security Council \nresolutions. In other words, it may be I might argue that is not in \nself-defense because I believe if we do not disarm Saddam Hussein, he \nwill eventually strike us and our allies. But, in any case, in \naffirming a right of self-defense, the Senator has set a standard that \nis not carried out in a later section which makes our ability to \nenforce those resolutions pursuant to United Nations authorization.\n  So to that extent, your amendment would give the United Nations a \nveto over whether the President of the United States could take action \nagainst Iraq to enforce outstanding U.N. resolutions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will put that in the form of a question.\n  I vehemently disagree. I urge the Senator from Connecticut to read \nthe language, which flat out says: We affirm ``the United States has at \nall times the inherent right to use military force in self-defense. . . \n.'' We affirm that.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, in the resolution in 1991, did not even \naffirm that. It just simply authorized the President to use military \nforce pursuant to the United Nations Security Council resolution. No \none suggested then that anyone was ceding the power to use our force to \nthe United Nations. Yet in our resolution, the alternative resolution, \nthe multilateral resolution, for some reason, the folks who are \nsupporting the go-it-alone resolution are suggesting we are ceding \nsomething to the U.N. when we explicitly reaffirm our right to self-\ndefense.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do not think we will ever go it alone because we are \ngoing to the United Nations. But how then does the Senator read section \n4(a) of his amendment, which says clearly that the President can only \nuse the Armed Forces of the United States to destroy, disarm Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction if there is U.N. permission?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Where does the word ``only'' appear in that resolution?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will read it:\n\n       Pursuant to a resolution of the United Nations Security \n     Council described in section 3(2) that is adopted after the \n     enactment of this joint resolution . . . the President is \n     authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States. . . \n     .\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Where does the word ``only'' appear in this resolution? \nThat is my question to my dear friend from Connecticut. The Senator \nadded a word that is not in the resolution and ignores a paragraph, \nsaying we have an inherent right of self-defense, that is in the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Now we have joined the issue.\n  Then I ask the Senator this final question: Would it be the Senator's \nopinion that enforcement of outstanding U.N. Security Council \nresolutions would amount to an act of self-defense and, therefore, the \nPresident of the United States could do that without an authorizing \nresolution from the United Nations?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have an inherent right to use military force in self-\ndefense, and that means, under law which is well established, that if \nthere is an imminent threat to the United States, we do not have to \nwait for that threat to be implemented. We can act against any imminent \nthreat whether or not there is a U.N. resolution covering that threat. \nIf it is an imminent threat, we may act in self-defense.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In that case, is it not true the Senator from Michigan \nis adding a word, which is the word ``imminent''?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. You have asked me to interpret the words ``inherent \nright of self-defense.'' What I am saying is, under international law, \nself-defense requires that a threat be imminent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is to be recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time not run against the Senator from Maryland for a \nunanimous consent request that we would like to have adopted.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator for the purposes \nof his unanimous consent request, with the understanding I not lose my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say we have a number of people who want to \nspeak. It is a little bit difficult because we have Senator Levin and \nSenator Sarbanes for an hour. So I know that some of my colleagues on \nthis side have been waiting a long time. But we have also had people \nover here waiting a long time.\n  So this would be my suggestion as to the time: That following the \nstatement of Senator Sarbanes, Senator Hutchinson be recognized for 25 \nminutes; following that, Senator Thompson be recognized for 20 minutes; \nfollowing that, Senator Murray be recognized for 20 minutes; Senator \nEnzi for 20 minutes; Senator Reed for 40 minutes; Senator Chafee for 7 \nminutes; and then Senator Durbin for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Now, if my friend from Maryland would withhold, we have a \nunanimous consent request that I gave to be copied, and it has not \nshown up. Here it comes. I would really like to get that done.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand, under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, this time is not being charged against my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum. As soon as the quorum \ncall is called off, I will do the unanimous consent request and give \nthe time to the Senator that he is entitled to anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me, just as a background, indicate that \nSenators Levin, Boxer, and Durbin have been most cooperative. They have \namendments that have been filed in the appropriate form. They have \nindicated they will offer each amendment tomorrow. Senator Levin's is \npending tonight. We will dispose of these amendments, and they will \noffer no other amendments tomorrow.\n  Senator Boxer's is going to be disposed of at some length. She is \nalways very deliberate in what she does. She recognizes this amendment \nis good, recognizes that the best way to handle this, though, is to \nhave a colloquy tomorrow. I have spoken to the minority manager on this \nmatter. He has agreed to enter into a colloquy with her. We have \ndiscussed what that would be.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Senator McCain and I will engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. REID. I therefore ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of Senator Byrd's amendment No. 4868, the Senate resume \nconsideration of Senator Levin's amendment No. 4862; that the amendment \nbe in order notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII; that there be \n50 minutes under the control of Senator Levin and 45 minutes in \nopposition divided as follows: 15 minutes for Senator Biden, 15 minutes \nfor Senator Warner, and 15 minutes for Senator McCain--this would be in \nopposition to the Levin amendment--that upon the use or yielding back \nof that time, the Senate vote without any intervening action on, or in \nrelation to, Senator Levin's amendment; that upon disposition of his \namendment, Senator Durbin be recognized to call up amendment No. 4865; \nthat Senator Durbin control 40 minutes for debate and 10 minutes for \nSenator Biden and 15 minutes for Senators Warner and McCain in \nopposition, a total of 35 minutes, plus the 10 minutes for Senator \nBiden--it would be 10 minutes for Senator Biden, 15 minutes combined \nfor Senators Warner and McCain--that upon the use or yielding back of \nthat time, the Senate vote without any intervening action on or in \nrelation to Senator Durbin's amendment; that no second-degree \namendments be in order to either of these above-listed amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The only change I would make in the request I just made is \nthat Senator Durbin have an up-or-down vote on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, having done that, I really appreciate very \nmuch Senator Sarbanes yielding. I would ask that after Senator Sarbanes \nfinishes his statement, Senator Chafee, who has agreed to speak for \nonly 7 minutes--rather than his waiting at the bottom of the list, I \nwonder if we could get him up at the top of the list to speak, and \nhopefully maybe Senators Hutchinson or Thompson may not use all their \ntime. That may work out OK anyway.\n  My question is, Does anyone object to Senator Chafee speaking first?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object--I won't object--I wanted \nto take a second to thank Senator Reid for arranging the disposition of \nthis very difficult issue in an equitable fashion to all. I thank him \nfor a masterful job that a few hours ago did not seem likely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. May I join Senator McCain. Also, there is reference in \nhere to time allocated to Senator McCain and myself. We will assure our \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut that that time will be given to \nhim as allotted between Senator McCain and myself.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, we still have a number of Members who have \nbeen attempting to make statements relative to the underlying bill. I \nassure Senators DeWine, Collins, Specter, and others that we will be \nworking with them with regard to scheduling tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say, I appreciate very much the cooperation of \neveryone. But before we start doing too much back slapping here, \ntomorrow is going to be a really difficult day. We have to be prepared \nfor that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we recognize that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator clarify \nthe list of speakers following Senator Sarbanes with the change \nregarding Senator Chafee?\n  Mr. REID. Senators Chafee, Hutchinson, and Thompson would be before \nyou, and Senator Chafee has 7 minutes. Senator Hutchinson has 25, and \nSenator Thompson has 20. I would say to my friend from Washington, you \nhave been here for at least 4 hours that I know of. But the point is, \nwe are using up a lot of time with Senator Levin and Senator Sarbanes. \nThey are really entitled to that time only from an equitable \nstandpoint, not from the fact that anyone could object to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Reserving right to object----\n  Mr. REID. You are already in the queue.\n  Mr. REED. You did agree to the list?\n  Mr. REID. Following Senator Thompson, Senator Reed is recognized for \n40 minutes, Senator Enzi, 20 minutes, and then Senator Durbin for 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized under the previous order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Akaka be added as a \ncosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I first want to commend, in the very \nstrongest terms, the very able Senator from Michigan, chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, for the powerful statement he just made and \nfor the analysis he has brought to this critically important issue.\n  In my judgment, he has drawn the essential lines of distinction and \ndifferentiation. They are reflected in the amendment that is now before \nus, which I hope will be adopted tomorrow when it is offered as a \nsubstitute to the pending Lieberman proposal.\n  At the end of World War II, the United States stood astride the world \nlike a colossus. We were preeminently the most powerful nation--in some \nrespects, more powerful even than we are today, although we are once \nagain certainly the most powerful nation. At the end of World War II, \nthe United States had an overwhelming military capacity and \noverwhelming economic strength, but at that time we chose to act \nmultilaterally, to make our way in the world on the basis of \ncooperation, to help found the United Nations. The United States played \na leading role in creating the U.N. framework and has exercised \nextraordinary influence within it ever since.\n  The question of how we are to exercise our power is a critically \nimportant question. We need to recognize that, for it is at issue here. \nWe face a real dividing line: are we going to seek to exercise our \npower in cooperation, in coordination with others, which in the current \ncontext means working through the United Nations; or are we going to \nmove down the path of asserting a unilateral preemptive prerogative, in \neffect, asserting our right to do what we want anywhere, anytime, to \nanyone. The comprehensive strategic doctrine that the administration \nissued only a short while ago would take us down that unilateral path.\n\n  It goes without saying, as the able Senator from Michigan pointed \nout, that the United States has an inherent right of self-defense; this \nright is recognized in his amendment. In fact, international law and \nthe United Nations Charter both recognize that inherent right to use \nmilitary force in self-defense.\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\n  But as the Senator very carefully pointed out in his most thoughtful \nstatement, under international law that inherent right to use military \nforce in self-defense is justified in response to an imminent threat. \nNow we have an effort to change that standard. I think such a change is \nfraught with danger both for our position in the world and for our \nleadership status.\n  We have to re-affirm the long-standing principle that the most \neffective way to accomplish our goals is to work in concert with \nothers. No one is proposing to give away our ultimate authority to act. \nThe President can always come back to us to seek such an authorization. \nIn fact, if the Senator from Michigan will yield for a question----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I read the amendment, the Senator provides that the \nPresident could come back to Congress to seek authority if he decided \nit was necessary to proceed on the unilateral path; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the other hand, his amendment provides an authority \nto act in support of multilateral action, as reflected in the adoption \nof a U.N. resolution, which would seek to deal with the threat Saddam \nHussein presents to the region and to the world; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is an extremely important point. It \nis not enough to be strong; you have to be smart as well. You have to \nbe both strong and smart. If we insist on acting alone, the potential \nconsequences are obviously very great.\n  First of all--although it has been asserted by some to the contrary--\nmany believe it will impede and adversely affect the war against \nterrorism. Why do they believe that? Because the war against terrorism, \nas Brent Scowcroft has pointed out in a number of articles, requires \nthe cooperation of other nations, the broadest possible coalition of \nnations. We need the contributions of their intelligence services. We \nneed their cooperation in tracing and cutting off money that is going \nto fund terrorist activities. We need other nations to help us monitor \nand control the movement of people across frontiers and borders. If the \nUnited States says to the rest of the world that we are just going to \ngo our own way, we will be hard put to turn around and expect a high \ndegree of cooperation and participation when we need it badly. We have \nto work with others. There is no question about that.\n  Efforts are underway at the U.N. now to develop a very strong \nresolution as the basis for sending the inspectors back into Iraq. I \nsupport that effort. I don't understand those who seem to just dismiss \nthe possibility of what the inspectors might accomplish. Others have \nsaid that the inspection system was futile, that Saddam played games \nwith the inspectors and made it impossible for them to see the total \npicture. I don't differ with that. But I want to emphasize that the \ninspectors did a very good job. They discovered and destroyed a lot of \nweaponry, and they very substantially reduced Saddam's capabilities.\n\n  I fail to understand why, if we have the opportunity to send them \nback under terms that will enable them to do their job, we would not \npursue that option before resorting to military force. Why would we not \ndo that? Why would we not explore to the limit the possibility of \nresolving the situation without having to resort to war?\n  Think of the experience of the past fifty-plus years. International \ncooperation has worked brilliantly for the United States for over half \na century. President Truman, President Eisenhower, and their \nsuccessors, faced grave provocations at critical turning points but \nrefrained from taking unilateral military action. There were some who \nargued at the end of World War II that the United States should attack \nthe Soviet Union, at a time when the United States had a nuclear \ncapability and the Soviet Union did not. That argument was rejected, \nrightly, by President Truman.\n  We had the foresight and the wisdom at the time to see the importance \nof cooperative international relationships to protecting our security \nbroadly defined. Our security is not one-dimensional: it encompasses \nmilitary matters, of course, but also economic and political matters. \nThe United States must work in a world environment in which we seek to \nmaximize cooperation. We run great dangers if we proceed unilaterally.\n  This amendment says, in effect, that at the present time the Congress \nis not going to provide an authority for unilateral action. It also \nsays that if the President concludes that such action is necessary, he \ncan come back to the Congress and request the necessary authority. This \nis an effort to support a multilateral effort.\n  Does anyone seriously contest the proposition that if we act in \nconcert with other nations, if the U.S. action has the support of the \ninternational community, then the possibility of turbulence in other \ncountries in the region, with which we have had important longstanding \nrelationships, will be much less, and the support that will come from \nelsewhere in the world will be much greater?\n  Furthermore, consider for a moment the precedent we are setting if we \nadopt this model of unilateral preemptive action.\n  We have worked very hard to try to develop international law in the \nUnited Nations institutions which can check the danger that countries \nwill seek to attack others, but if we assert our right to undertake \npreemptive action on a unilateral basis, act can do a unilateral \npreemption, what will keep other countries from doing the same, and \nusing our action as their justification?\n  A very tense situation exists between India and Pakistan, and in \nother parts of the world. What message do we send by acting \nunilaterally? This is a very important question for us, especially as \nwe are now so powerful.\n  Interestingly enough, the more powerful you are, the more urgent this \nquestion becomes. Stanley Hoffmann has made this point in a very \nthoughtful and provocative article, and I ask unanimous consent the \narticle be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Stanley Hoffmann has pointed out it is precisely the \nmost powerful state that has the greatest interest in links of \nreciprocity, international law, and mutual restraint; that a superpower \nmust take special care not to provoke the united resistance of lesser \npowers. The challenge, and it is a challenge, is to work cooperatively, \nthrough the international institutions. In doing so we join with others \nto register a judgment of the entire international community, and we \ncan then use our strength to carry out this judgment of the \ninternational community, again in cooperation with others. Failure to \ndo that, I think, is fraught with dangers for our continued leadership \nposition in the world.\n  It seems to me the distinction made in this amendment is a critical \none. It reserves to the United States the power to act in self-defense. \nIt provides authority to back a U.N. action and it leaves open, of \ncourse, the possibility of the President's coming back to the Congress \nto request an authority to act unilaterally, which would then enable us \nto assess the circumstances and the consequences under those \ncircumstances of granting such an action.\n  We have an opportunity here to achieve our ends--the destruction of \nthis program of weapons of mass destruction, assuming that is our end--\nwithout resorting to unilateral military action, and I think that is \nthe option we should pursue at this time.\n  As a matter of fact, the authority contained in the underlying \nresolution cites Iraq's violation of all previous U.N. resolutions as a \nbasis for acting. Some of those previous resolutions did not deal with \nthe issue of weapons of mass destruction at all. One dealt with \nviolations of the oil embargo. Another dealt with accounting for \nmissing prisoners of war. Is it intended that we authorize the use of \nmilitary force to achieve the objectives of these and other resolutions \nnot directed to the issue of weapons of mass destruction? I would hope \nnot. But in fact that is precisely what the underlying resolution, the \nWarner-Lieberman resolution, provides, and what the administration \nsupports.\n  I am not going to address the very broad resolution that the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\noriginally sent here. I find it difficult to understand the \nadministration's reasoning in sending such a proposal to the Congress, \ngiven the thinking it represented about the role of the Congress in \nmaking a decision with respect to the use of military force. On a \nmatter as grave and momentous as this, it is a matter of great concern.\n\n  That resolution was apparently written in the White House counsel's \noffice. It was not written at the State Department. It was not written \nby those who have had to deal with these difficult and complex issues. \nIt created such concern when it was first sent to the Hill that efforts \nwere subsequently made to modify it somewhat. But the basic difficulty \nremains: like its predecessor, the revised resolution posits unilateral \nand not multilateral action.\n  I think the United States at this point needs to focus all its \nenergies on acting in concert with the international community to send \na very strong message to Saddam Hussein. That message will be much \nstronger for having the support of the international community and \nrepresenting the judgement of the international community. To those who \nsay, Suppose they don't act? I would respond that we will consider the \nmatter in the light of that circumstance. But the chances are better, I \nthink, that the international community will act through the United \nNations if the U.S. makes its case and calls upon other nations to join \nin the effort.\n  To those who say that by seeking multilateral, U.N. action we are \ngiving the U.N. a veto over the right of the U.S. to use its military \npower to defend itself, I say that is absolutely not the case. Under \ninternational law the inherent right to self-defense is precisely \ndefined and recognized. We seek a U.N. resolution to reflect the \njudgement of the international community, and through that resolution \nwe seek to accomplish our objectives.\n  Congressman Houghton of New York had an interesting statement on the \nfloor of the House last night. He said: The right decision at the wrong \ntime is the wrong decision. I think we should keep that in mind as we \nthink about how the United States ought to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to think through very \ncarefully the implications of a go-it-alone strategy. We need to work \nwith others. We ought to join in a common effort. Other nations can be \nsupportive in numerous ways. Anyone who talks about the situation knows \nthat if force is eventually used against Iraq, there will have to be \nmajor reconstruction afterwards. Everyone acknowledges this. Who will \ndo it? Will the U.S. do it alone? We can hardly draw much comfort from \nwhat we are doing in Afghanistan. We had an amazing, very successful \nmilitary action, and yet we now run the risk of having success turn \ninto failure. Afghanistan is in the very earliest stages of \nreconstruction: its entire infrastructure needs to be rebuilt; the \ncentral government has no effective control of the country and barely \nof the capital. Its elected President Hamid Karzai is a man of great \ncourage. He has asked for continuing international support. He said \nover the weekend:\n\n       I believe the presence of the international forces here \n     should be for as long as the Afghan people need them. The \n     essential thing here is to help Afghanistan stand back on its \n     feet to defend itself and defend against terrorism and \n     radicalism.\n       And then the rest of the world can go and we will be able \n     to manage on our own.''\n\n  International forces are in Afghanistan, and the world has registered \na judgment there. I frankly think the United States could and should be \ndoing more than it currently is to assure the progress of the Afghan \nreconstruction. We have an important stake there, much too important to \nrelegate to a back seat. On the contrary, we must remain focused, to \nmake sure that it is carried through to success.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 6 minutes and 56 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will yield briefly.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. First, I want to say I agree with the Senator totally \nconcerning his comments about Afghanistan, and I hope if the time \ncomes, as I hope and pray it will, that there is a post-Saddam Iraq, we \nwill learn from the mistakes that were made in post-Taliban Afghanistan \nand devote ourselves to broad peacekeeping which will be necessary in \nthe economic and political redevelopment of the country \ninternationally. But my question----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let us keep the focus on the situation in Afghanistan. \nThat chapter is far from finished. We have an opportunity to correct at \nleast some of the mistakes we have made in Afghanistan, but \nunfortunately we are not doing so. The administration is very \nresistant.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In Afghanistan?\n  Mr. SARBANES. In Afghanistan, absolutely.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree with the Senator from Maryland. And, of \ncourse, I agree with his----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If we do not meet our commitments in Afghanistan, what \nlessons will we draw with respect to our obligations in Iraq?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That we must do it in Iraq.\n  Mr. SARBANES. By ourselves? Is it your view that we do not need the \nefforts of the international community alongside our own?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We do, and that is the question. I view the underlying \nresolution I have introduced with Senators Warner, McCain, and Bayh as \nan international resolution. It is all about enforcing the resolutions \nof the United Nations. It acknowledges, appreciates, encourages the \nPresident to go forward at the United Nations, but it is based on the \npremise that if we indicate a willingness to lead, even in leading an \ninternational coalition, to enforce U.N. resolutions if someone \nexercises a veto against doing that at the Security Council, that \nothers will follow. I think the strength in our underlying resolution \nis the best way to guarantee that either through the U.N. or after----\n  Mr. SARBANES. My perception of the underlying resolution is that it \nsays to the world the following: we are here, we want to get this \nresolution, we want to work together, but if you will not do it our \nway, then we are going to do it unilaterally, and in any event we \nassert the right to act unilaterally. It is part and parcel of the new \nstrategic doctrine that has just been announced.\n  For the life of me I do not understand why the administration chose \nthis particular moment to proclaim this doctrine, which obviously \nraises ll sorts of additional red flags about what their intentions \nwith respect to the U.S. role around the world.\n  There is no question that the United States is the most powerful \ncountry in the world. I do not recall the precise figure, but the \nAmerican military budget is more than the sum of I do not know how many \ncountries that follow along behind us. Yes, we have incredible military \nresources and power. We can go around the world and whack anybody we \nchoose. We can brush almost anyone aside.\n  But is that what we want for our nation? Is that the way we choose to \nconduct ourselves? Why would we make such a choice when we have an \nopportunity, if we are smart and skillful and have the underlying \nmilitary strength, to work in a way that brings the rest of the \ninternational community into concert with us?\n  We have an opportunity to help formulate the judgement of the \ninternational community against someone who has clearly violated \ninternational norms and standards, and to have that judgement carried \nout. Why would we not seek to do so?\n  That is the path the Levin proposal lays out. It avoids the downside \nof having the United States asserting a unilateral right as the basis \nfor its action. We should not throw away the opportunity to work \nthrough the United Nations and in concert with others to accomplish our \nobjectives with respect to disarming Iraq, and also to set very \nimportant precedents and standards for the international community in \ndealing with problems of this kind. It is frustrating to think that we \nmight not avail ourselves of this opportunity.\n  What will we say when some other country decides to engage in pre-\nemptive action on a unilateral basis? If we condemn the action, arguing \nthat it aggravates tensions and creates chaos in the international \nworld, the response will be that we have no basis for criticism--if we \ndid it, why should\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nother countries be kept from doing it? What message will our actions \nsend to countries in other parts of the world where tensions run very \nhigh?\n  I close with a plea to my colleagues to recognize the fundamental \ndistinction between unilateral and multilateral action. I ask my \ncolleagues to consider how important it is for our future, in so many \nways--not just in military and security terms, but also for our \neconomic and political and indeed the whole range of our interests--\nthat we seek to work with others and not set out on a path of \nunilateral action. That the U.S. has such great military resources at \nits command makes the decision that much more urgent. It may seem \nparadoxical, as Stanley Hoffman has observed, so powerful a nation \nshould choose to work in concert with other nations rather than through \nwillful imposition of its power on others. But that principle has \nserved our national interests well, and that is where our long-term \ninterests lie.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the American Prospect, Sept. 23, 2002]\n\n                       America Alone in the World\n\n                         (By Stanley Hoffmann)\n\n       The horrors of September 11 confronted the United States \n     with an extraordinary challenge and an extraordinary \n     opportunity. The challenge was to increase our ``homeland \n     security'' by measures that might have averted disaster, had \n     they been implemented before the attacks, and that would \n     minimize the risk of similar assaults in the future. The \n     opportunity was to build on the sympathy and shock of other \n     nations in order to construct a broad coalition against the \n     sort of terrorism the United States had suffered.\n       Alas, it cannot be said that the year was well used. As the \n     great Oxford and Yale historian of war Sir Michael Howard \n     predicted, the notion of a ``war'' on terrorism proved a \n     pernicious one. The very word ``war'' suggests military \n     measures and, of course, victory--rather than the difficult, \n     slow and partly clandestine operations that fighting \n     terrorism entails. So, too, does war allow for suspending or \n     violating citizens' liberties, holding foreigners without due \n     process and resorting to other arbitrary new forms of \n     justice.\n       Moreover, by defining the fight as one against global \n     terrorism--including the supposed axis of evil--President \n     George W. Bush was able to endow his controversial and highly \n     partisan agenda with a heroic dimension. Using his new \n     popularity and his global war, he sought to silence or enlist \n     the opposition. It's not exactly the newest trick in \n     politics. The problem, however, was twofold. Conceptually, \n     global terrorism is the sum of many individual terrorist acts \n     (most of them local) with very different inspirations, \n     dynamics and scopes. One size does not fit all. Indeed, some \n     of our allies against al-Qaeda had been terrorists or had \n     encouraged terrorists in the past--or even the present. \n     Useful as it was against the Taliban, the idea of taking \n     action against not only terrorists but also the states that \n     harbored them posed insoluble political problems with some \n     allies (such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) that had supported \n     terrorism. It also posed problems with democratic countries \n     that had tolerated terrorists on their soil (Germany, Spain \n     and the United States itself).\n       The strategy posed yet another set of problems with nations \n     that used the American war and its rhetoric as a pretext for \n     getting dangerously tougher with their own enemies. These \n     enemies were charged (often correctly) with terrorism, but \n     their circumstances were radically different from those under \n     which Osama bin Laden deployed his rabid theological and \n     anti-Western global network. In the case of Kashmir, the \n     cynical exploitation of the antiterrorist cause put the \n     United States in an embarrassing position, especially given \n     Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf's indispensable \n     role in the assault on Afghanistan. In the case of the \n     Palestinian intifada, the logic of antiterrorism pushed Bush \n     into supporting Ariel Sharon--a stance that shored up Israeli \n     repression and helped justify Sharon's clever policy of \n     destroying the Palestinian Authority while accusing it at \n     once of impotence and of encouraging extremists.\n       By the end of the Clinton era, Palestinian and Israeli \n     negotiators in Taba, Egypt, had been very close to an \n     agreement on all important issues. Indeed, the Israel-\n     Palestine conflicts is one that cannot be resolved without \n     strong American input and pressure. Washington's post-9-11 \n     tilt toward Sharon, however, has rendered the United States \n     ineffectual on this crucial issue--one that many friendly \n     Muslims regard as a test of American goodwill. The ability to \n     resolve the Palestinian issue was one casualty of the \n     relentless anti-terrorism priority. But there were at least \n     two others that Harvard professor and journalist Michael \n     Ignatieff has noted. An administration that had already \n     declared its distaste for ``nation building'' and for \n     humanitarian interventions (except on narrow calculations of \n     national interest) has become even more indifferent toward \n     humanitarian considerations. To be sure, the administration \n     spouts pro-democracy rhetoric. But it views humanitarian \n     concerns as mere distractions from the war on terrorism. \n     Similarly, the concern for human rights that has occasionally \n     animated U.S. foreign policy would have embarrassed or \n     annoyed many of our allies in the war, including Pakistan, \n     Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt. A foreign policy that took \n     human rights seriously might have helped, in the long run, to \n     limit the appeal of terrorism; but human rights are no longer \n     even an ornament of U.S. diplomacy.\n       The coherence and consistency that the war was supposed to \n     lend U.S. foreign policy have not materialized. The attempts \n     to link Saddam Hussein's regime to 9-11 and other terrorist \n     plots have failed; a rational for attacking him and had to be \n     sought elsewhere. The administration is still looking for a \n     convincing one.\n       Iraq's quest for weapons of mass destruction is not unique. \n     But the new doctrine of preventive action against countries \n     that work on acquiring such weapons and are hostile to the \n     United States is very different from other breaches of state \n     sovereignty as sanctioned by modern international law. In the \n     past, collective efforts to curb excessive aggression on the \n     part of sovereign powers have been pursued with the \n     benediction of the United Nations. In the current instance, \n     we risk acting on our own and creating a dangerous moral and \n     political precedent.\n       Deterrence worked well against the Soviet Union, a much \n     more potent and, at one point, malevolent adversary. If \n     applied consistently, energetically and with the support of \n     allies, deterrence could still work against Iraq. Replacing \n     deterrence and collective humanitarian efforts with \n     unilateral, preemptive intervention is a license for chaos. \n     Henry Kissinger's acrobatics in his Washington Post article \n     of Aug. 12, which attempts to reconcile a U.S. doctrine of \n     preventive attack with the notion of world order, can only be \n     described as pitiful.\n       This brings us to the most distressing aspect of the year \n     since 9-11: America's growing isolation in the world. The war \n     against terrorist networks that threaten the United States, \n     its allies and even non-allies such as Russia, cannot be won \n     by the United States alone. For one thing, we need the \n     cooperation of other governments in arresting, trying or \n     delivering to use suspects and possible plotters. And if \n     military action becomes necessary, as it did last year in \n     Afghanistan, we need the participation and endorsement of as \n     many countries as possible. Bush Senior succeeded in \n     obtaining that kind of cooperation in the Gulf War. A \n     coalition is both a help and a constructive source of \n     restraint. For a short while immediately after 9-11, the \n     current Bush administration seemed to understand that it \n     unilateralism was an obstacle. This did not last.\n       Instead, the administration has alienated allies and \n     inflamed adversaries repeatedly over the last year. The \n     multiple, half-baked rationales for action against Iraq have \n     confused and disturbed even old allies such as Germany and \n     Britain. The notion that the United States retains a \n     prerogative to act alone in its own purported interests or \n     those of the whole ``world community'' is clearly \n     incompatible with the UN charter and international law. The \n     self-perception of a unique and benevolent American empire \n     charged with maintaining order in the world irritates \n     allies and adversaries alike. And the oft-expressed \n     contempt for international institutions except those \n     controlled by the United States--the view that only weak \n     powers should be constrained by them or could benefit from \n     them--has alienated and exasperated many of our best \n     friends.\n       The fact is that the United States took the lead in \n     creating these institutions of collective security after \n     1945, precisely when it was the strongest superpower. That \n     generation understood that it is the hegemonic state, \n     paradoxically, that has the greatest interest in links of \n     reciprocity, international law and mutual restraint.\n       Imperial hubris on issues such as the Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty, the Kyoto Protocol and the International \n     Criminal Court have further isolated the United States just \n     when it needs allies most. The administration's case against \n     the court is based on an offensive assumption that a UN \n     institution will necessarily be unfair to the United States--\n     and on an interpretation of the U.S. Constitution that places \n     it above international law. Worse, we have bullied other \n     countries to prevent them from signing or applying the \n     protocol establishing the court.\n       This ``we don't need you'' posture is very risky for the \n     United States, insulting to others and mistakenly based on \n     the premise that others can never really proceed without us. \n     A superpower must take special care not to provoke the united \n     resistance of lesser powers. But the Bush administration \n     fails to appreciate the importance of what Harvard professor \n     Joseph Nye calls America's ``soft power''--a power that \n     emanates from the deep sympathies and vast hopes American \n     society has inspired abroad.\n       The shift from beacon to bully is rife with potential \n     disaster. Because a hegemon cannot rule by force alone, it is \n     vital for the United States to take an interest in other \n     societies and cultures. Since 9-11, that interest has grown \n     only with regard to Islam and terrorism. But an American \n     foreign policy guided exclusively by narrow self-interest is \n     not one our allies find terribly reassuring; and it is \n     downright offensive to assert that the United States alone \n     can decide what is good for others.\n       Particularly frightening to outside observers is the \n     impression that U.S. foreign policy has been captured by a \n     small group of hawks\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\n     who, frustrated in 1991, are now ideologically committed to \n     changing ``evil'' regimes--even in countries that have no \n     past experience of democracy and where repressive regimes \n     face no experienced or cohesive opposition. There were \n     comparable fears after the election of Ronald Reagan, but \n     divisions within his administration preserved a kind of \n     balance. Today's pragmatists are singularly weak and seem to \n     lack the president's ear.\n       Bush continually describes himself as a patient man who \n     will consult and listen. Let us hope that he means what he \n     says and isn't just trying to prevent a real debate until all \n     the important decisions have been made. Because one year \n     after 9-11, three things are clear: First, the war against \n     terrorism cannot be the alpha and omega of a foreign policy; \n     second, it cannot be waged by military means alone; and \n     finally, even a state endowed with overwhelming superiority \n     in all the ingredients of ``hard'' force cannot substitute \n     that for eyes, ears and brains. Decisions based on dubious \n     assumptions, overconfidence and intelligence reports risk \n     ending in imprudence and fiasco.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the American people need and deserve a \nthorough, reasoned discussion on the question of going to war against \nIraq. I appreciate the opportunity to share with my colleagues my \nthoughts during this momentous debate.\n  A great deal of the justification for a United States military \nintervention in Iraq centers on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. I \nrecognize that there are international criminals capable of unspeakable \nhorrors and Saddam Hussein is one of those. President Bush has urged us \nto believe the threat from Saddam Hussein is urgent and immediate, and \nthus this impending vote. I have listened carefully to every shred of \nevidence presented by the administration.\n  And I have also listened carefully to other world leaders. Of \nparticular concern to me is the position of those nations that share a \nborder with Iraq--Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and \nIran.\n  The Turkish Prime Minister said, ``We're trying to dissuade the \nAmerican Administration from a military operation.''\n  King Abdullah of Jordan said, ``In all the years I have been in the \ninternational community, everybody is saying this is a bad idea. Our \nconcern is . . . that a miscalculation in Iraq would throw the whole \narea into turmoil.''\n  The Kuwaiti Defense Minister said, ``Kuwait will participate in the \nmilitary campaign to remove the Iraqi regime only if the military \naction came in compliance with a United Nations' resolution.'' This in \nKuwait, a country that suffered greatly under the hands of the Iraqi \ndictator. These nations share a border with Iraq. Their leaders know \ntheir neighborhood and they have expressed their opposition to our \nintervention at this time.\n  I would also like to quote President Mubarak of Egypt who said, ``If \nyou strike Iraq . . . not one Arab leader will be able to control the \nangry outburst of the masses.'' And President Mussharaf of Pakistan \nsaid, ``this will have very negative repercussions around the Islamic \nworld.'' I believe it is wise to heed the concerns of our friends. And \nour friends are telling us that we are ratcheting up the hatred.\n  In two nations' recent elections the defining issues seemingly \nrevolved around American arrogance. The fact that the two countries are \nour friends, Germany and Brazil, is alarming.\n  What Congress does this week and next will have very serious \nimplications throughout the world.\n  Demagogues in the Middle East and elsewhere are surely ready and \nwilling to exploit a U.S. invasion of Iraq. And today the CIA is \nwarning Americans of the connection between a rise in terrorism and \nmilitary activity in Iraq. Certainly it is preferable to address the \nthreat posed by any international criminal in concert with our allies \nand within the confines of the United Nations. This is the preference \noutlined in the amendment offered by Senator Levin--an amendment I \nsupport.\n  We need to provide people susceptible to anti-Americanism with a \npositive message that respects international cooperation and \nfriendship. The Levin substitute upholds the values I have heard in \ndiscussions with the people of Rhode Island; it recognizes the benefit \nof an international coalition in taking on the tremendous challenge of \ndisarming the Iraqi regime. It authorizes military force against Iraq \nonly as part of a new UN-approved resolution, and failing that, allows \nCongress to return to session to consider an alternative approach.\n  As a nation, we are united in opposing the tyranny and repression of \nSaddam Hussein. But there are real disagreements both here at home and \nabroad as to how best to ensure that this man cannot threaten world \npeace. Adoption of the Levin amendment would not give Saddam Hussein a \nchance to further obstruct and delay--it is the prudent idea most \nconsistent with the values that have made the United States a great \nnation. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas is recognized for 25 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased this evening to rise in \nstrong support of the underlying resolution. I am pleased this \nbipartisan resolution Senators Lieberman and McCain and Senator Warner \nhave introduced is before the Senate. I am pleased to be able to \ncosponsor that. I believe after a full debate, the Senate will pass \nthis resolution in its current version, and I urge it to do that.\n  The decision to authorize the use of force is a very serious, grave \ndecision. I will further acknowledge that some Members of Congress, men \nand women of good conscience, have very significant concerns about this \nresolution. They have been articulated well. They have been argued \nwell. I also acknowledge that when we take a vote on anything that \ndeals with war and peace and life and death, that it must be done in \nthe most sober and serious manner. I have had a number of moms and dads \nwho have come to me concerned about what this might mean for their \nchildren, their young men and women who may face war. I see the tears \nin their eyes. I have heard their anxieties and worries. I approach \nthis with a great deal of serious contemplation and prayer.\n  However, I believe this resolution is not only warranted but \nnecessary in order to protect our Nation. We are rapidly reaching a \npoint at which the risk of utilizing military force is far outweighed \nby the danger that Saddam Hussein poses to the American people. I have \nheard that we are setting a dangerous precedent. There are concerns \nabout what this new strategic policy might mean, and how other nations \nmight interpret it.\n  I respond, with all respect, the case of Saddam Hussein, the case of \nIraq, is in every way unique. It is unique in law because here is a man \nand here is a nation that has stood now for a decade in defiance of the \nworld community; that is in violation and defiance of resolution after \nresolution from the United Nations. They are, as they have rightly been \ncalled this evening, an international outlaw. How is it that enforcing \nthe resolutions of the United Nations, and in doing so defend our \nNation, set a dangerous precedent?\n  Not only is Iraq in violation of resolutions, and in defiance of the \ncivilized world, but Iraq is also unique in the threat it poses to the \ncivilized world in amassing weapons of mass destruction.\n  It is not at all that the United States is some kind of international \nbully wanting to throw its weight around the world. It is, rather, we \nare the one Nation in the world that is capable of doing something \nabout this threat to the civilized world. Not only do we have the \nability to do it, but we have the will to do it.\n  The President has come to Congress as he was asked. He believed, I \nbelieve, that he had the legal authority already from previous \nresolutions from this Congress to have acted without coming to us. But \nCongress said: We want to be involved in this, we want to be consulted. \nSo he came to Congress and laid out his case.\n  Administration officials have appeared before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Briefings \nhave been provided for all Senators. Certainly, this issue has been a \nmatter of public discourse now for months.\n  It is time now for this distinguished body to act. As we continue \ndebate on this resolution, we must remember this debate is not about \narms inspectors, it is not primarily about United Nations resolutions, \nand it is not about assuaging the international community. History has \nnot looked well upon those\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\nwho fail to act for fear of provoking a tyrant.\n\n  What this debate is about is the protection of the American people, \nthe protection of our national security. The best way for the Senate to \ndo that is to provide the President with the authority he has \nrequested.\n  It is helpful to recount what has brought us to this point, to the \nbrink of being forced to use military force. For over a decade, the \nUnited States has pursued diplomatic and economic avenues to deal with \nthe threat that Saddam Hussein poses.\n  We have tried to contain, we have tried to deter. But in truth, we \nhave been in a virtually unbroken state of conflict with Iraq since the \nbeginning of the gulf war in 1991. After the American military along \nwith coalition allies routed the Iraqi military, the international \ncommunity pledged to ensure that Saddam Hussein would never have the \ncapability to threaten the region again.\n  Toward that end, the United Nations Security Council passed \nResolution 687. This resolution, which Iraq accepted as part of the \ncease-fire, required Iraq to end its pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction, destroy its stockpile of chemical and biological weapons, \nand end its support of terrorism.\n  As we convene this evening, more than a decade later, Saddam Hussein \nstands in violation of this agreement in virtually every point. To \nensure that Iraq was complying with its commitments, the United Nations \nestablished a weapons inspection program. In recent times, there has \nbeen a great deal of discussion about the inspectors. Forgotten in the \ndebate is the original purpose of the inspectors. Inspections were only \nsupposed to confirm that Iraq was living up to its commitment to cease \nthe development of weapons of mass destruction. Inspectors were not \nsent in to play a cat-and-mouse game. Saddam Hussein used every means \nat his disposal to thwart the inspections.\n  In the past decade, Iraq has stood in violation of 16 different \nresolutions. The world community has spoken strongly and frequently \nagainst Saddam Hussein. Saddam's response has been continual deception \nand defiance. Saddam Hussein has made every attempt to accelerate his \ndevelopment of weapons, biological and nuclear weapons.\n  Based on intelligence we have a very frightening picture of Iraq's \ncapabilities. We have had the briefings. I had the most recent briefing \nthis afternoon. We have solid information, public information, that \nIraq currently has a large stockpile of chemical weapons. In the \ninitial aftermath of the gulf war, the U.N. inspectors were able to \nensure that some chemical weapons were destroyed. A disturbing amount \nwere not uncovered. In fact, 31,600 chemical munitions, 550 mustard gas \nbombs, and 4,000 tons of chemical precursors were unaccounted for by \nthe U.N. inspectors. Even more disturbing is the likelihood that Iraq \nretained the means to produce chemical weapons. The U.N. has stated \nIraq has imported enough raw materials to produce 200 tons of the VX \ngas.\n  Since inspectors were ejected from Iraq in 1998, there is a \nsubstantial body of evidence that Saddam Hussein has reconstituted his \nability to produce VX and other chemical weapons. People question \nwhether there is an imminent threat? People question the currency of \nthe threat that faces us? They think we have time to burn? Time to \ndelay? Perhaps even more terrifying, Iraq continued virtually unabated \nto produce biological weapons. Senator Frist spoke of this earlier \ntoday. In fact, the Iraqi Government has admitted in the past to the \nweaponization of anthrax, botulism, and aflatoxin on Scuds and on \naircraft.\n  United Nations inspectors never accounted for at least 4 tons of raw \nmaterial that can be used to produce biological weapons. Recent reports \nare that the Iraqis are testing unmanned vehicles that could be used to \ndeliver these weapons over wide territories.\n  I am told these unmanned vehicles would be almost impossible to be \ndetected or to be shot down.\n  We also have reason to believe that Saddam Hussein has developed \nmobile biological weapon laboratories that would be virtually \nimpossible for inspectors, were they to get back in, to detect, to \nlocate, and to destroy.\n  In this debate, it is important that we have an appreciation for the \nterrible power of these kinds of weapons. VX nerve gas is one of the \nmost dangerous chemicals known to man. It operates by cutting off a \nperson's nervous system, making it impossible for them to breath. \nExposure to only a few drops can kill in minutes.\n  The danger of anthrax was made shockingly clear during last year's \nattacks. Over 20 Americans were infected, and 7 were killed, and it \ncould have been much, much worse. The letter that was sent to Senator \nLeahy's office contained enough spores to kill tens of thousands of \npeople, in one single envelop. There is every indication that Saddam \nHussein has enough anthrax to kill millions of Americans.\n  Iraq has accelerated work on its missile development program. In \nfact, some of his chemical and biological weapons are deployable with \n45 minutes warning.\n  According to the dossier recently released by the British Government, \nIraq currently has ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel, \nTurkey, and Saudi Arabia. He is actively working to extend the range of \nhis armaments, with the ambition of being able to strike as far as \nEurope in the coming years.\n  Even with his success in developing chemical and biological weapons, \nSaddam Hussein continues to pursue the ultimate weapon of mass \ndestruction . . . a nuclear bomb.\n  He has scoured the world attempting to procure enriched uranium to \nfinalize his development of a nuclear weapon. Estimates are that, \nshould Iraq be successful in getting this material, a nuclear weapon \nwould take no longer than a few months to produce. We can't be sure he \nhasn't succeeded already.\n\n  It is evident that Saddam Hussein has the capabilities to inflict \ngreat devastation. His intentions are even clearer.\n  His hatred of the United States is only matched by his hunger for \npower. The Iraqi Government has repressed its own people, committed \nacts of aggression against its neighbors, and been an active supporter \nof international terrorism. In a very unstable region, Saddam Hussein \nhas taken every opportunity to add to the turmoil in the Middle East.\n  He has plotted to assassinate a former U.S. President. In 1993, the \nIraqi Government plotted to kill former President George Bush during \nhis trip to Kuwait.\n  American pilots are taking fire from the Iraqi military virtually \nevery day during patrols of the no-fly zones. Unprovoked? Hardly. It \ndoes not set a dangerous precedent to act in a preemptive way in light \nof his violations of international law and his continual firing upon \nAmerican aircraft.\n  So far this year, American and British aircraft have been fired on \nover 406 times. In the past 2 weeks alone they have been fired on over \n60 times.\n  Until his recent death, Iraq harbored Abu Nidal, who masterminded \nterrorist attacks in 20 countries, resulting in the deaths of 900 \npeople.\n  There are credible reports that members of al-Qaida have found \nsanctuary in Iraq. It is becoming increasingly clear that Iraq has \nprovided training to al-Qaida, including instruction on the use of \nchemical weapons.\n  Earlier this year, Saddam Hussein offered $25,000 to each of the \nfamilies of Palestinian suicide bombers. The only condition is that the \nbomber has a full belt of explosives when he blows himself up. This \ndespicable offer essentially provides a bounty for the deaths of \ninnocent Israelis and establishes a perverse incentive program for \nterror.\n  His invasion of Kuwait is well-documented. However, I would like to \ntake a moment to discuss the atrocities he has committed against his \nown people. I believe that it will shed further light on the horrors of \nwhich Saddam is capable.\n  The U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the U.N. General Assembly has \nissued a report criticizing ``systematic, widespread, and extremely \ngrave violations of human rights,'' and cited ``all-pervasive \nrepression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and \nwidespread terror.''\n  That is the diplomatic language of the U.N. Commission on Human \nRights.\n  In ``The Threatening Storm,'' Kenneth Pollack puts it a little \nplainer. He said:\n\n       This is a regime that will gouge out the eyes of children \n     to force confessions from\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\n     their parents and grandparents. This is a regime that will \n     crush all of the bones in the feet of a two-year-old girl to \n     force her mother to divulge her father's whereabouts. This is \n     a regime that will hold a nursing baby at arm's length from \n     his mother and allow the child to starve to death to force \n     the mother to confess. This is a regime that will burn a \n     person's limbs off to force him to confess or comply. This is \n     a regime that will slowly lower its victim into huge vats of \n     acid either to break their will or simply as a means of \n     execution. This is a regime that applies electric shocks to \n     the body of the victims, particularly their genitals, with \n     great creativity. This is a regime that in 2000 decreed that \n     the crime of criticizing the regime, which can be as harmless \n     as suggesting Saddam's clothing would not be matched, would \n     be punished by cutting off the offender's tongue.\n\n  And on and on it goes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this citation from ``The Threatening \nStorm'' by Kenneth Pollack be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This is a regime that will gouge out the eyes of children \n     to force confessions from their parents and grandparents. \n     This is a regime that will crush all of the bones in the feet \n     of a two-year-old girl to force her mother to divulge her \n     father's whereabouts. This is a regime that will hold a \n     nursing baby at arm's length from its mother and allow the \n     child to starve to death to force the mother to confess. This \n     is a regime that will burn a person's limbs off to force him \n     to confess or comply. This is a regime that will slowly lower \n     its victims into huge vats of acid, either to break their \n     will or simply as a means of execution. This is a regime that \n     applies electric shocks to the bodies of its victims, \n     particularly their genitals, with great creativity. This is a \n     regime that in 2000 decreed that the crime of criticizing the \n     regime (which can be as harmless as suggesting that Saddam's \n     clothing does not match) would be punished by cutting out the \n     offenders tongue. This is a regime that practices systematic \n     rape against its female victims. This is a regime that will \n     drag a man's wife, daughter, or other female relative and \n     repeatedly rape her in front of him. This is a regime that \n     will force a white-hot metal rod into a person's anus or \n     other orifices. This is a regime that employs thalium \n     poisoning, widely considered one of the most excruciating \n     ways to die. This is a regime that will behead a young mother \n     in the street in front of her house and children because her \n     husband was suspected of opposing the regime. This is a \n     regime that used chemical warfare on its own Kurdish \n     citizens--not just on the fifteen thousand killed and maimed \n     at Halabja but on scores of other villages all across \n     Kurdistan. This is a regime that tested chemical and \n     biological warfare agents on Iranian prisoners of war, using \n     the POWs in controlled experiments to determine the best ways \n     to disperse the agents to inflict the greatest damage.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, freedom of speech does not exist in \nIraq, and summary executions are commonplace.\n  Torture is seen as a legitimate tool of control, and violence against \nwomen is not just condoned but perpetrated by the Iraqi government.\n  Political opponents of Saddam Hussein are subject to unimaginable \ncruelty. They are jailed without cause. Amnesty International reports \n``Detainees have been threatened with bringing in a female relative, \nespecially the wife or the mother, and raping her in front of the \ndetainee. Some of these threats have been carried out.''\n  In 1997, the UN reported that Iraq executed more than 1,500 people \nfor political reasons. There are even reports that the victims families \nare forced to pay the cost of the execution.\n  Saddam stays in power through fear. It is terror--sheer terror--that \nsustains his evil regime.\n  Saddam Hussein has never been called to account for the Kuwaitis that \nare still missing from the Gulf War. There are still 609 cases of \nmissing Gulf War POW/MIAs.\n  Included in that number is one American Navy Pilot. The Iraqi \ngovernment continues to refuse to provide full information about his \nfate.\n  The passage of this resolution will provide the President with \nauthority he requires in order to address the grave threat posed by \nIraq.\n  I fully support his efforts to rally the international community, and \nbelieve that a strong vote on this resolution will strengthen his case \nbefore the United Nations.\n  It is the hope of all of us that military action will not be \nnecessary. However, after a full decade of effort, we have almost \ncompletely exhausted diplomacy.\n  There are some who believe that preemptive military action against \nIraq represents a break from our nation's traditions.\n  My colleagues, unfortunately, we are facing untraditional threats. We \nhave tried containment. It was built upon the idea of inspection and \nsanction. The inspectors were thrown out, and the sanctions have been \nbroken.\n  Again, from Kenneth Pollack and from ``The Threatening Storm,'' he \nsays:\n\n       Unfortunately, it is difficult to know exactly what is \n     going into Iraq. This is the main problem; if the United \n     States and United Nations knew, they might be able to stop \n     it. As it is, we know only that between the smuggling and \n     the surcharges Saddam is making $2 billion to $3 billion \n     per year that he can spend as he likes. In addition, we \n     have been able to intercept some shipments and get \n     intelligence on others that give at least a sense of what \n     Saddam is using his illegal revenues to import. For \n     instance, in June 2002, the Indian government brought \n     charges against the executives of an Indian company for \n     selling atomized aluminum powder and titanium engine parts \n     to Iraq in such quantity and of such quality that India's \n     Defense and Research Development Organization concluded \n     they could only have been intended for chemical warfare \n     and ballistic missile production.\n  We tried inspections. The sanctions have been eroded, and deterrence \nonly works with a rational person. It assumes rationality. And the fact \nthat he can transmit weapons of mass destruction to terrorists who \ncould inflict enormous damage upon the United States with no \nfingerprints--with Saddam's fingerprints not even being on it--is \nevidence that the idea of containment to no longer be a workable \napproach.\n  The attacks of 9/11 tore our hearts and left us with a grief that \nwill never be forgotten. At the same time, those acts of evil have \nbrought forth a new resolve and a new commitment.\n  It is the responsibility of the U.S. Government, and it is the \nresponsibility of this Senate to ensure that the heartbreak of \nSeptember 11 is not repeated.\n  Our enemies have grown more cunning and their methods more sinister. \nWe must move swiftly and decisively to deny them the opportunity to \nattack us. When the threat is real, preemption is not just tactically \ncritical, but, I believe, it is a moral imperative.\n  In Saddam Hussein we are facing a menace that has long expressed \nhatred of the United States, established links to international \nterrorists, and has amassed large stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction. He has been accorded every opportunity to cooperate with \nthe international community, and he has refused.\n  Every day that goes by, the threat grows. He continues to amass his \nstockpile and strengthens his ties to terrorists. We cannot--we must \nnot--stand by and allow this to continue. And we must not delay. There \nhave been many people quoted in this debate, so let me add one more to \nthe record. Winston Churchill said:\n\n       There is no merit in putting off a war for a year if, when \n     it comes, it is a far worse war or one much harder to win.\n\n  The world is watching us. And freedom-loving people across the globe \nare waiting to see if America will answer the challenge that history \nhas put before us. They are waiting to see if our Nation will assume \nthe mantle of leadership in dealing with a tyrant with maniacal \nambitions.\n  Our enemies are hoping we falter. They hope we will continue to be \nmired in the web of deception spun by Saddam Hussein. They need to be \nshown that our resolve to protect the American people has never been \nstronger.\n  While my greatest hope is that military action will not be necessary, \nit may be unavoidable. Others have come to this floor to talk about the \ncost of such an operation. They rightly cite estimates ranging in the \ntens of billions of dollars. Some may discuss the damage that might be \ndone to our relationships with other nations. More gravely, some have \nspoken about the cost of human life that any military action would \nentail. These risks are real, but these risks must be weighed against \nthe very real risks of delay.\n  The price of inaction is far too high. Mr. President, 9/11 taught us \nthat. We will never know the complete economic damage of the terrorist \nattacks of last year. Some have estimated it at more than $600 billion, \nbut the true cost can only be seen by looking in the eyes of\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nthose who lost loved ones. The true impact is only realized with the \nunderstanding that over 3,000 families are still grieving.\n  Saddam Hussein has the capacity to wreak even more destruction than \nthat which we saw last year. He has weapons that could kill millions, \nand he consorts with terrorists who would unflinchingly do so if they \nhad the means.\n  So again, I remind you, opponents say this resolution sets a \ndangerous precedent of preemption. I remind my colleagues of sixteen \nU.N. resolutions defied, rejected, ignored by Saddam Hussein. The \ndangerous action would be to do nothing. The dangerous precedent would \nbe to back down in the face of a tyrant who dares us.\n  The resolution put forth by Senator Lieberman, and endorsed by our \nPresident, is a statement by this body that the risk posed by Iraq is \nunacceptable. It is a statement that we will not allow international \noutlaws to threaten our Nation. It is a statement that we will not sit \nback in the face of the growing danger that our country faces.\n  Thus, I call on my colleagues for their support of S.J. Res. 46.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. REED). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized under the previous order for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, for an excellent presentation covering all the points. \nAnd if I had not been persuaded before I listened to him tonight, I \nwould have been persuaded tonight.\n  This Nation has spent many dollars and many lives in defense of \nothers around the world. Tonight, we are considering a resolution that \nhas to do with the defense of ourselves.\n  People say that because our country does not go against another \ncountry without provocation that we should make the case of the need to \ntake action, and that is true. We need to make that case before the \nworld and before the American people.\n  I believe that case has been made. It is a case that has been made \nupon, basically, facts we have known for a long time and have chosen to \nignore and sweep under the rug. It is based on a shared history that we \nhave had together now for many years. And looking back on it, we must \nask ourselves, How were we able to ignore what is so obvious and \npending for so long?\n  We know Saddam's willingness to attack sovereign nations. We know \nSaddam's willingness to murder innocent individuals. We know he is in \npossession of weapons of mass destruction. We know he is developing \nmissile capability that is beyond what is allowable by the United \nNations resolutions and will rapidly be able to reach further and \nfurther. The only thing we do not know is how soon it is going to take \nhim to develop nuclear weapons.\n  I think that is essentially, from a factual standpoint, what this \nentire debate is about, because if, in fact, it is true that he, in the \nforeseeable future, will have nuclear weapons, do any of these other \npoints that we have been discussing really stand?\n  I think I have listened to many valid points and valid arguments of \nproblems connected with moving against Saddam Hussein. I think the \npoints that were made that the aftermath is going to be very difficult \nare very valid. I think the point that he might lash back against us in \nsome way is a very valid concern. I think the point that in some places \nin the world they will be taking to the streets against us is a valid \nconsiderations.\n  But if, in fact, it is true that in the foreseeable future he might \nor probably will develop nuclear weapons of mass destruction, do any of \nthese other considerations really stand up or do they together stand up \nto that consideration? Can we afford not to defend ourselves against \nthat consideration?\n  What is the evidence pertaining to that? We are debating, again, not \nover whether or not he is going to have it, but how soon he is going to \nhave it.\n  Unfortunately, when we have made estimates in times past with regard \nto Saddam's nuclear capability in the early 1990s, with regard to \nmissile capabilities of rogue nations, when we have gone back and \nthoroughly examined the situation--where, in Saddam's case, we have \ngotten inspectors in there because of defectors' information--we have \nfound that we have grossly underestimated the capability of our \nadversaries, time and time again.\n  Yet we are told by the entire world, those who have looked at this, \nthat it is just a matter of time, a few years, if he has to develop his \nown fissile material, and perhaps as early as a few months or a year if \nhe can buy it on the open market.\n  I was privileged to listen to some of the weapons inspectors who went \ndown to Iraq. I listened to some of the experiences they had. It caused \nme great concern to hear their lament about the way they were thwarted \nbefore and how hopeless their mission turned out to be because of what \nSaddam was doing, and how inspections in the future really will not \nwork unless you actually get active cooperation from the people you are \ninspecting. I am talking about a country, what, the size of California, \nwith an ability to hide anything almost anywhere.\n  And they talked about the fact that when they went in before, they \ndid not think Saddam had much in the way of nuclear. And they even were \nalmost to the point of being able to certify that when a defector gave \nthem some information. They went back. They found that not only had \nSaddam developed nuclear infrastructure, but he had a virtual \n``Manhattan Project'' is the way they put it, a virtual ``Nuclear \nManhattan Project'' when they went in there before.\n  They said they had a facility there that was based on the facility \ndown in Tennessee in Oak Ridge in terms of enriching uranium.\n  This is what was there before. We do not know what he has now because \nhe has made the decision to keep out inspectors. And we know from the \nCIA--a letter has been introduced in this Record--that the likelihood \nof Saddam using weapons of mass destruction for blackmail, deterrence, \nor otherwise grows as his arsenal builds.\n  Now he has been down there for 4 years. We know he has the science. \nWe know he has the know-how. We know he has the scientists. We know he \nhas the desire. We know he has a history of knowing how to build \nfacilities that will ultimately produce results for him. And we are \nstanding here debating as to whether or not we should do something \nabout that because we might have a little more time and we don't have \neyewitness testimony as to precisely where he is at precisely this \nparticular time.\n  Those are things that have been on the record along with his \nviolation of U.N. demands for many years. We have taken them for \ngranted. We have taken for granted that hundreds of times our airmen \nhave been shot at in the no-fly zone during all of this time. I have \nalways wondered what the parents of someone shot down under those \ncircumstances must feel like, being that far away, defending the \ninterests of your country. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about \nit. Nobody seemingly cares that much about it. That has been going on \ncontinually ever since we left the gulf.\n  These are things that are on the public record. They have been on the \npublic record for a long time. We now have some additional facts that \nhave not been on the public record that long, such as the fact he is \nbusily trying to obtain dual-use equipment that can be used for uranium \nenrichment.\n  We know more about his relationship with al-Qaida than we knew in \ntimes past.\n  Again, according to the CIA director:\n\n       We have solid reporting of senior level contacts between \n     Iraq and al-Qaida going back a decade.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qaida have \n     discussed safe havens and reciprocal nonaggression.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Since Operation Enduring Freedom, we have solid evidence of \n     the presence in Iraq of al-Qaida members, including some that \n     have been in Baghdad.\n\n  He goes further and says:\n\n       We have credible reporting that al-Qaida leaders sought \n     contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire [weapons of mass \n     destruction] capabilities. The reporting also stated that \n     Iraq has provided training to al-Qaida members in the areas \n     of poison and gases and making conventional bombs.\n\n  These are recent things that are not as well known, have not been \nknown over the years. Put all of that information together and you have \na consensus on many things. As usual, we are\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nspending a lot of time arguing over the things we disagree on. They are \nimportant. But I think we all agree the leader of Iraq is dangerous; \nthat he is a threat; that that threat is growing, not diminishing; and \nthat he is in violation of international law.\n  The real issue is whether or not it is going to be easier to deal \nwith this situation once he gets stronger than he is today. The \nquestion answers itself.\n  The other question is whether or not we will show a reluctance to \ndefend our own interests. We are rightfully concerned about acting \nprecipitously. But did we act precipitously after the first World Trade \nCenter bombing? Did we act precipitously after our men and women were \nkilled in the Khobar Towers bombing? What was the message we sent after \nour two embassies were bombed and hundreds of people were killed? Were \nwe acting precipitously after that? What did we do to avenge that or to \nset an example? What did we do after the Cole incident? Were we acting \nprecipitously there? Or have we announced to the world, basically, or \nled Osama bin Laden to believe that we can be attacked that the \nresponse will not be commensurate with the attack? That is Osama bin \nLaden. We are talking about Saddam Hussein here, but the lesson is the \nsame for tyrants throughout the world who pose a threat to this \ncountry. It has been a bad lesson that we have given for well over a \ndecade now.\n\n  Some say we should wait until there is an imminent danger; that we \nshould calibrate carefully as to when that danger we know is growing \nbecomes imminent; that we should tell Saddam Hussein on the front end \nwe will not attack him until we know he poses not only a danger but an \nimminent threat. That, of course, is basically consistent with the \nUnited Nations charter. It has been the law of nations for a long time. \nWe have to recognize that. The Treaty of Westphalia was mentioned, back \nin the 1600s, where the sovereign nations got together and decided that \nsovereign nations would not be attacked. We have perfected that \nsomewhat.\n  We have talked about imminent danger because traditionally we lived \nin a world where armies amassed on a border and that was the imminent \ndanger. September 11 changed all that. That is not the kind of world we \nlive in anymore. The imminent danger facing this country now does not \namass itself on the border and give everybody time to debate and make \nup their minds as to what they are going to do. The threats we face \ntoday hide their activities. The threats we face today are not always \napparent.\n  Let there be no mistake about it, the United States is the target. It \nis the primary target. No one likes the sound of the word \nunilateralism. But is there anyone who disagrees with the action the \nIsraelis took in 1981, when they took out the Osiraq nuclear plant in \nIraq? I am really curious. There is a case of unilateralism if there \never was one. Was there any imminent threat? I don't even know if the \nplant was finished yet. But either way, there was no imminent threat \nthat I know of that they were getting ready to produce material out of \nthere to put in a bomb to attack Israel.\n  They took it out. The United Nations condemned them. We condemned \nthem. But is there anyone today who is really regretful the Israelis \ntook that action?\n  I would think under that theory, if we had to wait for imminent \ndanger, we would have to ask ourselves, imminent with regard to our \nallies, would that count? With regard to our troops in the area, would \nthat count? With regard to the homeland only? Those would be questions \nwe would have to ask.\n  We would have to ask ourselves: Does that not mean, under the \nphilosophy of waiting for the imminent threat, we would have to wait \nnot only until we had ironclad proof Saddam had nuclear capability and \nthe means to deliver it, but that he was planning on actually hitting \nus with it? I don't think we have thought that fully through. Surely \nthat is not what we are suggesting, that we almost have to have a \nmissile in the air before we could act.\n  It is somewhat of a precedent. It would be, if it comes to that. But \nwe are in a position no other country has ever been in, as the Senator \nfrom Arkansas pointed out. We are living in a world no one has ever \nlived in before, where a handful of people can take modern technology \nand create a mortal threat to millions of people on the other side of \nthe world. We simply have to address the fact that is the world we live \nin.\n  Some say we should wait on the United Nations. That essentially goes \nto the heart of the amendment we are considering. I respectfully \nsuggest if we pass this amendment, it would be a guarantee the United \nNations would never act, because they would know they didn't have to. \nAnd so many who would rather avoid this because the United States is \nthe target, and for other reasons, would never, ever face up to it, if \nthey knew they didn't have to. Then I would ask: Where would we be? \nSome say, come back to the Senate in that weakened condition.\n  Would we be in better shape having been turned down by the U.N. if we \nthen went ahead in contravention of what they said or would it be \nbetter to stand tall on the front end, with the assurance that many \ncountries in the United Nations are going to support us in our effort?\n  The President has gone there and he has made the case. He has talked \nto our allies. The Secretary of State has been busy around the world. \nWhen people say we are going it alone, do not the British count? Does \nnot Spain count? Does not Italy count? Do not the Arab nations I read \nabout today in the paper, who are reluctantly coming along, count?\n  I think we should go back and look at where former President Bush was \nat this stage of the proceedings. I think the first thing that happened \nthere was he said this will not stand. Then he went internationally, \nand then the British came first, and then there was a period of time \nbefore very many people came forward after the British.\n  Speaking of the British, I think it is ironic that the head of that \ngovernment, in many respects, sees things more clearly than many of us \ndo.\n  The problem--as difficult as it is to acknowledge, but it is the \nplain truth--is we have lost the coalition we had before. We would like \nto go right back and say: Remember how we were together before, and \nremember how we made such progress, military progress, and there for a \nwhile we had Saddam Hussein on the ropes and we laid down all these \nrequirements. In order for us to go home, he had to make all these \nagreements, and he did make those agreements. Remember how we were \ntogether then before he violated each and every one of them, and \ngradually, year by year, we not only allowed that to happen, but one \nally after another started doing business with him. We are now asked to \ngo before a Security Council containing the country of China, which is \nnow furnishing fiberoptics communications systems to Saddam to help \nshoot our airplanes down. Are they the ones we are supposed to ask \npermission to defend our self-interests?\n  We are looking at a Security Council with our friends, the Russians \nand the French, who want to do business with Saddam, and Saddam owes \nthem money and they want that money back. Sure, the Arabs are kind of \nreluctant right now. And we are dealing with our now German friends who \nare led by an individual who will demagog his way to reelection on the \nbacks of our country and, presumably, international relations.\n  It is not an easy thing to say, but it is a true thing to say. We \nwant our friends, our allies, and especially our NATO partners; but as \nthey continue to let their defense budgets slide and the American \ntaxpayer continues to have to foot the bill for the free world, \nessentially, should they be given a veto when our interests are so \ndirectly involved? I think not.\n  I think we have to learn the lessons of the past, as difficult as it \nis. My friend from Arkansas mentioned Churchill. They didn't listen to \nChurchill after World War I. The result of their not listening to him \nwas called World War II. Back when Hitler was on the move everything he \ndid was not sufficient in and of itself to act. The allies thought they \ncould always act later, and other countries should do other things--\nexcuse after excuse.\n  That is not the message we want to send this time, Mr. President. I \nthink it is clear that strength is the only hope we have for peace, and \nif we cannot have peace, we must do what is in the vital interest of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to address the \nPresident's request for authority for military action in Iraq. I have \nspent weeks thinking about this issue and listening. I have sat across \nthe table from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor \nRice, Governor Ridge, CIA Director Tenet, FBI Director Mueller, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, and Vice President Cheney. I have \nlistened closely to the President's speeches and I have listened openly \nto the many questions my constituents have raised over the past few \nweeks.\n  Mr. President, I understand the consequences of war and I don't \nshrink from them. My father was among the first to land on Okinawa as a \nGI. Growing up, we always knew that our country may need to project \nforce to defend our freedoms. I know we have high obligations to the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces who undertake the hard work of \nsecuring our freedom. In college, I volunteered at the Seattle Veterans \nHospital. Most of the patients were young men, my age, who had returned \nfrom Vietnam. I carry that experience with me as the first woman on the \nSenate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n  When I look at decisions like this one, I take the time to consider \nall sides, with the full knowledge this decision will have serious \nconsequences for our country, our world, and our future.\n  This evening, I want to share with my colleagues and my constituents \nmy thoughts and my decision on this difficult issue. But most of all, I \nwant to share my reasoning because I want everyone to know how I \narrived at this conclusion. First, I looked to the threat posed by \nSaddam Hussein. Then I looked at the many questions that must be \nconsidered before our country begins military action. Then I looked at \nthe President's case, the role of the U.N. and our allies, the impact \nwar could have on the Middle East, and the impact it would have on the \nwar on terrorism. Finally, I looked at the context in which we are \nbeing asked to make this decision, including our economy and the \npolitical climate.\n\n  Mr. President, let me first address the threat. There is no doubt \nSaddam Hussein poses a serious threat to our interests, to his own \npeople, and to the world. Under his rule, Iraq has been an aggressor \nnation. It has started conflict with its neighbors and it has sought to \nstockpile conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.\n  Over the years, Iraq has worked to develop nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons. During 1991 through 1994, despite Iraq's denials, \nU.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of facilities \nIraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate \nIraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no \nreason to think otherwise.\n  Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and \nchemical weapons. U.N. inspectors have said Iraq's claims about \nbiological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq \nused chemical weapons against Iran and later against its own Kurdish \npopulation.\n  While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there \nhave been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt \nIraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Mr. President, we know from history and experience that Iraq poses a \ndanger to the region, to our interests, and perhaps to ourselves. It \nwill continue its aggression and its pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  This leads us to a second set of questions. What should we do about \nthis threat? The President has now asked Congress to authorize him to \nmake war on Iraq. The goals of military action have shifted from regime \nchange one day to disarmament, to enforcing any number of U.N. \nresolutions. The list of crimes to which the administration says Iraq \nmust be held accountable varies widely. They include: attempting to \nassassinate a former President; holding prisoners of war after the gulf \nwar, including one American; firing on aircraft enforcing the no-fly \nzone; seeking weapons of mass destruction; and violating U.N. \nresolutions.\n  All of these are serious crimes; not all of them deserve the same \nresponse; not all of them call for war.\n  Without a clear objective, victory cannot be measured. Indeed, it \nappears the administration established a solution--going to war--before \nit defined the problem or the goal.\n  Our most important goal is disarmament. Given Iraq's history and \nSaddam's madness, there can be no doubt the world will be safer if we \ndismantle Iraq's ability to produce and use weapons of mass \ndestruction. On this goal, the President receives complete support from \nthe American people, the Congress, and the world community.\n  Disarmament of Iraq is unquestionably the right thing to do. The \nmeans of achieving this goal are what is up for debate.\n  In the past few weeks, the Bush administration unveiled its new \npreemption doctrine. This marks a shift from our longstanding national \npolicy, and so far we have not been told how it applies to the world \nbeyond Iraq. Obviously, if troops or tanks are amassing at the border, \nwe have the right to defend ourselves, but to strike on the basis of \nsuspicion alone is another matter. It is something this Congress and \nthe American people need to fully explore and debate before we endorse \nthe preemption doctrine.\n  The United States is not alone in facing the threat of Saddam \nHussein, but unfortunately our Government is acting that way. I am very \nconcerned that a unilateral race to make war on Iraq will weaken the \nsupport we need worldwide to win the war on terrorism.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, the international community helped \nus heal and supported our efforts to respond. Their support has \nprovided critical intelligence keys to disrupting international \nterrorist networks. But today our allies are as confused about \nAmerica's objectives in Iraq as the American people are. Like the \nAmerican public, our allies woke up one day to find that the \nadministration was making plans for war. Like the Congress, they were \nnot consulted. Like the American people, they had nothing explained to \nthem. They saw, as did the rest of us, that a course of action had \napparently been determined before the reasons were clear.\n  Recently, the administration has done a better job working with our \nallies. Secretary of State Powell is to be commended for his work, but \nwe still have a long way to go. It would greatly benefit the Congress \nand the American people to know where our allies stand and what they \nare willing to do before we take action.\n  While we welcome the support of our allies and the United Nations, we \ndo not hand them or anyone else the ultimate power to decide America's \nsecurity demands. Only the United States can determine our interests \nand what steps are required to defend them.\n  That said, before we jump into a fight, we should know who is with us \nand what we are getting into, and today we do not.\n  Another key part of the international response to the Iraqi threat is \nthe United Nations. Efforts at the U.N. have been met with both success \nand failure. To date, our greatest failure has been the ending of \nweapons inspections in 1998 and the U.N.'s failure to hold Iraq \nresponsible for its obligations.\n  Today, the United States is working with our ally Britain to pass \nthrough the U.N. Security Council a new, tough resolution regarding \nIraqi weapons inspections. I believe we need a new, strong U.N. \nresolution that provides for complete transparency of Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction programs. This new resolution must allow inspectors to \nsearch all sites without roadblocks. Iraq should know that the U.N. and \nthe international community are serious about enforcing this resolution \neven with force, if necessary.\n  One of the reasons U.N. support is critical is that it shapes how \nother nations will look upon our action in Iraq. There is a difference \nbetween going it alone and having the support of a broad coalition. We \nhave a stated goal of working to achieve peace in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict. We have strong ties to other states in the \nregion--Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other gulf states. What action \nwe take and how we take it will have a direct impact on our other \nstated foreign policy goals of achieving peace in the Middle East, \nmaintaining friendly relations\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\nwith our allies in the region, and contributing to the stability of the \nregion.\n\n  In addition to the impact of war on the Middle East, we must \nunderstand how action in Iraq will affect the war on terrorism.\n  On September 11 last year, we were reminded again of the dangerous \nworld in which we live. After bombing our embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania and attacking the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, al-Qaida has pulled \noff the most horrific crime our Nation has ever known.\n  In the aftermath of these tragic events, the President declared war \non terrorism. We dispatched our troops to Afghanistan and its \nneighbors. We worked closely with our allies. We even got help from \nsome unexpected quarters. Most of the world joined our effort, but \nthere are places where we do not have relations where terrorists hide, \nand to reach those dark corners we rely on intermediaries. Today, those \nintermediaries are providing us with intelligence information to help \nour efforts.\n  We have to ask: Will unilateral action in Iraq undermine the support \nwe need from other countries in the war on terrorism? The answer to \nthat question should help inform us on our decision on military action \nin Iraq.\n  If we do take action in Iraq, there is no doubt that our Armed Forces \nwill prevail. We will win a war with Iraq decisively, and, God willing, \nwill win it quickly. But what happens after the war? That will have \njust as big an impact on our future peace and our security. Will we be \nobligated to rebuild Iraq, and, if so, how? Our economy at home is \nreeling, our budget is in deficit, and we have no estimate of the cost \nof rebuilding. And with whom?\n  As New York Times columnist Tom Friedman points out, there is a \nretail store mentality that suggests to some: If you break it, you buy \nit.\n  How will the Iraqis get back on their feet? Iraq's leadership has led \nits people through two decades of misery. The people of Iraq have paid \na terrible price for Saddam Hussein's military campaigns. What promises \nis the international community prepared to make to help restore the \nhealth of the Iraqi people? What promise is implicit in a unilateral \nattack?\n  If we must disarm Iraq by force, we will, but we cannot achieve peace \nthrough occupation alone. It costs money and energy and time, and like \nbuilding anything else, it is better as a shared responsibility than a \nsolo effort.\n  Again, the answers to these questions should not be the only factors \nin play as we make decisions on how to protect our security interests, \nbut they are not insignificant and they have not been answered.\n  We do not have a clear policy. We do not have a clear path to \nimplementing that policy. We do not yet know what level of assistance \nwe are going to get from our allies and the broader international \ncommunity. We have not factored in all of the implications this may \nhave on our other foreign policy objectives. We have not factored in \nall the implications this may have on our own economy.\n  Not having a well-defined policy or proper preparations for \ncontingencies that may result from whatever action we take is a \ndangerous situation on the eve of the war this administration says we \nmust have.\n  With all of these unanswered questions, how do we get here today? The \nadministration has said it wants a vote on this resolution ``before the \nelection.'' In this debate, many in Congress and many of our citizens \nare asking: What is special about November 5 in deciding this question?\n  The question of war should not be placed in the context of trying to \ninfluence the outcome of an election, and surely that cannot be the \ncase today. The question is too grave for that to be the motivation, \neven for that to be a motivation. The question of war should be placed \nsquarely in the context of what is the right policy to achieve our \nNation's security goals.\n  With all of these questions in mind, I look to the resolution that is \nbefore us. Does this resolution address the question this Nation must \nanswer in order to succeed? Does it clearly articulate a policy \nobjective? What course of action does it sanction in our Nation's \npursuit of that goal?\n  While this resolution is a marked improvement over the President's \noriginal proposal, S.J. Res. 46 does not provide the information--and \nthe objectives--needed at this time.\n  It is overly broad in defining the objectives of military action.\n  After considering the threat, the cost, and the unanswered questions, \nI have reached a decision. I will vote against the underlying \nresolution; I will vote against going to war at this time.\n  I am committed to fighting and winning the war on terrorism, \nincluding eliminating Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.\n  I support wholeheartedly our men and women in uniform. I admire their \nheroism. And I will continue to do all I can to provide them with the \nresources they need for whatever mission they are asked to carry out on \nour behalf.\n  Today we are being told we have no choice; that we have to grant the \nPresident war-making authority immediately, without knowing the \nultimate goal or the ultimate cost, and without knowing whether we are \ngoing it alone.\n  It may well be that someday our country needs to take military action \nin Iraq, but the decision right now to give the President this broad \nauthority, without focusing it narrowly on weapons of mass destruction, \nwithout the support of our allies, without defining the costs to our \ncountry today and tomorrow, is not something I can support given what \nwe know today.\n  The constituents I hear from want to know:\n  Why are we racing to take this action right now, alone, with so many \nquestions unanswered?\n  The administration could answer those questions with clear, \ncompelling facts and goals, but so far we have not heard them.\n  We are being asked to endorse a policy that has not been thought out, \nand one that could have dramatic consequences for our citizens and our \nfuture.\n  While we may need to take action in Iraq down the road, today I \ncannot support sending our men and women into harm's way on an ill-\ndefined, solo mission with so many critical questions unanswered.\n  If, in the coming weeks or months, we learn that Saddam's \ncapabilities are more advanced than we now realize, or if Saddam defies \nU.N. resolutions, we will certainly have the right to take appropriate \naction.\n  Looking back over the past year, it is clear that we can respond to \nSeptember 11 several ways.\n  We can act out of fear, casting aside our principles, and taking \naction without sufficient planning. Or we can stick to our principles \nand draw strength from them in tough times. That is the course I \nadvocate today.\n  In closing, let me be clear. Despite my reservations today, I will \nalways stand with and support those who serve our country, wherever and \nwhenever their Commander in Chief sends them.\n  If American troops are called to fight in Iraq, I will stand with the \nPresident and I will support our troops not only during the conflict, \nbut afterward.\n  The international community, and those who would do us harm, need to \nknow without exception that while we may have our disagreements before \nmilitary action, once our troops are on the ground, we are all on the \nsame side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to answer some of these questions \nabout why we are now considering a resolution and what proof we have \nabout Iraq. Senator Sarbanes and I are the two delegates to the United \nNations this year for the House and Senate. I was on the floor of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly when the President made his speech and \npresented his case to the General Assembly. I have to say I was so \nproud of him.\n  Before he even gave the speech, there had been a lot of hype in the \npapers that was unfavorable to him. When he was introduced, the tension \nin the crowd could be felt, and there was no applause. I did learn \nlater that there is seldom applause when a head of state is introduced.\n  When he gave his speech the body language could be seen on the other \ndelegates. At the end of the speech--also untypical--they gave him \napplause.\n  I also want to tell my colleagues what happened after that. As we \nwandered about and met other delegates,\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nwe heard lots of positive comments about what the President said. Not \nonly that, virtually every head of state who followed him had the same \nmessage for the U.N.: Be useful or be done. That is the message that \nthe President delivered.\n  Why now? Right now because we are trying to strengthen the resolve of \nthe United Nations. Discussions are going on right now in the Senate \nand throughout the nation about what should be done with Iraq. We are \nthe ones who provide the leadership in this country. We are the ones \nwho set the tone. We are the ones who have to approve what the \nPresident is doing.\n  What proof do we have? I hope everyone is attending the classified \nbriefings that are available. The things that are not classified are \nenough to scare us. The reports of Iraq that gave to the United Nations \nshow many chemical weapons they had left at the end of the war--their \nreport, their numbers, their chemicals, their weapons of bioterrorism. \nSubtract out the numbers that they destroyed, and we wind up with a \nhuge supply of chemical and biological weapons. Weapons that could be \nused against us now.\n  One of the things the other countries of this world appreciate is the \npatience our President had after September 11. Bombs were going off in \nAfghanistan that very night, and the press covering it said: The United \nStates is retaliating. But it was not us. The President was busy \nsending envoys to nations all over the world, setting up a coalition--\nthe same kind of coalition we are being asked about now. Some have \nasked: Shouldn't we see if there is a coalition first? No. First we \nshould show our resolve, and then we can build coalitions.\n  This is the President who built coalitions. This is the President who \nwent into Afghanistan with war plans, with a method, with cooperation, \nand he did in 1 month what Russia was not able to do in 7 years. It is \na President who knows what he is doing. It is a President with \npatience. Now he is asking us to pass a resolution.\n  How strange and unheard of is this request to pass a resolution? In \n1998, a Republican-controlled Senate for a Democrat President \nrecognized that this was not Democrat versus Republican. We then said \nthat it was very important to bring up a resolution that would show our \nresolve. That is exactly what a resolution does--show resolve. We \npassed a resolution in 1 day. We passed a resolution with no \namendments. The President asked us. We did it. We showed unity. We \nshowed the country we were behind the President and we were ready to do \nwhatever was necessary for the same despot we are talking about now.\n\n  Do we think he has gotten better? No. He has gotten worse. Do we \nthink he has gotten less prepared? No. He has gotten more prepared. It \nis time we did something about it, and time we did it through the right \nchannels--that is exactly what the President is doing. Part of that \nprocess is to ask us, ask Congress, to help.\n  In 1998, we did it with no questions. We did it with no amendments. \nWe did it with no filibuster. What do we have in the Senate today? We \nhave a filibuster. We have amendments. We have people giving all kinds \nof excuses so they can vote against an amendment that is necessary to \nget the resolve of the Security Council. That way the United Nations \nwill have the backbone to say to this despot, this tyrant, this killer \nof babies, that it is time he straightened out, got rid of his chemical \nweapons, got rid of his biological weapons, and let us in to make sure \nthere were not any nuclear weapons. It is time he becomes part of the \ncommunity of nations or gets out of office. It is that simple.\n  If we could do pass a resolution for Bill Clinton, we ought to be \nable to do it for President Bush. Again, I want to remind my colleagues \nof the patience and resolve we had going into Afghanistan. I think \nparts of this discussion came up from the fact that somebody heard that \nwe had plans for attacking Iraq. Well, we better have. We have a \nDefense Department that we pay a lot of money to plan for events so \nthat they never happen. They have a plan on Iraq, and they have a plan \non another dozen countries.\n  Every once in awhile, we even have exercises or war games so our \nDefense Department can see how to move people and have the right \nequipment in the right place at the right time. That way we know that \nthe training is good for the people we have in the armed services. \nAnybody who commits to the service of this country must be assured that \nwe are also committed to providing them with the training and \neverything under the Sun we can give them to keep them safe. Keep them \nsafe so they can do their job and to com home alive. That is absolutely \nessential.\n\n  Today we have half a dozen amendments, we have substitutes amendments \nto substitute amendment. We do have a resolution, a resolution the \nPresident asked us to pass. It is one that is considerably more \ndetailed and one that has more hoops to jump through than the one we \napproved in 1998. This is the resolution we need to pass. We must give \nPresident Bush the authority we gave President Clinton in 1998 without \nlimiting authority or amendments.\n  In July of 1998, as I mentioned, we considered a resolution urging \nthe President to take appropriate action to bring Iraq in compliance \nwith international obligations. The Senate debated that for one day, \nwithout amendments. We approved the resolution by unanimous consent. \nThat means no one objected and no one wanted to add an amendment. We \njust said yes. The House debated that one for day, had no amendments, \nand approved it by a vote of 407 to 6.\n  In October of 1998, we considered legislation that, in addition to \nauthorizing the President to provide assistance to the Iraqi democratic \nopposition, declared it should be the policies of the United States to \nseek the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and replace it with a \ndemocratic government. What did we do on that? The Senate debated that \nlegislation for one day without amendments and we approved it by \nunanimous consent. Once again, no one wanted to amend it, no one \ndisagreed. We gave President Clinton the authority. The House debated \nthat legislation for one day and approved it by a vote of 360 to 38. \nOne day in each Chamber--one day in each Republican-controlled Chamber \ngiving authority to a Democratic president. One day in 1998. How many \ndays will it take in 2002? We are already days into debate. How many \ndays are needed by my colleagues to undermine the ability of the United \nStates to address a security threat?\n  The President has been criticized for asking for a Congressional \nresolution prior to achieving a United Nations Security Council \nresolution. I believe the United Nations does have an important role in \nthe future of Iraq. If the UN does its job, and member states do what \nis right, we can address the threat within the realm of the United \nNations, which I am sure would be everyone's preference. As an \nindependent nation, however, the United States cannot sit idly by while \nthe Security Council debates the validity of pledges made by a known \nliar. If the General Assembly and Security Council are not prepared to \ndefend the security of the world and the legitimacy of this \norganization, the United States must be prepared to act. A strong \nresolution with strong support is the best effort to prevent a war \nlater. Afghanistan made the U.S. credible. It proved our patience and \ncapability. Those traits go a long way to moving Saddam--as long as \nCongress shows resolve and then the UN shows resolve.\n  It is also important to note that the passage of a Congressional \nResolution would not prevent the Administration from continuing its \nwork at the United Nations. Rather, I believe it will help the \nPresident gain support for an appropriate Security Council resolution. \nAs Congress, our actions must show a united front with the strong \nresolve of the American people. We will not wait to be attacked. We \nwill not wait for inaction and discord. We will not tolerate an Iraqi \nPresident who flouts the authority of an organization only to cower \nunder its umbrella when convenient.\n  Saddam Hussein is not crazy or an idiot. He is dangerous because he \nis cunning and very calculated. Repeatedly, he pushes the international \ncommunity to the brink point and then backs down and says--sure, let \nthe weapons inspectors come back. How many times are we going to let \nhim play this game? Do we wait for him to attack with nuclear, \nchemical, or biological weapons? Do we wait for yet another \ninternational inspector team to\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nbe denied access to weapons stockpiles? Do we wait for another attack \non the United States? Iraq has a despot leader, chemical and biological \nweapons, and a proven willingness to use anything. Iraq is the only \ncountry in the world with all three components. We must have changes \nimmediately or regret it soon.\n  Many have asked why now, and I must ask why have we not acted sooner? \nWe have considered action in Iraq before. We decided in 1991 that we \nshould defend Kuwait. We sent in planes and bombs in 1998 and brought \nthe inspectors home, but we have been silent since then. It is \nworthwhile to look at a few of the 16 Security Council resolutions that \nSaddam has chosen to ignore:\n  Resolution 687, adopted April 3, 1991, called for Iraq to accept the \ndestruction, removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and \nbiological weapons and unconditionally agree not to acquire or develop \nnuclear weapons or nuclear-weapons useable material;\n  Resolution 707, adopted August 15, 1991, condemned Iraq's violation \nof Resolution 687, adopted only four months before;\n  Resolution 1051, adopted March 27, 1996, called for Iraq to comply \nwith weapons inspectors;\n  Resolution 1115, adopted June 21, 1997, condemned the repeated \nrefusal of Iraqi authorities to allow access to UN inspectors; and\n  Resolution 1194, adopted September 9, 1998, condemned the decision by \nIraq to suspend cooperation with inspectors and oppose its obligations \nunder Security Council resolutions.\n  In 1991, we knew Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass \ndestruction. We knew it in 1995. We knew it in 1998. We know now--he \nhas these weapons today. There is no reason he would stop producing \nthem--no one has been there to stop him. The United States and Great \nBritain have been enforcing the no-fly zones, but no one has been \nenforcing Saddam's commitments to disarm. No one can believe he would \nsimply stop producing these evil weapons out of the goodness of his \nheart.\n\n  When and if we do use our armed forces, we must show one of the vast \ndifferences between the US and Saddam: a value for human life. To him, \nsoldiers are expendable. To us, each and every life has value and \nworth. Any military action inherently puts the lives of our brave \nsoldiers at risk, and the American people know this far too well, but \nwe must explore all possibilities and attempt to act with as little \nAmerican and even Iraqi lives lost as possible.\n  When Congress approved authorization for forays into Iraq in 1998, in \none days debate, no amendments, former President Clinton, said, ``Let \nthere be no doubt, we are prepared to act.'' This is the same message \nwe are again debating today. We must allow this President--President \nGeorge Bush--to stand up and say ``We are prepared to act.'' He must be \nable to state that to our allies with the authority and Congressional \nsupport, without limitation, that we gave in 1998.\n  When we act with our allies or through the United Nations, we should \ngo into Iraq with a plan--actually, several plans: a plan for how to \ndisarm Saddam and his guard; a plan for how to remove Saddam from \npower; a plan for when and how American troops should leave Iraq. The \nUnited States, however, should not have a plan for installation of a \nhand-picked successor. The Iraqi people must ultimately choose their \nleader. The United States and the international community must work \nwith the people of Iraq just as we worked with the people of \nAfghanistan. If we choose a leader for Iraq, we will not be allowing \nthe Iraqis to form an independent and democratic nation. The United \nStates should have a plan for encouraging the various factions to work \ntogether, but we cannot choose a future leader before the battle \nbegins.\n  The President and Congress have both been accused of trying to \npoliticize the issue of Iraq. This is not a political issue. It wasn't \nin 1998 and should not be now. It is an issue of national security and \ninternational stability. The truth is respected individuals from both \nparties have expressed support for taking action and, more importantly, \nsupport having a plan for action. On September 12 this year, former \nSenator Bob Kerry, a Democrat from Nebraska, wrote in the Wall Street \nJournal, ``The real choice is between sustaining a military effort \ndesigned to contain Saddam Hussein and a military effort designed to \nreplace him.'' He also pointed out that the United States has spent \nmore than a billion dollars in the last 11 years on simply containing \nSaddam. What return have the American people received from that \ninvestment? Saddam is still in power, the Iraqi people are still \noppressed, and the security and stability of the region are still \nthreatened.\n  This is the choice we have today. Do we keep the status quo and \ncontinue to spend money without any change in Iraq or do we authorize \nthe President to take action and make some changes? I support change. \nWithout any serious action by either the United States or the \ninternational community, we are telling Saddam that his game can go on. \nHe stays where he is and continues his shell game. We lose again. \nSaddam is more than willing to keep the game going as long as the \nUnited States and the world are willing to lose.\n  The people of Iraq, the people of the United States, and the people \nof the world have not need for the leadership of Saddam Hussein--we can \nall agree on that. If he cannot abide by his international obligations \nand if he will not disarm then, simply put, he needs to go. We need to \nbe rid of him and the President needs the authority to use armed forces \nto remove Saddam if necessary.\n  I firmly believe that firm resolve under this resolution--this \nresolution that does give some pretty broad powers--will keep us from \nhaving to go to war.\n  Without it, I think we may have to go to war.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the language included \nin the Lieberman-Warner substitute without any amendments--just as we \ndid for President Clinton in 1998--with the same resolve, with the same \nunity, and with the same straightforwardness we had then.\n  We can't quite do that, though, can we? We have already debated a \ncouple of days. We have already had amendments put in. But we can still \nhave the kind of unity we need to show our resolve so we can get the \nU.N. to do something which will keep us from going to war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 40 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, The Senate is engaged in a momentous and \nhistoric debate. The President seeks the authority to use force in our \non-going confrontation with Iraq.\n\n  The Constitution entrusts the Congress with the exclusive power to \n``declare War.'' It is our Constitutional obligation to consider the \nPresident's request carefully and conscientiously, to review the \nevidence thoroughly, to weigh the costs and the consequences. We are \ncalled upon by the Constitution to make an independent judgment, not an \nautomatic acquiescence.\n  I begin this debate acknowledging several unassailable conclusions.\n  First, we are already in a confrontation with Iraq. Since the Persian \nGulf War, we have maintained military forces in support of \ninternational sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Our \npilots are routinely fired upon as they enforce the ``No Fly'' Zones. \nThus, the question is not whether we should confront Iraq. The question \nis how best to thwart this outlaw regime and for what ultimate purpose.\n  Second, Saddam Hussein is a despicable person who oppresses his \npeople as he threatens his neighbors. Despite his military defeat in \nthe Persian Gulf War and the imposition of sanctions, Saddam continues \nto defy United Nations resolutions and, of most concern, continues to \ndevelop and attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. But, our \njudgment cannot rest simply on his unalloyed evil. We must consider our \nactions more broadly. Will we enhance the stability and security of the \nregion? Will we strengthen our security not just for the moment, but \nfor the future as well? What kind of precedent will we establish?\n  Third, we will decisively defeat Iraqi military forces in any \nconflict. The skill and courage of our forces, aided by superb \ntechnology, will overwhelm Iraqi resistance. The military outcome is \ncertain, but the costs and the consequences are uncertain and could be \nquite grave.\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\n  As I consider the proper course of action, as I weigh the \nuncertainties as well as recognize what is apparent, I return again and \nagain to one further conclusion. Whatever we do will be better done \nwith others. Thus, it is imperative that we commit all of our energies \nto encourage the United Nations to live up to its founding principles: \nto be more than just an international forum for discussion; indeed, to \nbe a force for collective action in the face of common dangers. \nPresident Bush said it very well when he addressed the United Nations' \nGeneral Assembly:\n\n       We created a United Nations Security Council so that, \n     unlike the League of Nations, our deliberations would be more \n     than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. After \n     generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and \n     squandered lives, we've dedicated ourselves to standards of \n     human dignity shared by all and to a system of security \n     defended by all.\n\n  Acting alone will increase the risk to our forces and to our allies \nin the region. Acting alone will increase the burden that we must bear \nto restore stability in the region. Acting alone will invite the \ncriticism and animosity of many throughout the world who will \nmistakenly dismiss our efforts as entirely self-serving. Acting alone \ncould seriously undermine the structure of collective security that the \nUnited States has labored for decades to make effective. Acting alone \ntoday against the palpable evil of Saddam may set us on a course, \ncharted by the newly announced doctrine of preemption, that will carry \nus beyond the limits of our power and our wisdom.\n  For these reasons, I will vote against the Lieberman-Warner \nresolution granting the President the permission to take unilateral \nmilitary action against Iraq regardless of the immediacy of the threat. \nAnd I will support the resolution proposed by Senator Levin.\n  The Levin resolution recognizes the inherent right of the President \nto use our military forces to defend the United States. This resolution \nsupports the President's demands that the United Nations promulgate a \ntough, new framework of inspections to disarm Iraq, and this resolution \ngives the President the right to use American military forces to \nenforce the resolve of the United Nations. The Levin resolution \nrecognizes Congress' responsibility to promptly consider the \nPresident's request to unilaterally employ American forces if the \nUnited Nations fails to take effective action.\n  On Monday in Cincinnati, President Bush said, ``Later this week the \nUnited States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked the \nCongress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves \nnecessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands.'' That is what the \nLevin resolution provides.\n  Those who advocate unilateral action assume that time has run out in \ndealing with Iraq. They see an immediate threat that will yield only to \nimmediate military action. Thus, it is important to assess the Iraqi \nthreat as best we can.\n  Iraqi conventional forces have been seriously degraded since the Gulf \nWar. Saddam does have a cadre of Republican Guards that are capable and \nfought with determination in the Gulf War. One cannot totally discount \nIraq's conventional forces, but they are not capable of defeating \nUnited States forces. The most dangerous aspect of Saddam's military \npower is the possession of chemical and biological weapons and his \naspiration to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\n  Today, Iraq has the capability to use chemical and biological weapons \nwithin the region to augment conventional forces that have been \nseriously degraded since the Gulf War. These capabilities, however, \nmust be viewed in terms of intentions in order to fully evaluate the \nthreat\n  An assessment of Iraq intentions reveals areas of consensus and areas \nof disagreement. It seems clear that Saddam is intent on rebuilding his \nmilitary and acquiring weapons of mass destruction including nuclear \ndevices. His expulsion of U.N. inspectors certainly supports this view. \nMoreover, it may suggest that the inspectors posed a very difficult \nobstacle to his plans and their future utility cannot be summarily \ndismissed. Saddam continues to aspire to be a regional power. \nUnchecked, Saddam would threaten his neighbors and endeavor to claim \nthe mantel of leadership in the Gulf and, perhaps, in the greater \nMuslim world.\n  There is, however, a lack of consensus on two significant points. \nWill Saddam risk the survival of his regime by threatening or \nconducting attacks on his neighbors? Will Saddam provide weapons of \nmass destruction to terrorist groups who can or will use them against \nthe United States or any other nation?\n  At the heart of discussions of Saddam's possible plans is the general \nquestion of whether deterrence and containment will work against Iraq \nas it did in the Cold War. Saddam certainly has a lot to lose in any \nconflict with the United States. Both his life and his lifestyle would \nbe in great jeopardy. Saddam also seems to be devoid of any ideology \nother than self-preservation and self-aggrandizement. Saddam is a \nsecular thug, not a messianic leader. There is evidence that he will \nnot put his regime at risk. During the Gulf war, the United States \nclearly signaled that any use of Iraq of chemical or biological weapons \nagainst Coalition forces would result in his destruction. Saddam \naccepted a humiliating defeat rather than risk losing power.\n  Of course, there are many who accurately point out that Saddam has \nalready attacked his neighbors, Iran and Kuwait. He has used chemical \nweapons against the Iranians and the Kurds. Still, one is left with the \nquestion whether even this despicable behavior is a product of \ncalculation rather than delusion.\n  And complicating the record of his actions against Iran is mounting \nevidence of our covert support both before and after he had begun to \nemploy chemical weapons.\n  The second issues involves Saddam's willingness and ability to \ncooperate with terrorists. After September 11, this issue takes on a \nnew and powerful emphasis. Despite extraordinary and justifiable \nefforts to establish a connection between the Iraqi regime and the \nattacks on New York City and the Pentagon and the downed aircraft in \nPennsylvania, no such links have been established. Indeed, if credible \nlinks exist, the President, in my view, could employ unilateral force \nunder the terms of the congressional resolution passed on September 14, \n2001.\n  Recently, however, administration officials are publicly, but \ncryptically, trying to make the case that there is a definite \nconnection between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaida. Secretary Rumsfeld \nand Condolezza Rice have asserted at various times that Iraq is \nharboring al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, that information from detainees \nindicates that Iraq provided chem-bio weapons training to al-Qaida, and \nthat senior-level contacts between the Iraq regime and al-Qaida have \nincreased since 1998. They have offered few details beyond Secretary \nRumsfeld's claims that the information is ``factual,'' extremely \naccurate'' and ``bulletproof.''\n  But according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, these claims are disputed \nby ``a growing number of military officers, intelligence professionals \nand diplomats.'' The article quotes an unnamed official declaring:\n\n       analysts at the working level in the intelligence community \n     are feeling very strong pressure from the Pentagon to cook \n     the intelligence books.\n\n  The Inquirer article examined some of these administration claims and \nfound that ``the facts are much less conclusive.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 8, 2002]\n\n                 Officials' Private Doubts on Iraq War\n\n      (By Warren P. Strobel, Jonathan S. Landay and John Walcott)\n\n       Washington.--While President Bush marshals congressional \n     and international support for invading Iraq, a growing number \n     of military officers, intelligence professionals and \n     diplomats in his own government privately have deep \n     misgivings about the administration's double-time march \n     toward war.\n       These officials say administration hawks have exaggerated \n     evidence of the threat that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein \n     poses, including distorting his links to the al-Qaeda \n     terrorist network; have overstated the amount of \n     international support for attacking Iraq; and have downplayed \n     the potential repercussions of a new war in the Middle East.\n       They say that the administration squelches dissenting views \n     and that intelligence analysts are under intense pressure to \n     produce\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\n     reports supporting the White House's argument that Hussein \n     poses such an immediate threat to the United States that \n     preemptive military action is necessary.\n       ``Analysts at the working level in the intelligence \n     community are feeling very strong pressure from the Pentagon \n     to cook the intelligence books,'' said one official, speaking \n     on condition of anonymity.\n       A dozen other officials echoed his views in interviews with \n     the Inquirer Washington Bureau. No one who was interviewed \n     disagreed.\n       They cited recent suggestions by Defense Secretary Donald \n     H. Rumsfeld and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice \n     that Hussein and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network working \n     together.\n       Rumsfeld said Sept. 26 that the U.S. government had \n     ``bulletproof'' confirmation of links between Iraq and al-\n     Qaeda members, including ``solid evidence'' that members of \n     the terrorist network maintained a presence in Iraq.\n       The facts are much less conclusive. Officials said \n     Rumsfeld's statement was based in part on intercepted \n     telephone calls in which an al-Qaeda member who apparently \n     was passing through Baghdad was overheard calling friends or \n     relatives, intelligence officials said. the intercepts \n     provide no evidence that the suspected terrorist was working \n     with the Iraqi regime or that he was working on a terrorist \n     operation while he was in Iraq, they said.\n       Rumsfeld also suggested that the Iraqi regime had offered \n     safe haven to bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed \n     Omar.\n       While technically true, that, too, is misleading. \n     Intelligence reports said the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, a \n     longtime Iraqi intelligence officer, made the offer during a \n     visit to Afghanistan in late 1998, after the United States \n     attacked al-Qaeda training camps with cruise missiles to \n     retaliate for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and \n     Tanzania. But officials said the same intelligence reports \n     said bin Laden rejected the offer because he did not want \n     Hussein to control his group.\n       In fact, the officials said, there is no ironclad evidence \n     that the Iraqi regime and the terrorist network are working \n     together, or that Hussein has ever contemplated giving \n     chemical or biological weapons to al-Qaeda, with whom he has \n     deep ideological differences.\n       None of the dissenting officials, who work in a number of \n     different agencies, would agree to speak publicly, out of \n     fear of retribution. Many of them have long experience in the \n     Middle East and South Asia, and all spoke in similar terms \n     about their unease with the way that U.S. political leaders \n     were dealing with Iraq.\n       All agreed that Hussein was a threat who eventually must be \n     dealt with, and none flatly opposed military action. But, \n     they say, that U.S. government has no dramatic new knowledge \n     about the Iraqi leader that justifies Bush's urgent call to \n     arms.\n       Some lawmakers have voiced similar concerns after receiving \n     CIA briefings. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D., Ill.) said some \n     information he had seen did not support Bush's portrayal of \n     the Iraqi threat. ``It's troubling to have classified \n     information that contradicts statements made by the \n     administration,'' Durbin said. ``There's more they should \n     share with the public.''\n       Several administration and intelligence officials defended \n     CIA Director George Tenet, saying Tenet was not pressuring \n     his analysts but was quietly working to include dissenting \n     opinions in intelligence estimates and congressional \n     briefings.\n       In one case, a senior administration official said, Tenet \n     made sure that a State Department official told Congress that \n     the Energy and State Departments disagreed with an \n     intelligence assessment that said hundreds of aluminum tubes \n     Iraq tried to purchase were intended for Baghdad's secret \n     nuclear-weapons program. Analysts in both departments \n     concluded that the Iraqis probably wanted the tubes to make \n     conventional artillery pieces.\n       Other examples of questionable statements include: Vice \n     President Cheney said in late August that Iraq might have \n     nuclear weapons ``fairly soon.'' A CIA report released Friday \n     said it could take Iraq until the last half of the decade to \n     produce a nuclear weapon, unless it could acquire bomb-grade \n     uranium or plutonium on the black market.\n       Also in August, Rumsfeld suggested that al-Qaeda operatives \n     fleeing Afghanistan were taking refuge in Iraq with Hussein's \n     assistance. ``In a vicious, repressive dictatorship that \n     exercises near-total control over its population, it's very \n     hard to imagine that the government is not aware of what's \n     taking place in the country,'' he said. Rumsfeld apparently \n     was referring to about 150 members of the militant Islamic \n     group Ansar al Islam (``Supporters of Islam'') who have taken \n     refuge in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. However, one of \n     America's would-be Kurdish allies controls that part of this \n     country, not Hussein.\n  Mr. REED. In addition, a full assessment of the assertions of \nSecretary Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor Rice is hampered by \nthe failure of the Central Intelligence Agency to provide an updated \nNational Intelligence Estimate of the current situation in Iraq.\n  Given the subjective nature and inherent difficulty of evaluating the \nintentions of such an opaque structure as the Iraqi regime, much more \nweight must be given to their capabilities. Saddam does not deserve the \nbenefit of the doubt. But looking at Iraqi capabilities alone, the \nthreat is not immediate. If unchecked, the threat is inevitable and \ndangerous. But, at time have the opportunity to pursue a collective \nsolution to Iraq. This is an approach that offers a greater chance of \nsuccess and a greater chance of long-term stability.\n  Whatever course of action that we choose, we cannot absolutely ignore \nor disregard the views and opinions of other countries. With the \nexception of Great Britain, there are few nations that are supportive \nof unilateral action.\n  The nations that surround Iraq are critical to the success of any \nmilitary operation and to the long-term success of our policy. And, \nregional support for unilateral American military operations is \nequivocal at best.\n  Turkey seems likely to allow use of its airbases but without great \nenthusiasm and with great concern about the Kurds. Saudi Arabia opposes \ntoppling Saddam and has stated it will allow the use of its bases only \nif the operation is authorized by the United Nations. The potential \nloss of Saudi bases and overflight rights will limit our flexibility. \nKing Abdullah of Jordan has described a military confrontation with \nIraq as a ``catastrophe'' for the region. His reluctant support is \nbased on our commitment not to seek permission to introduce American \nforces into Jordan.\n\n  The Iranians have declared their intentions to remain aloof from the \nconflict. Iran is a bitter foe of Iraq, but its government is no friend \nto America. The gulf states seem resigned to the possibility of war. \nMubarak of Egypt has repeatedly spoken out against a unilateral attack, \nand it is unclear whether Egypt will allow the use of its airfields.\n  As the New York Times pointed out with regard to the Gulf Region and \nthe Middle East:\n\n       The support for the United States is not enthusiastic, and \n     is based on any American military action having the backing \n     of a United Nations resolution.\n\n  As we debate, the Iraqis are preparing their responses to our \ndiplomatic and military initiatives. Their options are shaped by their \ncapabilities and, I believe, the lessons learned in their disastrous \ndefeat in the gulf war and their study of the success of American \nmilitary forces in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.\n  Their first option is the one that they are currently pursuing; the \nadmission of U.N. weapon inspectors under the most lenient conditions \npossible. The Iraqis are not unmindful that inspectors in Baghdad are \nthe best insurance that they can have against a military attack by the \nUnited States. Even if this Congress authorized the President to use \nmilitary force against Iraq at his sole discretion without regard to \nthe United Nations, it is difficult to conceive of the President \nordering an attack with U.N. inspectors in Iraq carrying out a \nU.N. resolution and presumably telling CNN that their mission is \nproceeding.\n\n  The State Department is engaged in difficult negotiations to broker a \nnew resolution while at the same time delaying the entry of inspectors \ninto Iraq. If these negotiations fail, the United States would find \nitself in a precarious position. Not only will we be deprived of a new \nand strengthened enforcement mechanism, we likely will be exerting all \nour formal and informal influence to prevent the reintroduction of \ninspectors. Blocking the reentry of inspectors would further isolate us \nin the world. If we succeed in brokering a new and more effective \ninspection scheme, there is a significant probability that Iraq, \ndespite it repeated defiance and rejection of tougher standards, will \ninitially comply. Saddam has consistently practiced the politics of \nsurvival. Accepting inspectors, even inspectors with unconditional and \nunconstrained access, will buy time. If Saddam refuses to accept \ninspectors in accord with a more robust U.N. resolution, he seals his \nfate.\n  The recognition by the administration that Iraq may capitulate in the \nface of a strong Security Council resolution might tempt them to \nhalfhearted pursuit of United Nations authority. They should resist \nthose temptations. It is clearly preferable to operate with a U.N. \nauthorization whether it is contained in one resolution that\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\npromulgates a new inspection scheme backed by the explicit \nauthorization of force or a two-staged process that introduces \ninspectors with enhanced powers but defers the question of enforcement \nuntil Iraqi non-compliance is established.\n  If inspectors are not reintroduced into Iraq and Iraq is convinced of \na pending American-led attack, then the possibility of terrorist \nattacks by Iraq within the United States must be considered. In a \nletter read before a hearing of the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees, CIA Director, George Tenet, stated that:\n\n       Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of \n     conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or chemical or \n     biological weapons.\n\n  But, Tenet went on to warn:\n\n       Should Saddam conclude that a U.S.-led attack against his \n     country could not be deterred ``he probably would become \n     much less constrained in adopting terrorist action.''\n\n  And, if Iraq is contemplating terror in America, then Iraqis are more \nthan likely to be considering preemptive strikes on our forces as we \nbuild up prior to an attack. One of the most compelling lessons of the \ngulf war and subsequent American military operations is that letting \nthe United States build up its military forces is tantamount to victory \nfor the United States. If we can assemble in sufficient numbers the \nbest warfighters in the world with the best military technology in the \nworld, we will win the military battle every time and certainly in the \ncase of Iraq.\n  If Hussein's goal is to kill U.S. soldiers and slow down an invasion, \nhe might strike in the early days of a campaign at regional ports or \nairfields when those facilities are filled to capacity with U.S. forces \ngathering for the fight. In 1997, a Pentagon team of 18 generals and \nadmirals projected different ways such an attack could take place. In \none scenario, small teams of Iraqi infiltrators unleashed mustard gas \nfrom an old bread truck outfitted with agricultural sprayers. In the \nprojected scenario, the truck was mistakenly let on base by troops who \nthought it was delivering food. In another scenario, a helicopter took \noff from a barge floating about 15 miles from the Indian Ocean island \nof Diego Garcia and sprayed cholera into the air, infecting thousands \nof U.S. Marines preparing to board ships. The Marines didn't fall ill \nuntil they were at sea. Finally, the generals envisioned speedboats, \nloaded with chemical and biological weapons, ramming into docks near \nkey U.S. ports in Bahrain and Kuwait. Added to these scenarios is the \npossibility of a missile attack similar to the one launched against our \nrear areas during the gulf war.\n  A chemical or biological attack on our forces as they assemble would \ndisrupt our operations but not ultimately defeat them. It would \nincrease our casualties and costs. It also has the potential to sow \npanic in civilian ranks and make our presence a greater burden on \nsupportive governments.\n  If Saddam does not choose to launch preemptive attacks on our build-\nup, there is increasing evidence that he will use chemical and \nbiological weapons against our forces as they commence the attack. Last \nTuesday Prime Minister Blair released a report, which stated that \nSaddam might have already delegated authority to employ chemical and \nbiological weapons to his youngest son, Qusai, who leads the Republican \nGuard. Reportedly, Saddam had, prior to the start of the 1991 Persian \nGulf ground war, issued specific orders for the use of WMD if the \nallies were winning the ground war and crossed a line 200 miles south \nof Baghdad.\n  Once again, Iraqi chemical or biological attacks against United \nStates forces will not halt our attack. American units are trained and \nequipped to operate in chemical or biological environments. However, \nsuch attacks can cause delay, disruption and increased casualties. \nGeneral Hoar, former CENTCOM Commander, testified before the Armed \nServices Committee that prior to offensive operations in 1991, he was \nbriefed on a simulation conducted at Quantico that indicated the \npossibility of 10,000 casualties to the assaulting Coalition forces due \nprincipally to the potential use of chemical and biological weapons. We \nhave improved our protective equipment and monitors since the gulf war. \nWe have devoted great effort to developing techniques to target and \nsuppress opposing systems that could deliver chemical and biological \nweapons. Nevertheless, chemical and biological attacks would pose \nserious risks to our forces and to the civilian population.\n  It is important to note that both General John Shalikashvili and \nGeneral Wesley Clark in testimony before the Armed Services Committee \nagreed that operating under United Nations authority would tend to \nraise the threshold for the Iraqis to use weapons of mass destruction. \nOperating alone, the United States runs the risk of Iraqi gambling that \ninternational opinion will not be as critical of Iraq in the employment \nof these weapons.\n  If the first lesson of the gulf war is don't let the United States \nbuild up its forces, the second lesson is don't fight the United States \nat long range in open terrain. Our troops, training and technology give \nus decisive advantages to locate and destroy targets with integrated \nfires at great range. The deserts of Iraq are ideally suited for our \nforces and will be the graveyard of the Iraqi army if they chose to \nfight us there.\n\n  Unless the Iraqis learned nothing from their defeat, they will not \nfight our forces in the open. They likely will conduct a strategic \nwithdrawal to Baghdad.,fighting at choke points like rivers and urban \nareas. But, they may also conduct a scorched earth policy as they \nwithdraw to slow us down and deny us speedy avenues of approach to \nBaghdad. Suddam ordered the oil fields of Kuwait destroyed as his army \nfled. He may do the same as his forces withdraw. Moreover, since our \nmajor avenue of approach is through Southern Iraq, the traditional home \nof Iraqi Shiites, Saddam is unlikely to have any reluctance to inflict \ndamage on a community that he has always suppressed.\n  If Iraq forces can maintain any coherence in the face of our assault, \nparticularly our air assaults, then they will most likely make their \nmajor stand in Baghdad. In the streets and alleys of Baghdad, our \ntechnological advantages are reduced. It would become a more difficult \nbattle.\n  The International Institute of Strategic Studies reports that Iraq's \n``wisest course would be to hunker down in cities, distribute and hide \nits forces, and fight from those places. It cannot be assumed that the \nIraqi Army would deploy armour in the open desert, as in 1990-91, \nfiring from static positions and presenting an immobile target for \nairpower, as the Taliban did. Many Iraqi weapons and command and \ncontrol centers will be placed near apartments, hospitals, schools, and \nmosques.''\n  General Hoar testified at the Armed Services Committee of a \n``nightmare scenario'' that needs to be planned for--six Iraqi \nRepublican Guard divisions and six heavy divisions reinforced with \nseveral thousand antiaircraft artillery pieces defending the city of \nBaghdad, resulting in urban warfare with high casualties on both sides, \nas well as the civilian populace.\n  We are all mindful that, during the Gulf War, Saddam launched 39 Scud \nmissiles against Israel as a means to provoke the Israelis to \nretaliate. It was a desperate attempt to change the dynamic of a war \nthat was leading to a humiliating defeat. He hoped that Israel could be \ndrawn into the war and their involvement would cause the Muslim world \nto abandon the international coalition and rally to Saddam. The \nIsraelis did not take the bait. They endured missile attacks, refrained \nfrom retaliation and watched as coalition forces dictated terms to a \ndefeated Iraq.\n  Given Saddam's history and his options, it is highly probable that he \nwill once again seek to draw Israel into the conflict as a means of \nrallying the Muslim world to his cause. He has a limited number of \nmissiles to fire at Israel. However, it is likely that Palestinian \nforces like Hamas and Hezbollah will launch either sympathetic or \nexplicitly coordinated attacks against Israel. This later dimension was \nnot such a formidable factor in 1991. Today, the potential for suicide \nattacks and widespread violence in the West Bank and elsewhere in \nIsrael is more pronounced.\n  According to Western and Israeli intelligence sources, Hezbollah \nmilitants in southern Lebanon are reported to have amassed thousands of \nsurface-to-surface rockets with ranges sufficient to strike cities in \nnorthern Israel.\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\n  The administration hopes that the government of Israel will exercise \nthe same restraint that it showed in 1991. That might be a forlorn \nhope. On September 26, Prime Minister Sharon said, ``If Iraq attacks \nIsrael, but does not hit population centers of cause casualties, our \ninterest will be not to make it hard on the Americans. If on the other \nhand, harm is doneto Israel, if we suffer casualties or if non-\nconventional weapons of mass destruction are used against us, then \ndefinitely Israel will take the proper action to defend its citizens.'' \nWe all recognize the right of Israel to defend itself. The Prime \nMinister's first responsibility is to his people.\n  But we also understand that Israeli retaliation would put great \npressure on Muslim countries to either end any support for United \nStates efforts or to actively oppose our efforts. Here again, a strong \nargument can be made that an operation sanctioned by the United Nations \nmight give these countries sufficient justification to participate with \nthe international community rather than oppose efforts to decisively \ndeal with Saddam.\n\n  We are prepared militarily to counter all of these Iraqi threats. Our \nfirst priority will be to establish an air defense system to protect \nour forces as they enter the region. Our ground based air defense \nbatteries and active aerial patrolling will help mitigate any potential \nIraqi threat from the air. We have had extensive collaboration with \nIsrael on the development of their Arrow air defense system. This \ncollaboration and other collaborative efforts will be accelerated to \nhelp ensure that any potential Iraqi attack on Israel will be \nfrustrated.\n  In the conduct of offensive operations, we will prepare the \nbattlefield with intensive air strikes. But, one of the factors that \nmust be considered in this air campaign is the inadvertent release of \nchemical or biological agents as a result of our bombing. Press stories \nsuggest that the Iraqis have placed sensitive installations in urban \nareas as a way to protect them from the expected air campaign. We could \ndiscover that we have unwittingly created a chemical or biological \nrelease that would be exploited by the Iraqi government not as \nconfirmation of their treachery but as an attack on our conduct of the \noperation.\n  Indeed, the potential use of chemical and biological weapons is one \nof the great uncertainties of a battle against Iraq. The President and \nSecretary Rumsfeld are trying to dissuade Iraqi field commanders from \ndeploying these weapons by sternly and correctly warning them that they \nwill be held accountable for war crimes.\n  It is an open question whether this warning will be effective with \nindividuals who owe their position and lives to Saddam and who would \nlikely face swift and fatal retribution from Saddam before they would \nbe subject to international law.\n  We are prepared to counter Iraqi responses to our military \noperations. But, there are certainly no guarantees that we can do so \nwithout significant casualties to our forces and to the civilian \npopulation. Much of the Iraqi response turns on the willingness of his \nforces to resist and to follow his supposed orders to employ weapons of \nmass destruction. It is difficult to predict these dimensions of \nloyalty and morale. But, this battle seems likely to produce more \ncausalities and costs than the Persian Gulf war for the simple reason \nthat the President has repeatedly associated our use of force with \nregime change. In a battle to remove Saddam from power, his desperation \nand the desperation of his loyalists will cast this as a battle to the \ndeath. Unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of dictators is that many \npeople suffer and die, many innocent people, before they meet their \ndemise.\n\n  We will prevail in any battle against Iraq. But, military victory \nbrings with it a host of other problems. Again, an examination of these \nissues strongly suggests that our tasks would be immensely aided if we \ninitiated our operations with the broadest possible international \ncoalition vested with the authority of the United Nations.\n  The Administration's avowed policy of ``regime change'' combined with \nthe discretion to wage a unilateral attack on Iraq will inevitably lead \nto the indefinite occupation of Iraq by United States forces. Such an \noccupation will be expensive and will impose significant stress on our \nmilitary forces that are already ``stabilizing'' Afghanistan, Bosnia, \nKosovo, and other areas across the Globe.\n  Moreover, governing Iraq is not one of the easiest tasks. It is a \ncountry with at least three major factions; the Kurds in the North, \nSunni Muslims in the Center and Shiite Muslims in the South. The \npotential for disintegration along ethnic and religious lines is \nsignificant.\n  Our tasks in Iraq will be immensely complicated by the probable \ndamage resulting from the military campaign. Although we will deploy \nprecision missions and will be acutely conscious of minimizing \ncollateral damage, a ``scorched earth'' policy by the Iraqis compounded \nby the possible release of toxic agents and the possibility of \nextensive combat in built-up areas may lead to significant damage and \nsignificant civilian casualities.\n\n  Again, after the battle, we would look for international assistance \nto rebuild Iraq. That assistance would be more forthcoming if we \ninitiated operations with international support rather than without it.\n  Even before calculating the costs of postwar reconstruction of Iraq, \nwe must recognize that military operations in Iraq will be expensive in \ndirect costs and could have significant and detrimental effects on our \neconomy.\n  Estimates of the direct cost of an attack on Iraq range from $50 \nbillion to $200 billion. For perspective, the gulf war cost about $80 \nbillion in direct incremental costs, and our allies paid much of this \nexpense.\n  Indirect effects on our economy are hard to estimate, but there is \ngreat concern that military operations in Iraq will further complicate \na fragile economy.\n  One of the most potentially volatile economic aspects of a war in \nIraq will be its effect on the price of oil. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, ``the effect of a sudden and sustained \nincrease in the price of oil could deepen an existing recession or push \nan already weak economy into recession.''\n  Our occupation of Iraq will place us in control of the world's second \nlargest oil reserves. Directly or indirectly, we will become a major \nforce in the international politics of oil. That fact will not be lost \non other producing nations and the world at large. There is a real \ndanger that our motivation to remove Saddam will be ignored or quickly \nforgotten, and our attack on Iraq will be seen as old fashion \nimperialism. Once again, this perception is most likely to develop if \nwe conduct our operations unilaterally.\n  To date, the administration has not publicly suggested how they \nintend to deal with Iraqi oil. This is a major issue of international \nimportance touching the economic, diplomatic and security priorities of \nthe world.\n\n  A unilateral attack by the United States will engender worldwide \ncriticism as already suggested by the comments of many leaders around \nthe world and reflected in public opinion in many countries. A swift \nvictory without significant casualties or damage will mute this \ncriticism in many quarters, but it will not easily extinguish the \nresentment of our ``go it alone'' policy. A difficult and costly \nstruggle will accelerate this criticism and create problems that will \ninhibit diplomatic and economic progress on other fronts.\n  One of the unintended consequences of a unilateral assault on Iraq \nmay be our efforts on the War on Terror; the unfinished business of \ncompletely destroying Al Qaida before they strike us again. Despite all \nthe good faith assurances of military leaders that they will not lose \nfocus on the War on Terrorism, the scale of the proposed operation, the \nnotoriety and the huge risks involved will inevitably draw resources \nand attention from the War on Terror. Further complicating our efforts \non the War of terror is the real possibility that many countries that \nare now assisting us will greet future requests with studied \nindifference or denial.\n  The President asks for the authority to use force unilaterally. This \nrequest must be viewed in the context of the newly promulgated National \nSecurity Strategy. The core of this new strategy rejects deterrence and \nembraces preemption.\n  According to this strategy, the United States has long maintained the\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\noption of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our \nnational security. The greater the threat, the greater the risk of \ninaction--and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory \naction to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time \nand place of the enemy's attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile \nacts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act \npreemptively.\n  There is no argument that the United States, like every nation, \nretains the right to defend itself from an imminent hostile act. But, \nthis strategy goes much further. It appears to be based not on the \nimmediacy of a hostile act but simply on the ``sufficiency'' of the \nthreat. It fails to make any distinction based on the nature or timing \nof the threat. As such, it can be applied or misapplied to a wide range \nof adversaries.\n  There is no question that the United States must act preemptively \nagainst terrorist like al-Qaida. The nature of the threat and the \nimmediacy of the threat leave no other option. Al-Qaida has no \nsignificant and identifiable institutions, resources or assets to hold \nhostage as a means of changing behavior. Al-Qaida has no significant \nand identifiable institutions, resources or assets to hold hostage as a \nmeans of changing behavior. Al-Qaida makes on pretense of attempting to \nparticipate in the international system of nation states. Al-Qaida is \nnot motivated by calculated self interest as much as it is motivated by \nan apocalyptic impulse for the destruction of its enemies and the \nritual sacrifice of its adherents. There is no choice but to seek out \nthese terrorists and destroy them before they attack us again.\n  But al-Qaida is different that many threats that face us. And, \nextending this notion of preemption and bolstering it in resolutions \nthat give the President authority at his discretion to conduct \nunilateral military operations starts us down a potentially dangerous \npath.\n  We are debating Iraq today, but will we apply this preemptive \ndoctrine to Iran or North Korea tomorrow? How do we prevent others from \nadopting this same strategy if we have enshrined it as the centerpiece \nof our policy? For example, how to we counsel the Indians to refrain \nfrom preemptively attacking Pakistan or vice versa? From New Delhi or \nIslamabad, the threat looks ``sufficient'' and striking first is \nenticing.\n  In this first test of the President's new National Security Strategy, \nwe should be very careful to define the scope of his authority to avoid \nbeing swept up in a doctrine that appears to have few limits.\n  Our continuing confrontation with Iraq is fraught with danger and \nchallenge. Much is uncertain, but I believe that one point is quite \nclear. Leading an international coalition to enforce United Nations \nresolutions, as the President spoke of in Cincinnati, is the surest way \nto reduce the dangers and ensure the long-term success of our policy. \nIt is for this reason that I support the Levin resolution.\n  Great events will turn on our deliberations. But, at this moment, my \nthoughts are not on historic forces. Rather, I think about the young \nAmericans who will carry out our policies. They are prepared to \nsacrifice everything. We owe them more than we can ever repay. One \nthing that we certainly owe them is our best judgment. I have tried to \ngive them mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for the opportunity to go forward.\n  I rise tonight to express my views on what has become the overriding \nissue before the Senate and our Nation as we close out the 107th \nCongress: the authorization of the use of military force against Iraq \nand in what context and under what circumstances such an operation \nmight take place.\n  This issue has been one on which I have given much thought and \ncareful analysis. This decision quite literally has life-and-death \nimplications, not just for our courageous men and women in uniform but \nfor all Americans across our homeland, for your family and mine.\n  No decision we take can weigh more heavily on our hearts and minds, \nparticularly in light of the exposed vulnerabilities and tragic events \nof September 11, 2001. This is as important an issue as any of us will \never face. It requires a sober and calculating weight of the costs and \nbenefits to our Nation.\n  Ultimately, our decision will shape the nature of the U.S. leadership \nas the first among equals in the post-cold-war world, and our decision \nsets a precedent for ourselves and for those who take our lead in the \n21st century for good or evil.\n  No one argues that Saddam Hussein's brutal and criminal regime should \nbe tolerated. He and his regime are evil. We all accept that Hussein \nuses torture and terrorism to advance his political goals. He \nconstructs palaces while his people starve. He stockpiles biological \nand chemical weapons. At times, these weapons of mass destruction have \nbeen unleashed against the Iraqi people and his enemies.\n  All of us are concerned that the Iraqi regime is seeking to develop \nnuclear weapons contrary to international law and U.N. resolutions. \nWith deference to these circumstances and probable facts, the United \nNations and the world community must act swiftly and decisively in \nresponse to the Iraqi threat.\n  As my colleague Senator Kerry said earlier today: The question is not \nwhether Saddam Hussein should be held accountable to disarm; the \nquestion is how. Should disarmament be imposed by the United States \nalone or with the weight of global public opinion behind it? To answer \nthe question how, one needs to consider the context of the broader role \nAmerica plays as a single remaining superpower.\n  As I see it, America should make every effort to build a global \ncoalition to achieve our objective of disarming Iraq. This effort \nshould be considered our first priority in these grave circumstances. \nBuilding an international coalition will give moral authority to our \nchallenge, share the sacrifices that will be incurred, and set a \npositive precedent for the future in foreign relations among nations.\n  The benefits of working cooperatively with other countries have been \na cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II. \nThat is why the United States worked to create the United Nations in \nthe very first instance.\n  Strangely, this administration has sometimes appeared to consider \nmultilateral support for a military campaign to be an unnecessary \ninconvenience. Even in light of our unprecedented international support \nand cooperation following the tragedy of 9/11--some 90 nations if I am \nnot mistaken--it was only after the President delivered his September \n12 speech at the United Nations that he began visible and serious \noutreach to the global community.\n\n  This week, the President in his speech in Cincinnati went further to \nembrace a multilateral approach. I support what he expressed in that \nspeech. In my view, we must reinforce his recent instincts. We all know \nat the end of the day the United States always retains the inherent \nright to act unilaterally in self-defense. With that understanding, I \nbelieve strongly we must not stop pursuing, however, the support of the \nworld community before acting alone.\n  The United States may be the strongest country in the world \nmilitarily. We still need allies. We need help with logistics. We need \nintelligence cooperation and overflight rights to help us succeed. That \nis in the short run. And after the military campaign is over, we will \nneed help in the long run reconstructing Iraq and rebuilding a civil \nsociety. But if the world community is not with us when we take off, it \nwill be hard to ask for their help when we land.\n  Our Nation has been well served if we share the human and financial \nsacrifices required to prosecute the war and keep the peace, and we \nwill be well served in the future if we follow that pattern. Unless we \nhave the support of\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\nour allies, it will be difficult to ask them for humanitarian \nassistance in helping to feed, clothe, and heal the Iraqi people or \nreestablishing the rule of law.\n  It will be difficult to ask for assistance for peacekeeping and \nnationbuilding activities. In the past, the current administration has \nbeen somewhat reticent to support these kinds of operations. As a case \nin point, we relied on the armed forces of other countries, for \nexample, to restore law and order in Afghanistan. Yet if other \ncountries had not been committed from the beginning, they would have \nbeen much less likely to participate once the fighting was over.\n  Unilateralism also brings with us great costs--most importantly, \ncosts in the precious lives of our men and women in uniform, people who \nserve us bravely.\n  It also brings us costs as we saw in the gulf war. The United States \nhad relatively low out-of-pocket expenses. The reason was, we had a \ncoalition of nations. Although the Congressional Research Service notes \nthat war cost about $80 billion, much of that was covered by allied \ncontributions.\n  Without allies, the United States, it is projected, will have to \nshoulder by itself the $100 billion to $200 billion pricetag suggested \nby the administration for the current war. I have seen higher \nestimates. It really depends on how long our participation in the \npeacekeeping and nationbuilding efforts will go on afterwards.\n  It should not be lost on the American people that we are still in \nKorea, 50 some years after our intervention. In other words, \nunilateralism is expensive and its cost--crowd out other priorities on \nthe Nation's agenda from our first responders to our first graders.\n  Unfortunately, by authorizing force before a multilateral approach \nhas been devised, the President's resolution provides no assurance that \nthe world community will be actively involved in either the military \ncampaign or, more importantly, the reconstruction efforts.\n  In the long run, the Bush doctrine of unilateral preemption embedded \nin the underlying resolution would set an awful example for the world \ncommunity--a precedent based on the concept of survival of the fittest.\n  For generations, the United States has decried the aggression of \nforeign governments across the globe. We fought the patriotic and just \nfights against the Nazis and Communists who sought world domination. \nHow in the future can we criticize Russia for attacking Georgia or stop \nIndia from taking action against Pakistan or believe Taiwan will be \nsafe from China? Many countries may feel threats, continuing or \nimminent. They, too, could argue preemptive rights. The underlying \nresolution would codify the Bush preemption doctrine in precedent and \ncould undermine our moral authority and leadership credibility in \nlimiting future conflicts around the globe.\n  Furthermore, by advancing a policy of unilateral preemption, we could \nbe encouraging state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran and Syria to \nform unholy alliances with just the kinds of agents of terror that \ncaused the horrific events of September 11. Iran, Iraq's mortal enemy, \nactually opposes a U.S. invasion of Iraq. Why is that? Perhaps because \nIran fears that if the U.S. attacks Iraq today, we might attack Iran \ntomorrow. Clearly, the thawing of relations between these two U.S. \nadversaries should give us pause. One can only wonder what Iran's \ninstructions to their agents of terror will be in a world where they \nfeel threatened under a preemption doctrine.\n  Earlier this week, Senator Graham introduced an amendment which \nauthorized the President to use force against several identified \ndangerous terrorist groups, including Iranian-linked Hezbollah and \nHamas. I supported that amendment because I believe that those foreign \nterrorist organizations represent an even higher order risk to American \nsecurity than Iraq.\n  Like al-Qaida, these organizations have the clear means of delivery. \nThese terrorist groups may already be operating in our homeland. I am \nconcerned that, at some level, Iraq may be a dangerous distraction from \nAmerica's war on terrorism. While the United States military has \ncertainly disrupted the activities of the al-Qaida network, no one \nshould doubt that al-Qaida and its sympathizers continue to operate. \nThe administration tells the American people this almost every week.\n  These groups continue to plot ways to undermine the American way of \nlife and our security. As the United States considers its future course \nof action with respect to Iraq, a potential threat, we must assure the \nAmerican people that we will not be distracted from the effort to \ndestroy a proven threat, al-Qaida and these other terrorist \norganizations. That should be our No. 1 priority. It certainly has been \nin repeated statements by the President. I am also concerned that the \nresolution we have before us is structured with an overly broad scope. \nIt refers to UN Security Council resolutions that are unrelated to the \nprimary goal of disarming Iraq and eliminating its delivery capacity of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  We must remember that the threat we feel is not from the Iraqi people \nbut from the criminal regime's control of weapons of mass destruction. \nAnd second, because the underlying resolution refers to UN Security \nCouncil Resolution 678, a resolution that discusses the importance of \nreturning security to the ``area,'' we may inadvertently be permitting \nmilitary action beyond Iraq. Potentially, some of these structural \nconcerns were addressed by other resolutions that were circulated \nincluding one drafted by Senators Biden and Lugar.\n  There were attempts to define away some of the broader aspects of the \nconcerns I relate to in the underlying Lieberman-Warner resolution, but \nI am fearful, as I have suggested, that by their reference to other \nU.N. resolutions that may not be the case.\n  I certainly believe we could have done better through the Biden-Lugar \napproach.\n  Finally, I am troubled my the fact that Congress is being asked to \nmake a decision on a matter of this gravity without being fully \ninformed with all relevant intelligence. It is an unfortunate fact but \nmany of us, and I can speak for myself, have often learned more by \nreading the New York Times and the Washington Post than by attending \nthe secret briefings provided to Senators.\n  Even today, we hear about a conflict between what it is the CIA says \nis the likely response of the Saddam Hussein regime when they no longer \nhave other options and would be the case as presented by the \nadministration.\n  In the future, I hope that the administration will be more open \nearlier with secure briefings in the process so that Members of \nCongress can make fully informed decisions. I think they should be \nbuilt upon true intelligence.\n  It is in this overarching context, that I will cosponsor and strongly \nsupport the Levin amendment which authorizes the use of force pursuant \nto a new UN security council resolution demanding swift council \nresolution demanding swift, certain, and unconditional inspections and \nIraqi disarmament. The Levin amendment in no way comprises the US' \ninherent right to self-defense or Congress' ability to authorize \nunilateral actions if the UN fails to act. But it embraces the \nmultilateral approach as a first priority.\n  This course of action, will bring with it all the benefits I have \nsought to outline, a multilateral approach, without giving up the right \nof unilateral approach as a last resort. In my judgment, the Levin \namendment embraces the need for the U.S. to lead a dangerous world to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein today with a multilateral approach, while setting \na pattern and precedent that provides for greater security to the \npeople of the United States and around the world.\n  That security will be in today's circumstances but it will equally be \ntrue as a guide to the future by its precedent. As a matter of \nconscience, barring substantive changes, I intend to oppose the \nunderlying Lieberman-Warner resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do think our distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey stressed the sense of urgency that is upon us right now when \nhe said perhaps the greatest decision we will have to make during the \nterms we are serving is going to be tomorrow. I think that is probably \nright. Even though I disagree with many of the things he stated, I \ncertainly respect\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\nhim for the commitment and belief he has in his interpretation of the \nfacts and the course we should take.\n  I have been listening for quite a number of hours now, and I quite \nfrankly have to say it has not been all that easy. I believe tomorrow \nwe will give the President of the United States the full support of \nthis body in order to send the right message to Saddam Hussein and to \nterrorists all over the world, and that message is this: The United \nStates of America will not live in fear.\n  I have ended every speech I have made since 1995 with one sentence, \nand I feel compelled to start this speech with that sentence. That \nsentence is that we today are in the most vulnerable and threatened \nposition we have been in in our Nation's history.\n  In January 2002, our President gave a magnificent State of the Union \naddress. He said:\n\n       Our enemies send other people's children on missions of \n     suicide and murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause \n     and a creed. We stand for a different choice, made long ago, \n     on the day of our founding. We affirm it again today. We \n     choose freedom and the dignity of every life.\n\n  The handwringers have already marshaled their special interest groups \nto delay this body from giving our President the homeland security bill \nhe asked for way back in June. And just like the homeland security \nbill, they are trying to weaken the President's ability to protect this \nNation with a hollow resolution against Iraq.\n  We are going to have to give the President the flexibility he needs \nto protect this Nation. Making the potential use of U.S. military force \ncontingent upon the current deliberations of the U.N. Security Council \nis absurd. Our national security must not be tied to the actions of the \n``mother of all handwringers,'' the United Nations.\n  I keep hearing a grinding noise. It is our forefathers turning over \nin their graves. Can they really believe this Nation would get into the \nposition where we would have to ask some multinational organization \nbefore our President had the right to defend America? I think not. And \nwhy are we letting the same groups of individuals that have prevented \nus from getting a homeland security bill, during a time of war, by the \nway, from supporting the President of the United States? What is next? \nDo they want us to go to the United Nations to get a homeland security \nbill?\n  The American people have to wonder about this one simple question: \nWhy do those who oppose the President's resolution trust the United \nNations more than they trust the President of the United States?\n  The United Nations did not stop in 1992 the threat of 100 servicemen \nin Yemen. The United Nations did not stop the 18 rangers from dying in \nSomalia or their naked bodies from being dragged through the streets of \nMogadishu. The United Nations did not stop the World Trade Center, the \nfirst bombing in 1993. They did not stop Khobar Towers in 1996. They \ndid not stop the Embassy bombings of Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. They \ndid not stop or prevent the loss of 17 sailors' lives in Yemen in 2000. \nThe United Nations did not stop the airplanes from flying into the \nWorld Trade Center, into the Pentagon, and the field in Pennsylvania. \nThe United Nations will not stop Saddam Hussein from giving a nuclear \ndevice to a terrorist, putting it on an airplane and flying it into an \nAmerican city. Of course, this time, instead of 3,000 deaths, there \ncould be hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n  I often remember the television scenes, the horrible scenes from New \nYork City of the airplanes hitting into the World Trade Center. Then I \nthought, if that had been the weapon of choice of a terrorist--in other \nwords, a nuclear warhead on a missile--there would be nothing left but \na piece of charcoal. We would not be talking about 3,000 lives, we \nwould be talking about 2 or 3 million lives.\n  Why should the President of the United States delegate his \nresponsibility of protecting this Nation to the United Nations? We made \na similar mistake back in 1998. Look where it has gotten us. In 1998, \nin an attempt to get the Iraqi regime to comply with the U.N. \nresolutions--doesn't that sound familiar--the administration blessed \nSecretary Annan's trip to Baghdad, and in doing so let the United \nNations negotiate on behalf of the United States, which proved to be a \nvery serious mistake. Part of that particular agreement was the \nrecognition of the eight palaces as special sites. And that compromise \ncontinues to haunt us today. The administration should not have let the \nUnited Nations negotiate and compromise for the United States in 1998. \nAnd the current administration should not do it now and will not do it \nnow.\n  My distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, likes to say: Saddam is looking down the barrel of a gun. He \nshould be looking at the international community at the other end, not \nthe United States.\n  While I respect my friend and colleague and admire his passion behind \nhis convictions, I could not disagree more. Saddam Hussein has been \nlooking down the gun barrel of the international community for 11 \nyears. The problem is that he knows the gun is full of blanks. The \nIraqi regime knows the United States does not shoot blanks, which is \nwhy they continue to manipulate and deceive the United Nations.\n  I know our Secretary of State is working very closely with the \nmembers of the Security Council in order to get a U.N. resolution \nagainst Iraq that is not full of blanks. I hope he has already \nexpressed to the Security Council this Nation is united, and with the \noverwhelming support of the American people and this Congress in the \nform of support of the President's resolution, we choose to exercise \nour right to defend ourselves. How unreasonable of us.\n  We have the right under international law to defend ourselves. \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states: Nothing in the present \ncharter shall impair the inherent right of an individual or collective \nself-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United \nNations.\n  The current Iraqi regime has been harboring and supporting terrorist \nnetworks since the early 1990s. We know that, maybe before that. We \nhave been under attack ever since. I challenge any of my colleagues to \ntell any of our brave soldiers who fly combat planes over Iraq every \nday that the surface-to-air missiles Iraq has been firing is not a \nhostile act. Iraq forces have fired on U.S. and British pilots 1,600 \ntimes since 2000. Since September 18--remember what happened on \nSeptember 18 of this year--hours after Saddam Hussein promised to allow \nthe return of U.N. inspectors without conditions, he fired on American \nand British pilots 67 times. That is 67 times since September 18 when \nhe made the promise. Is anyone home? What message are we sending our \nbrave men and women in uniform if we only consider it a hostile act \nwhen one of those missiles hits an aircraft?\n\n  The message we must send our military, our allies, the United \nNations, and those who support the current Iraqi regime is that the \nUnited States of America chooses not to live in fear and we will defend \nourselves. That message will be sent with the overwhelming passage of \nthe President's resolution.\n  The Armed Services Committee recently had a series of hearings with \nformer civilian and military leaders regarding the Iraqi issue. My \nfellow colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been using some \nof the testimony of witnesses to make their case that the United States \nmust wait for the United Nations to make a decision. A lot of people do \nnot realize, but there are over 4,000 retired generals floating around \nthe country today. They have only found three who would agree with \nthem. So they went out and found the three who said we have to continue \nto wait for the United Nations to solve the Iraqi issue.\n  The fourth member of that panel, not quoted by any of my fellow \ncolleagues, disagreed with the other three generals. Lieutenant General \nMcInerney had the following comments about the suggestion of weakening \nthe President's authority. Members have not heard this from anyone, \njust the other three generals.\n  He said: If you water this down--talking about the President's Iraqi \nresolution--you are going to send a signal to al-Qaida. You may not \nwant to, but you are going to send it to Saddam and say, well, we don't \nquite trust them. The signal you want to send is this nation is united. \nYou want to send that\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\nto the U.N. because I happen to believe--which is different than \nGeneral Clark--I happen to believe this strong signal will ensure that \nwe have a better chance of getting it through the United Nations.\n  That is what General McInerney said at the same time the other three \ngenerals said we need to decide what fate the United Nations will give \nthis great country.\n  Saddam Hussein is an evil man. He butchered his own people. Everyone \nagrees. He butchered members of his own family, two of his own sons-in-\nlaw. He must be stopped. He will be stopped. Each day that goes by he \ngets stronger. There are those who believe the President has not made a \nstrong enough case. They say: Where is the evidence? Why now? \nAdditional inspections will work, and we do not want another Vietnam.\n  To them I ask, Are they more concerned about a war that took place \nover 30 years ago, or the tragic events that took place on September \n11?\n  As I stand here today, is there more likely to be another Vietnam or \nanother September 11?\n  The President asked a critical question the other night. He said, if \nwe know Saddam has dangerous weapons today, and we do, does it make any \nsense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger \nand develops even more dangerous weapons? I know what the people of \nOklahoma are more concerned about. The people of Oklahoma are well \naware of what can happen when evil people unleash weapons of terror.\n  Go back and listen to the speeches the President gave to the U.N. on \nSeptember 12 and in Cincinnati on October 7. He has made his case. He \nhas made it to the United Nations, the Congress, and most importantly \nto the people of the United States. The threat is real. And with every \nday of delay and deceit the menace grows stronger.\n  The current Iraqi regime will continue to use the United Nations as \nhis tool until he gets what he may be close to having--a nuclear \nweapon. It may have been the right decision not to go after Saddam \nHussein in 1991, just like it may have been the right decision for the \nprevious administration not to go after Osama bin Laden in the 1990s \nwhen they had the opportunity to do so. But is it right to go after \nthem both today? I believe it is.\n  The big question is does he have a nuclear weapon? The scary thing \nis, no one is able to say that he does not. Does he have a delivery \nsystem? Nobody is in a position to say that he doesn't. This Congress \nis going to do the right thing. This Nation is united. We will defend \nourselves. This Congress must once again unite as we did following the \ntragic events of 9/11.\n\n  There is another statement a President made following another tragic \nevent in our history. Some of you may remember. The President was \nmotored from the White House to the Capitol under heavy security. The \nAmerican people were full of emotions, from apprehension to anger. \nAfter being greeted by rounds of loud applause, the President of the \nUnited States addressed the Joint Session of Congress. Here is a quote \nfrom that speech. You have to listen to this, Mr. President. This is a \nlong quote. This is what the President said:\n\n       The facts . . . speak for themselves. The people of the \n     United States have already formed their opinion and well \n     understand the implications to the very life and safety of \n     our Nation. As Commander in Chief, I have directed that all \n     measures be taken for our defense. Always will we remember \n     the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long \n     it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the \n     American people in their righteous might will win through to \n     absolute victory. I believe I interpret the will of Congress \n     and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend \n     ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that \n     this form of treachery shall never endanger us again. \n     Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our \n     people, our territory, and our interests are in danger. With \n     confidence in our armed forces--with the unbounded \n     determination of our people--we will gain the inevitable \n     triumph--so help us God.\n\n  The date of that speech was December 8, 1941. President Franklin \nRoosevelt gave the speech. Pearl Harbor and the war that followed led \nto the restructuring of our national security structure.\n  Today, more than 1 year since 9/11, an ongoing war against terror, \nand a possible conflict with Iraq, we, the Congress, have not given the \nAmerican people a homeland security bill and some Members of Congress \nwant to put the security of this country in the hands of the United \nNations.\n  I repeat, did our forefathers ever believe we would have to go to a \nmultinational organization in order to defend America?\n  The President of the United States during a time of war has asked \nCongress to give him support to show the world that this Nation is \nunited. He has requested the Congress give him the necessary \nflexibility to protect the homeland, to protect the Nation. Telling the \nPresident that he must first bow to the will of the United Nations is \nthe wrong message. Here we are today, just like with the homeland \nsecurity issue, letting the hand wringers drive the debate in a \ndirection that has nothing to do with the task at hand.\n  We are going to have to and will give the President an Iraqi \nresolution that does not tie his hands. The Secretary of Defense has \nsaid--and I think this is so important for us to understand today, for \nall of us, for all Americans to understand. He said:\n\n       If the worst were to happen, not one of us here today will \n     be able to honestly say it was a surprise. Because it will \n     not be a surprise.\n\n  Mr. President, I remember so well--I am old enough to remember World \nWar II. I was a very small child. I remember going to a country \nschoolhouse named Hazel Dell. It was way out in the country. We had \neight grades in one room with a pot-bellied stove there and a \nschoolteacher named Harvey Beam. He was a giant of a man, but I suspect \nhe wasn't quite as big as I thought he was at the time.\n\n  I remember studying American history and studying about how we won a \nwar and won the freedom in this country against impossible odds, and \nhow the greatest army on the face of this Earth was coming over from \nGreat Britain and marching toward Lexington and Concord, and here we \nwere, a handful of hunters and trappers with homemade weapons. We fired \nthat shot heard round the world.\n  A speech was made that I remember so well, in the House of Burgesses, \nwhen a tall redhead stood up and said:\n\n       Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those \n     means which the God of nature has placed in our power. Three \n     millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and \n     in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by \n     any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, \n     we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who \n     presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up \n     friends to fight our battles for us.\n\n  At that time, we fired the shot heard around the world. We knew we \nwere one nation depending on God to give us the strength to win a \nbattle that now historians say could not have been won. That was the \nsublime courage we had in this country, and now the hand wringers are \nback.\n  In 1996, we had an opportunity to end this whole thing, to get Saddam \nHussein. I suggest to you, if George W. Bush had been President in \n1996, we would not be here today. It is a no-brainer. It would have \nbeen done.\n  We had the opposition, including about 100,000 troops, well trained, \nand the Kurds in the north ready to join us, and we implied to them \nthat we would do that and we would together take out Saddam Hussein. \nWhat did we do? We turned our backs on them, and we walked away. \nSeveral thousand Kurds died as a result of that. Now they are back. \nThey are willing to join us again.\n  I wonder about this. Why is it that so many of the people I have \nheard on the floor of this Senate objecting to giving the President the \nrecognition he needs to do what he has to do, what is his \nconstitutional obligation--where were they in 1998, back when we had \nanother President, President Clinton, and he wanted to go after Saddam \nHussein? They were in line, saying: That's fine; let's go get him. Our \ndistinguished majority leader Senator Daschle said:\n\n       Saddam Hussein must understand that the United States has \n     the resolve to reverse that threat by force if force is \n     required. And I must say it has the will.\n\n  Senator Biden--I have the utmost respect for him. He came down to the \nfloor, and he is now saying we don't want to move too fast. Then he \nsaid we risk sending a dangerous signal to other proliferators if we do \nnot respond decisively to Iraq's intransigence. That\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\nwas 1998. What is different now? Nothing, except Saddam Hussein is \nstronger.\n  Does he have the weaponry? Does he have the weapons of mass \ndestruction? Does he have a nuclear warhead? We don't know for sure, \nbut we don't know he does not.\n  Let's go back to the Rumsfeld Commission. This is 1998. The Rumsfeld \nCommission was made up of, I don't know, 16 or 18 of the very top \nmilitary experts in this country. They said that U.S. intelligence was \nshocked by a 1990 Iraqi test of a long-range booster rocket, showing \nIraq was involved in an extensive, undetected, covert program to \ndevelop nuclear capability ballistic missiles with intercontinental \nrange. That was 1990.\n\n  People keep saying: Oh, no, this is not going to happen; they don't \nhave this. I remember in 1998, it was August 24 when our intelligence \nsaid that it would be something like 5 to 15 years before North Korea \nwould have a multiple-stage rocket. That was August 24, 1998.\n  Seven days later, on August 31, North Korea fired one. We know when \nthe weapons inspectors came back in 1998 after Saddam Hussein kicked \nthem out, they came before our committee. I can tell you exactly--I \nhave the transcript over here--what they said. By and large, this was \nit. For the sake of time, I say in response to our question, in 1998--\nthis is the weapons inspectors who were over there:\n\n       How long would it be until Saddam Hussein has the weapons \n     of mass destruction capability, including nuclear, and a \n     missile with intercontinental range to deliver those?\n\n  The answer was he could have it in 6 months. That was 1998. George \nTenet at that time said:\n\n       I agree with that testimony.\n\n  Unclassified intelligence told us that China was transferring \ntechnology of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and missiles to \nIraq.\n  On August 24, in the Washington Times, it was revealed the \nintelligence community warned President Bush that weapons of mass \ndestruction could be on their way in a very short period of time.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago, from a satellite image, we were able \nto photograph trucks, 60 trucks that were moving around--a biological \nlab that we knew was a weapons lab. They are up to something. Every day \nsomething has happened. The intelligence report to the administration \nwas that Saddam Hussein is preparing to use weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  On September 27, Rumsfeld said there is solid evidence that Saddam \nHussein is negotiating for weapons of mass destruction with al-Qaida--\nthey are negotiating with each other, I mean.\n  With all these things that we know are going on today, why is it that \nwe are sitting around, wringing our hands? We don't know that he \ndoesn't already have it, but we do know this. Every day that goes by, \nevery week that goes by, he has a greater opportunity to have these.\n  So, I look at this and I think that we have to remember what \nSecretary Rumsfeld said when he talked about the consequences. He said:\n\n       The consequences of making a mistake during the days of \n     conventional warfare meant that we might lose 100, maybe 200 \n     lives. But the consequences of making a mistake now could \n     mean hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\n  I think tonight we have the Churchills and the Chamberlains. Tomorrow \nwe are going to have a lot more Churchills than Chamberlains and we are \ngoing to stop the hand wringing. It will all stop tomorrow, and we are \ngoing to give the President of the United States the resolution that he \nknows he needs in order to have the full support of Congress and the \nAmerican people behind him to do what he knows he must do in defending \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n              Modification to Submitted Amendment No. 4869\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared with the minority.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask unanimous consent to \nmodify his amendment No. 4868 to remove paragraph 2, and further I ask \nconsent to modify amendment No. 4869 to change references to section \n3(a) to 4(a).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4869), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, in the USA PATRIOT Act, we provided \ntemporary immigration relief for lawful nonimmigrants who are survivors \nof the September 11 attacks. This relief ended last month, and it has \nproved to be too short. A single year is not sufficient time for these \nfamilies to sort out their affairs before returning to their native \nlands.\n  Senator Corzine has introduced legislation to help these people, most \nof whom are the spouses and children of H-1B and other highly skilled \ntemporary workers killed in the terrorist attacks. S. 2845 would allow \nthese family members to remain in the United States for an additional \nyear to deal with the very real challenges these families face.\n  They have been in mourning for a year. Many have not recovered the \nremains of their loved ones and are waiting for DNA analyses of the \nsamples collected from the attack site. Some families have children \nenrolled in American schools. Many of these families are still waiting \nfor awards from the Victims' Compensation Fund. Some have homes that \nmust be sold or other financial matters that need to be settled. Many \nof them are participating in support groups with other September 11 \nsurvivors groups that simply do not exist in their native lands.\n  Consider the case of Tessie Forsythe. Tessie's husband Christopher \nworked\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\nfor Cantor Fitzgerald. He had an H-1B visa, which expired in April. The \nrest of the family received H-4 visas, so their lawful status in the \nU.S. was dependent on him.\n  Christoper left behind two children Jose and Kirsten. Tessie is not \nKirsten's mother, but she is seeking to adopt Kirsten because Kirsten's \nbirth mother has had extensive mental health problems and has no \ncontact with Kirsten. The judicial process began in the United States, \nand if the family leaves the country now, the adoption proceeding could \nbe jeopardized. In addition, shortly after her husband's death, Tessie \nwas mugged and hospitalized for 3 months with extensive injuries.\n   Christopher's remains have not been recovered, though DNA samples \nfrom Kirsten have been submitted and are being analyzed. Like many of \nthe survivors, Tessie has not yet received an award from the Victims' \nCompensation Fund.\n  Consider the case of Sonia Gawas. Her husband Ganesh Ladkat was also \nemployed by Cantor Fitzgerald. The couple had been married just 9 \nmonths when the terrorist attacks killed Ganesh. Sonia suffers from a \ncondition know as ``delayed grief,'' where the death of a loved one is \nnot accepted until long after the event took place. In this case, \nwithout any remains or proof that here husband was dead, Sonia's \ngrieving period did not begin until it became clear to her that Ganesh \nwas in fact a victim of the attack. Acceptance of his death plunged \nSonia into a severe depression.\n  The catastrophic nature of the terrorist attacks had made the \nrecovery process far more difficult. Sonia is receiving counseling and \nattends support groups that are not available in her native country. \nThis unusually long grieving period has taken a toll on Sonia's ability \nto make arrangements for her return. She is still waiting to receive \ncompensation from the Victims' Fund.\n  These brave families should not have to face the specter of \ndeportation while still in the process of grieving for their loved ones \nand settling their affairs. An additional year will provide an \nopportunity to attend to their affairs and undertake the sad task of \ndismantling their lives in the United States. We need to help these \ndeserving families by enacting this legislation as soon as possible, so \nthat these families will not face deportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10218-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HOLD TO NOMINATION OF GROVER J.

Mr. President, in June I introduced S. 2633, the Reducing \nAmerica's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, also known as the RAVE Act. \nSince that time there has been a great deal of misinformation \ncirculating about this legislation. I rise today to correct the record. \nSimply stated, my bill provides technical corrections to an existing \nstatute, one which has been on the books for 16 years and is well \nestablished.\n  Critics of my bill have asserted that if the legislation were to \nbecome law ``there would be no way that someone could hold a concert \nand not be liable'' and that the bill ``holds the owners and the \npromoters responsible for the actions of the patrons.'' That is simply \nuntrue. We know that there will always be certain people who will bring \ndrugs into musical or other events and use them without the knowledge \nor permission of the promoter or club owner. This is not the type of \nactivity that my bill would address. The purpose of my legislation is \nnot to prosecute legitimate law-abiding managers of stadiums, arenas, \nperforming arts centers, licensed beverage facilities, and other venues \nbecause of incidental drug use at their events. In fact, when crafting \nthis legislation, I took steps to ensure that it did not capture such \ncases. My bill would help in the prosecution of rogue promoters who not \nonly know that there is drug use at their event but also hold the event \nfor the purpose of illegal drug use or distribution. That is quite a \nhigh bar.\n  I am confident that the overwhelming majority of promoters are \ndecent, law-abiding people who are going to discourage drug use, or any \nother illegal activity, at their venues. But there are a few promoters \nout there who are taking steps to profit from drug activity at their \nevents. Some of these folks actually distribute drugs themselves or \nhave their staff distribute drugs, get kickbacks from drug sales at \ntheir events, have thinly veiled drug messages on their promotional \nflyers, tell their security to ignore drug use or sales, or send \npatients who need medical attention because of a drug overdose to a \nhospital across town so people won't link emergency room visits with \ntheir club. What they are doing is illegal under current law. My bill \nwould not change that fact. Let me be clear. Neither current law nor my \nbill seeks to punish a promoter for the behavior of their patrons. As I \nmentioned, the underlying crack house statute has been on the books \nsince 1986, and I am unaware of this statute ever being used to \nprosecute a legitimate business.\n  The RAVE Act simply amends the current crack house statute in two \nminor ways. First, it clarifies that Congress intended for the law to \napply not just to ongoing drug distribution operations, but to single-\nevent activities, such as a party where the promoter sponsors the event \nwith the purpose of distributing Ecstasy or other illegal drugs. After \nall, a drug dealer can be arrested and prosecuted for selling one bag \nof drugs, and the government need not show that the dealer is selling \nday after day, or to multiple sellers. Likewise, the bill clarifies \nthat a one-time event where the promoter knowingly distributes Ecstasy \nover the course of an evening, for example, violates the statute the \nsame as a crack house which is in operation over a period of time. \nSecond, the bill makes the law apply to outdoor as well as indoor \nvenues, such as where a rogue rave promoter uses a field to hold a rave \nfor the purpose of distributing a controlled substance. Those are the \nonly changes the bill makes to the crack house statute. It does not \ngive the Federal Government sweeping new powers as the detractors have \nasserted.\n  Critics of the bill have also claimed that it would provide a \ndisincentive for promoters to take steps to protect the public health \nof their patrons including providing water or air-conditioned rooms, \nmaking sure that there is an ambulance on the premises, et cetera. That \nis not my intention. And to underscore that fact, I plan to remove the \nfindings which is the only place in the bill where these items are \nmentioned, from the bill. Certainly there are legitimate reasons for \nselling water, having a room where people can cool down after dancing, \nor having an ambulance on hand. Clearly, the presence of any of these \nthings is not enough to signify that an event is ``for the purpose of'' \ndrug use.\n  The reason that I introduced the RAVE Act was not to ban dancing, \nkill the ``RAVE scene'' or silence electronic music, all things of \nwhich I have been accused. Although this legislation grew out of \ntestimony I heard at a number of hearings about the problems identified \nat raves, the criminal and civil penalties in the bill would also apply \nto people who promoted any type of event for the purpose of drug use or \ndistribution. If rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as \nthey are so often advertised, as places for people to come dance in a \nsafe, drug-free environment, then they have nothing to fear from this \nlaw. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or \nexpression--it is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect \nkids.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to correct the record about what my \nlegislation does and does not do. I hope that all of my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10218-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10218-S10219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 8, \n2000 in Providence, RI. Two young gay men were severely beaten by two \nstrangers. The assailants drove by the young men, shouting vulgarities \nand anti-gay slurs. After making two passes, the perpetrators got out \nof the car, shouted more anti-gay slurs, and proceeded to punch and \nkick the victims in the head and body. The attackers fled after \nwitnesses called for help.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10219-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A HOLD ON EXTENDING CHAPTER 12 BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleagues \nthat I have requested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement \nbefore the Senate proceeds to the consideration of H.R. 5472 or any \nother legislation extending chapter 12 bankruptcy. While I am a strong \nsupporter of chapter 12--in fact I was the author of chapter 12--I \nbelieve that these changes should be enacted as part of the \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report, which includes \nprovisions making permanent chapter 12 and extending other important \nfamily farmer protections in bankruptcy.

MARK McCLELLAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, I joined my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in \nunanimously approving the nomination of Mark McClellan to be \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. I rise now to \nstrongly urge the Senate to immediately act on the nomination.\n  Dr. McClellan is not a stranger to the Senate. During his service on \nthe Council of Economic Advisors, many of us have benefitted from his \nexpertise, clear-headed analysis, and sound advice concerning health \npolicy matters. Dr. McClellan has served the President well and I know \nthat he will continue to serve the Nation well as the next Commissioner \nof the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Mark McClellan is an excellent choice to lead the FDA. He is a \ntalented academician and economist who has helped challenge \nconventional thinking about important health policy matters through \ngroundbreaking research. He is a gifted health policy analyst who has \nworked to improve the Nation's health care system for all Americans. \nPerhaps most importantly, he is also a physician who has cared for \npatients and knows first hand that there are few greater callings than \nhelping to heal one's fellow man.\n  Mark McClellan is uniquely qualified to lead this important agency at \nthis critical time.\n  The challenges confronting the next Commissioner of the FDA are \ngreat, perhaps greater than at any other time in our Nation's recent \nhistory.\n  Of course, the FDA has an important, ongoing role to play in ensuring \nthe safety and efficacy of drugs, biologics, food, cosmetics, blood \nproducts, and devices, goods and products accounting for nearly one-\nquarter of all consumer spending in the United States. But the FDA \nCommissioner must be more than simply the head of a large, regulatory \nGovernment agency. He must also provide strong leadership on a broad \nrange of critical health policy issues that directly affect the lives \nand well-being of every American.\n  I would like to highlight some of the issues on which it is critical \nthat the FDA Commissioner provide leadership at this time. The most \nsignificant issue we have faced over the past year is terrorism. On \nSeptember 11 we endured the most horrendous attack on American soil \nsince Pearl Harbor. This week, we mark the 1-year anniversary of the \nworst attack of biological terrorism in this country. We cannot know \nwhen, where, or in what form the next attack will happen, but we must \nbe prepared. This includes speeding the review and approval of rapid \nassays, vaccines, and other necessary bioterrorism countermeasures. \nNumerous scientists and research facilities are working to meet the \ncall of the President and Congress to protect our homeland from outside \nthreats. The FDA must help fashion an environment in which these \ndiscussions are encouraged and translated to medical practice.\n  At the same time, we cannot ignore naturally emerging threats to the \nsafety and sustainability of our blood, tissue and organ supply. Last \nweek, it was reported that 40 people were exposed to hepatitis C from a \nsingle organ and tissue donor and salmonella was transmitted through \nblood transfusions. This is in addition to the growing body of \nknowledge we are amassing on West Nile virus. Considered together with \nthe existing shortage of blood, tissue and organ donors, the need to \nspeed the development of new screening and purification products is \nclearly illustrated.\n\n  Finally, I would like to highlight the importance of promoting a \nregulatory environment that values innovations to improve patient care \nand consumer safety, while at the same time safeguarding the public \nhealth. But this must be done without contributing unnecessarily to \noverall rising health care costs or allowing basic medical treatments \nto be forgotten. We presently face just this situation with our \nNation's vaccine supply. Currently, only four manufacturers produce \nvaccines and they face the multiple challenges of a growing litigation \ncrisis and changes in the FDA's regulatory oversight. While most of the \nrecent childhood vaccine shortages have been alleviated, our system \nremains vulnerable to future shortages if we fail to act.\n  Mark has my full support, the full support of the HELP Committee, and \nI believe the full support of the Senate. It is in not only in our best \ninterest to see that his nomination is acted on quickly, but it is in \nthe best interest of the entire Nation for the Senate to confirm him as \nthe next Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. We cannot \nwait or allow the nomination to be delayed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10219-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10219-S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF TAX DOLLARS ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 2644, the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act, which was \napproved today by unanimous vote by the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nEarlier this week, the House of Representatives approved by voice vote \nthe companion measure, H.R. 468, sponsored by Congressman Toomey of \nPennsylvania.\n  I thank Chairman, Lieberman and Ranking Member Thompson for their \nsupport of this legislation, and Congressman Toomey for his leadership \nin the House on this significant issue.\n  This important legislation will increase the effectiveness of the \nChief financial Officers' Act by expanding to all executive agencies \nthe requirement that Federal agencies conduct independent financial \naudits. This bill will also subject agencies audited records to review \nby Congress and the administration.\n  As my colleagues well know, fiscal mismanagement by Federal agencies \ncosts taxpayers billions of dollars each year. The total amount of \ntaxpayer losses is probably much greater than we know, however, because \nmany agencies do not subject their budget reviews to the scrutiny of \noutside accountants. By requiring independent audits of all executive \nagencies, this bill will help make our Government more accountable to \nthe taxpayers. The agencies covered by this bill have a combined annual \nbudget of tens of billions of dollars--budgets that represent taxpayer \ndollars that should be accounted for more rigorously.\n  I was dismayed to learn that under current law, only the 24 largest \ndepartments and agencies--and a few others specified by Congress--are \nrequired to\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\nsubmit their books to outside auditors. The Accountability of Tax \nDollars Act of 2002 would require all executive agencies to prepare \naudited financial statements and subject those statements to an \nindependent audit.\n  I was especially surprised to learn that current Federal law does not \nrequire the Securities and Exchange Commission--the entity with which \npublicly held companies are required to file their audited financial \nstatements--to subject its own books to the scrutiny of outside \nauditors. Other Government agencies, including the Federal Trade \nCommission, the Consumer Product Safety Administration, the Federal \nElection Commission, the National Endowments for the Arts and \nHumanities, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal \nCommunications Commission--agencies that spend billions of taxpayer \ndollars every year--have also been exempt from this legal requirement.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, have been very critical of the \nalleged accounting abuses by some of this Nation's largest corporations \nthat have recently been brought to light. Particularly in light of \nthese recent revelations, it is incumbent on Congress to ensure that \nthe Federal Government, at the very least, meets the same standards \nthat we set for the private sector.\n  It is my hope that subjecting Federal agencies to congressional and \nexecutive oversight will provide an incentive for agencies to improve \ntheir financial performance or risk possible elimination. Independent \naudit opinions should contribute to increased Government efficiency by \nproviding information that can be used to strengthen integral \naccountability, better monitor assets and liabilities, enhance cost \ncontrols, identify inefficiencies and weaknesses, and curb Government \nwaste.\n  S. 2644, the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, would extend \nthe Chief Financial Officers' Act requirements currently imposed on the \nmajor agencies to all executive branch agencies.\n  The act gives the Office of Management and Budget the authority to \nwaive the audit requirement for smaller agencies that have annual \nbudgets of less than $25 million. In order to allow agencies some \nadditional time to meet this new standard of accountability, the bill \nallows the OMB Director discretion during the first 2 years of the \nact's implementation to waive the application of the new requirements \nto any agency.\n  This bill has bipartisan support as well as the support of the \nGovernment Accounting Office and the administration.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this important good Government \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10220-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF MAURA HARTY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to place a hold on the \nnomination of Ms. Maura Harty to be Director of the Office of Consular \nAffairs within the Department of State. Ms. Harty was voted out of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations today by voice vote. My reason for \nplacing a hold on this nomination is to hear from Ms. Harty regarding a \nnumber of controversial cases that were under her jurisdiction as an \nemployee of the Office of Consular Affairs.\n  First, I am seeking to know more about cases of international child \nabductions, which have left many parents frustrated with our \nGovernment. Many parents do not believe that Ms. Harty, in her capacity \nas the Managing Director of the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, \nvigorously pursued the interest of American abducted children.\n  Second, I wish to convey my concerns about personal appearance waiver \nprograms, such as Visa Express. I am seeking assurance from the nominee \nthat visa issuing procedures will be improved, and future \nrecommendations from the inspector general will be seriously considered \nby the Office of Consular Affairs.\n  Finally, I intend to question the nominee on allegations that she \nfired an employee for blowing the whistle on a Foreign Service national \nwho committed visa fraud. I have been a longtime champion for \nprotecting the rights of those who shed light on the problems in our \nGovernment, so I take these allegations very seriously and look forward \nto hearing from Ms. Harty regarding this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10220-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10220-S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DECOMMISSIONING OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD CUTTER ``SEDGE''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ndistinguished history of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Sedge which will \nbe decommissioned November 15, 2002, after serving 50 years in Alaskan \nwaters, and to honor the many men and women who have served aboard her.\n  The Sedge, a 180-foot seagoing buoy tender with a complement of 7 \nofficers and 54 enlisted personnel, was the 35th of the original 39 \nbuoy tenders built for the U.S. Coast Guard. Commissioned on July 5, \n1944, the Sedge began her long service with an assignment in Hawaii. \nShortly after arriving in her new home port of Honolulu, she was called \ninto service to support wartime operations. She served in the Pacific \ntheater from 1944 to 1945, tending navigation aids in Guam, Okinawa, \nAnguar, Midway, Pearl Harbor, and Shanghai.\n  On February 26, 1947, the Sedge was decommissioned and mothballed. \nBut the old girl's life was not over. She was recommissioned in \nSeattle, Washington on April 14, 1950, with orders making Boston, MA, \nher new homeport. However, on May 1, new orders sent the Sedge to \nKodiak, AK, instead.\n  After 7 years of service in Kodiak, the Sedge was transferred to \nCordova, AK on July 15, 1957, serving there for almost 16 years. In the \nSpring of 1973, the Sedge shaped a course for the Coast Guard Yard in \nCurtis Bay, MD, for major renovation. She came out of the yard with a \nnew lease on life--updated propulsion machinery, a new hydraulic buoy \nhandling system, a bow thruster and improved quarters.\n  After about a year of work, the Sedge was recommissioned and departed \nfor yet another new homeport: Homer, AK. She arrived in Homer on \nNovember 8, 1974.\n  The Sedge's primary duty is to maintain aids to navigation that make \nmaritime travel possible and safe. For the last 28 years, she has \nmaintained 73 shore aids and 19 buoys in and around Alaska's Cook \nInlet, and she has done it well. But throughout her history she has \nalso done her duty on other matters: national defense, search and \nrescue, maritime law enforcement, and environmental protection.\n  In the early 1950s, radar stations in the Arctic--the DEW Line--\nneeded regular servicing and supplies. Convoys would meet in Nome, AK, \nfor the voyage, and the Sedge was there. This included the year she was \nlocked in the ice pack for 3 days, and the year she was called on to \nrescue an LST that was in severe danger in an Arctic storm.\n  n 1962, she rescued six people who had been adrift in a life raft for \n5 days.\n  After the gigantic Alaska earthquake of 1964, the Sedge helped \nevacuate people from stricken towns and villages in Prince William \nSound. She braved many difficulties including the unpredictable seas \nand tides after the earthquake, including one unheard of minus 30-foot \ntide that put her hard aground in Prince William Sound.\n  In 1989, she was back in the Prince William Sound for another \ndisaster. She was the first Coast Guard cutter to respond to the Exxon \nValdez oilspill. The Sedge helped skim 4,000 barrels of oil off the \nwater soon after the incident. Afterwards, the crew of the Sedge \nconstructed a lighted tower on Bligh Reef, the shoal on which the Exxon \nValdez ran aground.\n  The history of the Sedge contains too many such stories of lives \nsaved and lives touched to relate them all. Suffice it to say that the \nmen and women who have served on board the Sedge have earned the many \naccolades and honors they have received, including the Coast Guard \nMeritorious Unit Commendation, the World War II Victory Medal, the Navy \nOccupation Service Medal, the Coast Guard Special Operations Service \nRibbon, the Department of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award, the \nCoast Guard Unit Commendation, the Coast Guard ``E'' Ribbon, the Coast \nGuard Bicentennial Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Coast Guard Arctic Service Medal, and the Humanitarian \nService Medal.\n  The Sedge will work her last aid to navigation on November 5, 2002, \nbefore her scheduled decommissioning on November 15, 2002. She will be \nreplaced\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\nnext summer by the USCGC Hickory, a brand-new seagoing buoy tender, but \nshe will not be forgotten.\n  I am proud to commemorate the decommissioning of this great ship, the \nSedge, and to honor the distinguished achievements of the officers and \nenlisted personnel who have served our Nation so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10221-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n ON THE WORK OF ANNE AND KIRK DOUGLAS, HONOREES, TREE-PEOPLE'S EVENING \n                      UNDER THE HARVEST MOON EVENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Collaborating \nwith TreePeople's Campus Forestry Program, community members and \norganizations, Anne and Kirk have helped fund new playground equipment, \ntree planting, outdoor classrooms, and other worthy projects throughout \nLos Angeles County.\n  Improving schools is a wonderful community service. Because of Anne \nand Kirk's work, many children can play on safe equipment, enjoy the \nbeauty and shade trees provide, and admire the natural environment. \nAnne and Kirk have every reason to be proud of their dedication to \nimproving the lives of countless children.\n  The Anne and Kirk Douglas Playground Award not only makes schools \nbetter, but also strengthens the bond among community members. Parents, \nstudents, school staff and local businesses work together for the \nbetterment of the community. This is truly a win-win situation for all \ninvolved.\n  I am proud to extend my sincere congratulations to Anne and Kirk on \nthis special honor from TreePeople, and wish them much continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10221-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF SHEB WOOLEY\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and \nrecognize a fine American treasure. This talented individual has \nenjoyed a remarkable career in the entertainment industry spanning from \nthe hills of Hollywood to the recording labels of Nashville.\n  This gentleman's name is Mr. Sheb Wooley. Mr. Wooley is currently in \npoor health and I would like to take this opportunity to wish him well \nand reflect upon his many accomplishments.\n  Sheb Wooley is a genuine American cowboy who throughout his early \nyears earned a living on the rodeo circuit. Born in Erick, OK, in 1921, \nSheb, who grew up facing the harsh realities of the Dust Bowl during \nthe 1930s, turned to entertainment after his father traded a shotgun \nfor a guitar.\n  Sheb's first encounter with the music industry occurred in Nashville \nin 1945 when he signed a deal with the Bullet record label and WSM. He \nthen ventured west to Fort Worth, TX, for a regular radio spot. While \nin Texas, upon the advice of a friend at WSM, Sheb decided to try his \nluck as an actor in California. Soon after his arrival in Hollywood, \nSheb appeared in several western films and worked with such film heroes \nas Errol Flynn and John Wayne. His most notable film was ``High Noon'' \nin which he played an outlaw gang leader opposite the town sheriff, \nGary Cooper. During his movie career he appeared in several more films \nincluding ``The War Wagon,'' ``Outlaw Josie Wales,'' ``Rio Bravo,'' \n``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' and ``Hoosiers.''\n  In 1958, Sheb was cast in the role of Pete Nolan on the popular \ntelevision series ``Rawhide,'' and later made many television \nappearances including the ``Ed Sullivan Show,'' ``Lone Ranger,'' \n``American Bandstand,'' ``Hee Haw,'' and ``Murder She Wrote,'' writing \nseveral scripts along the way.\n  While Sheb was enjoying his time on the screen, he was also working \non writing country music. After several attempts, Sheb landed a smash \nhit with ``Purple People Eater.'' In 1959 this tune climbed the pop \ncharts and eventually became one of MGM's most successful singles of \nall time.\n  And then there was Ben Colder, the drunken persona that Sheb created \nand ultimately played as a cast member on the television series, ``Hee \nHaw.'' Under the guise of Colder, Sheb performed many hit parodies of \nthe country music artists of the 1960s, including ``Don't Go Near the \nEskimos.'' In 1969, Sheb wrote and recorded the theme song for ``Hee \nHaw.''\n  The career of Sheb Wooley has been as colorful as the characters he \nhas played on and off the screen. He has won many accolades over the \nyears, including the Western Heritage Award for 9 consecutive years and \nSongwriter of the Year in 1992. He never strayed far from his roots and \nalways knew how to rope in an audience. I wish him well and pray that \nhis health returns to him soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10221-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO KEVIN DILLON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Kevin \nDillon of Prospect, KY, for winning the top honor in a recently held \nnational essay competition sponsored by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation. This competition was judged by Members of Congress, \nauthors, and national health reporters.\n  The American Psychiatric Association accepted up to five essays from \neach State; 14 States participated in this year's competition. This \nyear's essay topic was ``When not to keep a secret.'' In his essay, \nKevin provides his readers with a very real and very frightening \nscenario. The story describes a scenario in which someone is feeling \ndown and confides in a friend that he plans to commit suicide. Kevin \noffers two possible endings to his essay. In the first instance, the \nfriend reports the suicide plan to the police, who intervene and save \nthe boy's life. In the other scenario, no one intervenes, the boy kills \nhimself and his friend is left with an enormous amount of guilt and \nregret.\n  Mr. President, Kevin Dillon, a sophomore at St. Xavier High School, \ndeserves to be applauded for tackling such a difficult and important \nissue in such an elegant and stylistic manner. His story depicts the \nideal situation when keeping a secret becomes a detrimental and \ndangerous act for all parties involved. Once again, I congratulate \nKevin Dillon for this distinction and urge him to continue to take on \nthe tough issues this Nation faces today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10221-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10221-S10222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. ALBERT JOHNSON\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the ongoing \nefforts of my friend and fellow Tennessean, Mr. Albert Wm. Johnson of \nNashville. Mr. Johnson is chairman and CEO of Dobson & Johnson \nFinancial, a leading national mortgage banking advisory firm since its \nfounding in 1955.\n  Let me say that Albert Johnson continues to enjoy a remarkable life. \nUpon graduation from college, he entered the military service as an \naviation cadet en route to a distinguished military career. Mr. Johnson \nflew 49 missions against German bombing targets in WW II before being \nshot down in Austria and becoming a prisoner of war, POW, until the end \nof the conflict. During his World War II service, Al Johnson \naccumulated numerous decorations, citations, and commendations, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross, DFC, with two Oak Leaf \nClusters. After the war, Mr. Johnson was a senior instructor assigned \nto assist the Tennessee Air National Guard until returning to Europe to \nagain serve with notable commendation on the NATO staff responsible for \nplanning Germany's integration into NATO.\n  Upon leaving active military service, Albert Johnson returned to \nNashville and cofounded Dobson & Johnson, thereby embarking on a \nbrilliant business career that has featured the holding of billions of \ndollars in residential mortgage loans in trust for State mutual saving \nbanks, insurance companies, pension funds, and private investors. His \nremarkable leadership in the mortgage banking and real estate industry \nhas received well-deserved national acclaim and his firm has been \nrecognized as one of the largest private business enterprises in \nNashville.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  In 1994, for his ``commitment to free enterprise, limited government, \ntraditional American values and strong National Defense,'' Albert \nJohnson received the Medal of Freedom from the National Republican \nSenatorial Campaign Committee thereby joining the ranks of other \ndistinguished recipients of that award, including former President \nRonald Reagan, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and \nRetired General Norman Schwarzkopf.\n  Recently, I have been advised that Mr. Johnson has embarked on a new \nundertaking that features a joint venture whose mission is to build \n20,000 private homes in Kabul, Afghanistan, using imported capital, \nlocal Afghanistan labor and materials, and fully funded mortgage loans \nwith no down payment and long-term rates to assist that country in \ndeveloping their infrastructure. This sounds like a daunting task. \nNevertheless, Albert Johnson of Nashville has a track record to suggest \nhe is the right man for the job.\n  There is very little that Mr. Johnson, an embodiment of American \nvalues, has not been able to achieve. To the extent that his ongoing \nefforts foster stability and peace in strife torn Afghanistan, I wish \nhim well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10222-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION'S 125th ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, animals and small children do not \nhave an adequate voice to speak for themselves. They often cannot tell \na parent or an owner that they don't like what they are doing or let \nthem know that they are unhappy or in pain. That is why organizations \nthat aid such vulnerable members of our society are so important. For \nthis reason, I rise today to recognize the American Humane Association.\n  Today marks the 125th anniversary of the founding of that \norganization. I could not be more proud to report that the American \nHumane Association, a Colorado organization, has made a solid career of \nfurthering the welfare of children and animals.\n  The American Humane Association is the only organization in the \ncountry that is dedicated to the protection and support of both animals \nand children. They have organized events such as Be Kind to Pets Week \nand Tag Day, to educate the public about the need to treat animals \nhumanely and the need to be sure that pets can be easily identified if \nthey are lost, to the Front Porch Project, a program to educate the \npublic on how to protect children in their communities from abuse. \nAmerican Humane also works to educate the public about the link between \nviolence to people and violence to animals.\n  For 125 years, the American Humane Association has worked, through \nprograms such as these and others, to assure that the interest and \nwell-being of children and animals are fully, effectively, and humanely \nguaranteed. I, for one, am grateful to the American Humane Association \nfor the work that they do, and have done, and wish them another 125 \nyears of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10222-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ENTITLED ``CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVES \n                     BEYOND APRIL 5, 2003''--PM 115\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves \nProduction Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)(2)), I am informing you of my \ndecision to extend the period of production of the Naval Petroleum \nReserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 2003, the expiration \ndate of the currently authorized period of production.\n  Enclosed is a copy of the report investigating the necessity of \ncontinued production of the reserves as required by section \n201(3)(c)(2)(B) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. \nIn light of the findings contained in the report, I certify that \ncontinued production from the Naval Petroleum Reserves is in the \nnational interest.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to extend the \nAdvisory Council on Graduate Medical Education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Kennedy to extend the authorization time for an advisory \ncouncil for graduate medical education. The Council on Graduate Medical \nEducation, COGME, was created by Congress in 1986 to provide an ongoing \nassessment of physician workforce trends, training issues and financing \npolicies, and to recommend appropriate Federal and private sector \nefforts to address identified needs. The legislation calls for COGME to \nadvise and make recommendations to the Secretary of the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services, the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions, and the House of Representatives \nCommittee on Commerce. In 1998, when we re-autohrized Title 7 programs, \nwe re-authorized the Council through September 30, 2002.\n  Unfortunately, we have not been able to fully review all of the \nprograms outlined in Title 7, including COGME. To give our Committee \nthe additional time to review this council, I am introducing \nlegislation today with Senator Kennedy to extend the time period for \nits authorization until the end of fiscal year 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 3084. A bill to provide for the conduct of a study concerning \nhealth services research; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize an Institute of Medicine study to examine the field of health \nservices research. The health services research is the primary source \nof information for policy makers, payers, managers, providers and the \npublic concerning the organization, financing and performance of the \nAmerican health care system. the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality, AHRQ, is the lead Federal agency in this effort. However, many \nother federal partners, most institutes at the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health \nResources and Services Administration, the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nDepartment of Defense, fund and use health services research \nextensively to advance their mission. The American health care system \nis facing significant problems with rapidly rising costs, a staggering \nnumber of uninsured, racial and ethic disparities, and a compelling \nneed for safer, higher quality care. In the post-September 11 \nenvironment, we add the need to assure adequate public health systems \nand emergency response capacity in hospitals. In this challenging \nenvironment, I am increasingly concerned that the information needed \nfrom research to address current and future problems in the American \nhealth care system may not be available when needed. Therefore, I am \nintroducing legislation today that requests AHRQ to contract with the \nInstitute of Medicine for a report on the adequacy of the organization \nand financing of the field of health services research for meeting the \nnation's future information needs. The report should focus on the \nFederal role in supporting health services research, and in particular, \nthe role of AHRQ in leading the federal effort and coordinating the \ncomplementary roles of other Federal agencies, as well as the private \nfoundations and corporations, that conduct and fund health services \nresearch.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3086. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage under the Medicare program for diabetes laboratory \ndiagnostic tests and other services to screen for diabetes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Access to \nDiabetes Screening Services Act of 2002. My colleague Senator Bingaman \njoins me in introducing this important legislation. This bill will \nprovide Medicare coverage for laboratory diagnostic tests and other \nservices which are used to screen for diabetes.\n  Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among adults in the United \nStates. Trend data indicate that by the year 2010 more than 10 percent \nof all Americans will have diabetes. Even today our Nation is feeling \nthe effects of this disease, diabetes is the Nation's sixth leading \ncause of death.\n  My own home State of Arkansas has had first-hand experience with the \nrising diabetes rates. Arkansas ranks fifth in the Nation for diabetes \nincidence. According to recent health statistics, diabetes is the \nseventh leading cause of death for Arkansans. Recent studies show that \n6.5 percent of all Arkansas adults have diagnosed diabetes, and over 1 \nmillion Arkansans are at risk for undiagnosed diabetes.\n  These rising rates are especially evident among our aging population. \nCurrently almost 7 million Americans age 65 and older, or 20 percent of \nseniors, have diabetes. Roughly 20 percent of seniors age 65 and older \nhave a newly identified condition called pre-diabetes. If left \nuntreated, pre-diabetes will develop into diabetes. An additional \n40,000 people living with diabetes and end-stage renal disease under \nthe age of 65 participate in the Medicare program.\n  Even more distressing is the fact that approximately one third of the \n7 million seniors with diabetes, or 2.3 million people, are \nundiagnosed. They simply do not know that they have this very serious \ncondition--a condition whose complications include heart disease, \nstroke, vision loss and blindness, amputations, and kidney disease.\n  Those in the medical community and the federal government are only \ntoo aware of the rising prevalence and serious nature of diabetes. The \nCenters for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services have recently joined together \nin a national education campaign to inform people about diabetes and \nencourage people age 45 and older to get screened for diabetes.\n  Unfortunately, current law does not allow Medicare to reimburse for \ndiabetes testing, even if a patient presents a physician with serious \nrisk factors for diabetes such as obesity, high blood pressure, or high \ncholesterol. Most shockingly, even if a patient is experiencing early \nevidence of diabetes complications like blindness and kidney disease, \nMedicare still cannot reimburse for diabetes testing.\n  This nonsensical omission of diabetes screening coverage is even more \nshocking in light of the fact that about 25 percent of the Medicare \nbudget currently is devoted to providing medical care to seniors living \nwith diabetes. In 1999, Arkansas spent $1.6 billion on direct and \nindirect costs of diabetes. Why would we continue to constantly react \nto the disease in this manner, instead of proactively providing \nscreening for our Medicare beneficiaries? This screening can identify \nthe disease, even before any symptoms have appeared, and has the \npotential to save and improve thousands of lives.\n  The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists strongly \nbelieves that patients with diabetes should be identified as early as \npossible in their illness. We have the technology to do this through \nscreening.\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n  I cannot overstate the need for this legislation. When faced with the \nrising prevalence of diabetes, the high percentage of seniors who \nalready have the disease, the alarmingly high number of seniors who \nhave diabetes but do not know it yet, and the high cost associated with \nits treatment, it is obvious that Medicare should provide coverage for \ndiabetes screening.\n  The American Diabetes Association has identified Medicare screening \ncoverage as their top legislative priority, and I have worked closely \nwith them to craft this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to \ngive serious consideration to the Diabetes Screening Act of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10225-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 337--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING WITH ILLUSTRATIONS OF A \nDOCUMENT ENTITLED ``COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, UNITED STATES SENATE, \n                     135TH ANNIVERSARY, 1867-2002''\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 157\n\n       Whereas there are more than 8,000,000 Americans who have \n     mental retardation or other developmental disabilities;\n       Whereas individuals with developmental disabilities include \n     those with mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, Down's \n     syndrome, epilepsy, and other related conditions;\n       Whereas individuals with mental retardation or other \n     developmental disabilities have a continuous need for \n     individually planned and coordinated services due to \n     substantial limitations on their functional capacities, \n     including limitations in at least 2 of the areas of self-\n     care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, \n     self-direction, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       Whereas for the past 2 decades individuals with mental \n     retardation or other developmental disabilities and their \n     families have increasingly expressed a desire to live and \n     work in their communities and to join the mainstream of \n     American life;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. \n     581 (1999), affirmed the right of individuals with mental \n     retardation or other developmental disabilities to receive \n     community-based services as an alternative to institutional \n     care;\n       Whereas the demand for community supports and services is \n     rapidly growing, as States comply with Olmstead and continue \n     to move more individuals from institutions into the \n     community;\n       Whereas the demand for community supports and services will \n     also continue to grow as family caregivers age, waiting lists \n     grow, individuals with mental retardation or other \n     developmental disabilities live longer, and services for such \n     individuals expand;\n       Whereas our Nation's long-term care delivery system is \n     dependent upon a disparate array of public and private \n     funding sources, and is not a conventional industry, but \n     rather is financed primarily through third-party insurers;\n       Whereas Medicaid financing of supports and services to \n     individuals with mental retardation or other developmental \n     disabilities varies considerably from State to State, causing \n     significant disparities across geographic regions, among \n     differing groups of consumers, and between community and \n     institutional supports;\n       Whereas aside from families, private providers that employ \n     direct support professionals deliver the majority of supports \n     and services for individuals with mental retardation or other \n     developmental disabilities in the community;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide a wide range \n     of supportive services to individuals with mental retardation \n     or other developmental disabilities on a day-to-day basis, \n     including habilitation, health care, personal care and \n     hygiene, employment, transportation, recreation, \n     housekeeping, and other home management-related supports and \n     services that enable these individuals to live and work in \n     their communities;\n       Whereas direct support professionals generally assist \n     individuals with mental retardation or other developmental \n     disabilities to lead a self-directed family, community, and \n     social life;\n       Whereas private providers and the individuals for whom they \n     provide supports and services are in jeopardy as a result of \n     the growing crisis in recruiting and retaining a direct \n     support workforce;\n       Whereas providers of supports and services to individuals \n     with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities \n     typically draw from a labor market that competes with other \n     entry-level jobs that provide less physically and emotionally \n     demanding work as well as higher pay and other benefits, and \n     therefore these direct support jobs are not currently \n     competitive in today's labor market;\n       Whereas annual turnover rates of direct support workers \n     range from 40 to 75 percent;\n       Whereas high rates of employee vacancies and turnover \n     threaten the ability of providers to achieve their core \n     mission, which is the provision of safe and high-quality \n     supports to individuals with mental retardation or other \n     developmental disabilities;\n       Whereas direct support staff turnover is emotionally \n     difficult for the individuals being served;\n       Whereas many parents are becoming increasingly afraid that \n     there will be no one available to take care of their sons and \n     daughters with mental retardation or other developmental \n     disabilities who are living in the community; and\n       Whereas this workforce shortage is the most significant \n     barrier to implementing the Olmstead decision, undermines the \n     expansion of community integration as called for by President \n     George W. Bush's New Freedom Initiative, and places the \n     community support infrastructure at risk: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SERVICES OF DIRECT \n                   SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government and \n     the States should work to advance our Nation's commitment to \n     community integration for individuals with mental retardation \n     or other developmental disabilities and to advance personal \n     security for such individuals and their families by making it \n     a priority to ensure a stable, quality direct support \n     workforce that provides services and supports for such \n     individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/09/senate-section/article/S10225-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10225-S10226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4858.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687 (1991), Iraq made a commitment--\n       (A) to destroy, remove, or render harmless all chemical and \n     biological weapons and stocks of agents and all related \n     subsystems and components and all research, development, \n     support, and manufacturing facilities related thereto;\n       (B) to destroy, remove, or render harmless all ballistic \n     missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers, and \n     related major parts and production facilities;\n       (C) not to acquire or develop any nuclear weapons, nuclear-\n     weapons-usable material, nuclear-related subsystems or \n     components, or nuclear-related research, development, \n     support, or manufacturing facilities; and\n       (D) to permit immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's \n     biological, chemical, and missile capabilities, and assist \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency in carrying out the \n     destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of all nuclear-\n     related items and in developing a plan for ongoing monitoring \n     and verification of Iraq's compliance.\n       (2) The regime of Saddam Hussein consistently refused to \n     cooperate with United Nations Special Commission weapons \n     inspectors in Iraq between 1991 and 1998 by denying them \n     access to crucial people, sites, and documents.\n       (3) On October 31, 1998, Iraq banned the United Nations \n     weapons inspectors despite its agreement and obligation to \n     comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     (1991).\n       (4) Iraq continues to develop weapons of mass destruction, \n     in violation of its commitments under United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 687 (1991) and subsequent resolutions, and \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass \n     destruction against its own people and other nations.\n       (5) The development of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq \n     is a threat to the United States, to the friends and allies \n     of the United States in the Middle East, and to international \n     peace and security.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL POLICY FOR UNITED NATIONS SECURITY \n                   COUNCIL ACTION ON IRAQ.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) supports the President's call for the United Nations to \n     address the threat to international peace and security posed \n     by Saddam Hussein's continued refusal to meet Iraq's \n     obligations under resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council to accept the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless of its weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons-\n     usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of \n     150 kilometers, and related facilities, and to cease the \n     development, production, or acquisition of such weapons, \n     materials, and missiles;\n       (2) urges the United Nations Security Council to adopt \n     promptly a resolution that--\n       (A) demands that Iraq provide immediate, unconditional, and \n     unrestricted access of the United Nations weapons inspectors \n     so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons-\n     usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of \n     150 kilometers, and related facilities are destroyed, \n     removed, or rendered harmless; and\n       (B) authorizes the use of necessary and appropriate \n     military force by member states of the United Nations to \n     enforce such resolution in the event that the Government of \n     Iraq refuses to comply; and\n       (3) affirms that, under international law and the United \n     Nations Charter, the United States has at all times the \n     inherent right to use military force in self-defense.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES \n                   PURSUANT TO A NEW UNITED NATIONS SECURITY \n                   COUNCIL RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--Pursuant to a resolution of the United \n     Nations Security Council described in section 3(2) that is \n     adopted after the enactment of this joint resolution, and \n     subject to subsection (b), the President is authorized to use \n     the Armed Forces of the United States to destroy, remove, or \n     render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear \n     weapons-usable material, ballistic missiles with a range \n     greater than 150 kilometers, and related facilities, if Iraq \n     fails to comply with the terms of the Security Council \n     resolution.\n       (b) Requirements.--Before the authority granted in \n     subsection (a) is exercised, the President shall make \n     available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination \n     that the United States has used appropriate diplomatic and \n     other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with a \n     resolution of the United Nations Security Council described \n     in section 3(2) and that those efforts have not been and are \n     not likely to be successful in obtaining such compliance.\n       (c) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution (22 U.S.C. 1544(b)).\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     joint resolution, and at least once during every 60-day \n     period thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing a summary of the status of efforts--\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\n       (1) to have the United Nations Security Council adopt the \n     resolution described in section 3(2); or\n       (2) in the case of the adoption of such resolution, to \n     obtain compliance by Iraq with the resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4864.

Mr. DAYTON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 4856 proposed by Mr. Lieberman (for himself, Mr. Warner, \nMr. Bayh, Mr. McCain, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Miller, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Helms, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Lott, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thompson, and \nMr. Nickles) to the joint resolution S.J. Res. 45, to authorize the use \nof United States Armed Forces against Iraq; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``SECTION 1.'' and insert the following:\n\n     SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Disarm Iraq Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (1) Since in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression \n     against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States \n     forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its \n     people in order to defend the national security of the United \n     States and enforce United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions relating to Iraq.\n       (2) Since after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq \n     entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement \n     pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other \n     things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical \n     weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them, \n     and to end its support for international terrorism.\n       (3) Since the efforts of international weapons inspectors, \n     United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led \n     to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical \n     weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and \n     that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program \n     that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than \n     intelligence reporting had previously indicated.\n       (4) Since Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the \n     cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons \n     inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which \n     finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on \n     October 31, 1998.\n       (5) Since in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing \n     weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United \n     States interests and international peace and security, \n     declared Iraq to be in ``material and unacceptable breach of \n     its international obligations'' and urged the President ``to \n     take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution \n     and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into \n     compliance with its international obligations'' (Public Law \n     105-235).\n       (6) Since Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the \n     national security of the United States and international \n     peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in \n     material and unacceptable breach of its international \n     obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and \n     develop a significant chemical and biological weapons \n     capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, \n     and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations.\n       (7) Since Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the \n     United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in \n     brutal repression of its civilian population thereby \n     threatening international peace and security in the region, \n     by refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi \n     citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American \n     serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully \n     seized by Iraq from Kuwait.\n       (8) Since the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     capability and willingness to\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\n     use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its \n     own people.\n       (9) Since the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the \n     United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate \n     former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of \n     occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged \n     in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council.\n       (10) Since members of al Qaida, an organization bearing \n     responsibility for attacks on the United States, its \n     citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred \n     on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq.\n       (11) Since Iraq continues to aid and harbor other \n     international terrorist organizations, including \n     organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American \n     citizens.\n       (12) Since the attacks on the United States of September \n     11, 2001, underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the \n     acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international \n     terrorist organizations.\n       (13) Since Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness \n     to use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current \n     Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a \n     surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces \n     or provide them to international terrorists who would do so, \n     and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the \n     United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine \n     to justify action by the United States to defend itself.\n       (14) Since United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent \n     relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain \n     activities that threaten international peace and security, \n     including the development of weapons of mass destruction and \n     refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections \n     in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687, repression of its civilian population in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and \n     threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in \n     Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 949.\n       (15) Since Congress in the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has \n     authorized the President ``to use United States Armed Forces \n     pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council \n     Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, \n     and 677''.\n       (16) Since in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense \n     that it ``supports the use of all necessary means to achieve \n     the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     as being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1),'' that \n     Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and ``constitutes a \n     continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of \n     the Persian Gulf region,'' and that Congress, ``supports the \n     use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688''.\n       (17) Since the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) \n     expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy \n     of the United States to support efforts to remove from power \n     the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a \n     democratic government to replace that regime.\n       (18) Since on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed \n     the United States to ``work with the United Nations Security \n     Council to meet our common challenge'' posed by Iraq and to \n     ``work for the necessary resolutions,'' while also making \n     clear that ``the Security Council resolutions will be \n     enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be \n     met, or action will be unavoidable''.\n       (19) Since the United States is determined to prosecute the \n     war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international \n     terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of \n     mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under \n     the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions make clear that it is in the national security \n     interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war \n     on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of \n     force if necessary.\n       (20) Since Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously \n     the war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and \n     funding requested by the President to take the necessary \n     actions against international terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations, including those nations, organizations or \n     persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the \n     terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or \n     harbored such persons or organizations.\n       (21) Since the President and Congress are determined to \n     continue to take all appropriate actions against \n     international terrorists and terrorist organizations, \n     including those nations, organizations or persons who \n     planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons \n     or organizations.\n       (22) Since the President has authority under the \n     Constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent \n     acts of international terrorism against the United States, as \n     Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40).\n       (23) Since Congress, under the Constitution, has the sole \n     authority to declare war.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to--\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable \n     to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies \n     with all relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 4.
