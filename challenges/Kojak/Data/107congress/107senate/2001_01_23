Mr. President, this morning, I, Senator Kennedy, \nCongressman Boehner, the Chairman of the House Education and Workforce \nCommittee, and Congressman Miller, the ranking Democrat of that \ncommittee, met with President Bush to discuss his very ambitious \neducation initiative.\n  The package the President is putting forward today contains several \nareas where there is general, bipartisan agreement for providing the \ntools necessary for every child to receive a quality education.\n  These areas include: strengthening accountability to improve student \nperformance; providing the funds necessary to prepare, recruit, and \ntrain high quality teachers; developing reading initiatives to ensure \nthat all students will be able to read by the third grade; \nstrengthening early childhood programs; creating a math/science \npartnership for states, colleges, and universities to strengthen K \nthrough twelve math and science education; providing activities related \nto technology as a means to boost student achievement; and giving \nschool districts the flexibility to be innovative in implementing \nreform.\n  All Americans agree that every child in this country deserves a high \nquality education. We at the federal level must remember that we do not \nnecessarily have all the answers for making high quality education \naccessible to all students. It is parents, teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, school personnel, state and local school board \nofficials, and students that have many of the answers.\n  The proposal outlined by President Bush is a very good framework \nwhich will go a long way in providing the assistance that is needed at \nthe state and local level to have a first-rate elementary and secondary \neducational system.\n  It is critical that all of us in the Senate and in the House join \nwith the President in making comprehensive education reform our top \npriority. It is essential to our economic survival.\n  Almost half of all adults have neither completed high school nor have \npursued any type of postsecondary education. Approximately twenty \npercent of all eighteen year olds do not graduate from high school.\n  The most recent Third International Mathematics and Science Study \nindicates that fourth graders performed well in both math and science \nin comparison to students in other nations. U.S. eighth graders \nperformed near the international average in both math and science, and \nU.S. twelfth graders scored below the international average and among \nthe lowest of the participating nations in general science knowledge.\n  It is perhaps this last statistic which has contributed to the fact \nthat half of all college students must take at least one remedial \ncourse at an annual cost of one billion dollars to the nation's public \nuniversities.\n  Last fall, Congress passed the American Competitiveness in the 21st \nCentury Act. This initiative raises the cap on the number of H-1B visas \nto 195,000 a year for the next three years.\n  The H-1B bill, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96-1, was needed \nbecause this nation is lacking a skilled workforce in the areas of high \ntech and health care.\n  I hope that the sense of urgency that prevailed regarding the passage \nof the H-1B bill will lead all of us to pass an education reform \npackage that will help create a workforce with the skills to meet the \nneeds of our local, regional, national, and international economies.\n  I look forward to working with the President, Secretary of Education, \nRod Paige, all members of the Health and Education Committee, all \nmembers of this body and our counterparts in the House to develop a \nbipartisan bill that passes the Congress with a final vote tally \nsimilar to the final vote cast on the H-1B bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that President Bush \ntoday has sent forth to the Congress a package of education reforms \nthat carries through on his promise to make improving the education of \nour children his top priority. I believe the program he has proposed \nsets forth the basis for a bipartisan reform bill that I hope we will \nvery shortly consider.\n  Last August, President Bush traveled to Maine with, Roderick Paige, \nnow his Secretary of Education, and met with educators from my State. I \nwas extremely impressed with his heartfelt commitment to improving the \neducation of all the children in America, and with the progress that he \nhas made in the State of Texas on what is perhaps the greatest \nchallenge our country faces; that is, narrowing the achievement gap \nbetween disadvantaged, low-income children and their more advantaged \npeers.\n  We know today that 70 percent of the fourth graders in the highest \npoverty schools cannot read at the basic level. That is both shameful \nand unacceptable, and it is a compelling reason why I so strongly \nsupport the President's pledge to leave no child behind. I am \nparticularly pleased that his education package contains two provisions \nthat will be very helpful to my home State of Maine.\n  I am very proud of Maine's public schools. We do very well in \nproviding a quality education for all of our children. But we, like the \nPresiding Officer, have many school districts that are very small. They \nfind it very difficult to cope with the rules, redtape and paperwork \nthat apply to literally hundreds of Federal programs. The President's \nproposal would allow school districts to consolidate many of these \nprograms and use the money for their most pressing needs. One school \nmay need to hire more math and science teachers. Another may need to \nhave computers in the classroom. Still another may need to provide a \nnew program for gifted and talented programs. Yet another may have new \nconstruction needs. By allowing more flexibility in the use of Federal \nfunds, President Bush has sent a strong signal that he trusts parents, \nteachers, and local school boards to know what is best for their \nstudents and give them the flexibility they need while holding them \nstrictly accountable for improved student achievement. Isn't that what \nreally counts?\n  We want to be certain that our children are learning. What we don't \nneed is too much or our educators' attention diverted to whether or not \nthey filled out some Federal form correctly. I am very pleased that is \nan important focus of President Bush's election package.\n  I am also delighted that he has included legislation authored by \nSenator Kyl of Arizona and myself that will allow teachers to have a \ntax deduction of up to $400 to help defray the costs when teachers, out \nof their own pockets, buy supplies for their classrooms. We all know \nteachers do this every day. Indeed, according to a study by the \nNational Education Association, the average K-12 teacher spends $408 \nannually on classroom materials. By enacting our proposal, we can send \na message of appreciation to teachers who are so dedicated to their \nstudents that they reach deep into their own pockets to buy supplies to \nenhance\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\ntheir classrooms. We ought to help these dedicated professionals defray \nthe costs associated with such classroom expenses.\n  I would like to see that bill broadened to allow all teachers to \ndeduct the costs of professional development courses they undertake at \ntheir own expense. I know in the State of Maine we have many dedicated \nteachers who, at their own expense, pursue their education to make them \neven better teachers. I think we should help defray those expenses as \nwell.\n  I look forward to working as a member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, with the Presiding Officer, Senator Judd \nGregg who has been such a leader on this issue, our distinguished \nchairman, Jim Jeffords, and with many on both sides of the aisle who \nare committed to the goals and the challenges the President has set \nforth for us today. The President has challenged us to ensure that \nevery child in America, no matter where she lives or the income level \nof her family, will have the very best public education possible. I \nintend to answer the President's challenge.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield any remaining time of my 5 minutes \nto Mr. Gregg, the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ncourtesy. I also wish to thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ncourtesy in allowing us to go in front of him even though he has been \nwaiting.\n  I want to join in congratulations of the President for putting \nforward his education package and fulfilling a promise he made during \nthe election, which was that education would be the President's first \nlegislative initiative. As such, he has put together a package which \nhas many very strong points which will significantly improve our \neducational system in this country. The package, as I would describe \nit, can be divided into four elements.\n  First, it focuses on children. It sees children as the fundamental \nelement of our educational system, which seems only logical but \nregrettably has not been true over the last few years. In fact, over \nthe past 20 years we have spent over $127 billion on title I, but \nrather than spending it on children and having it be child focused, it \nhas been institution focused or it has been bureaucracy focused. The \nPresident is shifting that title I money towards the child.\n  Second, the President is proposing much more flexibility to local \nschool districts, to the teachers, to the principals, and, most \nimportantly, flexibility to the parents because they are the folks on \nthe front line who are most concerned about the child's education and \nwho understand how best to do that.\n  The educational system changes from not only State to State, not only \ncommunity to community but literally classroom to classroom. The needs \nwithin a classroom are different. The needs in one first grade \nclassroom in the community are different from the needs in the first \ngrade classroom in another town in New Hampshire. Flexibility is \nextremely important. That is a major element of their initiative.\n  Third, the President has focused on academic achievement. What an \nimportant goal. But it is, unfortunately, a goal we have forgotten. In \nfact, we have forgotten it in such a way that today our low-income \nchildren aren't achieving at all. As I mentioned yesterday on the \nfloor, the average fourth grader from a low-income family is reading at \na second-grade level, below his peers, even though we have spent \nliterally billions of dollars focused on that low-income child. \nAcademic achievement is critical.\n  He has pointed to the fact that the academic achievement of the child \nbegins by having the child reach school ready to read. He has committed \na huge amount of resources and a number of new programmatic initiatives \nto make sure that when our children get to school they are ready to \nread because, as he has pointed out, if you leave a child behind in the \nfirst grade, that child never catches up; they fall further behind.\n  The fourth element is one of the core elements of his proposal. He \nhas talked about accountability. We are no longer going to send funds \nout to the communities without expecting results. We are no longer \ngoing to tolerate a system which leaves children behind, which says to \nchildren: We are simply going to shuffle you through the system; we are \ngoing to use the money for whatever happens to be the need for the day; \nbut if it doesn't improve the results, we are not going to be held \naccountable. We will teach new math, and if you don't learn any math, \nthat doesn't matter. If we teach you any methods of reading, and if you \ndon't learn, that doesn't matter; you will shuffle through the system.\n\n  The President has said that from now on we are going to expect \nacademic achievement and we are going to hold the systems accountable \nto results in academic achievement.\n  Those four goals are the right goals: Focusing the effort on the \nchild, giving flexibility to the people who know how to educate so they \ncan educate well, expecting academic achievement, and holding the \nschool systems and the administrators accountable for academic \nachievement. I congratulate all those initiatives. This is a huge \nconceptual package with a lot of different initiatives performed in a \nvariety of different ways.\n  I also hope we focus on moving down the educational road, the issue \nof special education, and the fact that we as a Republican Congress \nhave committed our effort to try to fully fund special education. \nCertainly I hope that will be carried forward. I know this President is \ncommitted to that approach, also.\n  Nothing will free up local dollars more effectively and make more \ndollars genuinely available for good education than if the Federal \nGovernment pays its fair share of special education so the local tax \ndollars can be used where the local community thinks they can most \neffective be used.\n  This package is a call to arms for an improvement in our educational \nsystem. It lays out specific guideposts of how to get there. I \ncongratulate the President for putting it forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S431-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for coming together \non the floor this morning. All Members who were present on Saturday for \nthe inauguration of the new President realize it was an exciting and \nhistoric moment for our Nation. The weather did not cooperate; it was \npretty miserable outside. We all felt honored to be there, to see once \nagain this unique part of American history where we transfer power \npeacefully, even when we have been fighting like cats and dogs between \nthe political parties leading up to the election.\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\n  I wish the new President the very best, even from this side of the \naisle. We are hopeful his leadership will be successful and that he \nwill bring our Nation together as he has promised.\n  We on the Democratic side have tried to be cooperative. There was a \nbrief moment which we affectionately refer to as the ``age of \nenlightenment'' where the Democrats were in charge of the Senate for \nabout 17 days and then the leadership was transferred again on Saturday \nback to the Republican side.\n  The President has sent us 13 nominations for the Cabinet which, of \ncourse, is his effort to bring his team together as quickly as he can. \nOn Saturday, immediately after the President was sworn in, we approved \n7 of those 13. To put that in context, when last we had a Democratic \nPresident and a Democratic Congress, on the first day after the \nswearing in, only three members of the Cabinet were approved.\n  We are doing our very best on a bipartisan basis to give the \nPresident his team. There will be several other nominees for the \nCabinet positions who will be considered this week. I assume most of \nthem will be approved by the Senate. There are two or three who are \ncontroversial that may take a little longer. We are going to try to \nmove, I am sure, in a reasonable manner to engage any floor debate and \nto reach a point where the President knows his team will be in place at \nsome close date.\n  I am happy that President Bush has made education the first issue. I \nthink that was the right choice, the right issue. Time and again when \nyou ask Americans, rich and poor alike, what is the most important \nissue facing America, the answer is always education. I think it is \nbecause the term ``education'' embodies so many ideas and concepts \nwhich we value in America. Education means opportunity. Education means \ngiving a person a chance to improve themselves. Education in our \nculture and economy means that a person of very humble origins can rise \nto a position where they can be successful in so many different ways. \nThat is why education should be the first issue that we debate.\n  I am hoping, after listening to the description of the President's \neducation package, there will be a lot of bipartisan agreement when it \ncomes to education. Some of the concepts that have been mentioned this \nmorning are certainly concepts I endorse. I think about my own home \nState of Illinois and the Chicago public school system. This is a \npublic school system which only a few years ago was written off by the \nSecretary of Education, Bill Bennett, as the worst in America.\n  I daresay today what is happening in Chicago is exciting, and in \nterms of big city school districts, may be one of the most promising \nprograms in the United States of America. The leadership of Mayor \nRichard Daley, the leadership of the President of the school board, \nGary Chico, and the CEO of Chicago schools, Paul Vallas, really took on \na major challenge. In the Chicago public school system, 95 percent of \nthe students are minority, 85 percent are below the poverty level. \nImagine, if you will, that as your student enrollment.\n  Consider that you inherit a school system that is almost dead last in \nAmerica in achievement. In a very short period of time, a few years, \nthey have turned that system around, and they have come a long way by \njust addressing a few basic principles. The principles are fairly \nobvious to all of us as parents who have had children who have gone to \nschool.\n  First is accountability at all levels so the administrators and \nprincipals are held responsible for bringing a team of teachers \ntogether, and the parents and students, in creating a successful \nlearning environment; accountability for the teachers so they come to \nthe class prepared and are good teachers; accountability for the \nstudents and their parents. All of these have come together. They have \nconceded that at times these experiments have failed.\n  There have been several occasions now when the Chicago public school \nsystem has announced a school has failed and they have basically taken \nthe team of administrators and teachers, brought them in and said: You \nare finished. You had your chance. We are not going to leave kids in \nthis classroom if they are not learning. This group is disbanded. We \nwill start over. They didn't tear the school down. They didn't close \nthe school. They said: We are going to bring a new group of teachers \nand administrators to give these kids a chance.\n  If I am the parent of a student in one of those classrooms, that is \nexactly what I want to see. It does me no good as a parent to know that \nthe school system is doing well. If my child is not doing well, I have \na responsibility as a parent to be part of that, too. So they bring the \nparents in to be part of this learning process.\n  So when I hear the question of accountability and President Bush's \neducation package, I endorse it. I think it is a sound idea. It is one \nthat we should include.\n  I might also say the idea of testing is one that I think is \nimportant. I hated tests as a student. Don't most? Most students would \nrather not take a test. A test is the only objective way in many \nrespects to measure progress. It is not the only way. Some students may \nnot test well but may be learning. We have to make that accommodation. \nBut using testing to measure the progress of a student makes sense.\n  The big debate around here is whether we have national testing. That \nis voluntary now in the United States and will probably continue to be. \nI invite those school districts that believe they are doing the right \nthing to voluntarily sign up for those tests that Chicago has. We as a \nnation shouldn't take any comfort in the fact that some school \ndistricts are doing well and some not so well. All those students are \ngoing to be our citizens and leaders of tomorrow. If they are not \nequipped and skilled, our Nation will suffer. When we have national \ntesting to determine whether or not the students in Oregon and the \nstudents in Oregon, IL, are learning math and learning science, and \nlearning what they need to succeed, I think it gives us a good idea as \nto whether our approach to education is succeeding as well.\n  We also, I hope, in the course of this bill, will address some \nfundamental changes in our vision of a schoolday. Why in the world do \nwe start a school- day at 8:30 in the morning and end it at 3 in the \nafternoon? There might have been a time when that made sense, but it \ndoesn't today. The vast majority of kids have their parents working, so \nthese kids get off school at 3 in the afternoon, in many cases without \nany adult supervision. Ask the police chief in your hometown what \nhappens at 3:30 at the mall or at the shopping center. Ask the people \nwho keep statistics at what period of time are teenage girls most \nlikely to become pregnant. Don't be surprised; it is in that period \nbetween 3 o'clock and when the parents finally get home from work.\n  So when we talk about afterschool programs, it is to provide positive \nadult supervision so kids can continue their learning experience. It \nmight not be the same learning experience as sitting in a classroom. \nPerhaps it will be music or art or sports or developing skills on \ncomputers. Perhaps it is just supervised time so they can do their \nhomework. But I think afterschool programs should be part of modern \nAmerica, to make sure parents can be confident their kids are using \ntheir time well.\n  The same thing with the summer school programs. Why do we still have \n3 months off in the summer? It is hard to explain. There was a time \nwhen kids had to get out of school to go help on the farm. That isn't \nthe big challenge today in most families. I think we ought to have \nsummer school, enrichment programs and tutorial programs so kids can \nuse that time as well.\n  So I think there are many things we can do in order to make our \neducational system better. I am glad the President has brought this \nissue to us. I believe he will find bipartisan support for many of his \nproposals on education.\n  There is one thing that was not mentioned on the other side in \ndescribing the President's plan, and I hope we can consider it. When \nthe American Society of Civil Engineers assessed the infrastructure of \nAmerica last year, the schools came in dead last. Our school buildings \nare old and crumbling. In many respects the schools are in worse shape \nthan our water treatment systems and our sewage treatment systems in \nAmerica. It suggests to me that school construction is a important part \nof a challenge to local property taxpayers in school districts and I \nhope we can include it in this debate.\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\n  The other issue that is going to be brought before us very quickly is \nthe whole question of a tax cut. There is nothing more popular for a \npolitician to suggest than: I am going to cut your taxes. Frankly, I \nbelieve there should be a tax cut in light of the enormous surpluses \nwhich our good economy, as well as the policies and programs of the \nlast few years, is generating. We have created a system where, for the \nfirst time, we are paying down the national debt. That has not happened \nfor 30 years. We are dealing with balanced budgets and paying down the \ndebt. But make no mistake, we are still at this point in time dealing \nwith a huge national debt.\n  I called this morning to the Department of the Treasury to ask them \nwhat is our current debt. They gave me the debt of America as of today. \nWhen you add that debt together here is what it comes to: \n$5,728,195,796,181. That is the accumulated debt of America that we \ncurrently have to pay off.\n  How do we pay it off? We reduce it as long as we are running \nsurpluses and don't spend them on something else. But each day in \nAmerica we collect $1 billion in taxes from wage earners, from \nfamilies, from businesses, from farmers, and that money is used \nexclusively to pay interest on the old debt. It does not build a new \nschool. It doesn't educate a child. It does not buy us any tanks or \nguns or planes. It is used to pay interest on old debt.\n  Many of us believe, in the discussion of what to do with the surplus, \nwe should not lose sight of the most important single thing we can do, \nand that is eliminate this debt burden which we are passing on to the \nnext generation. To celebrate a tax cut and ignore this, I think is to \nignore the reality of what our children and grandchildren will face. I \nhope we can have a balanced approach with this surplus.\n  First be sensible. Don't assume, because some economists can think \nahead 4 and 5 years, or even 10, and say, oh, you are going to have a \nsurplus forever, that that is gospel truth. These economists tend to \ndisagree all of the time. We have to be careful that we do not \noverestimate the projected surplus, be careful in how much money we \nthink we will have. Then, once we have that money, we have to allocate \nat least a third of it to reducing the national debt so we do not have \nto collect all these taxes to pay interest on old debts which previous \ngenerations have incurred.\n  Second, we have to make sure we invest enough in Social Security and \nMedicare so that these systems will not go bankrupt. Mr. President, 40 \nmillion-plus Americans depend on these systems to sustain them, and \nSocial Security payments, to make sure they have quality health care--\nseniors and disabled Americans. If we have a surplus lets make sure we \ninvest from our surplus into Social Security and Medicare for that \npurpose.\n\n  Finally, of course, I support a tax cut. The Democrats and \nRepublicans both support tax cuts. My take on it may be a little \ndifferent than that of some of my colleagues. I do not believe the tax \ncuts should go to the wealthiest people in America. I happen to think \nwe ought to focus on struggling working families. I listen to the \ntelephone calls coming into my office in Chicago and Springfield and \nMarion, IL. I can tell you right now with what families are struggling. \nThey are struggling to pay heating bills. Families have seen a dramatic \nincrease in their heating bills in the Midwest. They have seen a \ndramatic increase over the last several years in the costs of college \neducation. They are facing ongoing increases in the costs of child \ncare. Any working parent wants to leave that son or daughter in the \nhands of qualified people. Yet it becomes increasingly expensive for \nthem to pay for day care.\n  I receive telephone calls and read letters where people say: Senator, \nI have reached a point where my family is doing well but my parent now \nis reaching a point where he--or she--needs more and more attention and \ncare. We are glad to give it, but it is expensive. Can you help us with \nthat?\n  When you are talking about long-term care, when you are talking about \nchild care, when you are talking about the expenses to put someone \nthrough college or even the expenses of heating your home, the average \nworking family is struggling to make ends meet. When we talk about a \ntax cut, let us focus on helping those families first. The wealthiest \nin America are doing OK. They will continue to do fine. They may have a \ntax cut but it should not be at the expense of working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise first to speak about one of the \ncritical pieces of education legislation that the Congress is scheduled \nto consider this year. I believe we have wide agreement, now, on the \nneed to increase school accountability, with new systems that will put \nreal teeth into improving school performance for all students, and \nschool districts, and for each State.\n  I have spoken for several years, now, about the need to improve \nschool accountability. I introduced school accountability legislation \nin 1999. President Bush has spoken frequently about it. His new \nSecretary of Education, Rod Paige, whom we confirmed on Saturday, has \nspoken about its importance.\n  I believe there is strong support from those colleagues, both \nDemocrat and Republican, on the HELP committee. The provisions that we \ndeveloped this last year to ensure accountability are included in S. 7, \nwhich Senator Daschle introduced yesterday.\n  In addition, I am introducing later today a bipartisan bill which \ncontains those same accountability provisions. I am very pleased that \nmy colleague and friend, Senator Lugar from Indiana, has joined me as a \ncosponsor of that bill. This will be a bipartisan effort which will \ndemonstrate the bipartisan nature of these proposals.\n  These accountability provisions demand results of all students so the \nexisting achievement gaps between minority and nonminority students, \nbetween poor and wealthier students, between limited English and \nEnglish-speaking students, are eliminated and they are eliminated at \nthe individual school level, at the school district level, and at the \nState level.\n  Mr. President, I do believe there is now widespread consensus on the \nneed for rigorous school accountability in key areas that are addressed \nin this bill that Senator Lugar and I are introducing.\n  The bill establishes aggressive performance objectives for all \nstudents that are linked to each school's standards and assessments. It \ndirects resources to the students and objectives most in need. It \nprovides for significant consequences for failure so that States and \nschool districts must take full responsibility for turning around those \nschools that have chronically failed to adequately educate the students \nin the schools.\n  Our bill provides maximum flexibility for educators to develop \nstrategies to meet the basic goals of school improvement, and it \nensures that every class have a fully qualified teacher. The bill \nprovides an expanded role for parents. Finally, the bill provides new \nfunding for school improvement strategies that have been proven to \nwork. These are strategies such as the Success for All Program, which \nSenator Lugar and I strongly support.\n  I am very pleased that school accountability is finally getting the \nattention it deserves in Congress from both sides of the aisle. With \nwidespread agreement now on the need for strong school accountability \nlegislation--and sanctions for schools that do not live up to basic \nstandards--I am very optimistic that this Congress can move quickly to \ndevelop a consensus package. I believe this bipartisan bill I referred \nto can serve as a starting point for working with the White House and \nwith all colleagues on this vital area of meeting the needs of our \nschoolchildren.\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, but I indicate I do want to speak \nas in morning business at some time after the majority leader speaks to \npay tribute to our former colleague, Senator Cranston.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, we have a new President of the United States \nwho has proven in his own State of Texas and in his life--and with the \nencouragement of his wife--that he really cares about education and \nthat he means it when he says we should leave no child behind.\n  We need an education system in America that is focused on one thing, \nand that is children learning. I am convinced he means that. I have had \noccasion to hear him talk about that in Texas, on the campaign trail, \nafter the election, and even yesterday in the first meeting, when the \nbicameral Republican leadership met with the President, that was his \nfocus. He made it clear he was going to reach out to the Congress, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and to outsiders to try to get a consensus \nas to how we want to move our country. But the issue he focused on was \neducation.\n  I believe that is going to be well received by the American people. \nPeople of all backgrounds, races, creeds, color, regions know that for \ncontinued advancement for the American culture, education and improving \neducation is absolutely critical.\n  He continues to focus on this issue. This morning he met with the \nleaders of the appropriate committees to talk about his proposal that \nhe is going to send to us today. I have spoken to a couple of those who \nattended that meeting, including Senator Jeffords. A moment ago, when \nthe Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, spoke, I felt there was an exuberance in him \nabout the fact that this President is opening his administration the \nway he said he would, and in the Senate we are picking up that mantle. \nThe bill that will carry the number S. 1 is going to be about \neducation.\n  Today the President of the United States will keep his promise to \nAmerica's schoolchildren. He will articulate for the Nation a vision of \nAmerica, a public school system that serves the children and leaves no \nchild behind.\n  I think it is important also that he is not going to send us a bill \ndrafted with every word, every dot and comma, but he is going to lay \nout the provisions, the major points he intends to pursue, and he is \nasking us to pursue it legislatively in the Congress.\n  Under President Bush, our public schools can and will be doorways to \nopportunity. In Texas, he has proven that every child, particularly our \ndisadvantaged children, can excel. As President, he will bring that \nsame determination to all of our Nation's children.\n  The President proposed we apply commonsense principles to promote \nresults. He also has picked an outstanding nominee to be Secretary of \nEducation, and now he is the Secretary of Education, Dr. Rod Paige. By \nthe way, I should note he is a native Mississippian. He grew up with a \nvery blue-collar upbringing. He attended public schools. He got a good \neducation. He was the head coach at Jackson State University in \nJackson, MS, a university that has produced some outstanding academic \nleaders and athletic leaders in this country. Some of the most \noutstanding football players in the history of this country came out of \nJackson State University.\n  He went beyond that. He got his postgraduate degrees. He got his \ndoctorate, and then he went to the Houston, TX, school system, a school \nsystem that had all kinds of problems, that was deteriorating, \ndeclining, and he said: We are going to make this place work. We are \ngoing to provide different ideas, innovative ideas, and he produced \nresults. Now he is going to be the Nation's Secretary of Education. \nHere again is a man who has shown the American dream is alive and well. \nWhen you look at his humble beginnings and what he did in terms of \ngetting an education in public schools, at Jackson State University, \nand then getting his postdoctorate degrees and now is Secretary of \nEducation, it is a tremendous testament to what can be done.\n\n  Our schools should be measured by what our children learn. I have \nsaid on this floor many times that I am the son of a schoolteacher, a \nlady who taught school for 19 years. I am very proud of it. She still \ncorrects my grammar when I use the wrong word, the wrong tense in my \nweekly columns or when she hears me speak. If I speak improperly, she \nwill mark my paper in red or chastise me. I am proud of that.\n  Unfortunately, like a lot of teachers, after 14 years she left and \nwent into bookkeeping and even radio announcing because she could make \nmore money. That is a tragedy, too. At the local and State level, we \nhave to make sure we pay our people a livable wage so they will stay in \nteaching and not go out into other places and get more money but maybe \nnot much reward in terms of what they actually produce.\n  I went to public schools all my life. So did my wife and so did my \nchildren. I remember distinctly the best teachers I ever had in my life \nwere my teachers in the second, third, and fourth grades at Duck Hill, \nMS. Those teachers affected my life. They taught me the basics. They \ntaught me to read.\n  By the way, I stayed in touch with two of the three all my life. One \nof them now is deceased. One of them I still hear from every now and \nthen. They came from a small poor school, but they made a difference in \nmy whole life, more than my college professors, more than my high \nschool teachers.\n  We have to make sure we have that for every child in America.\n  No child--no child--in America should be trapped in failing schools \njust because they lack the economic means to have a choice or to make \nsure they do get a good education.\n  We have to be prepared to think outside the box. What we have been \ndoing is not working in every school. Some schools are fantastic. In my \nown State, we have some great schools. We have students who make \ntremendous test scores on the ACT and SAT, and yet we have schools \nwhere children are just not getting a quality education. They are not \nlearning. They are not safe. They are in danger from all kinds of \nthings in these schools. So we have to keep the good ones good and make \nthem even better, but we have to make sure those other schools can be \nbrought up. That is a local responsibility, a State responsibility.\n\n  But, yes, the Federal Government has a role to play. There are many \nthings we can do to be helpful in that area. The President's proposals \nwill help us address that. The fact that he is willing to put money--\nand a significant amount of money--into children learning to read, that \nis a beginning, that is where it all starts.\n  We have one couple in my State of Mississippi who have been \nremarkably successful in their lives: Jim Barksdale and his wife Sally, \nfrom Jackson, MS. They went to the University of Mississippi. Jim \nBarksdale worked with FedEx. He worked with McCaw Telephone in \nWashington State. He is one of the founders of Netscape who made a lot \nof money, and now he is on the board of AOL Time Warner. He and his \nwife just gave $100 million--$100 million--of personal money, the two \nof them, for one thing, and only one thing, in my State--4th grade \nreading. The State said, OK, can we join in on this? And others said, \nno, we want this to be focused on teaching those 4th grade students to \nread. That is the kind of thing happening with individuals in the \nprivate sector. They have a responsibility to help with education, too.\n  So we need to really build on that. Parents have a right to hold \nschools to high standards and know that their\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\nschools are meeting those high standards. Our children excel when they \nare exposed to basics, going back to the points I made about reading. \nOur early childhood programs should focus on reading first, and we \nshould not be afraid to measure those programs to make sure they are \nsucceeding and not merely just good-intentioned programs that do not \nproduce results.\n  Also, character counts. There is a program called Character Counts in \nAmerica. I think we need to incorporate that in how we teach. We should \nnever shy away from teaching that basic lesson to our students.\n  These basic principles work. They have worked in Texas, they have \nworked in other parts of the country, and they have formed the \ncornerstone of the President's education initiatives.\n  Under Governor Bush, African American 4th grade students have made \nthe largest gains in the country in math and science. In fact, they had \nthe highest test scores in their peer group of any State in the Nation. \nHispanic students have made similar gains, scoring second highest of \nHispanics in all States. We can and should do the same thing for all of \nAmerica's children.\n  The President's education plan is based on a simple premise: Those \nwho know our children best--parents, teachers, and principals--should \ndetermine how to prioritize our education dollars. The needs in rural \nAmerica are often left out, and they are quite different from those in \nour cities. It makes sense that local schools have the freedom to \ndesign programs that meet individual needs. The compulsion in \nWashington has always been to have one size that fits all which they \ndictate from Washington.\n  What is needed in Pascagoula, my hometown, is obviously, on its face, \ndifferent from what they need in Pittsburgh, PA. So we need that local \nflexibility, that local control, and with accountability that goes \nalong with it. In exchange for that freedom, the President proposes to \nhold States accountable for the one thing that matters, and that is to \nmake sure our children are learning.\n  There are many special interests in education. Many of them will \nraise their voices against the President's plan. They will use tactics \nto try to distract from what we are trying to accomplish by advocating \nother things and new programs. I think we need to go with what works \nand to make sure the only interests that matter are the interests of \nour children and that they are learning.\n  I believe this commonsense approach will form the kind of principles \nthat can improve our education in America. I believe we can, in this \narea, reach bipartisan agreement. We tried mightily last year, and \nthere was a lot of effort across the aisle from our education leaders, \ngood men such as Paul Coverdell, who is not with us, and Slade Gorton, \nwho will not be serving in the Senate. Joe Lieberman was involved in \nthat effort. We can have Republicans and Democrats who can come \ntogether on this because what President Bush is proposing is not \nRepublican or Democrat; it is what has worked and what will work.\n  So I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's engage in \nthis issue. Let's move this bill. I hope the HELP Committee will have \nthe necessary hearings to think about what we are going to do, but do \nnot delay. Do not delay. Every day that goes by that we do not act in \nthis area, another child is not getting the education he or she needs. \nThey are in a school that is not safe or a school that is drug \ninfested.\n  This could be one of the most exciting things we do in the next 2 \nyears. I appreciate the fact that the President has shown his \ncommitment. He is going do be dogged. He is going to be focused. We are \ngoing to get this done. And the children will be the beneficiaries now, \nand the country will be the beneficiaries for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join in the bipartisan chorus of \nvoices here on the floor this morning speaking about education reform \nand the package that President Bush will be sending us for our \nexamination and consideration in the coming days. I say a chorus of \nbipartisan voices. Every Senator who serves in the Senate recognizes \nand is willing to dedicate time to the importance of education in our \nNation, and especially to the improvement of our public educational \nsystem.\n  Are there differences? Sure, there are differences. Historically, \nmany of our colleagues simply wanted to send money, wanted to send it \ndown from the Federal level, arguing that money was the problem; that \nif enough was sent, it would resolve the issue. A good many of us have \nsaid: Now, wait a moment. There has to be some control and some \nmeasurement, some evaluation of achievement. Or is the money being \nspent in the right way? Is enough control being given at the State and \nlocal level?\n  Over the years, while the Federal Government has participated, it \nreally has participated in a fairly limited way in the public education \nsystems of our country. For every dollar that is spent on the ground in \nIdaho or Mississippi or Texas or Illinois, only about 7 or 8 cents of \nthat dollar has been a Federal amount.\n  What George Bush brings to us today is an attempt to recognize what \nmost Americans have already recognized and spoke to him about in the \ncampaign. That is that our educational system is in need of improvement \nand in need of reform. And probably out of opinions from that side of \nthe aisle and this side of the aisle, there is a strong common ground \nto allow that kind of improvement and reform to go forward.\n\n  For the last decade, the chorus has not necessarily been here, but it \nhas been broad and across America where our citizens have been saying: \nSomething is wrong; our children are not achieving at the levels they \nshould. They are not safe in their schools. There is a level of \ndisruption that does not produce the kind of environment where quality \neducation can go forward.\n  Hopefully, in the days to come, we will be able to craft a package, \nworking with our President, to achieve what most Americans want for \ntheir children, recognizing, as all of us do, that in the absence of a \nhigh-quality public education system, the very character of our Nation, \nthat must be perpetuated and brought forward from generation to \ngeneration, begins to lose. If that happens, America loses. In the end, \nwe are a lesser nation because our children--our young people and our \nfuture leaders--are simply not as prepared as they must be to compete \namongst themselves and to compete in the world as we know it.\n  That is the issue George Bush challenges us with today. He speaks of \nputting money in for reading, but he also speaks of accountability. He \nturns that accountability back to the States and to the local \ncommunities and says: Prove your worth and we will help you. Good \nschools will improve and bad schools will work to improve, but for bad \nschools that will not recognize their failing, we will give parents and \nstudents the option to move elsewhere.\n  Now, public education is a monopoly. It always has been one. Many of \nthe educators within that system want to keep it just that way. They do \nnot want to have to measure up against the private sector or another \nschool down the road. If you live in that school district, you are \nrequired to attend that school. What George Bush is saying is, not \nnecessarily. So you do not have to be a prisoner within the educational \nsystem. If the educational system is going to educate, then the parent \nand the student--if they are not getting the quality of education they \nwant--ought to be allowed and ought to be given the means to move to \nanother school where that quality education exists.\n  Of course, there will also be consequences for success, not just for \nfailure. If schools improve overall student achievement, they will be \nrewarded with special grants and bonuses.\n  Other key components of this plan will go a long way towards \nimproving our schools. These components include increases in federal \nfunding for literacy programs, the strengthening of math and science \neducation, and the cutting of bureaucracy to make it easier for schools \nto upgrade their technology.\n  This bill would also help the States improve education by giving them \nmore freedom in administering federal education dollars.\n  Federal education programs will be consolidated, thus reducing the \nred tape and allowing more flexibility at the local level.\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\n  President Bush's proposal also expands the amount of money that can \nbe put into tax-free education savings accounts. Parents are a key \ncomponent of any education reform, and President Bush realizes that \nwithout empowering them, little can be done.\n  In short, the President's plan provides the right blend of parental \nempowerment, local flexibility, federal funding, and accountability.\n  If enacted, this plan will go a long way towards giving every child \nin America a chance to truly succeed.\n  There are a lot of issues to be dealt with in the coming days. A good \ndeal of compromise is to be made. But I am extremely excited that our \nPresident, President Bush, is leading with this issue. Clearly, there \nis no question in our country it is a major issue, and a major issue of \nimportance for all of us, but most importantly for the future of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, other colleagues have come to the floor and wish to \nspeak, and we are operating under a unanimous consent agreement. So let \nme, with that, conclude my remarks and, in so doing, say I am excited \nthat we have the opportunity to work together on this issue and to \nprove to Americans that education is the No. 1 priority of the \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, who has the great name Senator Hutchinson.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arkansas for \n5 minutes, under the previous order.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair, and thank the Senator from Texas \nfor her leadership on education, and for having a good name, and for me \nhaving a name similar to it.\n  I applaud President Bush for his commitment to education in unveiling \na very serious and comprehensive education reform program today. It is \nan education package that, if enacted in its entirety, I believe, will \nensure that no child in America will be left behind . . . That should \nbe our goal.\n  One of the wonderful aspects of what President Bush is now doing is \nto help us redefine what success is in education. For too long, success \nhas been defined by: How much do we spend? President Bush wants to \nredefine that as to how much children are learning. That should be the \ncriteria for whether or not we are succeeding in education.\n  His proposals represent an excellent framework for moving forward, \nand moving forward quickly, on a bipartisan basis, with legislation in \nCongress. I call on my colleagues to have an open mind on this \neducation package and allow us to work together to achieve these goals.\n  Among other things, he seeks to address the problem of failing \nschools. Federal support, under his plan, will be provided, augmenting \nState funds, to help schools that need improvement. States and \ndistricts will be expected to implement serious reforms in schools that \ncontinue to fail.\n  All children in America deserve to have the chance for a quality \neducation. In order to achieve that, there must be real consequences \nfor schools that are persistently dangerous or are not improving after \nserious reform efforts for 3 years.\n  Under the Bush plan, if a school cannot achieve success in 3 years, \nwith additional help from the Federal Government, then we ought to give \nthose parents the chance to get those children out of the failing \nschool. No child should be left behind because of where he or she lives \nor because of the financial standing of his or her parents. So I think \nthis is a wonderful hallmark of the Bush plan.\n  Under the Bush plan, success is rewarded; failure is sanctioned. \nStates, districts, and schools that narrow the achievement gap and \nimprove overall student achievement will be rewarded, and States that \nfail to make progress may lose a portion of their administrative funds.\n  If we are to change education in this country, there must be \nconsequences to failure. We must close that gap between the high \nachieving and the low achieving. That was the goal of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. The Bush plan provides a whole new area of \nflexibility, much less of the prescriptive, top-down categorical grant \nprograms--over 60 of them--that tie the hands of local educators. The \nBush plan would reduce that to a few streams of funds and provide new \nflexibility for local educators.\n  As you can tell, Mr. President, I am quite enthused about what we \nhave the opportunity to do for the education of American children. As a \nmember of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nI look forward to working with President Bush and with my colleagues in \nthe Senate to pass meaningful education legislation.\n\n  This issue is a priority. It is President Bush who deserves the \ncredit for making it a priority. It is time to put partisan politics \naside and to work to ensure that every child in America receives a \nquality education, and that no child is left behind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has been and will be very protective \nof the time on Tuesdays, but since the Senator has been here the entire \nmorning, I will not object.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know this is a difficult time to be presiding, but I \ndid want to finish the discussion of the education proposal that is \nbeing put forth by President Bush.\n  We have had several speakers this morning talk about the importance \nof addressing education as the first priority of our new President, \nGeorge W. Bush. I think you can tell from the debate that Congress is \nready to go on this issue.\n  We have been looking for accountability and flexibility in the \nFederal role in education since I came to Congress, and probably since \nStrom Thurmond came to Congress, because we know the difference between \nAmerica and most other countries in the world is that we value every \nchild getting a quality education. So we know that public education is \nthe route that every child must take to succeed in life.\n  If we fall down in public education, we will see the crumbling of the \nfoundation of democracy in America. That is why President Bush is \nputting this as a first priority, and why Congress is going to work \nwith him to do it.\n  I think what President Bush is talking about is exactly the right \napproach--that we are going to give incentives for creativity, for \nflexibility, that we are going to go for every child to have the best \neducation that we can potentially give that child.\n  But we are not going to sit back and say that year after year after \nyear, if a public school fails, we are going to keep pouring money into \nthat failing school and leave those children at risk. That is what we \nare saying. We are saying if a school fails for 3 straight years, we \nare going to empower parents and school districts and States to say \nthere is an alternative and we are going to let you look at the options \nand select another alternative for your child.\n  That is the bottom line of what we are talking about today. So we are \ngoing to put a lot more money from the Federal level into public \neducation. We are going to give our schools every chance to succeed, \nand we are going to help them succeed. But, Mr. President, this is \naccountability that we are going to put into the system because we are \nnot going to let a child be left behind because all the bureaucrats and \nthe politicians in Washington are talking about accountability but not \ndeciding what it is. We are going to decide in the next few months what \nit is and we are going to set a standard and we are going to require \nthat standard be kept.\n  That is what President Bush is doing. Congress is going to work with \nhim to do it. I applaud the President, and I am anxious to work with \nhim to make sure that every child has the ability to reach his or her \nfull potential with a public education in our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S436-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DANIELS, JR.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the \nnomination of Mitch Daniels to be the head of the Office of Management \nand Budget. First of all, I want to say Mr. Daniels called me when he \nhad been named and we had a brief, frank visit about the \nresponsibilities of the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. I want to indicate that I will vote for his confirmation.\n  That is not the reason I rose to speak on his nomination. At his \nconfirmation hearing Mr. Daniels indicated, in response to a question, \nthat he would not support giving the same protection to the Medicare \ntrust fund surpluses that we have agreed, on a bipartisan basis, to \ngive to the Social Security trust fund surpluses. I want to indicate my \nstrong disagreement with Mr. Daniels on that position. I think that is \nthe entirely wrong position to take.\n  In fact, in the U.S. Senate, on a bipartisan basis, we voted \noverwhelmingly, last year, on a provision I offered to protect both the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund surpluses, to \nprotect them against raids for other purposes.\n  Now Mr. Daniels has announced a policy of being willing to protect \nthe Social Security trust fund but not the Medicare trust fund. I hope \nhe will rethink that issue. I hope he will agree with what was a strong \nbipartisan vote here in the U.S. Senate last year, to protect both the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund surpluses. We \nshould not permit raids of either one of them. We should not allow \nthose funds to be used for any other purpose. Social Security funds \nshould not be used for other spending. They should not be used for a \ntax cut. The Medicare trust funds should not be used for other \nspending. They should not be used for a tax cut. Those funds ought to \nbe reserved for the purposes for which they were raised, which is to \nsupport the Social Security Program and the Medicare program.\n\n  I was disappointed when Mr. Daniels indicated he would not support \nprotection of the Medicare trust fund. I think that is a profoundly \nwrong position to take. I hope he will rethink it. I certainly hope he \nwas not speaking for this administration.\n  Again, I remind him and remind this administration that, on a \nbipartisan basis, last year on the floor of the Senate, we had 60 votes \nfor the proposition that we ought to protect both the Social Security \ntrust fund and Medicare trust fund. That is a policy supported by the \nAmerican people that ought to be supported by the Office of Management \nand Budget. It was supported here on the floor of the Senate and I hope \nthis administration will think very carefully about its position before \nthey conclude they are going to adopt the position of Mr. Daniels.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota and I, I think the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee, and others, were part of a debate that \ntook place just a few years ago, where the then majority, the \nRepublicans, were trying to use Social Security surpluses to offset the \ndeficit. Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I remember it very well. In fact they had what they \ncalled a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution but what they \nwere doing to balance the budget was to raid the Social Security trust \nfunds to achieve balance. That would have been an entirely phony \nbalancing of the budget, I believe.\n  Mr. REID. So, as I hear what the Senator is saying, what he is afraid \nof is they are trying to use, now, the surpluses from Medicare to spend \nfor other programs. Is that what the Senator is afraid of?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly what the new head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget has announced in a hearing before Members of the \nUnited States Senate in the Government Affairs Committee. He said he is \nwilling to protect the Social Security trust fund but he is not willing \nto protect the Medicare trust fund. They both ought to be protected. \nNeither one of them should be raided.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, who is the Democrats' \nleader on the Budget Committee, that, as usual, when it deals with \nmatters of finance--this is my personal opinion--there is no one better \nthan the Senator from North Dakota. I appreciate very much his bringing \nthis to the attention, not only of the Senate but the American people. \nWe cannot let the Social Security trust fund moneys be used for \nanything other than Social Security. And we cannot let moneys set aside \nfor Medicare be used for anything other than working to solve the \nterrible problem we have with seniors paying for their medical \nprograms, including that which we want to do dealing with prescription \ndrugs. So I personally appreciate the statement made by the Senator of \nNorth Dakota, focusing on this very vital interest.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate the comments of my colleague. I want to say \nwe are talking about real money here. The forecast of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses over the next 10 years is $2.7 trillion. \nThe forecast of the Medicare trust fund surplus over the next 10 years \nis $400 billion. We ought to protect them. We ought to wall them off. \nWe ought to prevent anyone from using those funds for any other \npurpose.\n\n  That is why I was so disappointed in the statement of Mr. Daniels, \nthe designee to head the Office of Management and Budget, when he \nindicated in response to a direct question that he would be willing to \nprotect the Social Security trust fund but he would not be willing to \nprotect the Medicare trust fund. What is the difference? It is just a \ndifference in programs. They are both trust funds. It is not very \ntrustworthy if you raid them and we should not permit any raid on them.\n  I just want Mr. Daniels and the administration to know that if they \nhave an idea they are going to raid the Medicare trust fund, we on this \nside are going to oppose them every step of the way.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, these should be trust funds, not slush \nfunds. I know, being the person he is, monitoring the money for the \nDemocrats in the budget process, and where it should go and should not \ngo, he will be vigilant because he is, in effect, protecting not only \nthe Senate, but the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand shortly the nomination of \nMel Martinez to be Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment will be before us. I rise in support of this nomination.\n  Mr. Martinez appeared before the Committee on Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs on January 17, where he made clear his commitment to \nproviding affordable housing and economic opportunity for all \nAmericans, both in his oral testimony and in his response to questions. \nHis nomination was brought to the Senate floor with a recommendation \nfor approval--a unanimous recommendation for approval in the committee.\n  Mr. Martinez has a compelling life story. His parents sent him to \nthis country at the age of 15, with thousands of other Cuban children, \nas part of the ``Pedro Pan'' operation, in an effort to security the \nliberty and opportunity that we enjoy as Americans.\n  He lived with a foster family, learned English, went to college and \nlaw school, practiced law for 25 years, and\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\nbecame deeply committed to serving his community. I believe this \nhistory has instilled in Mr. Martinez an understanding of and empathy \nfor the less fortunate that will serve him well in his new role as \nSecretary of HUD.\n  Mr. Martinez most recently served as the county chairman of Orange \nCounty, FL. Prior to that, he served on the Orlando Housing Authority \nBoard of Directors for 4 years, including 2 years as its chair in the \nmid-1980s. He served as vice president of Catholic Social Services in \nthe Diocese in Orlando throughout the 1980s and as president of the \nOrlando Utilities Commission from 1994 to 1997 and as a lawyer in his \nown firm. He has served his community in many ways as a volunteer \nmember of numerous organizations.\n  As chairman of the Orlando Housing Authority, Mr. Martinez worked \nwith his colleagues on the board to pass a measure that took about $1 \nmillion of reserve funds to build affordable housing for the elderly, \nas well as transitional housing for low-income single mothers. He \nconsistently showed a willingness to meet and work with residents of \npublic housing and other low-income residents of distressed \nneighborhoods in Orlando.\n  These efforts lead me to believe that as Secretary, Mr. Martinez will \nmake every effort to make good on his promise ``to work hard to ensure \nthat every American has every opportunity to have affordable housing.''\n  Last year, a number of bipartisan proposals providing for funding the \nconstruction of affordable housing were offered in the Congress. I look \nforward to working with the new Secretary on legislation that will help \nus achieve the lofty goal he has set out.\n  As many of my colleagues know, HUD has had a history of being a \ntroubled agency. While many of its programs do a good job of providing \ndecent homes to millions of poor and working families, it has proven to \nbe a difficult department to manage.\n  In 1994, in fact, HUD was placed on the General Accounting Office's \nhigh-risk list, the only agency to be so listed. However, as a result \nof concentrated efforts by Secretary Cuomo and his top staff, the GAO \nannounced last week that HUD is now off the high-risk list. HUD \nachieved this result by working tirelessly to correct the problems in \nfinancial oversight and procurement systems. It is widely recognized \nthat Secretary Cuomo has devoted significant time and effort to address \nthese managerial issues, and I commend him for his success.\n  This is by no means to say all of HUD's problems have been solved, \nbut it does mean that Mr. Martinez will take over the Department with a \nmanagement system in place that is moving HUD in the right direction. \nIn his confirmation hearing, Mr. Martinez made it clear that he \nunderstood the progress that has been made while committing himself to \ncontinue the efforts to improve the operations of the Department.\n  I was also encouraged that Mr. Martinez recognized the importance of \nthe Community Reinvestment Act in making housing opportunities more \navailable to all Americans. Several committee hearings have established \nthe fact that CRA is a crucial tool that is needed to make a number of \nother housing programs effective. The low-income housing tax credit, \nthe community development block grant, and the HOME program all depend, \nto some extent, on bank credit made available largely because of the \nCRA.\n  Finally, I note that this nomination has the support of a wide range \nof housing groups. A number of letters of support have been sent to the \ncommittee which are part of the hearing record. Included among these \nsupporters are a number of industry groups, public housing \norganizations, and others. I note in particular a very strong letter of \nsupport sent to us by our former colleague, Senator Mack, who has high \npraise for the nominee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mack's letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Mel Martinez understands the job ahead \nof him. He has committed to expanding housing opportunities for all \nAmericans. I look forward to working with him, and I commend his \nnomination to my colleagues for their approval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 16, 2001.\n     Hon.

I have found him to be an exceptional \n     individual who has the intelligence, integrity and compassion \n     to guide this agency and serve its constituents.\n       The Secretary-designee through his life experiences \n     understands the courage, drive and determination it takes to \n     achieve the American dream. As you and I know, very difficult \n     problems can be overcome when individuals work together. Mel \n     Martinez understands what is takes to bring people together \n     with a deep concern for those who are less fortunate and \n     striving for a better future. With his personal perspective \n     and insight, I am sure you could not find a better person to \n     improve the lives of those that look to us for assistance.\n       Therefore, with complete confidence, I strongly recommend \n     Mel Martinez and urge your favorable consideration of him for \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Connie Mack.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Mel Martinez has a great story. He is a \nself-made man who is destined to do great things. At age 15 he fled \nCuba during the airlift of children known as Operation Pedro Pan. \nAlthough, he was alone, he would soon begin his American Dream.\n  A graduate of Florida State University College of Law in 1973, \nMartinez joined an Orlando firm and practiced personal injury law. \nDuring his 25 years of law practice in Orlando, he was very involved in \na variety of community activities. In 1984, he was appointed chairman \nof the Orlando Housing Authority by the mayor. He held this post for \ntwo years, later serving as president of the Orlando Utilities \nCommission.\n  He also served as Chairman of Governor Jeb Bush's Growth Management \nCommission, declaring a moratorium on new residential projects in \nalready-crowded school districts.\n  In 1998, he was elected Orange County chairman. As the Chief \nExecutive of a government, he was responsible for providing complete \nurban services to over 860,000 people. In this mayoral-like role, he \nadvocated home ownership programs for low-income families and lowered \nproperty taxes. He concentrated on programs emphasizing public safety, \ngrowth management, the needs of children and families, clean \nneighborhoods, improved transportation, and the streamlining of \ngovernment.\n  As Secretary of HUD, Mr. Martinez, assumes the $30 billion budget, \nwhich faces a critical shortage of low-income properties and mid-income \nrentals. According to a recent HUD report, 5.4 million families pay \nmore than 50 percent of their gross income for rent.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Mel Martinez will be a great asset for \nHUD. Because of his life story, he will be able to handle the sensitive \nissues faced by this department. His story speaks for itself. From a \nchild fleeing from Cuba, to a successful Chairman, he has created his \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, it is with honor that I support Mel Martinez as \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S439-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe confirmation of Mel Martinez to be Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. I am impressed by his background and his \ncommitment to providing safe, affordable housing to all Americans. \nBased on my review of the Mr. Martinez's record as a public official in \nOrlando and Orange County and his expressed dedication to the mission \nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I believe he will \nmake a superb Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I support his \nnomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mel Martinez has an extraordinary story. At the age of 15, he fled \nCastro's Cuba to come to the United States without his family. He \nstayed with a foster family for four years before the rest of his \nfamily could join him in Orlando. After earning a law degree from \nFlorida State University, Mr. Martinez entered private practice, but \nalso served on numerous public boards and committees. He served on the \nBoard of Directors for the Orlando Public Housing Authority from 1982 \nto 1986. He was the Chair of the Orlando Affordable Housing Task Force \nin 1984, and President of the Orlando Utilities Commission from 1994 to \n1997.\n  Since 1998, Mr. Martinez has served as the Chief Elected Official of \nOrange County, Florida. He has a reputation for championing ``Smart \nGrowth'' and for understanding the need to ensure affordable housing \nfor all citizens. He even established a commission to identify new ways \nto provide affordable housing.\n  Assuming that Mr. Martinez will be confirmed, he comes to HUD at a \ngood time. Clearly, the nadir of HUD's existence was during the 1980s \nwhen the Department was riven by mismanagement and even worse. Jack \nKemp deserves credit for his commitment to reform and improving housing \nopportunities for the people served by HUD. He worked hard and achieved \nsignificant progress.\n  The last eight years have seen a continuation of reform and a \nrealization of many of the goals of reform. The homeownership rate is \nnow the highest in history--67.7% of all American families, nearly \nseven out of every ten families, own their own home. Nine million \nhouseholds have been added to the ranks of homeowners since 1993. We've \nalso seen record high levels of homeownership for urban-center African-\nAmerican and Hispanic families. The volume of Federal Housing \nAdministration (FHA) loans has doubled in recent years. FHA now has \nabout 6.7 million mortgages in its portfolio. FHA has gone from a $2.7 \nbillion deficit to a current value of more than $16 billion. HUD has \nalso recognized the changing needs of our aging population by producing \na Housing Security Plan for Older Americans.\n\n  HUD has made progress, but there is still much work to be done. There \nis still a pressing need to meet the continuing challenge of helping \nall Americans achieve the dream of homeownership and the promise first \nmade over half a century ago in the National Housing Act: a safe and \naffordable place to live for all Americans.\n  One of the most troubling paradoxes of our recent prosperity is that \ndespite the fact that incomes have risen for people in every income \ncategory, safe and affordable housing is more elusive than ever for \nmany low- and moderate-income families. That is because the cost of \nhousing has outpaced the increase in wages in many of our urban \ncenters, including areas of Connecticut that now rank among some of the \nmost expensive housing markets in the country.\n  We are losing public housing units in our country at an alarming \nrate. In some parts of the country, like the Northeast, the age of \npublic housing units has necessitated the demolition of many units that \nhave become too deteriorated to be rehabilitated. Federal policy has \ntried to provide public housing residents with housing vouchers, but \nfrankly, there just aren't enough of those vouchers to go around. \nFurther, in high-cost housing markets vouchers haven't always been \nuseful to low-income families because they can't always find landlords \nwho are willing to accept the vouchers. And even with vouchers, many \nfind rent to be all but out of reach.\n  We need more vouchers. We also need to invest in capital maintenance, \nand rehabilitation funding to ensure that public housing units remain \nhabitable. And if we have dilapidated public housing, then we need to \nput money into building replacement units. While vouchers work in some \nplaces under some circumstances, they don't work everywhere under all \ncircumstances.\n  I also believe that the Federal government needs to think ahead to \naddress issues that will arise as our elderly population continues to \ngrow. We should consider creating tax and other incentives for \nconstruction of privately-owned assisted living units. The time has \nalso come for HUD to consider developing new standards or approaches to \nensure that senior citizens who live in public housing can stay in \ntheir homes and not be forced prematurely into expensive and less \nindependent institutional care facilities.\n  These are not trivial matters. They are tough problems. But from what \nI have been able to discern, Mel Martinez is up to the task. He has the \nknowledge, the energy, and the commitment to lead HUD as the agency \nbegins to address these matters.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Martinez. I have already invited \nMr. Martinez up to Connecticut. Connecticut has some of the oldest \nhousing in the country, but we also have some of the country's most \nsuccessful affordable housing projects. I welcome the opportunity to \nshow him our state and, again, to work with him on behalf of\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nall Americans seeking a good home for themselves and their families.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Anthony J. Principi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. \nI am pleased that President Bush has selected a person of experience \nand ability for this important position.\n  Mr. Principi has a strong background and association with the \nmilitary community. He is a veteran of the United States Navy, a \ngraduate from the U.S. Naval Academy, and a highly decorated Vietnam \nveteran. He also served in the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps.\n  Mr. Principi is well qualified for this position, having previously \nserved as Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Deputy Secretary of \nthe VA. I personally know him to be a capable and dedicated public \nservant. In 1993, I called upon Mr. Principi to be my Staff Director \nfor the Senate Armed Services Committee. Later, as Chairman, I \nappointed him to a Congressional Commission on Military Servicemembers \nand Veterans Transition. He subsequently was elected by his colleagues \nas Chairman of that Commission. In each of these instances, his \nperformance was exceptional.\n  There are a number of important issues facing the Department of \nVeterans Affairs which affect veterans, their families, and employees \nof the Department. I will mention a few of these issues to emphasize my \nown concern and to stress to Mr. Principi that he must aggressively \naddress these matters.\n  The first issue I hope Secretary Principi strongly addresses is that \nof Veterans Benefits. It takes too long now to get initial decisions \nand the review process can take years. I hope Secretary Principi will \nwork with the Under Secretary for Benefits to improve the VA benefit \nreview process.\n  Second, I am concerned about the status of veterans health care. The \nCongress and the VA have enacted and implemented a number of reforms. \nThe challenge now is to ensure that the availability, delivery and \nquality of health care improves.\n  A third concern I have relates to the Veterans Equitable Resource \nAllocation, VERA, process. A few years ago, Congress passed a bill that \nrequires the VA to allocate resources according to veteran population \nand use of VA medical facilities. This legislation generally has \nshifted some resources from the Northeast to the South and West. I \ntrust Secretary Principi will continue to support this important reform \ndespite political pressures to do otherwise.\n  I congratulate Mr. Principi on his nomination. As a member of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I look forward to working with \nthe Secretary as we address the needs and concerns of the men and women \nwho have given much for our Nation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Anthony J. Principi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If \nconfirmed, Mr. Principi will have the responsibility of steering the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs through a period of great \ntransformation.\n  I recently had the chance to meet with Mr. Principi and to discuss \nthe many challenges he will face in guiding the VA through this \ncritical period. I have also had the opportunity to read his answers to \nprehearing questions and to hear his testimony at the January 18, 2001, \nhearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on his nomination. \nMr. Principi has expressed his belief that our veterans deserve access \nto quality health care and swift and accurate decisions about \ndisability benefits. I wholeheartedly agree and believe feel that Mr. \nPrincipi has the experience and the commitment to maintain this special \nobligation to our Nation's veterans.\n  I know that with his years of service to veterans--at VA, here in the \nSenate, and as chair of the Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans \nTransition (the so-called Transition Commission)--Mr. Principi is \nfamiliar with the importance of the leadership role he will soon assume \nat the VA. Because of his long history and experience, we have great \nexpectations for his success, and we expect him to hit the ground \nrunning to tackle the VA's many challenges.\n  We have all heard the President speak about the need to revamp the VA \nhealth care system. But what exactly does that mean to veterans who \ndepend upon the VA? Yes, we have made many sweeping changes in the \ndelivery of VA health care. Veterans' health care is now very often \nprovided in different settings, which are frequently not the \ntraditional hospital site. Outpatient clinics cover the VA landscape \nand provide new access points to many veterans. And veterans--unlike \nmany other groups--now have improved coverage of their long-term care \nneeds, although VA has been embarrassingly slow in implementing some of \nthese programs.\n  But while the past decade has brought tremendous transformation to \nthe VA health care system, we may be approaching the most challenging \nperiod of all. The VA medical system offers programs of enormous value, \nespecially for veterans who are blind or have spinal cord injuries, who \nneed prosthetic devices or dependable mental health care. We must \nretain these specialized services, offered nowhere else in the U.S. \nhealthcare landscape, which have made the VA great.\n  Mr. Principi understands that, if confirmed, he will be expected to \nbe a steward and protector of this very special health care system. \nAmerica's veterans will accept no less.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration is in crisis. Last year, \nChairman Specter chaired a hearing on the benefits adjudication system, \nand we were greatly disturbed by what we heard about the lack of \nquality and timeliness in VBA decisionmaking. At that hearing, a \nVietnam combat veteran from my state of West Virginia, suffering with \npost-traumatic stress disorder, testified that it took a full five \nyears for his VA disability claim to be approved. The documented \nchronology of events over that five-year period paints a clear picture \nof a benefits system that needs a great deal of work. This is just one \nexample of the many cases my staff hear about daily.\n  We continue to be dismayed by the delays in making eligibility \ndeterminations. And despite efforts by hardworking, dedicated VBA \nemployees, which have yielded some gains in customer service, the \nproblems with VA claims' processing seem to be getting worse. In fact, \nthe backlog has increased by 50,000 claims just since we held that \nhearing last July.\n  You know the old saying: ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' Our \naging veterans population cannot afford to wait. We look to Mr. \nPrincipi for innovative approaches so that VBA can absorb changes in \nlaw and new business processes without always going into a tailspin. We \nmust do better than this.\n  Mr. President, in my view, Mr. Principi is well qualified for this \nimportant position. He would bring to it his many experiences as an \nadvocate for veterans' needs, as well as his sincere commitment to \ntheir well-being. I urge my colleagues to approve this nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to give my strongest \nrecommendation for the confirmation of the nomination of Anthony \nPrincipi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  On January 5, 2001, then President-elect Bush announced his intention \nto nominate former-Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Tony Principi, \na man I have known for more than 20 years, to be his Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. I support this nomination, and I am pleased that the \nPresident decided to recommend him for this important position.\n  Tony Principi served as Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs and as \nActing Secretary of Veterans Affairs for President Bush from 1989 to \n1993. I am confident that he will, once again, be a competent, \ntrustworthy, effective Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Tony Principi is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a \ndecorated Vietnam Veteran. He earned a law degree from Seton Hall \nUniversity in 1975. He was a professional staff member, Counsel and \nlater Staff Director for both the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n  In 1996, Tony was named as the Chairman of the Military \nServicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance Commission. This \nCongressional Commission reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the \nservices and benefits available to active\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\nduty service members and veterans. A number of the Commission's \nrecommendations fall under the cognizance of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have carefully reviewed the recommendations and have \ninitiated action to implement many of the improvements and efficiencies \nrecommended by the Commission. As Chairman of this important \nCongressional Commission, Tony did a superb job with a very difficult \ntask.\n  Tony's father is a veteran of World War II. His wife, Elizabeth is a \nveteran of 30 years of service as a Naval officer and his two sons are \nserving on active duty in the Air Force today.\n  Tony's personal experiences in a family of veterans as well as a \nmidshipman, Naval officer give him an excellent perspective on the \nissues facing veterans. His experience as a staff member on the Armed \nServices and Veterans Affairs Committees and as a Cabinet official in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs makes Tony uniquely qualified to \naddress the many issues he will face as the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet with Tony in my office \nthe day prior to his confirmation hearing before the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee. During our discussions, he assured me that he would take \ntimely and positive action to ensure that employees of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs will assist veterans in applying for benefits and \nfiling claims for reimbursement and payments. This was an important \nissue on which the Armed Services Committee took a leading role during \nconsideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001. I was pleased that Tony agreed that it is a duty of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs personnel to assist veterans in \nsuccessfully navigating the difficult claims processes. We also \ndiscussed opportunities for increased cooperation between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \nhealth care arena. I look forward to working with Tony on these and \nother important issues concerning active duty military personnel and \nveterans.\n  I support this nomination. I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination as well. Secretary Principi will be a crucial part of the \ngreat team that President Bush has assembled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of M. \nAnthony Principi as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Our Nation's veterans are important to all of us. From time and \nmemorial, the men and women of our country's Armed Services have \ndedicated themselves to freedom and democracy. They have done far more \nthan representing freedom, they have given themselves to the cause, \nfighting for those inalienable rights that many of us take for granted.\n  There are 24.8 million veterans in the United States, 165,000 of \nwhich are in my own state of New Mexico. This means that all of us know \na veteran. In fact, one out of every four men in the United States is a \nveteran, and there are 1.2 million female veterans. We must continue to \nwork for the continued well-being of our veterans, as they are our \nmothers, fathers, grandmothers, and sons.\n  Health care is important to all of us, and veterans are no exception. \nI have worked with other members of Congress to dramatically increase \nfunding for veterans' health care. I know that more needs to be done \nfor veterans and pledge myself to work for their interests.\n  The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs will be presented with \nunique challenges. The Secretary must be pro-active and must have a \ncomprehensive understanding of veterans' issues.\n  In that vein, I am confident that Mr. Principi is the best person for \nthe job. As a decorated Vietnam War veteran, Mr. Principi can \nintimately relate to veterans' special needs.\n  Furthermore, he can fully appreciate the Department of Veterans \nAffairs after serving as Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment under the previous Bush Administration. Mr. Principi applied \nhis pro-active attitude and experience when he ordered the creation of \na registry to track medical conditions of Gulf War veterans.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Principi chaired the bipartisan Congressional \nCommission on Military Service Members and Veterans Assistance under \nthe previous Administration.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has put forth significant effort \nin moving towards a ``One V-A'' in attempting to deliver seamless \nservice to veterans. Yet, coordinating VA's various missions as \ntechnology advances remains just one challenge that Mr. Principi must \naddress.\n  Mr. Principi is a veteran. He has spent his life working for \nveterans. Mr. President, Anthony Principi is the best person to head \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  As Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Principi will \nsurely be tested. I am confident that he will ace the test.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Tony \nPrincipi's confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I have known \nhim for many years both as a staffer and a friend. He was my staff \ndirector when I was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee many \nyears ago. Since then I have come to value his advice and expertise \nabout our nation's veterans as much as I have come to value his \nfriendship. His experience both within the government and the private \nsector, along with his desire to give veterans the kind of services \nthey deserve, makes Tony the best man for the job. I support his \nconfirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nominations of Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., to be Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget; Anthony Joseph Principi, to be \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs; and Melquiades Rafael Martinez, to be \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                    [Rollcall Vote Nos. 1, 2, 3 Ex.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The nominations were confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S439-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. DODD.

It takes too long now to get initial decisions \nand the review process can take years. I hope Secretary Principi will \nwork with the Under Secretary for Benefits to improve the VA benefit \nreview process.\n  Second, I am concerned about the status of veterans health care. The \nCongress and the VA have enacted and implemented a number of reforms. \nThe challenge now is to ensure that the availability, delivery and \nquality of health care improves.\n  A third concern I have relates to the Veterans Equitable Resource \nAllocation, VERA, process. A few years ago, Congress passed a bill that \nrequires the VA to allocate resources according to veteran population \nand use of VA medical facilities. This legislation generally has \nshifted some resources from the Northeast to the South and West. I \ntrust Secretary Principi will continue to support this important reform \ndespite political pressures to do otherwise.\n  I congratulate Mr. Principi on his nomination. As a member of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I look forward to working with \nthe Secretary as we address the needs and concerns of the men and women \nwho have given much for our Nation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Anthony J. Principi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If \nconfirmed, Mr. Principi will have the responsibility of steering the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs through a period of great \ntransformation.\n  I recently had the chance to meet with Mr. Principi and to discuss \nthe many challenges he will face in guiding the VA through this \ncritical period. I have also had the opportunity to read his answers to \nprehearing questions and to hear his testimony at the January 18, 2001, \nhearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on his nomination. \nMr. Principi has expressed his belief that our veterans deserve access \nto quality health care and swift and accurate decisions about \ndisability benefits. I wholeheartedly agree and believe feel that Mr. \nPrincipi has the experience and the commitment to maintain this special \nobligation to our Nation's veterans.\n  I know that with his years of service to veterans--at VA, here in the \nSenate, and as chair of the Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans \nTransition (the so-called Transition Commission)--Mr. Principi is \nfamiliar with the importance of the leadership role he will soon assume \nat the VA. Because of his long history and experience, we have great \nexpectations for his success, and we expect him to hit the ground \nrunning to tackle the VA's many challenges.\n  We have all heard the President speak about the need to revamp the VA \nhealth care system. But what exactly does that mean to veterans who \ndepend upon the VA? Yes, we have made many sweeping changes in the \ndelivery of VA health care. Veterans' health care is now very often \nprovided in different settings, which are frequently not the \ntraditional hospital site. Outpatient clinics cover the VA landscape \nand provide new access points to many veterans. And veterans--unlike \nmany other groups--now have improved coverage of their long-term care \nneeds, although VA has been embarrassingly slow in implementing some of \nthese programs.\n  But while the past decade has brought tremendous transformation to \nthe VA health care system, we may be approaching the most challenging \nperiod of all. The VA medical system offers programs of enormous value, \nespecially for veterans who are blind or have spinal cord injuries, who \nneed prosthetic devices or dependable mental health care. We must \nretain these specialized services, offered nowhere else in the U.S. \nhealthcare landscape, which have made the VA great.\n  Mr. Principi understands that, if confirmed, he will be expected to \nbe a steward and protector of this very special health care system. \nAmerica's veterans will accept no less.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration is in crisis. Last year, \nChairman Specter chaired a hearing on the benefits adjudication system, \nand we were greatly disturbed by what we heard about the lack of \nquality and timeliness in VBA decisionmaking. At that hearing, a \nVietnam combat veteran from my state of West Virginia, suffering with \npost-traumatic stress disorder, testified that it took a full five \nyears for his VA disability claim to be approved. The documented \nchronology of events over that five-year period paints a clear picture \nof a benefits system that needs a great deal of work. This is just one \nexample of the many cases my staff hear about daily.\n  We continue to be dismayed by the delays in making eligibility \ndeterminations. And despite efforts by hardworking, dedicated VBA \nemployees, which have yielded some gains in customer service, the \nproblems with VA claims' processing seem to be getting worse. In fact, \nthe backlog has increased by 50,000 claims just since we held that \nhearing last July.\n  You know the old saying: ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' Our \naging veterans population cannot afford to wait. We look to Mr. \nPrincipi for innovative approaches so that VBA can absorb changes in \nlaw and new business processes without always going into a tailspin. We \nmust do better than this.\n  Mr. President, in my view, Mr. Principi is well qualified for this \nimportant position. He would bring to it his many experiences as an \nadvocate for veterans' needs, as well as his sincere commitment to \ntheir well-being. I urge my colleagues to approve this nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to give my strongest \nrecommendation for the confirmation of the nomination of Anthony \nPrincipi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  On January 5, 2001, then President-elect Bush announced his intention \nto nominate former-Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Tony Principi, \na man I have known for more than 20 years, to be his Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. I support this nomination, and I am pleased that the \nPresident decided to recommend him for this important position.\n  Tony Principi served as Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs and as \nActing Secretary of Veterans Affairs for President Bush from 1989 to \n1993. I am confident that he will, once again, be a competent, \ntrustworthy, effective Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Tony Principi is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a \ndecorated Vietnam Veteran. He earned a law degree from Seton Hall \nUniversity in 1975. He was a professional staff member, Counsel and \nlater Staff Director for both the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n  In 1996, Tony was named as the Chairman of the Military \nServicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance Commission. This \nCongressional Commission reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the \nservices and benefits available to active\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\nduty service members and veterans. A number of the Commission's \nrecommendations fall under the cognizance of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have carefully reviewed the recommendations and have \ninitiated action to implement many of the improvements and efficiencies \nrecommended by the Commission. As Chairman of this important \nCongressional Commission, Tony did a superb job with a very difficult \ntask.\n  Tony's father is a veteran of World War II. His wife, Elizabeth is a \nveteran of 30 years of service as a Naval officer and his two sons are \nserving on active duty in the Air Force today.\n  Tony's personal experiences in a family of veterans as well as a \nmidshipman, Naval officer give him an excellent perspective on the \nissues facing veterans. His experience as a staff member on the Armed \nServices and Veterans Affairs Committees and as a Cabinet official in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs makes Tony uniquely qualified to \naddress the many issues he will face as the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet with Tony in my office \nthe day prior to his confirmation hearing before the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee. During our discussions, he assured me that he would take \ntimely and positive action to ensure that employees of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs will assist veterans in applying for benefits and \nfiling claims for reimbursement and payments. This was an important \nissue on which the Armed Services Committee took a leading role during \nconsideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001. I was pleased that Tony agreed that it is a duty of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs personnel to assist veterans in \nsuccessfully navigating the difficult claims processes. We also \ndiscussed opportunities for increased cooperation between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \nhealth care arena. I look forward to working with Tony on these and \nother important issues concerning active duty military personnel and \nveterans.\n  I support this nomination. I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination as well. Secretary Principi will be a crucial part of the \ngreat team that President Bush has assembled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of M. \nAnthony Principi as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Our Nation's veterans are important to all of us. From time and \nmemorial, the men and women of our country's Armed Services have \ndedicated themselves to freedom and democracy. They have done far more \nthan representing freedom, they have given themselves to the cause, \nfighting for those inalienable rights that many of us take for granted.\n  There are 24.8 million veterans in the United States, 165,000 of \nwhich are in my own state of New Mexico. This means that all of us know \na veteran. In fact, one out of every four men in the United States is a \nveteran, and there are 1.2 million female veterans. We must continue to \nwork for the continued well-being of our veterans, as they are our \nmothers, fathers, grandmothers, and sons.\n  Health care is important to all of us, and veterans are no exception. \nI have worked with other members of Congress to dramatically increase \nfunding for veterans' health care. I know that more needs to be done \nfor veterans and pledge myself to work for their interests.\n  The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs will be presented with \nunique challenges. The Secretary must be pro-active and must have a \ncomprehensive understanding of veterans' issues.\n  In that vein, I am confident that Mr. Principi is the best person for \nthe job. As a decorated Vietnam War veteran, Mr. Principi can \nintimately relate to veterans' special needs.\n  Furthermore, he can fully appreciate the Department of Veterans \nAffairs after serving as Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment under the previous Bush Administration. Mr. Principi applied \nhis pro-active attitude and experience when he ordered the creation of \na registry to track medical conditions of Gulf War veterans.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Principi chaired the bipartisan Congressional \nCommission on Military Service Members and Veterans Assistance under \nthe previous Administration.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has put forth significant effort \nin moving towards a ``One V-A'' in attempting to deliver seamless \nservice to veterans. Yet, coordinating VA's various missions as \ntechnology advances remains just one challenge that Mr. Principi must \naddress.\n  Mr. Principi is a veteran. He has spent his life working for \nveterans. Mr. President, Anthony Principi is the best person to head \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  As Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Principi will \nsurely be tested. I am confident that he will ace the test.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Tony \nPrincipi's confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I have known \nhim for many years both as a staffer and a friend. He was my staff \ndirector when I was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee many \nyears ago. Since then I have come to value his advice and expertise \nabout our nation's veterans as much as I have come to value his \nfriendship. His experience both within the government and the private \nsector, along with his desire to give veterans the kind of services \nthey deserve, makes Tony the best man for the job. I support his \nconfirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nominations of Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., to be Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget; Anthony Joseph Principi, to be \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs; and Melquiades Rafael Martinez, to be \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                    [Rollcall Vote Nos. 1, 2, 3 Ex.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The nominations were confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S439-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe confirmation of Mel Martinez to be Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. I am impressed by his background and his \ncommitment to providing safe, affordable housing to all Americans. \nBased on my review of the Mr. Martinez's record as a public official in \nOrlando and Orange County and his expressed dedication to the mission \nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I believe he will \nmake a superb Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I support his \nnomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mel Martinez has an extraordinary story. At the age of 15, he fled \nCastro's Cuba to come to the United States without his family. He \nstayed with a foster family for four years before the rest of his \nfamily could join him in Orlando. After earning a law degree from \nFlorida State University, Mr. Martinez entered private practice, but \nalso served on numerous public boards and committees. He served on the \nBoard of Directors for the Orlando Public Housing Authority from 1982 \nto 1986. He was the Chair of the Orlando Affordable Housing Task Force \nin 1984, and President of the Orlando Utilities Commission from 1994 to \n1997.\n  Since 1998, Mr. Martinez has served as the Chief Elected Official of \nOrange County, Florida. He has a reputation for championing ``Smart \nGrowth'' and for understanding the need to ensure affordable housing \nfor all citizens. He even established a commission to identify new ways \nto provide affordable housing.\n  Assuming that Mr. Martinez will be confirmed, he comes to HUD at a \ngood time. Clearly, the nadir of HUD's existence was during the 1980s \nwhen the Department was riven by mismanagement and even worse. Jack \nKemp deserves credit for his commitment to reform and improving housing \nopportunities for the people served by HUD. He worked hard and achieved \nsignificant progress.\n  The last eight years have seen a continuation of reform and a \nrealization of many of the goals of reform. The homeownership rate is \nnow the highest in history--67.7% of all American families, nearly \nseven out of every ten families, own their own home. Nine million \nhouseholds have been added to the ranks of homeowners since 1993. We've \nalso seen record high levels of homeownership for urban-center African-\nAmerican and Hispanic families. The volume of Federal Housing \nAdministration (FHA) loans has doubled in recent years. FHA now has \nabout 6.7 million mortgages in its portfolio. FHA has gone from a $2.7 \nbillion deficit to a current value of more than $16 billion. HUD has \nalso recognized the changing needs of our aging population by producing \na Housing Security Plan for Older Americans.\n\n  HUD has made progress, but there is still much work to be done. There \nis still a pressing need to meet the continuing challenge of helping \nall Americans achieve the dream of homeownership and the promise first \nmade over half a century ago in the National Housing Act: a safe and \naffordable place to live for all Americans.\n  One of the most troubling paradoxes of our recent prosperity is that \ndespite the fact that incomes have risen for people in every income \ncategory, safe and affordable housing is more elusive than ever for \nmany low- and moderate-income families. That is because the cost of \nhousing has outpaced the increase in wages in many of our urban \ncenters, including areas of Connecticut that now rank among some of the \nmost expensive housing markets in the country.\n  We are losing public housing units in our country at an alarming \nrate. In some parts of the country, like the Northeast, the age of \npublic housing units has necessitated the demolition of many units that \nhave become too deteriorated to be rehabilitated. Federal policy has \ntried to provide public housing residents with housing vouchers, but \nfrankly, there just aren't enough of those vouchers to go around. \nFurther, in high-cost housing markets vouchers haven't always been \nuseful to low-income families because they can't always find landlords \nwho are willing to accept the vouchers. And even with vouchers, many \nfind rent to be all but out of reach.\n  We need more vouchers. We also need to invest in capital maintenance, \nand rehabilitation funding to ensure that public housing units remain \nhabitable. And if we have dilapidated public housing, then we need to \nput money into building replacement units. While vouchers work in some \nplaces under some circumstances, they don't work everywhere under all \ncircumstances.\n  I also believe that the Federal government needs to think ahead to \naddress issues that will arise as our elderly population continues to \ngrow. We should consider creating tax and other incentives for \nconstruction of privately-owned assisted living units. The time has \nalso come for HUD to consider developing new standards or approaches to \nensure that senior citizens who live in public housing can stay in \ntheir homes and not be forced prematurely into expensive and less \nindependent institutional care facilities.\n  These are not trivial matters. They are tough problems. But from what \nI have been able to discern, Mel Martinez is up to the task. He has the \nknowledge, the energy, and the commitment to lead HUD as the agency \nbegins to address these matters.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Martinez. I have already invited \nMr. Martinez up to Connecticut. Connecticut has some of the oldest \nhousing in the country, but we also have some of the country's most \nsuccessful affordable housing projects. I welcome the opportunity to \nshow him our state and, again, to work with him on behalf of\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nall Americans seeking a good home for themselves and their families.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Anthony J. Principi to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. \nI am pleased that President Bush has selected a person of experience \nand ability for this important position.\n  Mr. Principi has a strong background and association with the \nmilitary community. He is a veteran of the United States Navy, a \ngraduate from the U.S. Naval Academy, and a highly decorated Vietnam \nveteran. He also served in the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps.\n  Mr. Principi is well qualified for this position, having previously \nserved as Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Deputy Secretary of \nthe VA. I personally know him to be a capable and dedicated public \nservant. In 1993, I called upon Mr. Principi to be my Staff Director \nfor the Senate Armed Services Committee. Later, as Chairman, I \nappointed him to a Congressional Commission on Military Servicemembers \nand Veterans Transition. He subsequently was elected by his colleagues \nas Chairman of that Commission. In each of these instances, his \nperformance was exceptional.\n  There are a number of important issues facing the Department of \nVeterans Affairs which affect veterans, their families, and employees \nof the Department. I will mention a few of these issues to emphasize my \nown concern and to stress to Mr. Principi that he must aggressively \naddress these matters.\n  The first issue I hope Secretary Principi strongly addresses is that \nof Veterans Benefits.

This means that all of us know \na veteran. In fact, one out of every four men in the United States is a \nveteran, and there are 1.2 million female veterans. We must continue to \nwork for the continued well-being of our veterans, as they are our \nmothers, fathers, grandmothers, and sons.\n  Health care is important to all of us, and veterans are no exception. \nI have worked with other members of Congress to dramatically increase \nfunding for veterans' health care. I know that more needs to be done \nfor veterans and pledge myself to work for their interests.\n  The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs will be presented with \nunique challenges. The Secretary must be pro-active and must have a \ncomprehensive understanding of veterans' issues.\n  In that vein, I am confident that Mr. Principi is the best person for \nthe job. As a decorated Vietnam War veteran, Mr. Principi can \nintimately relate to veterans' special needs.\n  Furthermore, he can fully appreciate the Department of Veterans \nAffairs after serving as Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment under the previous Bush Administration. Mr. Principi applied \nhis pro-active attitude and experience when he ordered the creation of \na registry to track medical conditions of Gulf War veterans.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Principi chaired the bipartisan Congressional \nCommission on Military Service Members and Veterans Assistance under \nthe previous Administration.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has put forth significant effort \nin moving towards a ``One V-A'' in attempting to deliver seamless \nservice to veterans. Yet, coordinating VA's various missions as \ntechnology advances remains just one challenge that Mr. Principi must \naddress.\n  Mr. Principi is a veteran. He has spent his life working for \nveterans. Mr. President, Anthony Principi is the best person to head \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  As Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Principi will \nsurely be tested. I am confident that he will ace the test.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Tony \nPrincipi's confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I have known \nhim for many years both as a staffer and a friend. He was my staff \ndirector when I was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee many \nyears ago. Since then I have come to value his advice and expertise \nabout our nation's veterans as much as I have come to value his \nfriendship. His experience both within the government and the private \nsector, along with his desire to give veterans the kind of services \nthey deserve, makes Tony the best man for the job. I support his \nconfirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nominations of Mitchell E.

THOMPSON, OF WISCONSIN, TO BE SECRETARY OF \n                       HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report the next \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Tommy G. Thompson, of \nWisconsin, to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the debate will \ninclude 60 minutes of time under the control of Senator Wellstone, with \n40 minutes for the chairman and ranking minority member of the Finance \nCommittee and 10 minutes each for Senators Feingold, Kennedy, and Reid \nof Nevada.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had the privilege of hearing Gov. \nTommy Thompson, the designee for Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, when he came before our committee which the distinguished \nSenator from Montana chaired last week. We had a very good hearing.\n  I want to compliment Senator Baucus for putting together a good \nhearing and, more importantly, for his cooperation in helping President \nBush move many of his nominees through the Senate as quickly as \npossible, and Senator Baucus was responsible for doing that in the case \nof Secretary of the Treasury O'Neill, and now Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services Governor Thompson.\n\n  Last week, we invited then-Governor Thompson to testify. I have to \nsay it was a very refreshing hearing. It became so apparent that the \nqualities that have made Governor Thompson so successful in Wisconsin \nare what will also make him very successful as a Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. This is a very ideal choice \nthat President Bush has made.\n  First and foremost, Governor Thompson is a problem solver, focused on \nimproving the lives of real people. As Senators of both parties noted \nduring our hearing last week, Governor Thompson has made remarkable \nprogress in addressing the health care needs of families in Wisconsin. \nSuccessful programs such as Badger Care and family care reflect his \nability to reach consensus and implement concrete solutions. In \naddition, Governor Thompson is a true innovator. On issues such as \nWelfare reform he has shown that he is willing to cast away old, tired \napproaches. He reaches out for new ideas and develops creative \nsolutions to tough problems.\n  Governor Thompson has also been an effective administrator and \nmanager of his State, expertise that will be critical as he oversees \nimportant programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and the State children's \nhealth insurance program. Coming from being a Governor of a State, I \nthink he has appreciation that one size doesn't fit all in our great \ncountry. A mold poured in Washington, DC, doesn't necessarily solve the \nproblems of New York City or Madison, WI, with the same effectiveness \nas if we would give some leeway to the Governor of the State of New \nYork and the Governor of the State of Wisconsin leeway in solving those \nproblems that are unique to their respective States and, hence, deserve \na unique solution.\n  I can say from the standpoint of his work on welfare reform that he \ndid not wait for the Federal Government to pass welfare reform before \nhe started working within Federal law with what he could do to improve \nthe system. When we were working on this in 1996, he was able to come \nto Washington and discuss the expenses and what needed to be done with \nFederal law to allow each State to have some leeway to help people move \nfrom welfare to work, to give people a chance, to move people from the \nfringe of our society to the mainstream of our society in order to be \nin that mainstream and to have the opportunities for advancement and \nprogress as those in the mainstream.\n  I think he is flexible. That flexibility that he has will serve well \nnot only our Federal policies, but it will also help Governors and \nState and local administrators do a better job as they have some \nleeway. Also, as there are some changes in programs that will be \nsuggested by President Bush we in the Congress will work on, as well. \nIt gives citizens an opportunity to have right here in this town, full \ntime, a person who has had the experience of being a Governor--where \nthe rubber meets the road--on Federal programs to make sure that we are \nable to make the best policy to fit a country that is as geographically \nvast as ours, with heterogenous population.\n  Lastly--and I hope this responds to some of the cynicism of people \nabout Washington being too partisan sometimes I am pleased to report, \nas Governor Thompson has been successful in his State, he has done it \nbecause he has been able to reach across party lines because he himself \nhas followed the same principle of bipartisanship to find successful \nsolutions in his home State by reaching across party lines. That \nbipartisanship and how it has been successful is shown in the fact he \nwas warmly introduced to our committee by Senator Dole, a Republican, \nSenator Kohl and Senator Feingold, who are Democrats, and by Secretary \nShalala from the present administration, who worked closely with \nGovernor Thompson when she was chancellor of the University of \nWisconsin.\n\n  This support from party leaders on both sides of the aisle speaks for \nitself. I hope we in Washington will apply the Governor's bipartisan \napproach in Congress. I think we will.\n  As I noted at the hearing, we are in a unique situation in the \nSenate. Bipartisanship can no longer be a hobby for a few; instead, it \nneeds to be a way of life for all. The American people demand it. We \nmust respond. I think hopefully when we look back at this year and even \nmore so after 2 years of this 107th Congress, we will be able to say \nthat the fact that the Senate was split 50/50 was good because it \nbrought people closer together.\n  For my part, I respond to the initiatives and the ideas that Governor \nThompson brings and to an evenly divided Finance Committee, hoping we \nwill seize the opportunity to solve the real problems we face--\nmodernizing Medicare and improving access to prescription drugs for \nseniors, reducing the number of 43.5 million uninsured, improving \nhealth care in rural communities. That is something that Senator Baucus \nand I have worked closely on over a long period of time, improving \nlong-term care. These are priorities for me, but I am sure they are not \njust my priorities. They are priorities for many in this Congress, and \nparticularly those that serve on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I look forward to working closely on these priorities, not only with \nmy colleagues, but with Governor Thompson in his new position as \nsecretary HHS. Governor Thompson deserves not only our votes but our \nthanks for his willingness to serve our country even though it means \nleaving both a job and a State he loves. I am also grateful to \nPresident Bush for choosing such a qualified Senate. He sends a clear \nsignal for his desire for problem solving, effective management, and \nbipartisanship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I note the presence of the new \nFinance Committee chairman. This is the first appearance of our new \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I know all Senators agree \nwith me in saying we look forward to a very long, prosperous, \nproductive period, and eagerly seek to work with the chairman in a \nbipartisan nature, noting the 50/50 composition of the Senate. It is a \nterrific opportunity we have. I know I speak for the chairman in saying \nhe also shares my desire to do the same.\n  I rise to give my enthusiastic support to the nomination of Governor \nTommy Thompson of Wisconsin to be our nation's 19th Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. I think he will be a great Secretary. He has the \nenergy, the spirit, creativity, enthusiasm, and he takes a \nbipartisanship approach. He is quite a guy. He has the spirit of his \npredecessor, another Badger, if I can use that term. Secretary Shalala \nalso had a lot of energy and spirit. I think Governor Thompson, when he \ndoes retire from that job and looks back upon his term, will find that \nhe feels good about his achievements, and the rest of the country will \nas well.\n  In saying so, I do not mean to imply that I expect to agree with \nevery position of our about-to-be-Secretary. There are clearly going to \nbe some issues on which we disagree--for example, a woman's right to \nchoose and some aspects of the upcoming Medicare debate.\n\n  With that said, I think Mr. Thompson is the right person for a very \ntough job. It is not an easy job. But he is more than up to the task. \nHe is known for many things, probably best of all for his work on \nwelfare reform. He is the nation's leader on this issue, as Governor of \nWisconsin where he took the lead on their welfare reform. In many ways, \nhis efforts helped the Senate pass welfare reform legislation. And I \nwas an early supporter of these efforts. Welfare reform has affected \nour nation very significantly, most particularly in my State of \nMontana. I credit Governor Thompson. I salute him for taking that \ninitiative.\n  Just as important, he has provided resources to the programs that are \nnecessary to make Federal reform work\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\nfor needy families. If we are going to have welfare reform, certainly \nthe families on welfare need these resources. And he didn't call it \nwelfare reform, but a workfare program. It was obviously the correct \napproach.\n  Governor Thompson has also been a leader on health care issues. He \nhas found innovative ways to ensure health care coverage for the \nworking poor. We have heard reference to BadgerCare, a combination of \nincreases in Medicaid and the CHIP program. I teased him a bit in the \nhearing when I was talking about the BadgerCare program. It is \nobviously named after the mascot of the University of Wisconsin. The \nmascot of the University of Montana is the grizzly. I am not so sure \n``grizzly care'' makes much sense in Montana, but I mentioned that to \nhim. Frankly, I am not sure BadgerCare really is that warm and \ncomfortable either, but it gives Wisconsin a deep sense of pride.\n  Governor Thompson has a reputation for work in other areas: Expanded \njob training, reform of Wisconsin law to allow women on welfare to keep \nmore of the child support payments they receive. Those of us who know \nGovernor Thompson and who are getting to know him better see him as \nsomeone with a reputation who is very honest, who tells you where he \nstands. An innovator, a risk taker. Perhaps most important of all, as \nmy good friend Chairman Grassley said, he is someone who worked with \nboth Republicans and Democrats to find bipartisan solutions. As the \nchairman mentioned during the confirmation hearings last week when \nGovernor Thompson appeared before the Finance Committee, he was \nintroduced not only by former majority leader Bob Dole, but also by his \ntwo Senators and by Secretary Shalala.\n  Senator Kohl told us that Governor Thompson's ``methods reach across \nthe aisle and his successes reach across the board.''\n  Senator Feingold said that he ``values innovation above partisan \ngridlock.''\n  And outgoing Secretary Shalala said that Thompson is a ``consensus \nbuilder'' rather than an ideologue.\n  That, to my mind, is precisely what we need. A consensus builder, \nbecause the next Secretary faces challenges that defy partisan \nsolutions.\n  First and foremost, Congress must address the pressing need for \nMedicare to cover prescription drugs. The practice of medicine has \nchanged dramatically since Medicare was created in 1965. Today, \nprescription drug therapies play a vital role in medical care.\n  As we all know, drug prices are rising fast, and our seniors who do \nnot have insurance coverage for prescription drugs pay the highest \nprices of anyone in the world.\n  We need to fill this glaring gap in the Medicare program.\n  Accordingly, it is my sincere hope that we can work together to enact \na prescription drug program for all seniors, not just low-income \nseniors, and that we can do so quickly.\n  In addition, we need to improve the Medicaid program and the CHIP \nprogram for low-income kids. We need to find ways to lend a hand to the \n43 million Americans who do not have health insurance. We all call that \na national disgrace, that so many Americans do not have health \ninsurance. There is no other country in the modern industrialized world \nthat has such a large percentage of people uninsured. We Americans have \nto fill that gap quickly.\n  On each of these issues, I look forward to working with Secretary \nThompson to find innovative and bipartisan solutions that improve the \ndelivery of health and human services.\n  He has my full support, and I urge colleagues to vote to confirm his \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota? \nThe Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my good friend from Minnesota if \nthis is a time he wishes to make his longer statement or to withhold. I \nask that because the Senator from Delaware asked me some time ago to \nspeak for about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as it turns out, I will be brief, too. \nIt turns out I will take only about 10 minutes, 15 at the most.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say, if that is all right with the Senator from \nDelaware because he did ask me earlier if he could speak next.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I apologize. I thought I had some time reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota does have 60 \nminutes. Without objection, he is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first let me make it clear I am going \nto support Governor Thompson to be Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I do not intend to oppose him, and I look forward to working \nwith him.\n  When he appeared before the HELP Committee, we had a spirited \ndiscussion. I think there are many areas where we can work together. \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services is very important and there \nare a lot of areas that are critical to the lives of people in \nMinnesota where this Secretary is going to be in a key role.\n  I talked to Governor Thompson, soon to be Secretary Thompson, about \nhaving some parity in ending the discrimination in mental health \ncoverage. We talked also about trying to end discrimination when it \ncomes to substance abuse coverage. We talked about the importance of \nthe strong support that Secretary Shalala showed for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act and the steps we need to take to reduce that \nviolence.\n  I think Senator Harkin asked the question about stem cell research, \nhow important it is not only for people struggling with Parkinson's but \nfor people struggling with other diseases. I thought we covered a lot \nof issues that are extremely important. I believe Secretary-to-be \nThompson will be an important leader in these areas.\n  I want to talk about one area of disagreement, though not a lot, \nwhich is why I want to take some time on the floor. It is an appeal to \nGovernor Thompson. It is an appeal to colleagues. It is something I \nintend to be vigilant about as a Senator from Minnesota. It has to do \nwith TANF or what we call welfare reform.\n  As my colleague pointed out, Montana has been viewed as a State which \nis a leader in welfare reform--as a model, by some, for welfare reform. \nBut what troubles me is that all too often we define reform as \nreduction of the caseload. None of us ever intended that welfare reform \nshould be equated, ipso facto, with just the number of people who no \nlonger receive welfare. The question was whether or not these families, \nalmost all of them headed by women with children, all of them low-\nincome, were able to move from welfare to economic self-sufficiency.\n  It just does not suffice to say that in Wisconsin or Minnesota or \nDelaware or Montana or anywhere in the country, TANF has been a huge \nsuccess because we have cut the rolls by 50, 70, or 80 percent. The \nquestion is whether or not we have reduced the poverty. I raised these \nfigures during our hearing. It is not really just about Wisconsin, \nwhich is a State I dearly love, and not to talk about a Governor in the \nnegative who, frankly, has put more investment into child care and job \ntraining and health coverage than many Governors have, but it is \ninteresting and important and I asked the Governor about this.\n  When it comes to infant mortality, in 1996-1998 Wisconsin had the \nhighest Hispanic infant mortality rate in the country and the fourth \nhighest black infant mortality rate in the United States of America.\n  I believe the figures in the early 1990s were different. Wisconsin \nreally ranked well. They did well compared with other States in the \ncountry. When it comes to neonatal mortality rates, in 1989-1991 \nWisconsin had the seventh best black infant neonatality rate. By 1997-\n1998, it had the fifth worst neonatal infant mortality rate in the \nUnited States. Wisconsin lagged dead last in the country for \nHispanic neonatal infant mortality--double the U.S. average in 1996-\n1998.\n\n  Why do I say this? Not to bash away at this Governor, who has been \none of the leaders and has been willing to make more of the up-front \ninvestment, but to point out to colleagues that when you ask this \nGovernor and other Governors--there is at least one former Governor \nhere who might disagree with me--about welfare reform, they will say it \nhas been a great success. Then you ask: Do you have the empirical data? \nCan you tell me where are these families? Do the mothers have jobs? Are \nthey living wage jobs? What is the child care situation? Or, in the \nUnited States of America post-1996, do you know that there has been a \n30-percent\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\ndecline in food stamp participation, which is the major safety net \nprogram for poor children in America, to make sure they do not go \nwithout food? Ask what has happened.\n  What has happened is we have become so anti-welfare that we are \nneglecting to tell people they are eligible for some of these benefits.\n  So I want to make the case today not against Governor Thompson, but \nthat even in Wisconsin, which is recognized as a State where you had a \nGovernor who was willing to make more of the up-front investment, you \nhave had a situation where there is some troubling data when it comes \nto the infant mortality rate, especially for children of color.\n  I will tell you something. I believe all of us have been guilty of \nnot wanting to look at the data. Sometimes we do not know what we do \nnot want to know. What I want to know and what I want to know from this \nadministration is, as the TANF bill, welfare, comes up to \nreauthorization: Have we just dramatically reduced the rolls or have we \nreally reduced the poverty?\n  I can go through studies that will tell you that, in the majority of \ncases, these women do not have living-wage jobs. I can tell you too \nmany of these families have lost medical assistance. I can tell you, \nbased upon a Berkeley-Yale study, that the child care situation is \nreally quite dangerous and inadequate. And I can tell you that just \nbecause you have single parents and just because they have children and \njust because they are scapegoated and just because it is easy to be \nanti-welfare, we better make sure in this reauthorization that we do it \nright.\n  That is why I speak because this Governor, this Secretary to be, is \ngoing to be playing a critical role.\n  I will just conclude, since I do not have a lot of time, by showing a \ncouple of charts which I have which make my point. I asked the Governor \nabout this, I say to my colleague from Montana, during the hearing. If \nyou look at President Bush's proposed tax cut, which ultimately we are \ntalking about $1.6 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, and you \nadd to that interest, and you add to that Pentagon expenditures, and \nyou add to that what we must put into the Social Security trust fund, \nand you add to that what we must spend for Medicare, do you know how \nmuch money you are going to have for children, for job training, for \nchild care, for education and all the rest? Zero dollars.\n  So I would say to Governor Thompson, and I say to this \nadministration: How are we going to do welfare reform right so we do \nmake sure that women and poor children do not pay the price? Where is \nthe investment in child care going to be? Where is the investment in \neducation going to be? Where is the investment in job training going to \nbe? I do not see any dollars for it. That is what I am worried about.\n  We all say we care so much about the elderly. I have two parents I \ndesperately wanted to stay at home and not be in a nursing home. They \nboth had Parkinson's disease. Where is the money going to come from for \nthe investment to make sure our parents and grandparents can live at \nhome in normal circumstances with dignity, with $1.6 trillion in tax \ncuts.\n  Finally--and this goes way beyond Governor Thompson--no child left \nbehind? This is President Bush's education reform. I have heard some \nlanguage about this on the floor today. Here is where we are heading in \nmy not, I will admit, so humble opinion.\n  Putting vouchers aside, which is a nonstarter, you are going to have \nmandatory testing in every State when it comes to title I children, \nlow-income children, low-income neighborhoods, low-income schools. In \nthe school districts, they are going to hire consultants to teach \nteachers how to teach for the tests. The kids are going to have \nconsultants to teach them how to take the tests. It is going to be \ndrill education. It is going to be educationally deadening. That is \nwhat is going on in the country. And do you know something else? We are \nsetting up all these kids and all these teachers--I have two children \nto teach--and we are going to set up all these schools for \nfailure because the accountability does not stop at the school door. \nWhat about us, Democrats and Republicans, and what about President \nBush? How can you leave no child behind when you have $1.6 trillion in \ntax cuts which erodes the revenue base and makes it impossible to \nexpand funding for Head Start, child care, the title I program, and the \nIDEA program, which is nowhere fully funded.\n\n  This is not a step forward. It is a great leap sideways. This is a \ngreat leap backwards. Fannie Lou Hamer, a great civil rights leader, \nonce uttered the immortal words:\n\n       I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.\n\n  I am going to make a fairly angry statement today: I am sick and \ntired of playing symbolic politics with children's lives. If you want \nto have children pass these tests, first, do not rely on one \nstandardized test; have multiple measures. Then you make the investment \nin these children so every child has an opportunity to achieve, do \nwell, and pass tests.\n  This cannot be done. You cannot ``leave no child behind'' on a tin-\ncup budget. I want to know whether this administration is serious about \nthese investments. I will wait to see the budget, and I hope Democrats, \nif this administration wants to govern at the center of children's \nlives, and it wants to make this investment so these kids come to \nkindergarten ready to learn, I say to the Presiding Officer, I am \nwilling to work together. If this administration does not do that and \njust have these tests, then all we have done is set these children, \nthese teachers, and these schools up for failure.\n  It will be cynical, it will be counterproductive, and as a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, I will draw the line, and I hope other Senators will as \nwell. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield now to a new Senator. I look \nforward to hearing from the former Governor of the State of Delaware, \nMr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and for \nthe opportunity to speak today.\n  For the last 8 years, I served as Governor of Delaware and a \ncolleague of Governor Thompson. During that period of time, my family \nwas fortunate enough to be a guest in his home. We have eaten at his \ntable. There were times over the last 8 years when we crossed swords--\nrarely. But there have been many more times when we found there was \ncommon ground and the opportunity to work together for the good of \nWisconsin, Delaware, and the other 48 States.\n  He was chairman of the National Governors' Association for a year. He \nwas also the chairman for our Center for Best Practices within the \nNational Governors' Association. In those roles, I found him to be, \nfirst of all, pragmatic; secondly, I found him to be innovative.\n  I found Governor Thompson to be someone who is civil, who really does \nnot just talk about bipartisanship, but he actually means it and lives \nit. I found in Governor Thompson someone who really tries to treat his \ncolleagues the way he would want to be treated.\n  I want to pause for a moment and direct my thoughts and attention to \nwelfare reform. Some people think it is possible to do welfare reform \non the cheap and we simply set time limits and push people off a cliff \nat the end of that period of time. Governor Thompson does not approach \nwelfare reform that way, nor do I, nor do most of our Governors.\n  When welfare was actually created over 60 years ago, we set up a \nsystem with the best of intentions, but a system that unwittingly \nturned out to encourage people to get on welfare and have children out \nof wedlock, have them early, and for fathers to walk away from those \nresponsibilities and for people to be better off by staying on welfare.\n  What Governor Thompson has done and what Governors across the country \nhave done is to say maybe we should change the incentives we set up \nover the last 60 years so people are better off when they go to work, \nnot by staying on welfare.\n  For Gov. Tommy Thompson, it has meant spending more money on child \ncare, not less.\n  For Gov. Tommy Thompson, it has been spending more money on health \ncare to make sure when people leave welfare they do not also lose \nhealth care for themselves and their families.\n  For Gov. Tommy Thompson, it has been providing transportation so \npeople have the opportunity to take a job\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\nand actually have a way of getting there.\n  For Gov. Tommy Thompson, and for the rest of us, it has meant \nchanging our tax policies as well so people are not penalized for the \nfirst dollar they make when they go to work but actually are able to \nrealize and keep that purchasing power they have earned.\n  He does not believe in welfare reform on the cheap. He has a good, \nrealistic, tough-love approach. Sure, there is a toughness to it, but \nthere is also real love and compassion, and I believe he will take \nthose same qualities to his new post as Secretary if we confirm him, \nwhich I hope we will.\n  Another way I got to know him, believe it or not, is through Amtrak. \nThe President historically appoints one Governor to serve on the Amtrak \nboard. He was on the Amtrak board before me. President Clinton \nappointed me to serve for 4 years, and at the end of my service, I \nrecommended the President appoint Governor Thompson again. Not only \nthat, he ended up serving as the chairman of the board for Amtrak. In \nthat capacity, he has helped to focus, spread, and expand passenger \nrail service, to improve the quality of that passenger rail service, to \nfind ways to reduce Amtrak's operating budget deficit, to invest in the \ninfrastructure of passenger rail service, and to try to be fair to not \njust the customers but the folks who work for Amtrak.\n  In closing, I am delighted to be able to stand here before you today \nto say this is somebody I know, somebody I have known for a long time. \nThis is someone of whom the people of Wisconsin can be proud. This is \nsomeone I am proud to express my support for today and to encourage my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper for those warm \nremarks about the Secretary-to-be, Governor Thompson. I say to the \nSenator--he may not know this--when Governor Thompson and the Amtrak \nboard were trying to negotiate further funding for Amtrak, there was a \nproposal to take certain funds out of the highway trust fund. I had a \nsomewhat tense meeting in the office of the Senator's predecessor, \nSenator Roth, with Governor Thompson and many others on how to handle \nall this.\n  Frankly, I was adamant that money not come out of the trust fund. My \npoint being, very much to his credit and to the Senator from Delaware, \nwe worked out another solution as the bonding authority to provide \nresources to Amtrak. I am very grateful and appreciative of the way in \nwhich Governor Thompson handled that issue; that is, we both wanted to \naccomplish the same goals and objectives: Further funding for Amtrak, \nbut not at the expense of the highway trust fund, money motorists paid \nin gasoline taxes which should go back to the States for highways. \nRather, we saw another way and both sides were happy. I commend the \nSenator from Delaware, as well as Governor Thompson. This is an early \nexample of this is a guy with whom we can work, who is straight, \npragmatic, and looks for solutions. That made a positive impression \nupon me.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. The Senator from \nWisconsin seeks the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator \ncertainly has it right, he knows what it is like to watch Tommy \nThompson in action and to watch him try to solve a problem. His \nassessment is right and so is the assessment of the former Governor and \nnow new Senator from Delaware who, as so many other Governors, has told \nme how much they have enjoyed and benefitted from working with Governor \nThompson. It is uniform.\n  That is also the experience we have had in Wisconsin. I think I speak \nfor myself, as well as for the senior Senator, Mr. Kohl. We are the two \nSenators who have worked with Tommy Thompson throughout the 14 years he \nhas been the Governor of our State. No one in the long history of our \ngreat State has served as Governor longer, and he is a very popular \nGovernor.\n  For me, I marvel at him. I used to listen to older legislators talk \nabout having known a person for many years and worked with them for \nmany years. I am getting there with this one. I started working with \nGovernor Thompson, then State representative Tommy Thompson, when I was \nin my twenties. Now 18 years later, I can tell you it has been an \nexcellent relationship. Our roles have changed over the years, but \nconsistently I have found it a pleasure to work with Governor Thompson, \nand I think you will find it the same when he becomes Secretary.\n  We worked together on a wide range of issues--increasing access to \nhome- and community-based services for the elderly and the disabled, \nand expanding health care for children and their families.\n  I want to mention a couple things.\n  Everybody talks about, of course, the signature issue of Governor \nThompson--welfare reform. It is probably the most well-known example of \nhis can-do attitude.\n  We in Wisconsin can be proud that our State was the first in the \nNation to submit a welfare plan under the 1996 law that created the \ntemporary services to needy families, or the TANF program. In fact, I \nam very proud of our Governor on this. The Wisconsin plan was submitted \non the very day that President Clinton signed the TANF program into \nlaw.\n\n  Tommy Thompson has also been very devoted to the issue of child care. \nBecause of his record, Wisconsin is also proud of its rating among the \ntop 10 States in the Nation for the quality of child care by Working \nMother magazine. The national recognition is a testament to the \nunprecedented investments Wisconsin continues to make in safe, \naffordable child care.\n  In the area of research, which is so very important across the \ncountry, and especially to those of us in Wisconsin and those of us who \ntake such pride in our great university and its research abilities, \nthis man, as Governor, has been a great supporter of medical research. \nHe has been a vocal advocate of funding research at the University of \nWisconsin, setting up an incubator for transferring that technology to \nthe private sector. The Governor proposed a $317 million initiative to \nbuild a series of state-of-the-art research centers at the University \nof Wisconsin, Madison campus.\n  With regard to what we like to call BadgerCare, Tommy Thompson has \nworked with both Republicans and Democrats in Wisconsin to enact \nBadgerCare, Wisconsin's program to expand health care coverage \nopportunities to children and their families. He has tirelessly \npromoted BadgerCare's ideals--the idea that children have a much better \nchance of being healthy and doing well in school when they have a \nchance to live in a healthy family.\n  When BadgerCare took effect on July 1, 1999, again, as has been so \noften the case under Governor Thompson, Wisconsin became the first \nState in the Nation with a health insurance program that supports \nparents as well as children. This program has had a number of \nsuccesses. According to the most recent statistics, more than 74,000 \nchildren and their families are now covered under BadgerCare.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about something on which Tommy Thompson \nand I worked together for many years, and that is our so-called \nCommunity Options Program in Wisconsin. We worked together, on a \nbipartisan basis, to support efforts to expand what we call the \nCommunity Options Program, which, better than any other State in the \ncountry, in my view, provides cost-effective home- and community-based, \nlong-term care alternatives to institutions and nursing homes.\n  Wisconsin was already on this issue and working effectively to find \nalternatives in the late 1970s, but there has been significant growth, \non a bipartisan basis, on this issue ever since Governor Thompson \nbecame Governor in 1986. I think we all recognize that a lot more needs \nto be done to reform our long-term care system. It is one of my highest \npriorities.\n  I noticed, when I had the honor of introducing Governor Thompson to \nthe HELP Committee, that many of the members mentioned long-term care. \nPerhaps the most mentioned issue was either home- and community-based \ncare or home health care. Governor\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\nThompson is the right person to work on this issue. I believe he will \nuse his experience as an innovator to make it easier for States such as \nWisconsin to pursue their own reforms, such as making Federal long-term \nwaivers more flexible and making it easier for States to apply for \nthose waivers.\n  So after 18 years, I can talk about a lot of other very positive \nreasons we are lucky to have Tommy Thompson as our new Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. But let me say, all of us in Wisconsin are \nvery proud, and it will take some getting used to having a different \nGovernor just because it seems as though Tommy Thompson has been our \nGovernor forever. Of course, he has been very popular in that regard. \nBut I think it will be a good opportunity for the country to see \nfirsthand what it is like to have a person who has a ``can-do'' \nattitude, a person who really enjoys simply solving problems rather \nthan trying to divide people. I think that has been a hallmark of his \nrole as our Governor. I think it will be a hallmark of his role as the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n  I thank the ranking member and thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not know of any others on our side \nwho wish to speak on this nomination. It is my understanding that there \nare no other Senators on the other side of the aisle who wish to speak \non this nomination as well. I do not see other Senators who have \nspecial orders to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise the Senator from \nMontana, both Senator Kennedy and Senator Reid also asked to speak for \n10 minutes pursuant to the agreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi pertaining to the introduction of S. 149 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I am worried. I expressed this concern \nbefore the inauguration, and I hoped that cooler heads would prevail \nafter the inauguration. Specifically, as I said at that time, surplus, \nsurplus, everywhere a man cries surplus, and there is no surplus.\n  Right to the point, I have been looking for a surplus since we had \none in 1968 and 1969, almost 32 years ago. I worked with George Mahon, \nthen chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We called over to the \nCapitol, and we asked Marvin Watson to check with President Johnson to \nsee if we could cut another $5 billion from the budget. I think it was \naround December of 1968, and, at that particular time, there was no \nBudget Committee. The fiscal year used to run from July to the end of \nJune the following year. We were given permission. We cut the budget. \nThe entire budget amounted to some $178 billion. Now remember, that was \nguns and butter, the war in Vietnam, and domestic needs.\n  Now, here we are, facing $362 billion just in interest costs--almost \n$1 billion a day. The government is spending more in interest costs \nthan it spent for the entire budget in 1968 and 69--far more, more than \ndouble the amount, for nothing. Then I look at the record, and I follow \nit very closely because back in 1997, when we passed the so-called \nBalanced Budget Act, I was on the floor with my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I said if that \nBalanced Budget Act works, I will jump off the Capitol dome.\n  Mr. President, around the fall of last year, I was looking up the \nprice of a parachute because we were getting pretty close to a surplus. \nWhen President George Bush left town, the deficit was $403.6 billion. \nIn other words, we were spending over $400 billion more than we were \ntaking in. Of course, we have done that for 30 years. There has been no \nsurplus in the entire 30-year-period since our last surplus. We ended \nfiscal year 2000 with a deficit of $23 billion. As of September 30th, \nthe year 2000, almost 4 months ago, it was $23 billion.\n  I carry around, in a similar fashion as my distinguished friend from \nWest Virginia--he carries around the Constitution, and I carry around a \nlittle sheet, as much as I can keep it up to date, called ``The Public \nDebt To The Penny.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this sheet printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      THE PUBLIC DEBT TO THE PENNY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent: January 22, 2001.....................     $5,728,195,796,181.57\nCurrent month:\n  January 19, 2001............................      5,727,776,738,304.64\n  January 18, 2001............................      5,725,695,166,475.90\n  January 17, 2001............................      5,718,517,343,351.92\n  January 16, 2001............................      5,711,790,291,567.40\n  January 12, 2001............................      5,735,197,779,458.19\n  January 11, 2001............................      5,734,110,648,665.41\n  January 10, 2001............................      5,724,315,917,828.49\n  January 9, 2001.............................      5,725,066,298,944.04\n  January 8, 2001.............................      5,719,910,230,364.19\n  January 5, 2001.............................      5,722,338,254,319.31\n  January 4, 2001.............................      5,719,452,925,490.54\n  January 3, 2001.............................      5,723,237,439,563.59\n  January 2, 2001.............................      5,728,739,508,558.96\nPrior months:\n  December 29, 2000...........................      5,662,216,013,697.37\n  November 30, 2000...........................      5,709,669,281,427.00\n  October 31, 2000............................      5,657,327,531,667.14\nPror fiscal years:\n  September 29, 2000..........................      5,674,178,209,886.86\n  September 30, 1999..........................      5,656,270,901,615.43\n  September 30, 1998..........................      5,526,193,008,897.62\n  September 30, 1997..........................      5,413,146,011,397.34\n  September 30, 1996..........................      5,224,810,939,135.73\n  September 29, 1995..........................      4,973,982,900,709.39\n  September 30, 1994..........................      4,692,749,910,013.32\n  September 30, 1993..........................      4,411,488,883,139.38\n  September 30, 1992..........................      4,064,620,655,521.66\n  September 30, 1991..........................      3,665,303,351,697.03\n  September 28, 1990..........................      3,233,313,451,777.25\n  September 29, 1989..........................      2,857,430,960,187.32\n  September 30, 1988..........................      2,602,337,712,041.16\n  September 30, 1987..........................      2,350,276,890,953.00\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Bureau of the Public Debt.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, everyone in this land and those out in \nChina and anywhere else can look up the public debt to the penny on the \nInternet.\n  Yes, if the deficit or debt went up some $23 billion in fiscal year \n2000, and they are claiming a surplus, let's see where it was cut in \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ months. I look and, instead, to my dismay but not to my \nsurprise, the debt ended up at some $5.674 trillion in the last fiscal \nyear. I look today, and, as of 1/22/2001, the public debt was $5.728 \ntrillion. So you can subtract these two figures, and you can see that \nthe debt has gone up some $54 billion.\n  While we are heading toward enlarging deficits and debts, everywhere \nman cries ``Surplus!''--even those with the best of credibility. I \nworked with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, on Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings. Incidentally, if you want to have political anonymity, \ncosponsor a bill with my distinguished friend from Texas. They've \ncalled it Gramm-Rudman from then on--which suits me.\n  Today, I picked up the morning paper. And right down on page A2, it \nsays, ``right now our surplus has never been greater.'' He thinks the \nsurplus has never been greater, yet we still have rising debt.\n  Instead, I wish everybody would turn to the ``Tax-Cut Mania'' article \non page A17 of today's Washington Post.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Tax-Cut Mania\n\n                          (By Steven Rattner)\n\n       With the economy visibly weakening, the preelection debate \n     over the Bush tax cut has nearly turned into a post-election \n     stampede. But even if the economy tips modestly into \n     recession, that still shouldn't panic us into full-sized tax \n     cuts.\n       Haven't we learned anything about economic policy in the \n     past eight years? Nothing has contributed more to our current\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\n     prosperity than having gotten our fiscal house in order.\n       Bringing down the deficit allowed the Federal Reserve to \n     lower interest rates, and lower interest rates played a key \n     role in creating the greatest investment boom in history. \n     Even after adjusting for inflation, investment has risen from \n     $630 billion in 1992 to nearly $1.5 trillion last year, and \n     that investment has, in turn, been a critical part of the \n     productivity surge associated with the New Economy (which \n     remains very much with us, recession or no recession).\n       Meanwhile, consumers have stopped saving. Without those \n     savings available as investment capital for business, the \n     size of the federal deficit or surplus becomes even more \n     important. Whatever the federal government doesn't borrow to \n     finance deficits (or produces as surplus) becomes available \n     for business investment.\n       Tax cuts also bring international repercussions. The lack \n     of savings has contributed meaningfully to our massively \n     negative current account position as we ingest foreign \n     capital to finance the investment boom. A tax cut compounds \n     this problem.\n       While we've made progress with the federal budget, voting a \n     sizable tax cut today would mean committing to spend money we \n     may not have, a significant step backward in the march toward \n     fiscal order. In truth, we're only just balancing the budget. \n     Don't forget that the current year's projected surplus of \n     $256 billion consists mostly of surpluses in the Social \n     Security and Medicare trust funds, surpluses that both \n     presidential candidates agreed should go into a lockbox.\n       And even the $71 billion of true surplus must be viewed in \n     the proper framework: the understandable desire of the Bush \n     administration to propose new spending initiatives for \n     education, defense and other pressing needs, the propensity \n     of Congress to spend on its own agenda (and pork), the \n     eventual adverse impact of slower growth on tax revenues, and \n     the fact that even with the lockbox we haven't truly saved \n     Social Security and Medicare, which will both still run out \n     of money sometime before mid-century.\n       Kept within our means, tax cuts are an important part of \n     holding the size of government to sensible proportions and of \n     redressing inequities, such as the marriage penalty. To \n     paraphrase President Bush's original justification for the \n     tax cut: Genuine surpluses should be returned to the people. \n     So, less tax relief now but perhaps more later as significant \n     surpluses begin to kick in.\n       In the meantime, we need to develop a plan that we can \n     afford and also one less oriented toward helping the wealthy \n     through rate cuts and an end to the estate tax, probably the \n     most progressive tax in our system.\n       But what about the ``recession''? At least until there's \n     evidence of a truly dramatic slowdown, leave that to the \n     Federal Reserve, which has already signaled that still lower \n     rates may be forthcoming. Interest rate cuts can be the \n     quickest and most effective form of fax reduction, \n     particularly when much of the ailment is weak capital \n     markets. Indeed, the Fed's half-point reduction three weeks \n     ago has already succeeded in stabilizing nervous financial \n     markets.\n       Apart from a more quiescent Nasdaq, important indicators \n     such as the interest rate difference between corporate and \n     government borrowings have begun to turn down--a positive \n     signal--after relentlessly rising through the fall. Some, \n     particularly in the Bush camp, have chosen to read the Fed's \n     dramatic action on Jan. 3 as another vote for a quick and \n     large tax cut. Just the opposite. If the Fed is prepared to \n     move quickly and aggressively to combat slowdown, that's all \n     the more reason why we shouldn't abandon our fiscal \n     discipline.\n       Under more extreme circumstances, a tax cut to fight \n     recession can make economic sense, but the slowdown we're \n     experiencing is hardly of Great Depression scale. Even Morgan \n     Stanley Dean Witter, whose early January recession call set \n     off a particularly loud alarm bell, projects the mildest of \n     recessions, and positive economic growth for this year as a \n     whole. The recession may be over while Congress is still \n     chewing over the tax cut.\n       Part of today's tax-cut mania is politics--a new \n     administration eager to paint its economic inheritance in \n     negative terms and to justify an ill-advised campaign \n     platform--and part is the fact that after a decade of \n     unbroken prosperity, we've become too easily traumatized by \n     the occasional bump in the economic road. In fact, recessions \n     are not only inevitable but necessary to cleanse the economy \n     of imbalances that have built up.\n       That's particularly true with today's stresses, \n     particularly in the financial markets. We've seen this movie \n     before. In late stages of an economic expansion, lenders \n     relax their guard and investors fall in love with all manner \n     of the next new thing. Before we wheel out too much anti-\n     recession artillery, bear in mind that no tax cut can help \n     the fact that at 5000, the Nasdaq was wildly overvalued and \n     that we have many companies--not just dot-coms but companies \n     in telecom and other sectors--with truly bad business plans \n     that need to be allowed to disappear quietly into the night.\n       Nor can a tax cut help the fact that one cause of this \n     slowdown and cleansing is a reversal of the ``wealth \n     effect,'' the propensity of consumers to spend and business \n     to invest when markets are robust. An injection of reality \n     into irrational and unrequited optimism about corporate \n     profits brought down the stock market; what should we do--\n     pump the Nasdaq back up to 5000?\n       When the Clinton administration arrived in 1993, it too \n     proposed a short-term stimulus package. Happily for the \n     economy, cooler heads prevailed. The stimulus was abandoned, \n     deficit reduction was passed, and we've had the longest \n     economic boom in American history. Sounds like a pretty good \n     plan.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

But there are plenty of other \n     directions a financial shock could come from * * *\n       For several months, the tightness of credit in global \n     markets has suggested that the current economic cycle could \n     end in financial crisis. A financial stress index devised by \n     the Montreal-based Bank Credit Analyst Research Group--based \n     on factors such as the degree of leverage in financial \n     markets, bank share prices and the shape of yield curves--has \n     dropped into dangerous territory.\n       Yet the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in interest rates \n     on January 3 has put a dramatically different complexion on \n     events. The question is whether this surprise move will take \n     the financial sting out of the slowdown in the US and the \n     world economy.\n       Confidence has returned triumphantly to the US bond market. \n     In spite of warnings from rating agencies of a big rise in \n     defaults, junk bonds have been selling like hot cakes since \n     the start of the year. January has also seen an exceptionally \n     high volume of investment-grade bond issues.\n       In Europe the successful sale last week of nearly \n     10bn ($9.5bn) of bonds by British \n     Telecommunications was reckoned by some analysts to be a \n     turning point for telecom debt. Credit conditions generally \n     have eased. And financial flashpoints in emerging market \n     economies such as Argentina and Turkey have been successfully \n     addressed by the International Monetary Fund. To those who \n     responded to the rate cut by asking ``what does Alan \n     Greenspan, the Fed chairman, know that we don't?'' the bond \n     markets are saying ``who cares?''.\n       Yet it is possible, that the doubters were looking for the \n     wrong kind of financial crisis. The last economic cycle came \n     to an end with a banking debacle followed by recession. In \n     the U.S., Japan and much of Europe, commercial banks had \n     over-extended themselves in property. In the present cycle \n     bankerly exuberance threatened to unleash a downturn when the \n     over-borrowed Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund came \n     close to collapse in 1998.\n       The Fed's efforts to head off a systemic disaster by \n     cutting interest rates had the effect of prolonging the \n     economic cycle. It also provided a friendly environment for a \n     high-technology bubble. The result is that the cycle is \n     ending untypically, although in a way that would have looked \n     familiar to a 19th-century businessman. Over-investment \n     prompted by an artificially low cost of capital, together \n     with increased global competition, have prevented businesses \n     from passing on rising labour and energy costs in higher \n     prices.\n       There is thus a shock to the real economy that is reflected \n     in an autonomous slowdown and a profits squeeze instead of a \n     full-scale financial shock. The high-tech bubble was, after \n     all, substantially financed by equity, not debt. And in place \n     of the overheating in junk bonds that characterised the end \n     of the 1980s, we have seen manic investment in venture \n     capital.\n       The banking system has a number of discrete problems--the \n     Californian energy crisis, bad debts in telecoms, financial \n     fragility in emerging market economies and the rest. So far \n     they remain non-contagious. But there must be a risk that the \n     cumulative impact could start to pose systemic problems.\n       This, says a central banker, could be difficult to manage. \n     When a crisis has a single focus as with property or Latin \n     American debt, he points out, ``you can put someone in charge \n     of the hospital ship and then focus on strategy to get out of \n     the mess. If the problems are spread across the whole loan \n     portfolio, it's harder to do this.''\n       U.S. commercial banks have greatly enlarged their capital \n     since the last seizure in 1990. So while asset quality has \n     deteriorated and charge-offs have risen Alan Greenspan felt \n     able to argue last month that the problems ``remain \n     historically modest relative to assets and capital''.\n       Yet the economy does remain vulnerable to financial shocks, \n     of which the most worrying concerns the link between the \n     stock market and the U.S. private sector's balance sheet. One \n     consequence of the Fed's interest rate cuts after the LTCM \n     crisis was that it gave the private sector an opportunity to \n     spend and accumulate more debt. Since the start of the bull \n     market, U.S. household debt has gone from less than 65 per \n     cent to more than 95 per cent of personal disposable income, \n     while the savings ratio has fallen to zero.\n       When households are already so heavily indebted they may \n     respond less readily to the Fed's interest-rate invitation to \n     go on another spending binge. But the debt also needs\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n     to be seen in the context of the overall household balance \n     sheet, in which the asset side carries an unprecedented \n     amount of stock market investments. About 45 per cent of the \n     population is reckoned to have exposure to equities either \n     directly or via defined contribution pension plans.\n       Stock market capitalization has fallen from about 180 \n     percent of gross domestic product at its peak last March to \n     164 percent last week. There has been no collapse in \n     residential property. But if that sounds reassuring, note \n     that the stock market's earlier peaks in August 1929 and \n     December 1972 were well below these levels, at 81 percent and \n     78 percent of GDP.\n       The scope for an adverse valuation adjustment on the basis \n     of changing expectations is far from negligible. The Bank \n     Credit Analyst argues that the era of super-normal equity \n     returns is over. Between 1982 and 1999, it points out, the \n     Standard & Poor's 500 index generated average annual total \n     returns after inflation of 16 percent, or twice the average \n     during the previous half-century. The average returns in \n     future, it argues, are likely to be no more than 8 percent \n     before inflation.\n       If that is right and if private individuals have yet to \n     downgrade their expectations fully, there would be room for a \n     very sharp balance sheet adjustment as disillusioned \n     households rebuilt their depleted savings by investing in \n     non-equity assets.\n       Also relevant is the distribution of household debt. A \n     lesson of the late 1980s boom in the US and the UK was that \n     only a small proportion of the borrowing population has to be \n     in difficulty to put big downward pressure on asset prices \n     and create a bust.\n       Nor would the impact of a stock market shock be restricted \n     to negative wealth effects, as people responded to falling \n     asset values by spending less. It could exacerbate problems \n     in banking.\n       If overstretched telecoms operators find that sliding \n     equity and bond markets are no longer willing to offer them \n     fresh funds, the banks may be asked to increase their \n     exposure to their least creditworthy customers, causing a \n     decline in asset quality.\n       And any weaknesses among the investment banks, which have \n     enormous leverage on and off the balance sheet, both through \n     borrowing and exposure to derivatives, would be ruthlessly \n     exposed.\n       There are other possible shocks. In the bond market, \n     investors' perceptions may become more cautious, with fallout \n     for equities. The risk, says David Hale of Zurich Financial \n     Services, is that the new Bush administration may forge \n     consensus by embracing more of the Democrats' spending \n     proposals. If the economy is weak, he adds, Republicans will \n     feel even less inhibited as they worry about the mid-term \n     elections in 2002.\n       The dollar is another source of vulnerability, given the \n     financing challenge of a current account deficit of 4 percent \n     of GDP. Weakness against the euro would be helpful in \n     rebalancing global economic growth. But a collapse would be \n     another matter given the inflationary consequences.\n       Whether these vulnerabilities turn into shocks is \n     inherently unpredictable. But as Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley \n     Dean Witter's investment guru, told Barron's magazine last \n     week, ``it still boggles my imagination that everybody thinks \n     we can come through the biggest bubble in the history of the \n     world and certainly the longest boom the US has ever had, and \n     get out of it with a very, very mild recession''.\n       His is not the only imagination that remains boggled.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is Tuesday, January 23--today. You will understand \nmy grave misgivings about all of these tax cuts. Everybody loves a tax \ncut. But we have to act responsibly and look at whether or not, in \nessence, instead of cutting taxes, we are increasing taxes, namely, \nincreasing interest costs on the national debt.\n  One of my colleagues, in cosponsoring President Bush's tax cut \npackage, said, ``You have to starve the beast.'' We heard about \nstarving the beast from President Ronald Reagan. It was first Kemp-\nRoth; and Senator Dole, then the head of our Finance Committee, had his \ncomments about that. Better than all of them was former President Bush. \nHe called it voodoo economics. President Reagan turned Kemp-Roth into \nReaganomics, and we are supposed to starve the beast, to cut all the \ntaxes.\n  What did we do? We increased the biggest waste in the history of \nGovernment; namely, the interest cost that is gone, where it was at the \ntime we balanced the budget at $16 billion, it has now increased to \n$362 billion--$362 billion for absolutely nothing, just for past \nprofligacy, just for ``starving the beast.''\n  Come on, there is no education in the second kick of a mule. Don't \ncome around here saying, ``We are going to starve the beast and reduce \nthe taxes of the people. You know those Washington folks, they are \ngoing to spend it. Get it out of the hands of the politicians.'' That \nis big political nonsense.\n  You talk about campaign finance, the biggest campaign finance abuse \nis not soft money. Oh no, the biggest abuse is how the politicians--\nnamely we Senators and Congressmen--use the Federal budget to get \nourselves reelected. If we can run around and give tax cuts, then, as \nPresident Reagan said, ``The government is not the solution to the \nproblem, the government is the problem.\n  We have had 20 years of that nonsense. We have to sober up, and we \nhave to start paying our bills. I am going to be coming from time to \ntime to explain that we do not have a surplus--I wish we did--and I am \ngoing to caution the Members that when they start giving tax cuts, they \nare only increasing the interest costs of the debt. We know President \nBush is going to increase defense. He has already said we ought to have \nan increase in military pay. We gave a pay raise last year, but we are \ngoing to give another increase, he says.\n  We know, according to Secretary Colin Powell, we are going to \nincrease funding for the State Department.\n  We know we are going to increase funding for the Department of \nAgriculture. If he doesn't increase agriculture funding, Bush will be \nthe first President who has not.\n  We know we are going to increase energy funding. Look at the \nsituation out on the west coast.\n  We know we are going to increase education funding. President Bush \nhas a proposal in right now. If you are going to test everybody, you \nare going to have accountability. I hear it costs $10 just at the \nelementary level and $50 at the higher levels for testing. This is \ngoing to cost into the millions, perhaps billions.\n  So everybody is talking about increasing spending or increasing the \ndebt and cutting out the revenues, increasing the debt. Somewhere, \nsomehow, somebody will stand in front of this stampede and talk sense \nto the American people. Hopefully, the message will come through.\n  How is this even called a surplus with any face whatever?

Mr. President, that sheet breaks down the deficit and \ndebt as debt held by the Government and debt owed to the public. You \ncan see the debt owed to the public has been reduced $37 billion. But \nthen the debt held by the Government has gone up $91 billion. So what \nhappens? Yes, we have now an increase in the debt of $54 billion.\n  This accounting is like using your Visa card to pay off your \nMasterCard. You still owe the same amount of money under the Visa card; \nthe debt is on the Visa rather than on the MasterCard. It is \ntomfoolery. It is outrageous nonsense. We only have one Government, and \nit is public. That is why they call it the public debt. So let's not \nget that ``owe the public.'' We are the custodians of the public. And \nwe are spending Social Security, Medicare, Civil Service retirement, \nmilitary retirement, unemployment compensation, all of these other \nfunds, and saying we are balancing the budget.\n  Now they are into a mumbo-jumbo, saving Social Security mode. All you \nhave to do to save Social Security is not spend it. They continue to \nspend it.\n  If you did not spend the Social Security moneys, you would have \nbetween $2.4 and $2.7 trillion in the next 10 years. How about putting \n$2.7 trillion back into the Social Security kitty rather than taking it \nout, whereby we owe $1.9 trillion to Social Security alone this minute.\n  The same case applies with Medicare. We have been using those moneys. \nWe talk and say we are not going to do it. In fact, we passed a law, \nsection 13-301 of the Budget Act: Thou shalt not, you Congress, or you \nPresident--calculate Social Security moneys in your budget. But they \ndo. They do. And they separate it out, and then they spend it later on. \nIf they have a lockbox and somebody says they put in a bill on the \nlockbox--I am going to put in a true lockbox. Ken Apfel, the \nAdministrator of Social Security, helped me draft it, whereby each \nmonth we remit the amount of T-bills we purchase or give to the public. \nSo we will keep that in the fund and have a true lockbox and not a \nsection 201 as the Social Security Act requires, just put it in \nTreasury bills.\n  There it is. We have this sheet. That is the game being played. Yes, \ncampaign finance, McCain-Feingold. I voted for that bill five times \nalready; I will vote for it again. That bill deals with soft money. \nAspects of this bill are constitutionally questionable, and I have, in \nthe past, introduced a constitutional amendment that says the Congress \nis hereby allowed to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. \nMy bill received a majority vote in the Senate but never did get the 67 \nvotes needed to send it to the States. They would ratify it in a snap. \nI can tell my colleagues that right now.\n  We play games with the American public, and the people who keep us \nhonest play the games along with us; namely, the free press of America. \nThey are the only ones who can stop this game. I cannot do it. No one \nSenator or Congressman or group of them can do it. We have tried.\n  I will put a budget freeze in the budget again this year: Just take \nthis year's budget for next year. That is the kind of economic \nsituation described by Rattner and Plender in their articles. We not \nonly have a fiscal deficit, but we have a current account deficit in \nthe balance of trade of some $366 billion.\n  As those dollars continue to go overseas and decrease in value, we \nare going to have to raise interest rates in order to attract foreign \ninvestment. And if we raise that interest rate to get that foreign \ninvestment, we are going in the opposite direction of Chairman \nGreenspan's recommendations.\n  Chairman Greenspan needs to come forth the day after tomorrow, as he \nis scheduled to testify before the Budget Committee, and say \ncategorically--without being political about it--but say that what we \ndid in 1993 needs to be done: Proceed very cautiously; do not rely on \nthese ten-year projected surpluses.\n  The ten-year budget projection has been the evil in trying to balance \nthe budget. When we had just the Appropriations Committee and not the \nBudget Committee, we had a one year budget. Then we got three year \nbudget projections. Then with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we got 5-year \nbudget projections. Recently, we played the game of 10-year budget \nprojections until President Clinton said we could do away with the \npublic debt in twelve years. He neglected to say, however, that in \nthose 12 years we could transfer the public debt all back into the \nGovernment account and still owe the same amount of money. In fact, we \ncan do that tomorrow morning. Just put in a little bill and say that \nthe public debt shall be paid, and we will transfer it all over to the \nGovernment debt and all go home and get reelected. That nonsense has to \nstop.\n  If anybody can find a surplus in the Government account, namely, in \nthe national debt owed by the United States of America, please tell me, \nand I will be glad to jump off that dome. But unless and until that \nhappens, Mr. President, old Hollings is going to stand here and berate \nthem and nag them and fuss at them.\n  This whole charade is just totally irresponsible. Senator Thurmond \nand I are going to get on; we are not going to have to pay for this, \nbut our children and grandchildren are going to have to pay for it. \nSome of these esteemed Senators who are voting so boldly and \nintroducing bills to ``starve the beast'' are going to learn the hard \nway that they are going to be spending nothing but interest costs. They \nare really going to be increasing the worst kind of tax on the American \npeople--interest costs for which they get absolutely nothing.\n  We are spending that amount of money. When President Clinton gave his \nState of the Union Address last January, it was said by one \ndistinguished Senator that that gentleman is costing us $1 billion a \nminute. President Clinton then talked for 90 minutes, an hour and a \nhalf. President Bush now wants to give a $90 billion-a-year tax cut. \nThose two equal $180 billion. If we really had been paying the bill and \nhad a true surplus, we could give both President Bush and President \nClinton their programs of either spending increases or tax cuts and \nstill have $182 billion. The truth is, instead of spending $362 \nbillion, $1 billion a day, on carrying charges, we would have another \n$182 billion from the $180 billion with which we could easily increase \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health, pay for the military, \nState Department--all of these other budgets.\n  We would be tickled to death to increase all of them. We are spending \nthe money but not getting anything for it. Somewhere, sometime we all \nhave to start talking out of the same book, and that is the book put \nout by the U.S. Treasury itself. Every day they put out the public debt \nto the penny. When we pay down the public debt, rather than increasing \nit by some $54 billion, then let's all get together and talk about tax \ncuts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, earlier this month the U.S. Senate lost \nanother member of its family. Gerard Lougee passed away on January 6th \nat the Washington Hospital Center. Gerard worked in the Senate post \noffice as a mail carrier for the past eighteen years. He was a graduate \nof Cardoza High School and attended the National Presbyterian Church in \nWashington\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\nD.C. He began work in the Senate in 1982 after working in the White \nHouse mail room. During his career in the Senate post office Gerard was \nrecognized for his perfect attendance record, as well as numerous other \nperformance awards.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that President Bush chose yesterday to announce that as \nhis first major policy action since becoming President he is \nreinstating the ``global gag rule'' restricting United States \nassistance to international family planning organizations.\n  There have been few issues in recent years that have been more \ndebated, with people of good intention on both sides of the issue, and \nI am dismayed that the President has opted to start his Administration \nwith such a divisive action.\n  The world now has more than 6 billion people. The United Nations \nestimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. Almost all \nof this growth will occur in the places least able to bear up under the \npressures of massive population increases. The brunt of this decision \nwill be felt not in the United States but in developing countries \nlacking the resources needed to provide basic health or education \nservices.\n  If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of \ntheir families, they must have access to the educational and medical \nresources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their \nhealth.\n  In fact, international family planning programs reduce poverty, \nimprove health and raise living standards around the world; they \nenhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number \nand spacing of their children.\n  Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, \nand under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the \nUnited States has established a long and distinguished record of world \nleadership on international family planning and reproductive health \nissues.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years these programs have come under \nincreasing partisan attack by the anti-choice wing of the Republican \nparty--despite the fact that no U.S. international family planning \nfunds are spent on international abortion.\n  I do not expect President Bush to change his mind. He is the \nPresident, and, under legislation passed by the last Congress it is now \nhis prerogative to determine how U.S. international family planning \nassistance will be used.\n  But I would ask him, and his advisors, to think long and hard about \nthis decision, about how this decision squares with ``humble'' U.S. \nleadership of the international community and our commitment to help \nthose around the world who need and want our help and assistance.\n  I would ask the women of America, as they consider their own \nreproductive rights, to consider the aim and intent of a policy in \nwhich the reproductive rights of American women are approached one way, \nand those of women in the developing world another.\n  And I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who feel as \nstrongly about this issue as I do to consider what legislative remedies \nand options we may have available to address this decision.\n  Mr. President, it had been my sincere hope that under President Bush \ninternational family planning would have been an issue that Republicans \nand Democrats, the Administration and Congress, could have worked on \ntogether, in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It is with no small amount of regret that I say that that no longer \nappears to be the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S450-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY NIELSEN\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to the memory of a \nlady who lived in northeastern Montana who just passed away. She was a \nreliable adviser to me and a wonderful person, although not being born \nof the land or even in that part of the country. She was a native of \nEngland and had moved to northeastern Montana many years ago.\n  Mary Nielsen was one of those unique persons, living in a very remote \nend of this country, the northeastern corner of Montana, isolated and \n150 miles from the nearest major airport--which is not really major. \nAnd for those of us who enjoy pasta--affordable pasta, that is, \nnowadays--the main crop in that part of the world is durum wheat.\n  She served in a group called WIFE, Women Involved In Farm Economics. \nShe took those responsibilities very seriously and, of course, with \ngreat purpose. She became a valuable resource to me and my staff on \ntransportation issues.\n  When I first met her, I was a farm broadcaster. My programs were \naired on the radio station in Plentywood, MT. This was at a time when \nthe big railroads were in the business of abandonments, wanting to \nclose the spur lines that were not very profitable to the big \nrailroads. And that was the case on the Opheim spur up in that part of \nthe country that was originally a part of the Great Northern Railway. \nWe fought hard on that issue because we did not want to see that line \nabandoned, because up there rail transportation is very important in \nmoving our crops to market.\n  So she took it on. It was one of those unselfish things people do, \nleaders do. And you find out that in these small places, in some of \nthese remote places, we have great minds and great leadership.\n  She and others formed an organization called ABLE, the Association \nfor Branch Line Equity, which became a model in this country for \nopposing abandonments of railway lines in agricultural country.\n  She was also a shining star in the political arena. She was \npassionate and articulate. In fact, she received international \nrecognition when she was elected to the office of Sheridan County \nAssessor. She ran on a campaign slogan of ``If elected, I will resign'' \nin an effort to save taxpayers the cost of paying for a county officer \nafter the office was left on the ballot even though all duties had been \nabsorbed by the State of Montana. She was elected and she resigned, and \nthe office went with her.\n  Mary was a great vocal advocate for agriculture. That is what she \nwill be remembered as. She was politically informed and active. She was \na mentor to all who knew her. She was one of those rare people who, as \nan activist, fought with grace and dignity for what she really believed \nin.\n  It is with great sadness that we see her slip into history. Our \nprayers go out to her and her husband Ove and, of course, their family. \nShe was a great lady, with grace, who represented a great, great \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S450-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S450-S453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n\n                     nomination of spencer abraham\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I'm very pleased to have strongly \nsupported the nomination of Senator Spencer Abraham as Secretary of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  As all my colleagues are well aware, Senator Abraham has a \ndistinguished record of leadership here in the Senate. He has \ndemonstrated his initiative and willingness to pursue complex issues on \ncountless occasions during his years of service in this body.\n  Senator Abraham and I served together on the Senate Budget Committee, \nand I came to appreciate his insightful approach to the challenging \ntasks we faced in crafting the nation's budget. Through his work on the \nBudget Committee, Senator Abraham deserves a share of the credit for \nthe wonderful progress towards balancing the federal budgets.\n  From his public service in the State of Michigan, Senator Abraham has \nan in-depth understanding of the issues facing manufacturers and \nconsumers, including their dependence on reliable, clean energy \nsources. He appreciates the immense role of the transportation sector \nin influencing significant parts\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\nof our energy policy. He has been one of the Senate's most \nknowledgeable members on subjects related to high-technology policies \nand the contributions that this important sector makes to America's \neconomy and global success.\n  While Senator Abraham has expressed concerns about the role of the \nDepartment of Energy in the past, I'm pleased to note that he carefully \naddressed his current views in his statement to the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. In that statement, he emphasized his support for \nthe many important missions that comprise the portfolio of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Service as the nation's Secretary of the Department of Energy is a \nchallenge for any individual. The Department has a diverse set of \nmissions, that sometimes seem to lack a coordinating thread. Management \nof this Department is truly a daunting assignment.\n  National security and energy policy will present some of his largest \nchallenges. In the national security area, he and Undersecretary John \nGordon, Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration \nare responsible for all aspects of our nuclear stockpile and a wide \nrange of non-proliferation programs. These two dimensions represent the \ntwo different major approaches to improved national security, \nminimizing threats that could jeopardize our peace and prosperity and \ninsuring our ability to protect ourselves if necessary.\n  Among many important areas, the NNSA must strive to rebuild morale at \nthe weapons laboratories, develop a major infrastructure improvement \ninitiative across the weapons complex, and address serious \ncongressional concerns associated with faulty program management that \nhas led in the recent past to large construction overruns such as the \nexperience on the National Ignition Facility. In the non-proliferation \narea, transparency and accountability will remain serious issues as \nCongress evaluates the advisability of future funding for these vital \nprograms.\n  A comprehensive energy policy is urgently needed, although recovery \nfrom our current energy crisis will be anything but overnight. First we \nneed the policy, then we need years of careful support to implement \nthat policy--only then can we approach a greater degree of energy \nsecurity than we face today. As I've outlined now on several occasions, \nI urge the President to create a multi-Agency approach to national \nenergy policy, so that several key agencies evaluate their decisions in \nlight of assuring our nation of energy security.\n  And finally, the Secretary is responsible for a large fraction of the \nfederal support for science and technology. The nation's scientific and \nengineering talents, and the high technology advances they've \ngenerated, are responsible for a large fraction of our economic \nstrength. In recent years, Congress has started to increase funding in \nkey areas of science and technology. The Secretary of the Department of \nEnergy must organize his scientific programs to maximize their outputs \nand their contributions to our scientific understanding and economic \nsecurity.\n  His past experiences have prepared him very well for these fresh \nchallenges. I look forward to working with Senator Spencer Abraham in \nthis new role as Secretary of the Department of Energy and encourage \nall of my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have supported the \nnomination of Spencer Abraham to be Secretary of Energy.\n  As Secretary, Senator Abraham will face a number of important and \ndifficult challenges. Clearly, we must address our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy and the current spike in fuel prices that is \ndriving transportation and heating costs to unacceptably high levels. \nIn my state of North Dakota, home heating costs are painfully high for \nmany families. And this spring farmers will face high input costs as \nthey head into their fields. I do not think developing a comprehensive \nand effective long-term answer will be easy, but the strength of our \neconomy will depend, in part, on our success in controlling energy \nprice hikes.\n  In addition, our most populous state, California, is in the middle of \nan electricity crisis. Again, this has potential implications for our \neconomy. Finally, the security problems at our national labs will \npresent a difficult challenge for our next Secretary of Energy.\n  Senator Abraham has been a capable and dedicated colleague for the \npast six years. As he noted in his confirmation hearing, his views have \nevolved since he was first elected to this body. Then, he called for \nthe abolition of the Department of Energy. Now he looks forward to \nservice as our next Secretary of Energy. As one who believes the Energy \nDepartment plays a critical role in setting policies that profoundly \nimpact our economy and our national security, I welcome this change of \nheart and wish him well as he enters into this next chapter in his \nservice to our Nation.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Dr. Rod Paige\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Dr. \nRod Paige, Secretary of Education.\n  President George W. Bush has repeatedly emphasized the importance of \neducation being a linchpin of America's future. Moreover, he has linked \nincreased spending on education with real accountability that actually \nproduces results.\n  I think Ben Franklin may have put it best when he said, ``An \ninvestment in knowledge always pays the best interest.'' I believe this \nbecause even on its best day the Federal government can never be a \nreplacement for local administrators, educators, and parents.\n  It is with this in mind that I am so pleased the nomination of Dr. \nRod Paige is before us to be the next Secretary of Education. Dr. Paige \nis not a Washington bureaucrat, rather he is an accomplished educator \nand administrator who has actually served in the education trenches.\n  Dr. Paige's recent tenure as the Superintendent of the Houston \nIndependent School District provides him with the unique perspective of \nwhat is actually involved in running a local school district. \nUnfortunately, that is all too often not the case because Washington \nbureaucrats make the decisions affecting our students instead of local \nadministrators.\n  However, I would submit the practice of implementing a Washington \nbased one size fits all approach is about to come to an end.\n  As a former Superintendent, Dr. Paige, actually understands that \nevery school district does not face the same set of problems and \nWashington does not know what is best. Rather it is the local parents, \nteachers, and administrators who know what the problems are as well as \nthe solutions.\n  I think it also interesting to note the breadth of Dr. Paige's \nexperience in the field of education. Not only was he a school \nsuperintendent, but prior to assuming that role he served as a member \nand then later the president of the Houston School Board.\n  Lest we forget the importance of higher education, Dr. Paige has also \nspent time as an administrator and teacher at Utica Junior College, \nJackson State, and Texas Southern University. In fact, Dr. Paige served \nas the dean of the College of Education at Texas Southern prior to \nserving on the Houston School Board.\n  I would also like to touch upon one final aspect of Dr. Paige's \ncareer and that is his time as a football coach. While the head \nfootball coach at Utica Junior College and Jackson State he was still a \nteacher of students, but instead of desks and a chalkboard he used the \ngridiron as his classroom.\n  In closing, I think we all begin the 107th Congress with unlimited \nopportunities to improve our nation's educational system and among \nthose opportunities is the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act (ESEA).\n  I think there is a lot of agreement on the need for education reform \nconditioned upon accountability and I look forward to working with \nSecretary Paige to achieve those goals.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have supported the \nnomination of Dr. Roderick Paige to be Secretary of Education. I \nbelieve that his commitment to the improvement of public schools and \nhis diverse education experience will bring him success in this \nchallenging and rewarding position. I am looking forward to working \nwith him to address the critical issues associated with our nation's \neducational system.\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\n  I am encouraged by Dr. Paige's accomplishments in Houston. The \nHouston Independent School District has seen dramatic changes under the \nleadership of Dr. Paige, including a decrease in the dropout rate and \nan increase in test scores. He has worked hard to foster partnerships \nbetween public schools and businesses and to encourage community \ninvolvement. Dr. Paige's seven year tenure as superintendent has shown \nhim to be capable, creative, and committed to his students.\n  As we enter a new Administration, it is important that we make the \ngreatest effort to secure our public schools by providing them with the \nsupport they need. Whether it be through school modernization and class \nsize reduction programs, or through increased financial aid for higher \neducation, it is critical that we recognize the role of affordable, \nhigh quality public education for our children.\n  Dr. Paige said, ``I think the public is where we need to begin our \nwork. This is a public system, it is for the public's benefit, it is a \npublic good, and the public must bring itself together and work hard to \nachieve it.'' I agree with him and believe that through hard work \ntogether, we will be able to achieve many good things for our schools, \nour children, and our Nation.\n\n\n                     nomination of donald rumsfeld\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as was apparent to all who attended Mr. \nRumsfeld's confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, our new President has made a good choice for Secretary of \nDefense, one of the nations most important offices. Mr. Rumsfeld held \nthis senior position during the Ford administration, a time when some \nMembers of Congress were just getting their start in public service. \nDecades of experience, respect from both sides of the aisle, \nthoughtfulness, and a strong commitment to this nation make Donald \nRumsfeld well qualified to again serve as Secretary of Defense.\n  As ranking member of the Budget Committee in this equally divided \nSenate, I look forward to working closely with Mr. Rumsfeld to craft a \ndefense budget that strengthens our nation's defense and makes sense in \nthe context of our national fiscal priorities. In light of the fact \nthat both the status quo within our armed forces and massive increases \nin defense spending are untenable, I am interested in talking with the \nnew Secretary about a sustainable defense budget and making policy and \nprocedural changes at the Pentagon that might enable us to retool for \nthe information age and get more for our defense dollar.\n  As the new administration begins to review our nation's approach to \narms control, missile defense, and proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, I would urge Mr. Rumsfeld to avoid preoccupation with \nspecific numbers and keep efforts focused on a central objective: \nincreasing strategic stability and nuclear safety. Toward that end, I \nhope the new Defense Secretary will support and expand the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction program, broaden shared early warning \ninitiatives, encourage more military-to-military contacts with Russia, \naddress the particular threats associated with Russia's enormous \ntactical nuclear stockpile, resist de-alerting initiatives which could \nincrease strategic uncertainty in a crisis, and ensure that the U.S. \nretains a robust and balanced triad of strategic nuclear forces.\n  I want the record to reflect that I have been concerned by some of \nthis nominee's statements regarding arms control. As my colleagues are \naware, Mr. Rumsfeld suggested during his confirmation hearing that the \nABM Treaty is an outdated relic of the cold war, and has discussed \nabandoning the process of arms control and sizing our strategic forces \nunilaterally. I urge Mr. Rumsfeld to reconsider these views. No arms \naccord is perfect, but over the past several decades the arms control \nprocess has produced momentum toward more inspections, transparency, \nreciprocity, and confidence-building between former cold war rivals.\n  This momentum toward greater stability and trust was hard-won and \nshould not be abandoned. One need look no farther than Russia's failure \nto fully implement the 1991 Bush-Gorbachev handshake agreement on \ntactical nuclear reductions to see the folly of unilateralism in arms \ncontrol. In the view of this Senator, any further strategic force \nreductions would best be undertaken in the context of a new START \naccord, one built upon recognition that the ABM Treaty is the \ncornerstone of strategic stability and can allow the limited, \neffective, affordable national missile defense we need to counter \nemerging rogue-state threats.\n  Finally, I look forward to talking with the new Defense Secretary \nabout the importance of Defense Department compliance with statutes \ndirecting that the entire B-52H bomber force be funded. Billions of \ndollars of upgrades and the world's most advanced precision weapons \nhave transformed these airframes into airborne arsenal ships which \ntoday represent the fast, sharp end of the spear in our conventional \ndeterrent force.\n  Mr. President, Donald Rumsfeld has an impressive record. He is \nqualified to be Secretary of Defense. I congratulate him on his \nconfirmation and wish him the very best.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Colin L. Powell\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am honored to have supported the \nnomination of Colin Powell to be our next Secretary of State. Few \nindividuals submitted to the Senate for confirmation have the \ncredentials, experience, values, and respect of the Nation that Colin \nPowell has.\n  Colin Powell has served our Nation with distinction in both civilian \nand military capacities. Powell served the Carter Administration as an \nexecutive assistant in both the Energy and Defense Departments. During \nthe Reagan Administration, Powell was chosen as a senior adviser to \nDefense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and later held his first Cabinet \npost as National Security Advisor to President Reagan. During the Bush \nAdministration, Colin Powell was nominated to serve as Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. Most Americans, however, remember Colin Powell's \nrole as the architect of Operation Desert Storm, and his unique skills \nin developing critical global alliances to defeat the Iraqis forces in \n1991.\n  Colin Powell, however, represents more than a distinguished military \nleader. His life and those values that he has encouraged our young \ncitizens to follow, are an inspiration to us all. During the decade \nsince Operation Desert Storm, I have admired Colin Powell's efforts to \nreach out to America's youth, encouraging our younger citizens to \ncontinue their education, and to aspire to higher goals in life. For \nPowell, the challenge was to make sure that every child in America \nunderstands that he or she is important, and that we, as leaders and \nparents, are going to make certain that every one of them achieves \nsuccess in life. To achieve this goal, Colin Powell urged Americans to \nstep forward as mentors for our youth, and to make certain that young \npeople have access to computers and the Internet. In my opinion, no \nchallenge, and no effort is more important than the education of our \nyouth.\n  Few individuals that have served in this capacity have faced the \nextraordinary challenges and threats around the world. Relations with \nChina, Russia, the Balkans and the Middle East, as well as the \ncontinued nuclear threat and terrorism will demand his immediate \nattention and skills. I am confident of his abilities to handle these \nchallenges, and I am honored to work with Secretary of State Powell on \nthese most difficult issues.\n  Not long ago, Colin Powell was asked during an interview on \nScholastic.com ``what do you believe history will say about you?'' His \nresponse: ``my only request of history is that history books say that I \nwas a good soldier and served the nation well.'' Mr. President, Colin \nPowell has already achieved that goal. I am confident of his continued \noutstanding service to our Nation during the next four years, and \nperhaps most importantly, as a wonderful example to the youth of \nAmerica.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Donald Evans\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I supported the nomination of Donald Evans \nto be Secretary of Commerce. Don Evans has a distinguished background \nin private business as head of a large, independent energy firm. In \naddition, his experience as chairman of the Bush campaign and as \nChairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas system have \nhelped prepare him for overseeing the wide-ranging programs of the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n  As Secretary, Don Evans' first mission will be to promote U.S. \nexports. With a record trade deficit of more than $300 billion last \nyear, I can think of few tasks more urgent than this one. As he takes \non this responsibility, I urge him to remember the critical role that \nsmall businesses and agriculture play in our export successes and not \nconcentrate solely on the role of the largest corporations. We also \ncannot forget the other side of the ledger. Mr. Evans will also be \ncharged with enforcing our trade laws, another vital task to ensure \nthat U.S. farmers and businesses are not competing against unfair \nimports.\n  I am also very concerned about the so-called digital divide in the \ndevelopment of the communications infrastructure and the new e-economy. \nAs Senator for one of the most rural states in the nation, it is \ncritically important to me that our next Secretary aggressively work to \nclose this digital divide to make sure rural North Dakotans get full \naccess to the benefits of information technology.\n  Finally, I would note that the Department of Commerce is responsible \nfor collecting a range of statistics on our population and economy that \nare critical to informing the choices that we, as elected officials \nmust make. The accuracy and accessibility of this data are essential to \nmaking the right choices for America's future.\n  In short, Don Evans faces a host of challenges. I am confident that \nhe will approach them with the same vigor and success with which he ran \nthe Bush campaign, and I look forward to working with him in the months \nand years ahead.\n\n\n                       nomination of ann veneman\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I look forward to working with Ann Veneman \nas Secretary of Agriculture. For North Dakota, there is no Cabinet \nposition more important than this one.\n  American agriculture faces a serious crisis that threatens the \neconomic livelihood of North Dakota farmers and rural communities. Our \nnext Secretary of Agriculture faces the challenge and responsibility of \ncoming up with a new farm policy that addresses this crisis as well as \nthe competitive challenges we face from overseas. Ms. Veneman has a \nlong record on agricultural issues and will bring a depth of experience \nand commitment to the leadership of the Department of Agriculture.\n  However, I must say her track record causes me some concern. Ms. \nVeneman was a cheerleader for the failed Freedom to Farm policy that \nhas been such a disaster for North Dakota farmers. In fact, we've had \nto write economic disaster bills in each of the last three years to \ndeal with the consequences of that disastrous legislation. Beyond that, \nMs. Veneman was heavily involved in negotiating the Canadian Free Trade \nAgreement, which was another disaster for North Dakota. Nevertheless, I \nwish her well, and I'll do everything I can to work with her to change \nthese policies.\n  I think the first priority must be to rewrite the current federal \nfarm policy. This is not working and it's very clear to everyone that \nit's not working. Prices are at record lows. Farmers are leaving the \nland. And rural main street businesses are suffering.\n  Next, we must re-invigorate our agricultural trade policy. We've got \nto be engaged in world trade but it's got to be on a fair, competitive \nbasis. I think we've got to level the playing field with our major \ncompetitors--the Europeans--who are outspending us 10 to one in terms \nof providing support for their producers. Leveling the playing field is \none of my highest priorities, so we get farm income up and so our \nfarmers have a fair chance to succeed.\n  As a senior member of the Agriculture Committee, I look forward to \nworking with Ms. Veneman as we take on these challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S453-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE PASSING OF JOHN C. ``JACK'' RENNIE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to pay tribute to the \nlife of one of Massachusetts most prominent citizens and small business \nadvocates, John C. ``Jack'' Rennie, who passed away last Monday, \nJanuary 15th, at the age of 63. Jack was truly an extraordinary figure \nwho changed the way American business looked at education, and the way \neducation worked in Massachusetts.\n  Born in Boston in May of 1937, Jack attended and graduated from the \nU.S. Naval Academy and Harvard School of Business. He later went on to \nearn a master's degree from Northeastern University.\n  Using the skills he learned while serving in the Navy as a test \npilot, and putting his business education and experience to good use, \nhe founded Pacer Systems in 1968. Pacer Systems provided systems \nintegration and product services for the Department of Defense (DoD). \nPacer was later to become AverStar and expand its systems integration \nwork beyond DoD to other Federal agencies. Jack served as Vice Chairman \nof AverStar from 1998 until his retirement in June of last year.\n  His entrepreneurial spirit was not limited to his own company. In the \nmid-1970s, Jack was the driving force behind the creation of National \nSmall Business United (NSBU), the nation's oldest bipartisan trade \nassociation for small businesses. In the early 1980s, Jack served as \nthe President of the Small Business Association of New England (SBANE), \nand in 1983, he led the first all small business trade mission to the \nPeople's Republic of China. In 1983, he was also named the Small \nBusiness Person of the Year for Massachusetts and New England by then \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  But despite all of these noteworthy accomplishments, Jack's most \nlasting achievements came in the area of education reform.\n  As a business leader and entrepreneur, Jack was alarmed at the \nproblems facing the public education system in Massachusetts and the \nnation. He knew that the businesses of tomorrow would demand a higher \ncaliber of education from its employees, and that education was an \nintegral part of America's future prosperity.\n  Not one to sit on the sidelines, Jack combined his business expertise \nwith his natural leadership abilities to found the Massachusetts \nBusiness Alliance for Education in 1988, which successfully led a five-\nyear effort to reform Massachusetts' K-12 education system. His \norganization's 1991 report, ``Every Child a Winner,'' was the impetus \nfor the Massachusetts Education and Reform Act in 1993. This \nlegislation led to new state-wide testing and accountability standards, \nas well as increased funding for education.\n  Prominent small businessman, and executive, Navy veteran, education \nreformer and community leader, Jack Rennie's passing leaves a void few \npeople are qualified to fill, and even fewer would attempt to try.

Mr. President, recently Frank Hemingway came to \nWashington, D.C. to be a part of the 2001 Inaugural activities. A \nstudent from Onate High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico, he was the \nwinner of the Character Counts Task Force Contest for area high school \nstudents. To win this contest, Mr. Hemingway was required to write an \nessay dealing with his experience with one of the Pillars of Character \nCounts.\n  Character Counts is a grassroots effort in New Mexico and on the \nnational front. The Character Counts initiative strives to promote, in \nall aspects of American life, six basic pillars of good character: \nTrustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and \nCitizenship. I have actively worked to support New Mexico schools and \ncommunities that have embraced this initiative.\n  Mr. Hemingway chose to write his on the Responsibility Pillar, and \nhow being responsible has changed his life. I commend Frank for his \nsmart choices and hard word.\n  Mr. President, I ask that his essay be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The material was ordered to be printed in the Record.\n\n                   How Responsibility Changed My Life\n\n                          (By Frank Hemingway)\n\n       ``Hey bud! want to go to the movies tonight? I've got some \n     girls from across town going--I know I can get you a date.''\n       ``No, maybe later,'' I answered to a typical offer from one \n     of my closest friends, ``It's a school night and I've got a \n     report that I need\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n     to do before the big meet this weekend,'' I replied.\n       Being responsible isn't always easy, but anything that's \n     worth while rarely is. However, I know from experience that \n     responsibility pays off.\n       Responsibility is an active character trait--it is \n     something that must be demonstrated rather than just an \n     attribute that a person possesses. Being responsible means \n     putting impulsive actions on hold and making good decisions \n     based on sound judgment while keeping one's long term goals \n     in mind and acting accordingly. Following this approach to \n     responsibility has helped me maintain outstanding grades and \n     become an emerging leader to my team and classmates. Everyone \n     can and should be responsible to a certain degree and \n     accountable for their actions. A responsible person is \n     dependable, reliable, and trustworthy. Living with these \n     traits has opened up numerous possibilities for me and helped \n     me to further mature and become even more responsible.\n       As a captain of my cross country team, I am responsible for \n     my teammates to a certain extent although they are still \n     responsible for themselves and we are all held accountable by \n     our coach. For example, I am responsible for locking up the \n     locker room and making sure that everyone knows about all \n     practice times. I must be dependable and reliable to fulfill \n     these duties and trustworthy so as not to abuse my authority. \n     These actions, in turn, allow me to set a good example and be \n     looked up to by my teammates as a positive role model. I have \n     become confident in myself as a result of being responsible \n     and have become able to handle additional responsibilities.\n       I have increased my responsibility in my community \n     resulting from my experiences in a team setting. I am often \n     asked by my neighbors to take care of their houses and pets \n     while they are on vacation. I have done this for time periods \n     of up to five weeks! Doing this task takes discipline and \n     self control in making sure that the necessary duties are \n     completed without fail and whether or not I am in the mood \n     for the job.\n       Successful instances of responsibility within my community \n     have led me to seek responsibility to my country. Having \n     recently turned eighteen years old, I upheld my national \n     responsibility to register with the Selective Service System \n     and was eager in becoming a registered voter. I have learned \n     that the significance of responsibility is that it grows \n     proportionally in that small responsibilities soon lead to \n     larger responsibilities, which is an essential part of \n     growing up. The circumstances in life are always changing, by \n     responsibility is always a good choice and responsibility has \n     continually changed my life for the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S454-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 73.

A bill to require country of origin labeling of peanuts and \npeanut products and to establish penalties for violations of the \nlabeling requirements; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing the Peanut \nLabeling Act. This bill will require country of origin labeling for all \npeanut and peanut products sold in the United States; specifically, it \nwill require consumers to be notified whether the peanuts are grown in \nthe United States or in another country. The main purpose of this bill \nis to provide American consumers with information about where the \npeanuts they purchase are grown. This bill will allow consumers to make \ninformed food choices and support American farmers in the best way that \nthey can--with their food dollar.\n  By providing country of origin labels, consumers can determine if \npeanuts are from a country that has had pesticide or other problems \nwhich may be harmful to their health. This is true particularly during \na period when food imports are increasing, and will continue to \nincrease in the wake of new trade agreements such as the WTO and GATT.\n  The growth of biotechnology in the food arena necessitates more \ninformation in the marketplace. Research is being conducted today on \nnew peanut varieties. These research efforts include seeds that might \ndeter peanut allergies, tolerate more drought, and be more resistant to \ndisease. As various countries use differing technologies, consumers \nneed to be made aware of the source of the product they are purchasing. \nGAO recently pointed out that FDA only inspected 1.7 percent of 2.7 \nmillion shipments of fruit, vegetables, seafood and processed foods \nunder its jurisdiction. Inspections for peanuts can be assumed to be in \nthis range or less. This lack of inspection does not provide consumers \nof these products with a great deal of assurance.\n  Polls have shown that consumers in America want to know the origin of \nthe products they buy. And, contrary to the arguments given by \nopponents of labeling measures that such requirements would drive \nprices up, consumers have indicated that they would be willing to pay \nextra for easy access to such information. I believe that this is a \npro-consumer bill that will have wide support.\n  I am also very pleased that peanut growers in America strongly \nsupport my proposal. In fact, the Peanut Labeling Act has been endorsed \nby the Georgia Peanut Commission, the National Peanut Growers Group, \nthe Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, the Alabama Peanut Producers \nAssociation, and the Florida Peanut Producers Association.\n  In conclusion, as my colleagues know, we live in a global economy \nwhich creates an international marketplace for our food products. I \nstrongly believe that by providing country of origin labeling for \nagricultural products, such as peanuts, we not only provide consumers \nwith information they need to make informed choices about the quality \nof food being served to their family but we also allow American farmers \nto showcase the time and effort they put into producing the safest and \nfinest food products in the world. I believe this bill represents these \nprinciples and I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\n                                 S. 144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase to \nparity with other surviving spouses the basic annuity that is provided \nunder the uniformed services Survivor Benefit Plan for surviving \nspouses who are at least 62 years of age; and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am again introducing \nlegislation that would correct the long-standing injustice to the \nwidows or widowers of our military retirees. The proposed legislation \nwould immediately increase for surviving spouses over the age 62 the \nminimum Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity from 35 percent to 40 \npercent of the SBP covered retired pay. The bill would provide a \nfurther increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, \n2004 and to 55 percent as of September 2011.\n  As I outlined in my many statements in support of this important \nlegislation the Survivor Benefit Plan advertises, that if the service \nmember elects to joint the Plan, his survivor will receive 55 percent \nof the member's retirement pay. Unfortunately, that is not so. The \nreason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that \ncurrent law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced either by \nthe amount of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of \nthe SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees who joined \nthe plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service members were \nnever informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made an \nirrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their spouses, \nas our constituent mail attests, believed their premium payments would \nguarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the survivor. It is \nnot hard to imagine the shock and financial disadvantage these men and \nwomen who so loyally served the Nation for many years experience when \nthey learn of the annuity reduction.\n  Uniformed services retirees pay too much for the available SBP \nbenefit both, compared to what we promised and what we offer other \nfederal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, \nthe Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the \ncost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal civilian \nsurvivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \ngovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 \npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal \ncivilian retiree.\n  Mr. President, although the House conferees thwarted my previous \nefforts to enact this legislation into law, I am ever optimistic that \nthis year we will prevail. I base my optimism on the fact that the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 included a \nSense of the Congress on increasing Survivor Benefit Plan annuities for \nsurviving spouses age 62 or older. The sense of the Congress reflects \nthe concern addressed by the legislation I am introducing again today. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill and now ask that the bill be \nsent to the desk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 146. A bill to amend part S of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the use of certain \namounts for assistance to jail-based substance treatment programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation amending \nthe Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program, known as R-SAT, to \nenable jurisdictions below the state level to realize greater benefits \nfrom the program. The R-SAT program allows the Attorney General to make \ngrants for the establishment of treatment programs within local \ncorrectional facilities, but only a few jurisdictions have been able to \ntake advantage of these grants.\n  The legislation that I am offering today will address this problem by \nestablishing a separate Jail-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, \nor J-SAT. Under this new program, states will be explicitly authorized \nto devote up to 10 percent of the funds they receive under R-SAT to \nqualifying J-SAT programs.\n  This legislation will provide matching funds to jail-based treatment \nprograms that meet several criteria. First, the program must be at \nleast three months in length. This is the minimum amount of time for a \ntreatment program to have the desired effect. To qualify for funding, a \nprogram must also have been in existence for at least two years. This \ncriterion is intended to ensure that jurisdictions that already have \ndemonstrated a commitment to treatment programs at the local level \nreceive first priority for funding. It also ensures that scarce \ntreatment resources are allocated to programs with a demonstrated track \nrecord of success. The third criterion for programs seeking J-SAT \nfunding is that the treatment regimen must include regular drug \ntesting. This is necessary to ensure that an objective measure of the \nprogram's success is available. Grant recipients also are encouraged to \nprovide the widest range of aftercare services possible, including job \ntraining, education and self-help programs. These steps are necessary \nto leverage the resources devoted to solving the problem of substance \nabuse, and to give individuals involved in treatment the best possible \nchance for successful rehabilitation.\n  This legislation passed the Senate during the 106th Congress, and I \nam offering the J-SAT bill again because substance abuse and problems \narising from it continue to put a severe strain on the resources of \nlocal jurisdictions throughout the nation. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy indicates\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nthat approximately three-fourths of prison inmates--and over half of \nthose in jails or on probation--are substance abusers, yet only a small \npercentage of inmates participate in treatment programs while they are \nincarcerated. The time during which drug-using offenders are in custody \nor under post-release correctional supervision--whether at a state or \nlocal level--presents a unique opportunity to reduce drug use and crime \nthrough effective drug testing and treatment programs.\n  Research indicates that programs like J-SAT can help to reduce the \nstrain on our communities by cutting drug use in half, by reducing the \ncriminal activity that results from drug habits, and by reducing \narrests for all crimes by up to 64 percent.\n  Jail-based treatment programs are cost effective. The Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy states that treatment while in prison and \nunder post-incarceration supervision can reduce recidivism by roughly \n50 percent. Moreover, former Assistant Health Secretary Philip Lee has \nestimated that every dollar invested in treatment can save $7 in social \nand medical costs.\n  For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support the Jail-Based \nSubstance Abuse Treatment legislation that I am introducing today. I \nalso ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jail-based substance abuse treatment.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 147. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise, along with Senators Hutchinson \nof Texas, Senator Kyl of Arizona, and Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, \nto introduce the Southwest Border Judgeship Act of 2001.\n  This legislation would enact the United States Judicial Conference \nrecommendation of nine permanent and nine temporary judgeships for the \nfive Southwestern border districts of Southern California, Arizona, New \nMexico, Western Texas, and Southern Texas.\n  The judicial districts on the Southwestern Border are facing an \nunparalleled surge of cases, and lack the resources to handle them.\n  From March 1994 through March 1999, criminal case filings in \nSouthwestern border courts increased by 125 percent (from 6,460 to \n14,517), drug prosecutions in these same districts increased by 189 \npercent (from 2,864 to 5,414), and immigration prosecutions by 431 \npercent (from 1,056 to 5,614).\n  The Five ``Border Courts'' (Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, \nWest Texas, Southern Texas) now handle 26 percent of all federal court \ncriminal filings in the United States, and are projected to handle one-\nthird within two years. The 89 other district courts handle the other \n74 percent of criminal filings.\n  All five border courts currently are among the top ten most burdened \ndistricts in the country in terms of weighted caseload.\n  While these courts have faced an ever rising caseload, their \nresources have remained stagnant. The Southern District of California, \nfor example, has not been authorized a new judgeship since 1990.\n  Nowhere is the judicial crisis greater than in the Southern District \nof California. On October 30, 2000, the district took the unprecedented \nstep of declaring a ``judicial emergency.'' The Southern district had a \nweighted caseload of 978 cases per judgeship in Fiscal year 2000. \nThat's nearly two and a half times the national standard of 430 cases \nper judgeship.\n  The court's criminal caseload is the heaviest in the nation, with 55 \ntrials per judge for the year 2000. In civil case, many judges no \nlonger hear oral arguments; they base their opinions solely on written \nbriefs.\n  The Chief Judge in San Diego, Marilyn Huff, has resorted to desperate \nmeasures to hold back this tide of cases, including asking seven \nretired judges to return to the bench. Two of these judges, Judge \nEdward Schwartz and Judge Leland Nielsen, have recently died.\n  The Southern District of California and other border districts cannot \ncontinue to function effectively with a skeleton crew of judges. The \ncrisis in San Diego, in particular, has reached a point where citizen \naccess to justice is being threatened. It is imperative that Congress \nact proactively to address this shortage of resources.\n  The Southwest Border Judges Act would authorize nine permanent \njudgeships (5 judgeships for the Southern District of California, 1 \njudgeship for the district of New Mexico, 1 judgeship for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, and 2 judgeships for the western district of Texas) \nand nine temporary judgeships (four for Arizona, 3 for the Southern \nDistrict of California, 1 for New Mexico, and 1 for the Western \ndistrict of Texas).\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this urgent \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Feinstein's bill \nto add judgeships to the states along U.S.-Mexico border. I agree with \nSenator Feinstein that, due to the growing population and caseload, \nadditional judgeships are solely needed.\n  This bill seeks to enact a recommendation of the Judicial Conference \nof the United States. The bill would authorize nine permanent and nine \ntemporary judgeships. I favor a different approach. I believe that all \nthe judgeships in the bill should be permanent judgeships because the \ngrowth in population and resulting caseload is expected to continue. I \nhave agreed to cosponsor the bill because I agree that additional \njudgeships are needed and I believe that the bill provides a sound \nbasis for discussions.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Feinstein and the other \nSenators along the southwest border, as well as Senators Hatch and \nLeahy and the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Courts \nand Administrative Oversight.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 148. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe adoption credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there is some very important unfinished \nbusiness from the last Congress that requires our early attention this \nyear: renewing the adoption tax credit.\n  As many of our colleagues know, this credit was enacted in 1996 to \nhelp families with the extraordinary costs of adoption. Forming a \nfamily through adoption is challenging for a number of reasons, but the \nfinancial burden puts it out of reach altogether for too many \nAmericans. Legal fees, medical bills, travel, and other expenses can \npush the cost into the tens of thousands of dollars, over and above the \nnormal cost of raising a child. Congress enacted the adoption tax \ncredit to enable families to keep a little more of their own hard-\nearned dollars to use for these expenses, on a one-time basis.\n  That tax credit has been very helpful to the families who have opened \ntheir homes and hearts to children in need. However, it is due to \nexpire at the end of this year, along with another adoption-related tax \nprovision that excludes employer-provided adoption benefits from \nincome, for tax purposes.\n  We cannot wait until the end of the year to renew these tax measures. \nToday, families are making decisions about whether they can afford to \nembark on the long journey to bring a child home through adoption. \nToday, they cannot count on those tax benefits being available. This \nCongress must move swiftly to reassure America's adoptive families that \nwe will continue to support this modest assistance.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Hope For Children Act, which many \nof my colleagues will remember from the last Congress. I am delighted \nto be joined in this effort by Senator Mary Landrieu, who with me co-\nchairs the\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nbicameral, nonpartisan Congressional Coalition on Adoption, as well as \nour colleagues, the Senator from Alaska Mr. Stevens, and the Senator \nfrom South Dakota Mr. Johnson.\n  Our legislation will extend, increase, and simplify these important \ntax measures. Specifically, the Hope For Children Act would remove the \ncurrent sunset on both the adoption tax credit and the exclusion for \nemployer-provided adoption benefits. It would also increase the benefit \nand exclusion from $5,000 (or in the case of an adoption of a child \nwith special needs, $6,000) to $10,000, and adjust them for inflation. \nIt would lift the cap on income eligibility for receiving the full \nbenefit of these tax measures from $75,000 gross income to $150,000.\n  Also, the bill includes a provision that the Senate has passed more \nthan once, liberalizing the tax credit for families adopting children \nwith special needs. It would also make a similar adjustment in the \nexclusion as it relates to these families. Instead of being limited to \nthe adoption expenses that the Internal Revenue Service decides are \nallowable, these families would be entitled to the full credit and \nexclusion. This change is necessary, because the financial challenges \nfacing these families tend to fall outside or after the adoption \nprocess itself--for instance, they may include a wheelchair or special \nvan for an adopted child with a physical disability, or home \nconstruction work to make it possible to adopt a sibling group, or \ncounseling services for the family to cope with the extraordinary \nchallenges of a child with special needs.\n  It is important to remember that the costs involved in such adoptions \nare truly staggering. Even with the increases we want to provide \nthrough the Hope For Children Act, the adoption tax credit and \nexclusion only offer a boost, not a subsidy, to families who are \nwilling to open their hearts and homes to a child with special needs.\n  Mr. President, there are thousands and thousands of children in \nAmerica who are waiting to be adopted. The adoption tax credit and \nexclusion are humane, measured, effective policies that truly help \nthese children find safe, loving, permanent homes. Let's send a strong \nmessage of support to these children and their families by renewing \nthese policies, through early passage of the Hope For Children Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

    Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 149. A bill to provide authority to control exports, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Export \nAdministration Act of 2001. I am joined by my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Gramm\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\nof Texas, Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, Senator Johnson of South \nDakota, Senator Hagel of Nebraska, and Senator Roberts of Kansas. I \nthank each of them for their help in drafting and supporting this \nbipartisan bill. I believe it can be one of the first bipartisan \naccomplishments of the 107th Congress and President Bush. The EAA of \n2001 would eliminate trade barriers while focusing control on those \nitems most sensitive to our national security.\n  Let me begin by emphasizing the need to reauthorize and reform the \nEAA of 1979.\n  The EAA provides export control authority for commercial or dual-use \nitems--things that can be used in more than one way. For 6 years the \nCongress has failed to update and reauthorize this important act, with \nthe exception of a 1-year reauthorization of the outdated Export \nAdministration Act of 1979. As a result, our export control laws have \nbeen inadequately governed by either the EAA of 1979 or, more often \nthan not, by emergency Presidential authority under the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act. This situation has effectively allowed \nthe administration, instead of Congress, to set the export control \npolicies of the United States.\n  The bill introduced today would place our export control system on \nfirm statutory grounds and establish a modernized framework to \nrecognize the rapid pace of economic innovation and the realities of \nglobalization.\n  The Export Administration Act of 2001 is a reasonable and balanced \nbill that will put up higher fences around the most sensitive areas and \nfocus our enforcement efforts on restricting all technology exports to \nall the true bad actors. At the same time, it takes into account the \nrealities of today's economy, incorporating the concept that items such \nas computers are very difficult to control.\n  The bill recognizes that items available from foreign sources or \navailable in mass market quantities cannot be effectively controlled. \nAt the same time, we recognize that the President may, in exceptional \ncases, want to control a very sensitive item even when that item is \navailable from the foreign source or in mass marketed quantities. \nTherefore, we include a provision to provide the President with this \nauthority.\n  The Export Administration Act of 2001 also strengthens national \nsecurity in other areas. It enhances the role of the Department of \nDefense and other agencies by requiring the concurrence of the \nSecretary of Defense for items included on the control list as well as \nallowing licensing decisions to be appealed to the next level of review \nat the request of any participating agency representative. Licensing \ndecisions would be made in part through the use of ``country-tiering'', \ngrouping countries and items according to their assessed risk. The bill \nwould also target end-use checks on those items that pose the greatest \nrisk to national security.\n\n  The EAA of 2001 provides tough new criminal and civil penalties for \nexport control violations. For example, criminal penalties for \nindividuals could be up to $1 million, or ten times the value of the \nexport per violation. Criminal penalties for corporations could be up \nto $10 million or ten times the export value of the export per \nviolation. It also authorizes a wording of up to 25 percent of the \npenalties imposed to a person providing information concerning an \nexport control violation. The increase in penalties, which also include \npotential jail time and enhancement of enforcement provisions, will \nprovide an effective deterrent to the violations of the act.\n  A number of reviews of technology transfer and export controls were \nunanimous in their statements that an important requirement for an \neffective export control program is appropriate authorizing \nlegislation.\n  The Cox committee on technology transfer to China, the joint \nInspector General's interagency review of the export licensing \nprocesses for dual-use commodities and munitions, and the Commission to \nAssess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the \nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, have all strongly \nrecommended the authorization of the EAA. The bipartisan Export \nAdministration Act of 2001 would accomplish this while balancing the \nnational security and economic interests of the United States.\n  S. 1712, which was the EAA reauthorization bill of last session that \nunanimously passed the Senate Banking Committee last year, was strongly \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats, as well as both large and small \nexporters.\n  The Clinton administration supported the bill. Even President Bush \nendorsed the bill in campaign statements that he made. It was prevented \nfrom coming up last year because of a crowded floor agenda, but now is \nthe time to replace the current outdated export control system and pass \nthe Export Administration Act of 2001. We have an opportunity. We have \nan obligation to make sure that we increase exports while we protect \nnational security.\n  The bill was expired for six years. There have been 12 attempts to \nreauthorize the bill. The biggest reason that it has not been \nreauthorized is the complexity of detail of the licensing and appeal \nprocess. Fortunately, the Cox commission brought to light the need to \nreauthorize this important piece of legislation.\n  Last year, we passed it through committee by a 20-0 vote. After 12 \nfailures, that is fairly significant. In fact, it is always significant \naround here when you have something Bipartisan enough that it passes on \na unanimous vote.\n  We have worked hard on the bill. We have listened to industry. We \nhave listened to our colleagues. We have listened to the \nadministration. We have listened to those people over past \nadministrations who have worked on the same issue. We have a bill that \nupdates the process for the post-cold war so that the provisions in \nthis will work today and into the future. This is the new version that \nneeds to be passed in this session of Congress. It needs to be passed \nearly.\n  The current extension we got on the bill only extended it until \nAugust 20. That is coming up soon, particularly with our legislative \ncalendar needs. I ask my colleagues to work promptly on this bill. We \nwill be talking to everyone who has an interest in it, and coming back \nto the floor with debate and discussion and a vote that will put this \nin front of the President for signature so we can have the proper \nnational security and increase in national exports.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this most important piece \nof legislation and look forward to working with my colleagues to \nreauthorize the EAA during the coming months.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORITY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY EXPORT CONTROLS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--In order to carry out the purposes set \n     forth in subsection (b), the President may, in accordance \n     with the provisions of this Act, prohibit, curtail, or \n     require a license, or other authorization for the export of \n     any item subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or \n     exported by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     United States. The President may also require recordkeeping \n     and reporting with respect to the export of such item.\n       (2) Exercise of authority.--The authority contained in this \n     subsection shall be exercised by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the intelligence \n     agencies, and such other departments and agencies as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of national security export \n     controls are the following:\n       (1) To restrict the export of items that would contribute \n     to the military potential of countries so as to prove \n     detrimental to the national security of the United States, \n     its allies or countries sharing common strategic objectives \n     with the United States.\n       (2) To stem the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and the means to deliver them, and other \n     significant military capabilities by--\n       (A) leading international efforts to control the \n     proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, nuclear \n     explosive devices, missile delivery systems, key-enabling \n     technologies, and other significant military capabilities;\n       (B) controlling involvement of United States persons in, \n     and contributions by United States persons to, foreign \n     programs intended to develop weapons of mass destruction, \n     missiles, and other significant military capabilities, and \n     the means to design, test, develop, produce, stockpile, or \n     use them; and\n       (C) implementing international treaties or other agreements \n     or arrangements concerning controls on exports of designated \n     items, reports on the production, processing, consumption, \n     and exports and imports of such items, and compliance with \n     verification programs.\n       (3) To deter acts of international terrorism.\n       (c) End Use and End User Controls.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this title, controls may be imposed, based \n     on the end use or end user, on the export of any item, that \n     could materially contribute to the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction or the means to deliver them.\n       (d) Enhanced Controls.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of this title, the President may determine that \n     applying the provisions of section 204(b) or section 211 with \n     respect to an item on the National Security Control List \n     would constitute a significant threat to the national \n     security of the United States and that such item requires \n     enhanced control.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Enzi, Senator Johnson, and Senator Gramm to introduce the \nExport Administration Act of 2001. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is very similar to the legislation that was reported out of the \nSenate Banking Committee in the last Congress by a unanimous 20-0 vote.\n  The Export Administration Act provides the President authority to \ncontrol exports for reasons of national security and foreign policy. \nLet me begin by saying that I believe there is a very strong national \ninterest in Congress reauthorizing the Export Administration Act.\n  The EAA has not been reauthorized since 1990 except for temporary \nextensions in 1993, 1994, and last year. At the end of the last \nCongress we passed a temporary extension of the EAA that expires on \nAugust 20 of this year. Prior to this most recent temporary extension, \nthe authority of the President to impose export controls had been \nexercised pursuant to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act \n(IEEPA). In my view, Congress should put in place a permanent statutory \nframework for the imposition of export controls. They should not be \nimposed in effect on a permanent basis pursuant to an emergency \neconomic authority of the President. Just one example of the \nimplications of depending on IEEPA is that the penalties that may be \nimposed for violations of export controls under IEEPA are significantly \nless than those imposed under the EAA.\n  I believe this legislation is a carefully balanced effort to provide \nthe President authority to control exports for reasons of national \nsecurity and foreign policy, while also responding to the need of U.S. \nexporters to compete in the global marketplace.\n  Extensive consultation took place with representatives of the \nprevious Administration, including the Commerce Department, the Defense \nDepartment, the intelligence agencies and the National Security \nCouncil, as well as representatives of the different industry groups. I \nalso understand that during the campaign then-Governor Bush also \nendorsed this legislation, and we would hope to work closely with the \nnew Administration on this bill.\n  I would like to commend Senator Enzi (who was the chairman of the \nInternational Trade and Finance Subcommittee of the Banking Committee \nin the last Congress), Senator Johnson (who was the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee), and Senator Gramm, as well as their staffs, for \ntheir efforts to develop a bipartisan consensus on this legislation.\n  The legislation generally tracks the authorities provided the \nPresident under the Export Administration Act which expired in 1990. \nHowever a significant effort was made, with the assistance of the \nLegislative Counsel's Office, to provide these authorities in a more \nclear and straightforward manner. We believe this will make the statute \nboth easier for the executive branch agencies to administer and for \nexporters to comply with.\n  The bill also makes a number of significant improvements to the EAA. \nI would like to mention just a few. The legislation provides for the \nfirst time a statutory basis for the resolution of interagency disputes \nover export license applications. The intent is to provide an orderly \nprocess for the timely resolution of disputes, while allowing all \ninterested agencies a full opportunity to express their views. This was \nan issue of great concern to the Administration, the national security \ncommunity, and industry. I believe we have reached a reasonable \nresolution of this issue in the bill.\n  The bill significantly increases both criminal and civil penalties \nfor violations of the Export Administration Act, reflecting the \nseriousness of such violations.\n  The bill provides new authority to the President to determine that a \ngood has mass market status in the United States and should therefore \nbe decontrolled. The President retains authority to set aside a mass \nmarket determination if he determines it would constitute a serious \nthreat to national security and continued export controls would be \nlikely to advance the national security interests of the United States. \nThis was a provision of great importance to U.S. exporters.\n  At the urging of Senator Enzi, the bill contains a provision that \nwould require the President to establish a system of tiers to which \ncountries would be assigned based on their perceived threat to U.S. \nnational security. The intent is to provide exporters a clear guide as \nto the licensing requirements of an export of a particular item to a \nparticular country.\n  The bill would also require that any foreign company that declined a \nU.S. request for a post-shipment verification of an export would be \ndenied licenses for future exports. The President would have authority \nto deny licenses to affiliates of the company, and to the country in \nwhich the company is located as well.\n  On balance, I believe this bill is a very balanced piece of work. It \ncommanded unanimous bipartisan support in the Banking Committee in the \nlast Congress. It is my belief that it will receive broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Banking Committee and in the full Senate in this \nCongress. I believe it will be the first bill the Banking Committee \nwill act on this year, and I would hope we could move it quickly to \nconsideration by the full Senate. Early action by the full Senate \nwould, in turn, give the House more time to act on the bill. I am \nhopeful that this will be the Congress in which the Export \nAdministration Act is enacted back into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 150. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan incentive to ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable \naccess to the Internet over current and future generations of broadband \ncapability; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S479-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S479-S497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH INSURANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act. As the Ranking \nDemocratic Member on the Senate Committee on Small Business, I know how \nimportant access to health insurance is for small businesses. Today, \napproximately 42.5 million Americans lack health insurance. \nUnfortunately, employees of small businesses are much more likely to be \nuninsured than employees of large firms.\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\n  Current law allows qualified small businesses to deduct 60 percent of \ntheir health insurance payments. The cost of health insurance and the \nlack of a full deduction has kept many small businesses from obtaining \nhealth insurance for their employees. In 1998, an estimated 12.5 \nmillion workers were self-employed but only about 3.2 million tax \nreturns claimed the self-employed health insurance deduction. In 1998, \n34 percent of workers in firms with fewer than 10 employees lacked \nhealth insurance compared with only 13 percent of workers in firms with \nmore than 1,000 employees. Clearly, the cost of health insurance has \nkept many small businesses from offering health insurance. Many small \nbusinesses simply cannot afford to pick up the difference between the \ndeduction and the total cost of health insurance.\n  Unfortunately, due to an inequity within our current tax law, big \nbusinesses are currently allowed to deduct 100 percent of their health \ninsurance costs. While small businesses are slated to have their health \ninsurance deduction increase to 100 percent in 2003, I believe this is \nfar too long for many small businesses to wait to obtain health \ninsurance.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the legislation introduced \nyesterday by Senators Bond and Durbin, which will finally end the \ninequity in current tax law and allow small businesses to deduct the \nsame amount of their health insurance costs as big businesses. For many \nsmall businesses, this increase in the deduction will make it possible \nfor them to obtain health insurance for the first time.\n  No one in the United States should be without adequate health care \nbecause he or she cannot afford it. Access to affordable health \ninsurance is crucial to increase the quality of life for working \nfamilies across this nation. That is why we must enact this legislation \nduring the 107th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 152. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 60-month limit and increase the income limitation on the \nstudent loan interest deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the tax deduction for student loan interest. I am proud to have \nas my original cosponsor Senator Max Baucus of Montana.\n  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax deduction for student loan \ninterest was eliminated. This action, done in the name of fiscal \nresponsibility, disregarded the duty we have to the education of our \nnation's students. This struck me and many of my colleagues as wrong. \nSince 1987, I have spearheaded the bipartisan effort to reinstate the \ntax deduction for student loan interest. In 1992, we succeeded in \npassing the legislation only to have it vetoed as part of a larger bill \nwith tax increases. Finally, after ten long years our determination and \nperseverance paid off. Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 we \nreinstated the deduction. In our success, we sent a message to the \nstudents and their families of this nation that the Congress of the \nUnited States understands the financial hardships they face, and that \nwe are willing to assist them in easing those hardships so they can \ncontinue to receive the education they need to become productive \nmembers of society and of their place of work.\n  In 1997, our steps were in the right direction. We did what needed to \nbe done. Regrettably, due to fiscal constraints, we were not able to go \nas far as we wanted. The nation was still struggling to eliminate the \ndeficit. In order to control costs, we were forced to limit the \ndeductibility of student loan interest to only sixty payments, which is \nfive years' worth plus the time spent in forbearance or deferment.\n  This restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. Many of \nthese borrowers are students who, due to limited means, have borrowed \nmost heavily. The restriction discriminates against those who have the \nhighest debt loads and the lowest incomes. It makes the American dream \nof self-improvement harder to achieve for those struggling to pull \nthemselves up--but who started with less. It is simply unjust.\n  Today, our situation is vastly different. In these times of economic \nsurplus, we have a responsibility to do what we were unable to do \nbefore. Student debt is rising to alarming levels and additional relief \nis needed. We must eliminate the sixty month restriction on the \ndeductibility of student loan interest and adjust the income limits to \nshow that the United States Congress stands behind our nation's \nstudents in their endeavors to better themselves.\n  In addition, the removal of the sixty-month limit on deductibility of \nstudent loan interest will bring most needed relief to some of the most \ndeserving borrowers. The restriction weighs most heavily on those who, \ndespite lower pay have decided to dedicate themselves to public \nservice. Thus this change will have the added benefit of rewarding \ncivic virtue of these admirable citizens.\n  Additionally, eliminating this restriction will remove difficult and \ncostly reporting requirements that are currently required for both the \nborrower and lender. By supporting our nation's students, we will also \nbe reducing costly and unnecessary regulatory requirements.\n  Currently, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must have an adjusted \ngross income of $40,000 or less or $60,000 for married couples. The \namount of the deduction is gradually phased out for those with incomes \nbetween $40,000 and $55,000, or $60,000 and $75,000 for married \ncouples. The deduction was phased in at $1,000 and will cap out at \n$2,500 in 2002. This bill will adjust those limits.\n  Many students in our country are suffering from heavy education-\nrelated debt. More can and must be done to help them. In these times of \nrelative budget surplus, it is our duty to invest in our students' \neducation. Doing so is an investment in America's future. To maintain \nour competitive edge in the global marketplace, America must have a \nwell-educated workforce. By making it easier for students to take out \nthe loans they need to obtain the highest level of education they can, \nwe recommit ourselves to education and maintaining our competitive \nadvantage in technology and in world trade.\n  I urge members to join me and Senator Baucus in our effort to relieve \nthese excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their \nfutures through education, by expanding the tax deduction for student \nloan interest payments. I now ask that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, in introducing legislation to expand the tax deduction for \nstudent loan interest.\n  Under current law, student loan interest is only deductible for the \nfirst sixty loan repayments, which is equivalent to five years in \naddition to any deferrals. While this limitation was\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\noriginally imposed due to revenue constraints, it has had unanticipated \nconsequences.\n  Most importantly, the limitation hurts some of our neediest \nborrowers. Students with the most limited means often are forced to \nborrow most heavily in order to afford a higher education. These are \nprecisely the students who need the most help to succeed.\n  The restriction also makes it more difficult for students who would \nlike to pursue a career in public service, where loan repayment is made \nmore challenging by salaries that tend to be lower than the private \nsector. We should not punish those who sacrifice in order to serve the \ngreater good.\n  Finally, the current sixty month limitation imposes costly and time-\nconsuming reporting requirements on both borrowers and lenders. In \nsupporting our nation's students, we will also be cutting costly \nbureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, we currently are enjoying unprecedented budget \nsurpluses, which allows us the luxury of deciding how best to allocate \nour nation's revenues. I believe there are some priorities we must \nemphasize, and one important one is our children's education.\n  Investing in education is investing in our nation's future.\n  Our best tool for ensuring long-term economic growth is to make sure \nour workforce is the most educated in the world. Eliminating this \nartificial restriction on student loan interest deductibility keeps us \none small step closer to our goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 153. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for State accreditation of diabetes self-management training \nprograms under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwill allow all state accredited diabetes education programs to be \nreimbursed by the Medicare program. Currently, diabetes education \nprograms that have state certification, as an alternative to being \ncertified by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), are not eligible \nto receive Medicare reimbursement for their services. As a result, \nthese deserving patients have more limited access to the important \nmedical education that they need to control their diabetes effectively \nand to improve the quality of their health.\n  This important health issue was brought to my attention by the \nProgram Director of the Utah Diabetes Control Program. There are over \n30 diabetes education programs in Utah that are either Utah certified \nor recognized by the American Diabetes Association. The majority of the \neducation programs have only state certification; several are located \nin rural communities of Utah.\n  It is important to emphasize, that in Utah, our state certification \nprogram meets or exceeds all national standards. These stringent state \nrequirements include the submission of a detailed application, with the \nappropriate documentation that the diabetes education programs meet the \nvarious national standards.\n  The Utah Diabetes Control Program staff also conduct on-site visits \nto all applying programs. After the completion of this extensive \napplication process, the state staff collects follow-up data through \nthe annual report process in order to assess program quality and \ndiabetic patient outcomes.\n  One notable concern that has been brought to my attention by the Utah \nDepartment of Health is that the American Diabetes Association charges \n$850 for state programs to apply for their ADA certification. The \nsmaller and rural state diabetes education programs, which provide \nservices to their patients, have indicated that the ADA fee is cost-\nprohibitive for them. It does not seem right to me that Medicare \nreimbursement for such programs is contingent on the ability of the \nprogram sponsor to pay a fee to the only accepted certifying entity.\n  I understand that this problem is not unique to Utah, but is a \nsignificant issue across the country. All Medicare beneficiaries, \nregardless of where they live in America, should have access to these \ndiabetes education programs that ultimately improve the quality of \ntheir lives. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act to ensure uniform treatment by States of Federal overseas \nabsentee ballots, to amend titles 10 and 18, United States Code, and \nthe Revised Statutes to remove the uncertainty regarding the authority \nof the Department of Defense to permit buildings located on military \ninstallations and reserve component facilities to be used as polling \nplaces in Federal, State, and elections for public office, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military and \nOverseas Citizens Voting Fairness Act of 2001. This bill ensures that \nthe men and women of the military who go into harm's way and bravely \nserve our country will have their vote counted. Given the great \nsacrifice these men and women make to defend our country, it is \nessential that we as lawmakers do all that we can to have their voices \nheard.\n  Although military mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, \nthe reality of the situation is that exigent circumstances aboard Navy \nships and in foreign theaters can result in mail being sent without a \npostmark. Because several states require a postmark for an absentee \nballot to be counted, the unfortunate outcome is that many military \npersons who went through the timely process of registering, applying \nfor and sending in a ballot are disenfranchised through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  My bill provides that lack of a postmark does not result in automatic \nrejection of an overseas ballots in states that require a postmark. \nSpecifically, the bill states that as long as there is conclusive proof \nof timely sending and the ballot is received by a state within 10 days \nafter a federal election, mere lack of a postmark will not prevent the \nballot from being counted.\n  My bill lists two ways in which conclusive proof of timely sending \nmay be established, although any conclusive evidence could establish \ntimely sending. If a ballot is received on or before election day, \nlogic dictates that the ballot was sent in a timely manner. Also, \ntimely sending would be conclusively established by examining the date \nof signature and witness on the outside of the ballot envelope. \nFraudulently misstating the date would be punishable by civil and \ncriminal penalties.\n  In addition to creating a uniform absentee voting law, my bill \nincludes provisions to allow polling places on domestic military bases. \nThese provisions\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nwill make it easier for military personnel located on remote bases to \nbe able to participate in the voting process. Voting is one of the most \nimportant civic duties in a democracy. By allowing voting to take place \non-base, we as the Senate, will guarantee that the men and women of our \nmilitary will have every opportunity to exercise their important right \nto vote.\n  Mr. President, confidence, clarity, and participation in our voting \nprocess are vital to the continuation of our great democracy. The \nelection of this past year illustrates the need for change in our \nvoting procedures. While more reform will be needed, my bill is a \ncrucial step in that direction. For this and all the above reasons, I \nurge you and all my other colleagues to support the passage of this all \nimportant bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 155. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to eliminate an \ninequity in the applicability of early retirement eligibility \nrequirements to military reserve technicians; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nput forward last year to remove the inequity that continues to exist in \nretirement pay benefits for critical personnel, referred to as ``Dual \nStatus Technicians,'' who serve in our National Guard and Reserve. The \nSenate approved my proposed legislation last year by including it in \nthe FY 2001 Defense Authorization bill. This year, I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate and House to join with me to see that this important \ninitiative is enacted into law.\n  There are about 40,000 Dual Status Technicians covered by retirement \nrequirements and restrictions contained in Title 32 of the United \nStates Code. The designation ``Dual Status'', Mr. President, refers to \nthe fact that these technicians serve the government simultaneously \nboth as military and civilian employees. These men and women are the \nbackbone of our National Guard and Reserve structure. They are the \nmechanics, pilots engineers, equipment operators, supply and support \ntechnicians who keep things running so that the Guard is able to \nrespond to natural disasters and national emergencies, as well as serve \non active duty in accordance with the ``total force concept'' that \nintegrates active and reserve forces in the military. These hardworking \nmen and women are often the first called to duty in an emergency. They \nplayed on essential role, for example, in the major firefighting \nefforts that took place in New Mexican and throughout western states \nlast summer.\n  As essential as Dual Status Technicians are, they suffer from the \nworst of two employment worlds. These technicians are by statute both \nmilitary and civilian employees. Guard technicians must maintain their \nmilitary job and grade in order to keep their technician status and \nremain a federal employee. In the event of separation from military \nservice, however, under existing law they are denied the retirement \nbenefit options extended to those who serve in the same grade and time \nin service in the active military. Frequently, Dual Status Technicians \nwho are separated from the Guard and Reserve must wait years to qualify \nto receive their Federal Service retirement benefits.\n  The bill I am introducing in the Senate today corresponds to a \ncompanion bill being introduced on the House side by Representative \nAbercrombie. It seeks to eliminate retirement inequities--a problem we \njust addressed head on in the Armed Services Committee when we include \na provision in the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Bill eliminating \nretirement inequities between active duty personnel who retire before \nor after 1986. We voted by that provision to effectively eliminate the \n``Redux'' retirement benefit program because of the lower benefits it \noffered to personnel who retired after 1986. The action I am proposing \nin this legislation is similar.\n  The bill will permit Dual Status Technicians to retire at any age \nwith 25 years of service or at age 50 with 20 years of service. Those \ncriteria reflect benefit options now extended to Federal police and \nfire employees. They also replicate those offered to federal employees \nwho retire from the Congress.\n  Last year, I was pleased to see, Mr. President, that the FY 2000 \nDefense Authorization Act took a step to extend more equitable \nretirement benefits to Dual Status Technicians. In doing so, however, \nthe Congress created an inequity within the Technician community \nitself. A provision in that Act authorized early retirement after 25 \nyears at any age, or at age 50 with 20 years of service--but only for \nthose employed as Dual Status Technicians after 1996. Those same \nbenefits are withheld from those employed before 1996. In other words, \nMr. President, we created a situation similar to the one the Senate \ndealt with regarding the ``Redux'' retirement program in the FY 2001 \nDefense Authorization Act. The bill I offer today would remove that \ninequity in the same way the Congress voted to remove the inequity for \nactive duty personnel who retired under the ``Redux'' program.\n  Mr. President, the cost of achieving retirement equity for Dual \nStatus Technicians would not be high. Last year, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated that this bill could cost about $74 million \nover a five year period. That estimate may be on the high side, I \nbelieve, since it is based on the assumption that nearly all \ntechnicians eligible for retirement under those criteria would choose \nto do so. The actual number who would choose to retire would vary, of \ncourse, depending on individual circumstances. It is important to note, \nMr. President, that we're not only providing for equity here. We're \nauthorizing appropriate compensation, well deserved, to the men and \nwomen who have devoted their careers to service for the nation both at \nhome and abroad--the men and women of our National Guard and Reserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge my fellow members \nto support this effort through cosponsorship. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve academic and social outcomes for students \nand reduce both juvenile crime and the risk that youth will become \nvictims of crime by providing productive activities during after school \nhours; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  S. 157. A bill to establish a program to help States expand the \nexisting education system to include at least 1 year of early education \npreceding the year a child enters kindergarten; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there have been many positive steps taken \nto support quality early education and afterschool programs, yet they \nstill represent token steps when giant leaps are needed. America must \ncommit to ensuring a comprehensive education system beginning with \nearly education\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\nprograms and continuing with afterschool programs. This is why I am re-\nintroducing my two bills, the ``Early Education Act of 2001,'' and the \n``After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001.''\n  Every day, millions of working parents are forced with the prospect \nof leaving their children unsupervised after school because they either \ncannot afford quality afterschool programs or the programs simply are \nunavailable in their surrounding area. Children need a place to go \nafter school. An empty house should not be an option. It can be \nespecially frightening for many students today because of the increase \nin crime and drug related incidents in their neighborhoods.\n  There are anywhere from 8 to 15 million children without accessible \nafterschool opportunities. Only 33 percent of schools in low-income \nneighborhoods offer before and afterschool programs compared to over 50 \npercent of schools in affluent neighborhoods. Yet, unlike what most may \nbelieve, this tragic situation cuts across both racial and economic \nlines. Affluent, non-minority workers also leave their children home \nalone.\n  According to a recent report from the Urban Institute, one in five \nchildren ages 6 to 12 are regularly left without adult supervision \nafter school. The FBI reports that the after school hours between 2 \np.m. and 8 p.m. are the times when latchkey children are most likely to \nbe involved in crimes and other delinquent behavior, and this is \nprecisely the time period when juvenile crime peaks across the nation.\n  According to the Departments of Education and Health and Human \nServices, extracurricular activities, like those provided by \nafterschool programs, have proven to reduce the number of students \nlikely to use drugs by 50 percent and the number of students likely to \nbecome teen parents by 33 percent. Statistics like these prove that \nafter school programs are essential to ensuring the safety of our \nchildren in the critical hours after school.\n  We made great progress in the last 5 years. Through the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Center program, federal support for local \nafterschool programs increased from $1 million in fiscal year 1997 to \n$845 million in fiscal year 2001. As a result, over 900 communities \nacross the nation are now providing their children with a positive \nalternative to unsupervised care.\n  But a gap still exists. While eight out of ten voters in America \nindicate they strongly support afterschool programs and would welcome \nthem in their community, fewer than 4 out of 10 voters say that their \ncommunity provides afterschool programs.\n  My bill, the After Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001, would help \nclose this gap. It would provide $1 billion in grants for afterschool \nprograms and incrementally increase that funding over the next five \nyears to $1.5 billion in the year 2006. This funding would help provide \nafterschool programs for 1.5 million youth in the year 2002 with the \npotential to assist nearly 2.5 million in the year 2006.\n\n  While afterschool programs continue the learning process during after \nschool hours, we also must support initiatives that ensure our young \nchildren receive quality educational experiences in their early, \nformative years.\n  In 1989, the Nation's governors established a goal that all children \nwould have access to high quality prekindergarten programs by the year \n2000. It is now the year 2001, and this goal still has not been met.\n  Importantly, researchers have discovered that children have a \nlearning capacity that can and should be developed at a much earlier \nage than was previously thought. The National Research Council reported \nthat prekindergarten educational opportunities are necessary if \nchildren are going to develop the language and literacy skills needed \nto read.\n  Furthermore, studies have shown that children who participate in \nprekindergarten programs are less likely to be held back a grade, show \ngreater learning retention and initiative, have better social skills, \nare more enthusiastic about school, and more likely to have good \nattendance records. Yet, of the nearly 8 million 3- and 4-year-olds \nthat could be in early education, fewer than half are enrolled.\n  My bill, the Early Education Act of 2001, would create a \ndemonstration project in at least 10 States that want to provide one \nyear of prekindergarten early education in the public schools. There is \na 50 percent matching requirement, and the $300 million authorized \nunder this bill would be used by States to supplement--not supplant--\nother Federal, State or local funds.\n  Our children need a solid foundation that builds on our current \neducation system by providing them with early learning skills and the \nopportunity to further develop these skills during the afterschool \nhours. My bills will help create such a positive environment for our \nNation's youth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 158. A bill to improve schools; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \nthat I first introduced in 1999. This bill will establish much needed \naccountability for our education system so that the taxpayers' \ninvestment in education is adequately protected and our children \nreceive the best possible education. I am pleased to offer this \nbipartisan bill on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator Lugar. The \nprovisions of this bill are also included in S. 7, introduced yesterday \nby Senator Daschle and 18 other senators.\n  I think that we can all agree that greater accountability in our \npublic schools is an imperative. I am encouraged that President Bush \nand our new Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, have both expressed a \nstrong commitment to increased accountability and have implemented \nstrong school accountability standards in Texas. I understand \naccountability is a central piece of the administration's proposal \nbeing released today.\n  In 1994, we made some important changes to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. We created an accountability system for the \nprogram receiving most of the ESEA funds--the program, for \ndisadvantaged students called the Title I program. This accountability \nframework--along with the Goals 2000 program--have driven the \nstandards-based reform efforts across the nation. During the last 5 \nyears, however, experience in many States has demonstrated that we must \ndo more. At this point, only 11 states have fully approved assessment \nsystems in place as required under Title I.\n  The federal government has succeeded in targeting funds on those most \nin need better than any state or local government. And over the last \nthree decades we have had success--albeit only partial success--in \nclosing the achievement gap between economically disadvantaged students \nand their peers.\n  Our bill builds on the existing strengths of the accountability \nstructure in the current Title I programs and also establishes \naccountability for teacher quality and other federal education programs \nencompassed in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In \nparticular, our bill (1) establishes aggressive but achievable \nperformance objectives for all students linked to each state's own \nstandards and assessments; (2) directs resources to the students and \nobjectives most in need and (3) provides maximum flexibility for \neducators in devising strategies that meet our shared goals, but \nultimately having real consequences and sanctions for states, \ndistricts, and schools that do not meet agreed-upon performance \nobjectives for student achievement.\n  Through amendments to Title I and Title VI of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, our bill establishes aggressive but achievable \nperformance objectives for all students.\n  We require rigorous statewide accountability systems based on each \nstate's standards and assessments holding states, districts, and \nschools accountable for real achievement progress for all students, by \nrequiring states, districts and schools to set specific, numerical \ngoals for improvement which will ensure that all students will be \nproficient on state standards within 10 years. We also require public \nreporting of not just the results of the assessment but also the number \nof students excluded from assessments.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, this bill demands results for all \nstudents, by no longer tolerating existing achievement gaps between \nminority\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nand non-minority students, poor and non-poor students, and LEP and \nEnglish-speaking students. The achievement gap between low-income \nstudents and their more advantaged peers has narrowed significantly \nfrom 1970 until the mid-1980's. This was a central goal of the Title I \nprogram and its success in this regard is underrated.\n  But we have not done enough to accelerate those results. \nAccountability systems that depend upon average student achievement \ndata--data in the aggregate--will not close the achievement gaps that \nseparate low-income students from more affluent students or minority \nstudents from white students.\n  For example, in my home State of New Mexico, in 1994 4th grade \nreading data show that an average of 21 percent of the 4th graders in \nmy state were reading at the proficient level. This is distressing \nenough, but the disaggregated data tells an even more depressing story. \nIn New Mexico only 11 percent of the African American 4th graders and \njust 15 percent of the Latino 4th graders were reading at the \nproficient level. The 1996 4th grade NAEP data show that 13 percent of \nall students in New Mexico were proficient in math while only 3 percent \nof African American students and 6 percent of Latino students were \nproficient.\n  The fact that these students are in the minority means that their \nperformance data is swamped by data of the majority when an \naccountability system that depends on averages is used.\n  To remedy this--to close the gaps and to make good on the promises of \nTitle I--our bill would demand that states use disaggregated data and \ngoals to hold schools and school districts accountable for the use of \nTitle I funds.\n  Mr. President, recognizing that increased accountability and \nincreased results will not be easy to accomplish, our bill also directs \nadditional resources to the students and objectives most in need.\n  First, our bill would set aside a pot of funds (3 percent of Title I \nfunds--about $250 million at current funding levels--and 5 percent \nafter three years) for school improvement. 80 percent of these funds \nwould be sent to the local level to support efforts to turn around \nfailing schools. Schools can use these funds to implement research-\nbased comprehensive school reform programs.\n  An example of a comprehensive school reform model used widely in my \nState and throughout the nation with great results is Success for All. \nThis program is a proven early grade reading program, which if \nimplemented properly can ensure results. At the end of the first grade, \nSuccess for All schools have average reading scores almost three months \nahead of those in matching control schools, and by the end of the 5th \ngrade, students read more than one year ahead of control peers. The \nprogram can reduce the need for special education placements by more \nthan 50 percent and virtually eliminate retention. Our bill provides \nnew funding of $500 million per year to states and school districts to \nimplement comprehensive, research-based school reform programs, such as \nSuccess for All, that have proven effectiveness.\n  Second, the state may use the remaining State funds to provide \nassistance to districts and schools as they implement their \naccountability system and develop school improvement plans.\n  Finally, we also support an increased authorization level for Title \nI--$15 billion--and will continue to fight for substantial increases in \nthe appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, the bill does not provide additional resources without \nasking for something in return. The bill would ensure that if states, \ndistricts or schools fail to demonstrate returns on the federal \ninvestment through increased student performance, real consequences and \nsanctions will result.\n\n  On the school and district level, if grant recipients do not meet \nrequired performance standards, changes in the governance structure of \nthe school or district must be implemented; and students must be \nallowed to transfer to higher performing schools. The states and \ndistricts must provide the necessary resources for transportation with \nstate and local funds; state administrative funds will be withheld; and \nTitle VI funding (current block grant program) will be reduced and \nStates will be ineligible for the Ed-Flex program.\n  This bill also would establish aggressive but achievable performance \nobjectives to ensure that every class has a qualified teacher. Our bill \ndoes this by first, requiring states receiving federal funds to ensure \nthat all teachers are fully qualified by December 2005; second, \nrequiring states and districts receiving federal teacher quality funds \nto set specific numerical performance goals and targets for reducing \nthe number of unqualified and out-of-field teachers; and third, \nensuring that low income and minority students are not taught by \nunqualified teachers at higher rates than other students.\n  The bill would ensure that resources are directed to these objectives \nfirst, by ensuring that federal funds are not used to hire unqualified \nteachers and second, by ensuring that resources are provided for, and \nschool improvement plans incorporate, high-quality, research-based \nprofessional development for instructional staff.\n  Again, in exchange for increased resources, our bill would provide \nconsequences for failing to meet performance objectives. States failing \nto meet their performance objectives would lose State administrative \nfunding. Districts and schools failing to meet performance objectives \nwould be ineligible for continuing grants.\n  This bill also ensures that the other Federal Education Programs in \nthe ESEA incorporate performance-based accountability measures by: \nFirst, requiring that all plans submitted with grant applications \nincorporate performance-based objectives for increased student \nperformance or other relevant program objectives. Second, providing \nadditional funding through the Title VI block grant program in the ESEA \nto achieve performance-based objectives. Third, providing consequences \nfor failing to meet performance-based objectives, including \nineligibility for continuing grants in the case of competitive programs \nand in the case of formula programs, reductions in administrative funds \nand Title VI, and fourth, mandating that states failing to meet goals \nwould also be ineligible for flexible funding programs in current law \n(``Ed Flex'').\n  In addition, this bill recognizes the critical role played by parents \nin improving performance and ensuring accountability. The bill provides \nparents the right to know their child's teachers' qualifications; it \nrequires that parents be notified when their child's school is failing; \nit requires school improvement plans be published and parents be \nincluded in their development; and it requires school report cards to \ninform parents about the quality of their schools and their programs in \nmeeting student achievement goals.\n  Finally, our bill authorizes $200 million dollars for States to \nreward high performing schools and districts so that these schools and \ndistricts are recognized and encouraged to strive for high performance.\n  Mr. President, our bill would use an output-based rather than an \ninput-based system of accountability for the various programs \nauthorized by this bill. A shift that my colleagues on the both sides \nof the aisle have repeatedly endorsed.\n  Indeed, Both President Bush and Secretary Paige have expressed \nsupport for the measures incorporated in this bill and implemented many \nof them with some success in Texas. Both have endorsed closing the \nachievement gap at the school level with real consequences for \nfailure--the key component for accountability under Title I. They have \nindicated support for report cards, a rewards program for successful \nschools, and using performance-based accountability for all education \nprograms. At his confirmation hearing, Secretary Paige also endorsed \nproviding additional resources to struggling schools to help them turn \naround before corrective actions are taken. So I am very hopeful that \nthis will be a bill that receives strong bipartisan support and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on it.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, many schools that educate hard-to-serve \nstudents have shown success by setting high standards for staff and \nstudents and mobilizing educators and the community around a clear set \nof educational goals.\n  In fact, there are successful schools all over the country, in every \ntype of\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\ncommunity, that are living proof that all children have the ability to \nachieve beyond our wildest expectations, no matter what their economic \nor social background.\n  Success is not yet the rule in all of our schools. Our job, in this \nCongress, is to support parents and educators in every community as \nthey apply these lessons and leverage federal funds so that they create \nchange in areas where success continues to lag. We know what works. Now \nwe must dedicate the resources needed to apply what works and hold the \nsystem accountable for real results. Again. I want to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Lugar, for his cosponsorship of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to a \ncabinet level department, to redesignate the Environmental Protection \nAgency as the Department of Environmental Protection Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nDepartment of Environmental Protection Affairs Act of 2001. The bill \nredesignates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the \nDepartment of Environmental Protection Affairs and makes the Department \npart of the president's cabinet.\n  As most of my colleagues know, President Nixon established EPA in \n1970 as a response, in part, to water too polluted to drink and air too \ndirty to breathe. It had become clear by that time that air, waste and \nwater pollution problems did not respect state boundaries, and that \npublic health and environmental protections varied widely from state to \nstate.\n  In the 30 years since its founding, EPA has played a critical role in \nensuring that all Americans enjoy the same basic level of public health \nand environmental protection.\n  The Department of Environmental Protection Affairs Act of 2001 \nrecognizes that fact. The bill reflects that today most Americans view \nprotection of the public health and environment as duties of at least \nequal importance as our national programs for education, energy, \ndefense, commerce and agriculture.\n  The impact of this bill, however, goes beyond the very important \nsymbolic statement it makes.\n  First, elevating the EPA to the cabinet will ensure that the \npresident is directly involved in setting environmental policies. While \npast presidents have chosen to make the EPA Administrator part of \ncabinet-level discussions, this bill expresses Congress' will that \nenvironmental protection is given its place among the other national \nissues which occupy the president and his cabinet.\n  Second, this bill will ensure that the EPA Administrator is on equal \nfooting with her colleagues in the rest of the cabinet. This is \nimportant because some of the worst polluters in the nation are \ndepartments of the federal government. For example, Department of \nDefense and Department of Energy facilities are some of the most \npolluted toxic waste sites in the nation.\n  EPA must be on equal footing with those departments if it is to \nensure that the environment is restored and that the public health is \nprotected at those sites.\n  Third, this bill will strengthen EPA's role in negotiating \ninternational agreements with foreign nations. Protection of public \nhealth and the environment has increasingly become an important part of \nforeign relations. Most of the industrialized nations have afforded top \nstatus to their environmental officials. This bill will afford that \nstatus to our top environmental official.\n  I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to \nensure the passage of this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill be print in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 159\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Environmental \n     Protection Affairs Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) protection of public health and the environment is a \n     mission of at least equal importance to the duties carried \n     out by cabinet-level departments;\n       (2) the Federal Government should ensure that all Americans \n     enjoy the same basic level of public health and environmental \n     protection regardless of where they live;\n       (3) protection of public health and the environment \n     increasingly involves negotiations with foreign nations, \n     including the\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\n     most highly industrialized nations all of whose top \n     environmental officials have ministerial status; and\n       (4) a cabinet-level Department of Environmental Protection \n     Affairs should be established.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide assistance to States to expand and \nestablish drug abuse treatment programs to enable such programs to \nprovide services to individuals who voluntarily seek treatment for drug \nabuse; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Drug Abuse \nTreatment on Demand Assistance Act to help ensure that substance abuse \ntreatment is available to all substance abusers who seek it.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, each year \ndrug and alcohol related abuse kills more than 120,000 Americans. In \n1999, an estimated 14.8 million Americans were illicit drug users, with \nnearly 5 million of them addicted to drugs.\n  Drugs and alcohol abuse costs taxpayers nearly $276 billion annually \nin preventable health care costs, extra law enforcement, auto crashes, \ncrime and lost productivity.\n  In his final report before stepping down as America's Drug Czar, \nGeneral Barry McCaffrey outlined the prescription for solving America's \ndrug problem: ``prevention coupled with treatment accompanied by \nresearch.'' And drug treatment is now one of the goals of the National \nDrug Control Strategy.\n  To meet that goal, however, will require additional investment. \nThrough the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration \n(SAMHSA), the federal government currently provides over $2 billion to \nstates and local entities for drug treatment programs, and total \nfederal spending in this area is just over $3 billion. But, fewer than \nhalf of America's nearly 5 million substance abusers are receiving \ntreatment for their addiction.\n  While some substance abusers are not seeking treatment, many are--and \nare being turned away. In California, for example, 60 percent of all \nfacilities that maintain a waiting list have an average of 23 people on \ntheir list on any given day. Nationwide, an estimated 2.7 million \nsubstance abusers are in need of treatment.\n  Current treatment on demand programs focus on the specific drug abuse \nneeds of the local community. For instance, in San Francisco, \nmethamphetamine abuse is especially problematic and continues to be on \nthe rise. In other cities, cocaine abuse or marijuana is the drug of \nchoice. Treatment programs should be targeted to address these local \nepidemics, but there is a funding shortfall.\n  The Drug Abuse Treatment on Demand Assistance Act would more than \ndouble SAMHSA's funding for drug treatment over five years--to $6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2006. This is an increase of $600 million each \nyear for five years. The additional funding is provided through \nSAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and it provides SAMHSA \nwith flexibility to target funds where they are needed most.\n  The Drug Abuse Treatment on Demand Assistance Act would also reward \nstates that have instituted a policy of providing substance abuse \ntreatment to non-violent drug offenders as an alternative to prison, as \nCalifornia recently did with the enactment of Proposition 36. The bill \nauthorizes $125 million per year for five years to provide matching \ngrants to states. These funds could be used to help pay for treatment \nas well as to provide other elements of a comprehensive anti-drug abuse \nprogram for non-violent offenders, including drug testing and probation \nservices.\n  Mr. President, recent studies indicate that every additional dollar \ninvested in substance abuse treatment saves taxpayers $7.46 in societal \ncosts. Clearly, such an investment is very worthwhile, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support treatment on demand.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S498-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S498]]\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 21\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cleland, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 21, a bill to establish an off-budget lockbox to strengthen Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hagel, the name of the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nRoberts) was added as a cosponsor of S. 22, a bill to amend the Federal \nElection Campaign Act of 1971 to provide meaningful campaign finance \nreform through requiring better reporting, decreasing the role of soft \nmoney, and increasing individual contribution limits, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 27\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the names of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Cleland) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 27, a bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \nof 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n\n                                 S. 29\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the names of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli), the Senator \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), the \nSenator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Boxer), and the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 29, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to allow a deduction for 100 percent of the health insurance costs \nof self-employed individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 30\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 30, a bill to strengthen \ncontrol by consumers over the use and disclosure of their personal \nfinancial and health information by financial institutions, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 35\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the names of the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. Kyl) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 35, a bill to provide relief to America's working \nfamilies and to promote continued economic growth by returning a \nportion of the tax surplus to those who created it.\n\n\n                                 S. 104\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the names of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Chafee), the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and the \nSenator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) were added as cosponsors of S. \n104, a bill to require equitable coverage of prescription contraceptive \ndrugs and devices, and contraceptive services under health plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 127\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 127, a bill to give \nAmerican companies, American workers, and American ports the \nopportunity to compete in the United States cruise market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S498-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S498-S499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 14--COMMENDING THE GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY EAGLES \n    FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2000 NCAA DIVISION I-AA FOOTBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. CLELAND (for himself, and Mr. Miller) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Georgia \nSouthern University football team for their second consecutive and \nsixth overall NCAA's Division I-AA football national championship. In \naddition to the record number of National Championships, Georgia \nSouthern has captured four consecutive Southern Conference titles. \nNever in the history of Division I-AA has there been such a successful \nfootball program and I see no end to their success in the future. Among \nthe many players and coaches who were honored this year was Coach Paul \nJohnson who was recognized as the American Football Coaches \nAssociation's 2000 Regional Coach of the Year. Another notable \nperformance was that of junior running back Adrian Peterson who \ncompleted his 43rd consecutive game rushing for more than 100 yards--\nincluding 152 yards against the much larger school, the University of \nGeorgia and 148 yards against Montana in the National Championship \ngame. Much credit is due to all the players--offense, defense and \nspecial teams--who made this wonderful season possible.\n  While the Eagles had just two losses this season--one to rival Furman \nand the other to the Division I-A opponent the University of Georgia--\nthey had an impressive list of victories this season, including: a 57-\n12 victory over Johnson C. Smith; a 24-17 victory over Wofford; a 31-10 \nvictor over Chattanooga; a 56-3 victory over VMI; a 42-24 victory over \nWestern Carolina; a 34-28 victory over Appalachian State; a 27-10 \nvictory over the Citadel; a 42-7 victory over East Tennessee State; and \na 32-9 victory over Elon. Additionally, in the post season, Georgia \nSouthern defeated: McNeese State 42-17; Hofstra 48-20; Delaware 27-18; \nand finally, Montana 27-25 for the National Championship.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I would like to recognize all the 2000 \nGeorgia Southern football team for their dedication to the team and \ntheir commitment to the hard work it takes to win a national \nchampionship: Derek Adams, T.J.

Mr. President, I oppose the conference report of \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill, which has \nbecome the vehicle for the final budget agreement for fiscal year 2001, \nand I regret the need to do so for there are many laudable provisions \nincluded in this package. I was particularly pleased with the boost in \nfunding for Pell grants, an absolutely critical program that ensures \nlower income students have the opportunity to go to college. Welcome, \ntoo, was the additional support for class size reduction and special \neducation funding. This latter program, though, is still far short of \nwhere it ought to be. While this spending package brings funding for \nthe Federal share of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to \n15 percent, the highest it has ever been, it is still far short of the \n40 percent which represents the maximum Federal contribution under \nIDEA. I was proud to join with my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, \nin offering an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year \nwhich would have provided that full funding for IDEA, and though we \nwere not successful, I very much hope my colleagues will make full \nfunding of this program a high priority.\n  I was also pleased that this measure includes needed increases in \nsupport for Social Services Block Grants, a vitally important program \nthat helps counties and social service providers serve our most \nvulnerable citizens and that had been drastically cut in earlier \nversions of the Labor, Health and Human Services spending bill. As \nwell, I was glad that additional funding was provided to the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control, and that \nadditional resources were included to relieve funding pressures on \nthose who provide Medicare services. In this last area, I was \nespecially pleased that the legislation will provide relief for \nMedicare services delivered in rural areas and that it will delay for \none year the scheduled 15 percent cut to home health care agencies.\n  Unfortunately, this massive spending bill also includes a number of \nhighly questionable provisions. I am deeply concerned that the Medicare \npackage is disproportionately skewed toward HMOs, providers that do not \nserve the vast majority of Wisconsinites. The underlying reimbursement \nformula for Medicare HMOs is grossly unfair, punishing those areas, \nlike Wisconsin, with efficient, low-cost health care providers. \nSignificant reform is needed for the Medicare HMO reimbursement \nformula, and until that reform is undertaken, we should not pour \nbillions and billions more into a Medicare HMO system that is so \nfundamentally unfair. Instead, those funds should have been targeted \ntoward provisions to ensure adequate access to home health care and \nfunding a significant prescription\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\ndrug benefit. In this regard, I am particularly disappointed that \nCongress only delayed, and did not eliminate, the 15 percent reduction \nin payments to home health care agencies and only ordered a study of \nthe inclusion of medical supplies in new payment system.\n  More broadly, this measure contains the same defects that previous \nlarge end-of-session omnibus spending bills have contained; namely, \nspecial interest provisions that are slipped into the must-pass bill to \navoid the usual committee scrutiny and full review on the floors of the \nHouse and Senate. My good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, has identified at least $1.9 billion in pork \nbarrel spending in this year's version of the omnibus spending bill. He \nnotes that in the conference report for the Commerce, State, and \nJustice appropriations bill, itself an add-on to the Labor, Health, and \nSocial Services appropriations bill, are many earmarked spending \nprovisions that have never undergone appropriate review, including: \n$200,000 for the Kotzebue Sound test fishery for king crab and sea \nsnail; $3 million for Red Snapper research; $300,000 for research on \nthe Charleston bump; $150,000 for lobster sampling; $1 million for \nHawaiian coral reef monitoring; and $1 million for the implementation \nof the National Height Modernization system in North Carolina.\n  I am willing to concede that some of these programs may have merit. \nBut if they do have merit, those who advocate funding for them ought to \nmake their case before the appropriate authorizing committees and \nsubmit their case to the floor of the House and Senate in the normal \nway. That they chose instead to slip these matters secretly into a \nmassive, must-pass spending bill at least suggests that some of these \nprograms would not have withstood thorough scrutiny.\n  Mr. President, these special interest provisions continue to be one \nof the best arguments for reforming an appropriations and budget \nprocess that has led to an annual, end of the fiscal year budget wreck. \nUnwarranted and wasteful special interest provisions flourish in such \nan environment, and fundamental reform, including moving to a biennial \nbudget process, is the only solution. I very much hope such reform will \nbe the very highest priority of this body during the 107th Congress and \nthat this year's pork-laden omnibus appropriations bill will be the \nlast of its kind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/23/senate-section/article/S500-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S500-S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PIPELINE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  The text of S. 141, introduced by Mr. McCain on January 22, 2001, is \nas follows:\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
